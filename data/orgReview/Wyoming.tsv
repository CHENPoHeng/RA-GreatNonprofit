Donor	5	09/15/2016	My husband and I have contributed to the Caring Center for several years, personally and through our church during the Baby Bottle Boomerang fund raiser.  There is only one reasonwe do this and that is to save the lives of unborn children who have no voice. Terry Winslep and each of her devoted staff members  go beyond the norm in time, talent and love to care for mothers and their unborn child.  Its remarkable the devotion these ladies show in all they do.

The Caring Center Inc	282612		/users/profile/372770	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/17/2016	I have been involved at various levels with TrueCare for around five years. Currently, my wife and have the privilege of partnering and volunteering with them through our local church. True Care maintains a high level of focus and clarity  in achieving their mission. They have exemplified excellence administratively, organizationally, and, most importantly, relationally. Our community is better because of the work that True Care does through empowering women who have found themselves in an unplanned pregnancy to make the best choice and turn fear into confidence. I even know first hand, my sister was their client and if it had not been for them, I am not sure where she would have landed. Thank you TrueCare!

The Caring Center Inc	264181		/users/profile/352892	SaraL	Volunteer	5	10/14/2015	Volunteering at Care Net Inc (True Care) has been an eye-opening experience, seeing into a world of crisis that can turn to calm by the end of the appointment as knowledge is shared about the choices and resources available.  Being able to help a young lady or woman understand what her choices and resources are so that she can make an informed decision is empowering.  Walking along side someone who is in crisis reminds me to be present, honest, kind, and non-judgemental when a person is sharing their story and their emotions.
The Caring Center Inc	264129		/users/profile/352840	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2015	From pregnancy confirmation, including 3D ultrasounds, all the way through the pregnancy and birth of each baby, True Care provides loving support for women, especially those in crisis situations.

I received help and healing from their Abortion Recovery class and I had not even known that I needed help. It was amazing to me to discover how many people had been praying while I took the class.

The Caring Center Inc	249347		/users/profile/337176	kstorrud4	Volunteer	5	07/22/2015	The Caring Center lives up to its name. Not only are the unborn cared about, but the mothers' overall health is truly a concern. The mothers are supported, provided with options, given resources to succeed in life, educated on care for themselves and their babies, given tools to help them in relationships, and given spiritual guidance. All are welcomed and no one is abandoned.

The Caring Center Inc	131298	1	/users/profile/176854	Sue Struck	Board Member	5	10/30/2012	I have long been impressed by True Care (previously known as The Caring Center).  The staff and volunteers are all highly skilled and trained to serve their clients with compassion.  Their kindness and nonjudgmental care  of their clients is so heartwarming.  I have recommended this agency for years to those facing an unexpected pregnancy.  They go above and beyond what is expected in order to help eliminate the perceived need for abortion as a solution to a crisis situation.  They also offer Christian love and assistance to those who are suffering from their previous decision to abort, gently guiding them and allowing them to see past their pain to realize God's forgiveness is available to them.  I am so grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the work done by True Care of Casper, Wyoming.
The Caring Center Inc	199957		/users/profile/261016	gatekeepers27	Donor	5	05/08/2014	I was originally introduced to TrueCare (The Caring Center, Inc) as a volunteer. Then, I became a member of the board for three years.  I have been a donor all this time and are now part of the endowment program. I believe in saving as many babies from abortion as possible.  I have covered them in prayer for these many years since I first met the wonderful people who are saying true to their mission.  
The Caring Center Inc	199206		/users/profile/260104	kathy.c	Donor	4	04/29/2014	I am the receptionest at True Care and have been serving here for about 8 years. I also advocate as needed. There is never a day that goes by that does not bring me surprises and pleasure. I get to see our patients as soon as they come through the doors and so I make that first impact on them. I love working with the variety of people that we see. It is our patients that make my day! I am thankful to be a part of our great team that work so well together serving the needs of the patients. When I advocte I get to have a even closer contact with whoever may be the patient for the day. I have laughed with them, cried with them and loved them. It is love that matters as so many are at a crisis point in their life.Without God as my help and guide I know that the service that they recieve would amount to nothing. I feel truly blessed as I work for True Care. It makes my heart happy to see women change their minds, smile again and be able to walk out our doors ready to meet whatever challage is before them. At True Care it is not a job to me but a ministry where I can help others in need. They have also helped me in many ways by their kindness and love. Many of our ladies and young gals return to us because they know that their needs will be met. They also know that we care for each of them as a individual. A day a True Care is never just a day . It is a reminder of how good the world can be when we choose to help others.
The Caring Center Inc	198971		/users/profile/259800	Michael239	Board Member	5	04/25/2014	Writing a review for True Care is really about writing a review for the people that make up True Care. From the people in the Churches supporting the mission, to the people in the rooms with each mother they all really deserve 5 stars. We are blessed by these people and by having True Care in our Community!

They not only pointed me to a group where im getting exactly the help I needed.

The Caring Center Inc	198524		/users/profile/259253	Karenef	Volunteer	5	04/21/2014	I have always been an advocate of the unborn, but the Vision Tour I attended really opened my eyes to the wonderful, dedicated ministry that this organization is to our community.  Not only do they educate the mother about the life she is carrying within, but they also walk with her during her pregnancy and offer resources and support during a time in her life that can be very scary and stressful.   The staff and vounteers are compassionate and dedicated to their mission, and are truly doing God's work on earth.
The Caring Center Inc	198464		/users/profile/259188	Kim_136	Volunteer	4	04/21/2014	I have participated in a Walk for Life and a Vision Tour.  Both are professionally done and a lot of fun.  The work True Care does in our community is so important.  Knowing about the choices of adoption and keeping a baby can change lives of young women for ever.
The Caring Center Inc	198433		/users/profile/259154	Cheryl86	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2014	When I saw, in my church bulletin, that True Care was looking for a nurse with ministry experience, I knew I had found the perfect fit for me. I accepted Christ as my Savior at age 16. I have been very involved with my church since moving to Casper in 1998. I became a nurse in 1998. I started working at True Care in January 2013 and it has changed my life. I am able to meet with young women early on in their pregnancy and provide them with all the resources they need to hopefully feel confident and prepared to become a new mom. I am able to share with woman, who are considering abortion, my story of abortion and how that decision affected me greatly. I work with the most Godly women I know in Casper. We pray every single day before work and I can tell you God is working great miracles in Casper and beyond through True Care. I absolutely love my job and I love helping woman. Please consider supporting this wonderful non profit, and may God bless you richly!
The Caring Center Inc	198198		/users/profile/204565	Dama	Board Member	5	04/17/2014	As a long-time financial supporter and new Board Member, I have always been impressed with the sincerity of the staff and volunteers to truly carry out the mission of reducing the perceived need for abortion by supporting and encouraging the women who come to True Care. God's love for all His children is demonstrated to hurting, confused, scared women, and their families from the moment they first call for an appointment through their last encounter. As a Board Member, I appreciate the values of transparency and being good stewards of the financial support provided for the ministry, but also the care and support that is shown for all the staff, volunteers and patients. It truly is humbling to be asked to serve God through this ministry.
The Caring Center Inc	153749	2	/users/profile/204565	Dama	Donor	5	04/09/2013	I have volunteered and served on as a board member for other Crisis Pregnancy Centers, which has given me the opporutnity to more fully appreciate the quality of the Caring Center ministry.

The Caring Center Inc	198098		/users/profile/39357	bduffey07	Donor	5	04/16/2014	I believe with all the prayer preparation that starts the day at True Care (the Caring Center) that the Lord has blessed them in a multitude of ways.  Thus they are prepared to hear from God with every unique situation that arises.  Not only does a mother feel personal care, she also learns a variety of aspects in mothering, giving her the confidence that support is there for her during and after her pregnancy.
The Caring Center Inc	38477	1	/users/profile/39357	bduffey07	Donor	5	05/10/2010	After hearing about a 24 hour 7 day a week prayer chain in Washington DC, I felt an urgency to be involved with fighting abortion in our country. I have made it a practice for years to fast and pray weekly against abortion, and everything it incorporates. I believe the testimonies from our local Care Net clinic has a life transforming impact on the community. It has been an honor for me to sponsor tours and help others see that our center provides free STD testing, ultrasounds,Godly council and much more. Their fundraiser breakfast definately reaches out to the donor with inspiration and need. We are fortunate to have a local clinic helping reduce abortion one life at a time!
The Caring Center Inc	198074		/users/profile/258761	readephesians2	Donor	5	04/16/2014	The Caring Center is excellent at meeting the needs of women not only in our community, but from surrounding communities.  Their trained volunteers and staff are caring and compassionate.  The services provided include and are not limited to pregnancy testing and ultrasound , one on one meetings with a trained advocate concerning pregnancy and child  care and also group classes for abortion recovery.  What a tremendous asset this is to our community!!!  It is crucial for the clients and those facing crisis pregnancy to know their options and to receive much needed care and support.  I am so thankful that we have the Caring Center.

While volunteering and working currently, I love and enjoy working alongside such an amazing team of women to serve the needs of the women, men, and unborn of our community while facing a time of unplanned pregnancy. I love being able to come along side and give them a place of support through services of True Care.

The Caring Center Inc	190036		/users/profile/248110	RitaDean	Volunteer	5	12/06/2013	I have been very blessed to be able to volunteer as the Receptionist on Friday mornings.  I have met wonderful people who really care about what they are doing --- helping women who have unplanned pregnancies realize that there is a lot of help out there from the people at True Care in Casper, Wyoming.  I have also been very blessed by meeting some of these pregnant women who are genuinly good women who just need some love and guidance in helping them with their situation.

The Caring Center Inc	186220		/users/profile/243214	suekp	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	Since my children have all left home, I have been looking for a meaningful place to volunteer during the summer months when I am not teaching school. It needed to be a place where I felt that I was making a difference in the lives of others.  The Caring Center Inc. provides just such an opportunity.  I completed the training and was able to spend a few days advocating for women who found themselves pregnant.  During my time there this summer, I was impressed by the team of nurses, volunteers, and other staff members at The Caring Center.  They truly have a heart for the women who come through their doors!  They demonstrate a passion for determining the best for each of their clients.  I was also excited to learn that The Caring Center offers a Baby and Me program for women who decide to carry their baby to term.  This is a tremendous investment in our community, as it helps women become better equipped to raise their child. The long-term effects of this program are endless.  Thanks, Caring Center, for your investment in the lives of these women and their children!
The Caring Center Inc	184959		/users/profile/241895	laurammeyer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I have been volunteering at True Care for just over 2 months.  I saw a notice in my church bulletin about them needing more volunteers so I prayed about it. God opened the doors and my time to be able to be a part of a fantastic team! From the first meeting I had to every day I walk in to help, I find myself walking into a center that LOVES!! The staff is so friendly and have a passion for the women they long to help.

The Caring Center Inc	181458		/users/profile/238186	jessicalfadel	Client Served	5	10/23/2013	Soon after my husband and I moved to Casper, I found out I was pregnant. So many people recommended that I go to True Care to confirm the pregnancy and to get some great resources. Going to True Care was a wonderful experience.  The environment is warm and inviting and they make you feel at ease. The staff showed that they cared about my health and well being and for me as a person. The nurse and advocate were thorough with the information that they gave and helped me find some midwives that were close to town. After my appointments, the nurse followed up with me to see how I was doing, which was greatly appreciated!

As a medical professional I was impressed by the level of medical services they provide and the technology they employ. I have worked with two of the nurses who care for patients at The Caring Center and know that in addition to being well qualified and competent nurses they are also both very kind and compassionate.

The Caring Center Inc	73719		/users/profile/80558	volunteer	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	It had caught my attention over the years as I visited with friends who were staff members or who were volunteers at The Caring Center the important role that The Caring Center has in our community.  As a Christ-centered pregnancy and resource center, The Caring Center helps people to know and to understand the truth often at times in their lives that they are overwhelmed and do not know what to do or where to turn.  As the Lord has drawn me to be a volunteer, the core issue that grabbed my attention is that the absolute truth is shared with each and every client . . . not opinions but truths.  When I made an appointment to be interviewed for a volunteer position, I wanted to help in any way that I could.  I was asked to make follow-up phone calls to clients, and it has been the most fulfilling and worthwhile volunteer work that I have ever done.  To undergird and to help The Caring Center to stay in touch with clients and for clients to know without a doubt that there are caring, committed staff members there for them is awesome!  It is all about relationships and staying connected with the very ones who come for help.  I am so thankful that the Lord led me to volunteer and that my time and effort at The Caring Center continue to confirm what the Lord nudged and prompted me to do . . . I love fulfilling God's will by being a part of an organization that could not have more integrity, more passion, and more genuine concern for those in need.  To volunteer in the midst of people who strive to support those in our community who are dealing with decisions that affect the lives of unborn children feeds my soul and encourages me to do all that I can to be of help.  I am so thankful for The Caring Center and so blessed to have the privilege to be a small part of the incredible work that is being done through this organization to touch and to affect the lives of people for eternity!  Our community is so fortunate and so blessed to have The Caring Center!!!
The Caring Center Inc	153740	2	/users/profile/204557	joys	Donor	5	04/09/2013	We were introduced to True Care by our Pastor who organized a Baby Bottle Boomerang for the congregation about 3 years ago.  It was a simple and easy way to collect funds to support their work.  Then we were invited to attend a Vision Tour where we saw the work that goes on daily at True Care.  We were very impressed with the loving care shown to the women who were considering abortion and how so many decided to keep their babies after viewing an ultrasound.  We are very happy to support True Care financially because they understand that it is a baby--not a choice!  Women need to know that abortion is killing a real live baby not just a collection of cells and that abortion is not birth control as is being practiced more and more in the US.  We thank God for True Care and Terry and her staff and volunteers and we will continue our financial support to save God's little ones!

I was impressed with the amount of information, statistics and facts the facility has in defense of life, showing the many devastations of abortion.  Way to go, True Care!  You are definitely a gift of hope and help in our community!  Thank you for loving and protecting the most fragile form of life.  Thank you for being an advocate to the women who are growing and nurturing that fragile life within them.  Everyone's love and efforts are deeply appreciated!
The Caring Center Inc	133473	1	/users/profile/179198	Ashley28	Board Member	5	11/04/2012	I have been a board member at True Care for 2 years. It has been both an honor and a privilege to witness the power of this ministry. First and most importantly, to save the lives of many hundreds of unborn babies, and secondly to help transform the lives of many parents who chose to protect life and be informed to change their minds and hearts to go from truly considering abortion to carry their baby to term and ultimately giving life. The entire organization under Terry Winship's leadership is like a well oiled machine. More importantly, Terry's passion and dedication  for True Care and its donors who provide for this ministry's existence. Her passion for the staff and volunteers who graciously and prayerfully serve the clients shines through in every decision and action she takes, not only saving lives but transforms our community and state. I can't put into words how being involved as a board member has truly touched my life. Keep up the good work Terry, Lilly, donors, staff, advocates, volunteers, and board members.Sincerely,Ashley FullerBoard MemberTrue Care of Casper, WY
The Caring Center Inc	133427	1	/users/profile/179144	Magdalene	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	I have volunteered at True Care for a little over 3 1/2 years as a patient advocate.  The time I give to this ministry continues to enrich my life and cement my values about life, the human person, and the need for Jesus Christ in this chaotic world.  True Care allows me to enter the life stories of women in crisis and to use my skills to bring a sense of peace to their situation.  Many of them have been told that sexual freedom is their right but they aren't told how to deal with the wreckage that remains when they allow others to use their precious bodies as a playground.   The most important thing that we do is to listen to them in their broken-ness and offer them a chance to begin again.  No one is judged at True Care.  We offer them an opportunity to experience real forgiveness through a relationship with Jesus Christ and then walk with them through the challenges ahead.  The daunting mountain they face can become a manageable journey through the support offered by True Care.  It is such a privilege to serve. 
The Caring Center Inc	133390	1	/users/profile/179101	Jadvocate	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	Being a volunteer as an advocate, I have witnessed many clients listen intently to every word that is spoken to them. From these words huge decisions are made. Often these same clients become involved in the Baby and Me program. The learning cycle for most of these at-risk mothers-to-be is huge, but they are always so grateful to all of us. The high quality of the staff is evident - always loving, caring, and compassionate to each and every client, regardless of any decision made. Everyone involved at True Care demonstates through their lives and actions true Christian values.

The board is active and purposeful in overseeing the mission of the clinic and its future. I believe Care Net is a living, growing, answer for anyone in crisis pregnancy and clients feel the love and acceptance when they encounter the staff. Addressing needs before and after pregnancy, and encouraging women to protect, respect and cherish their sexuality are all addressed by staff.  It is an excellent service.

No judging, just a professional and caring offer to help walk a woman through one of the biggest decisions she will ever have to make...what to do about her unplanned pregnancy.

National Outdoor Leadership School	144686	1	/users/profile/186662	Jeff_R	Client Served	5	11/29/2012	NOLS is the best outdoor educator in the country.  NOLS teaches leadership, teamwork, wilderness skills, and stewardship to the land and each otherin everything they do.  I completed the month long Wind River Mountaineering course in 200 and climbed Denali with NOLS in 2006.  Even today, I realize new ways in which these courses changed me forever.  The NOLS structure teaches you lessons that you will remember for a lifetime.  For example, leadership.  You talk about leadership and then the next day you actually lead the group for a day of hiking and practice your leadership skills.  You make mistakes and learn from them in a supportive community.  ... NOLS is also a community of amazing people.  While many have done unique things, my amazement with NOLS faculty, staff, and alumni are that they are passionate about what they do, care deeply about other people, and exhibit leadership in everything they do.  I would recommend NOLS to anyone that not only whats to have a fantastic wilderness experience, but also build the leadership skills to face all of life's challenges.
National Outdoor Leadership School	141612	1	/users/profile/187980	Sydney H.	Client Served	5	11/20/2012	I completed a Wind River Mountaineering course and a Wilderness EMT course through NOLS and WMI. NOLS generates active and concerned citizens who are not onlyproficient in wild places, but who care for the environment, leave asmall footprint, and know how to effectively collaborate with others.I believe NOLS graduates go out into the world and show others howto live similarly. I see this very clearly among fellow graduates and lifelong friends from NOLS and WMI, who all embody good leadership, passion, and self-responsibility amongtheir peers. On day three of our mountaineering course, the first day we traveled off-trail, amassive snowstorm hit. We quickly learned about post-holing,route finding in zero visibility, and what to do if you cant findthe x. I am so grateful that one of the worst weather days cameearly in the course. There were so many challenges at one time, itdid me absolutely no good to complain or cry. I could only focus onlearning how to light my MSR stove and properly set up the tent. Ilearned to cope by controlling what I could about the situation andaccepting what I couldnt. It does not serve any purpose to point outthe hailstones pummeling you in the face, because everyone else hasclearly noticed them as well.  My instructors set great examples to keep a positive attitude, andoptimism remains my main strategy towards overcoming challengesin the front-country. Cold conditions were fun because they meant weconstantly did the Tazmanian Toe Tap or held Push-Up Contests tokeep warm. After four weeks I came to viewadversity as a natural part of the process. I looked forward to arduousmoving daysnow, I think short on-trail hikes are even a bit boring!Today, when I facestressful times, I recognize that dwelling on the problems preventsme from solving them. Life will always throw us challenges, but NOLStaught me how to enjoy the opportunity to grow and learn.

Such was my NOLS course in 1970. Though I could not have dreamed it  those many years ago, an even more important life changing experience for me would be my daughter's similar experience in 2006. And so it continues. My last NOLS course: about 90 days ago- August 2012.  In 1970 I thought NOLS was an expedition for a month- or a summer. I now know it is an expedition of a lifetime.

The leadership lessons I learned I still use; the devotion to environmental issues is still strong with me, and I can still read a map. :)   I encourage everyone I know to send their kids or grandkids to NOLS.

As a leader my NOLS experience taught me how to deal with adversity, uncertainty, and managing people with different attitudes and abilities.

Through hard work, learning, and real experience, NOLS Students improve themselves, and go on to improve their world. I went into this program a confused teenager: unfocused, disorganized, and unmotivated. I emerged a confident, competent, and capable leader in any setting i find myself in. Not only was my experience at NOLS outstanding, but experiences I have had following NOLS continue to amaze me. Taking into account that NOLS creates exemplary individuals, it should come to me at no surprise that i find myself frequently meeting other NOLS graduates and have come to understand that I am now part of a very beneficial NOLS Graduate Community. So reviewing NOLS... It seems pointless to me because only someone who has been through NOLS can know what it really means to have done so, and those people already know.

While my experience only lasted three short months, I think about the relationships I built and the memories we all shared every day. The experiences I had through this program are unlike anything else, but somehow I find myself applying the things I learned in my daily life. NOLS taught me how to be a leader. It taught me how to make the most out of life and how to live in the present. I have been changed through this program and I could not be more grateful.
National Outdoor Leadership School	139566		/users/profile/185686	macsmith	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	NOLS changed the direction of my life. It taught me how to be independent, how to speak up and how to ultimately be a leader in my life and at work. I went on my first student course when I was 22 and I went on my next course by getting a scholarship. I was the only female on a 30 day mountaineering course, it was during this time I learned how to face fear and still meet your goals. I learned how to speak up when I felt timid and shy, but I knew it was important to speak. I learn to trust my gut and make decisions that would create good outcomes. I then went on to teach for NOLS. I eventually went back to school to become a nurse, I now work in one of the best trauma hospitals on the west coast. I use all the skills that NOLS taught me to save the lives of my patients everyday. NOLS is a fantastic nonprofit which shapes the leaders of tomorrow.

It has been a great character and leadership development tool not only for the many students I have worked with, but also for me.  The staff is full of idealistic and fully engaged people who live what they believe. I'm a better person for having become involved with NOLS and the people I know there.  Bob
National Outdoor Leadership School	139433		/users/profile/185550	Eric26	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	Of my 8 semesters during my undergraduate college career, the semester I spent at NOLS was far and away the most valuable.  NOLS builds leaders.  The course work helps students deepen an understanding of themselves and their capabilities.  It gives them a depth of character to rely upon for the rest of their lives.  Strangely, this is not accomplished through direct focus on esoteric ideas of leadership.  Rather, the school challenges students with a curriculum focused on wilderness safety training and camping and traveling in the outdoors with minimal impact on the environment.  The combination of those two concepts and working through them with a new small group of strangers creates an amazing environment.  It allows people to learn, change and grow, and broadly become better people, able to interact with more different people in more challenging situations than most had originally conceived.
National Outdoor Leadership School	139166	1	/users/profile/185270	Michael Gewirz	Donor	5	11/14/2012	The summer after graduating from college I took a 30 day NOLS course in the Wilderness of Wyoming.It was a game changer for me personally and I came away, not only with a new set of practical outdoor and expeditionary skills, but an environmental ethic that has informed my professional and personal life ever since.  This organization influences the lives of many people every year and has a similar impact on them. It is unusual to find a non-profit that has had such consistent outcomes in terms of positively influencing people.   
National Outdoor Leadership School	138642		/users/profile/184719	Anne12934	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/14/2012	The quality of NOLS staff, nature places, expedition training, and leadership were outstanding on the two courses I completed in 1991 and 2006. I am a natural resource professional and a nature educator, and I gained both professionally and personally on each course.  I believe in NOLS so much that I contribute to their scholarship fund each year. Anne, San Diego

The wallpaper on my computerscreen is one of the photos i took during the course and so are the posters in my bedroom. But wat still reminds me of this course every single day, other than the pictures, is the way it inspired me to think about life, nature and the wellbeing of the ones you care about most. Furthermore, the instructors knew exactly what they were doing which made me feel safe in the outdoors. I still have contact with my fellow NOLS students and I am now saving to go on another trip next summer. Taking part in a NOLS activity is indeed a life changing experience. 
National Outdoor Leadership School	138281		/users/profile/184335	alstonsh	General Member of the Public	5	11/13/2012	I attended NOLS in 1997, participating in their Fall Semester in the Rockies.  That semester helped shape me into the person I am today.  Due to NOLS, I am confidant in my leadership abilities, constantly aware of my surroundings, and able to keep an open mind.  These assets are invaluable.  The staff is top notch.   As far as non-profits, NOLS is at the top of my list.  I am grateful to have had the opportunity to attend NOLS and will be a life long supporter.  Grade A organization, in my book.

I gained maturity, leadership skills and confidence that will serve me well for the rest of my life. I can honestly say that not a day goes by where I don't use the skills gained from my NOLS course. I would recommend NOLS without hesitation to anyone who is looking for a truly challenging and life-changing experience.

It has provided me with technical skills that I can use back at home, but more than that it has presented me with a new way to look at the way I live, and the way others live. My NOLS semester gives me a beautiful, hopeful picture of the future. I found the importance of simplicity and minimalism, and compassion and respect. It is my greatest wish that everyone could be fortunate enough to experience what I experienced with NOLS.

I give both my time and my money to this organization because I believe it makes the world a better place, and enriches the lives of those who are fortunate enough to go on a NOLS trip.
National Outdoor Leadership School	137997		/users/profile/184036	Fred Kleisner	Donor	5	11/13/2012	I have known NOLS sine 1989 when our eldest daughter attended "Spring Semester in the Rocky Mountains" - during her senior year in High School. While we were familiar with NOLS approach to the teaching of wilderness skills and ethics, we marveled at the affect this experience had on our daughter.  I have often said, 'We brought a little girl to the airport in NY on the way to Lander WY, and 82 days later, a young woman greeted us on her return!". Our three other children have all done NOLS courses with identical results. I have taken 25 years and older courses as well as several alumni courses. I have found that NOLS unique approach to group dynamics through their focus on "Expedition Behavior" in not only successful in the wilderness, it works equally well at the family dinner table and the Board Room table. Pre-NOLS, I viewed the term, "Wilderness" and meaning government Land, now, it evokes the feeling of "My Land, My home to visit where ever I choose, as long as I leave it the way I find it!. I am happy and proud to commend to your readers this terrific non-profit, which also has an acute focus on fiscal responsibility and credibility. Sincerely, Fred J Kleisner
National Outdoor Leadership School	137992		/users/profile/184031	rbethge	Advisor	5	11/13/2012	For more than 15 years, I have carried the leadership and technical skills training that I gained during my NOLS semester course into my personal life and professional career.  Since then, I have gone on to take many more courses with the school, each time adding to my back country skills and improving my expedition behavior. And most importantly, each NOLS experience introduces students to a team of world -class outdoor educators. 
National Outdoor Leadership School	137969		/users/profile/184008	wcpringle	Donor	5	11/13/2012	NOLS was the most significant semester of school I ever attended.

National Outdoor Leadership School	137965		/users/profile/184004	jasbar	Advisor	5	11/13/2012	Many years ago, I first heard of NOLS through a fellow Boy Scout leader, and filed the thought for a time when my daughters were older. A decade later my 15 year old daughter was having some problems at school that seemed to arise from low self confidence. I recalled my friend's comment about NOLS and after some encouragement and investigation my daughter decided to take a NOLS 30 day adventure course in Wyoming. The results were nothing less than amazing. My daughter departed as a self-centered child and returned as a self-confident young woman. Her love of the outdoors and the skills she learned from NOLS combined to become a life changing experience for her. After college, the same daughter went on a NOLS program to Tanzania. Through the Tanzania program reinforced the her self-confidence and outdoors skills and provided her a new and different perception of the world and strongly influenced her decision to get a master's degree in environmental science.    From the time when I first dropped off my daughter in Lander, more than 15 years ago, I have wanted to personally participate in a NOLS program. The opportunity and my work load finally aligned and I was able to participate in a NOLS alumni program in Wyoming this past Summer. The time outdoors and the camaraderie were all that I had hoped for. I had a great time and heartily recommend NOLS programs for people of all ages.

They work with local people on local projects that will empower and support local people. We donate as often as we can because we recognise the importance of their work.  Inspiring! 
Trailblazer Foundation	217780	1	/users/profile/281323	NancyJB	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/26/2014	Although program outcomes are essential to any mission driven organization the criticality of an involved board of directors (BOD) and effective staff administration should not be overlooked.   The Trailblazer Foundation serves as an example of how  the BOD/staff work hand in hand to develop and deliver programs whose outcomes make a difference.   As a former nonprofit associate professor at a major university, I have worked with thousands of well meaning nonprofit employees - both new to the field and established management - and have personally observed how good intentions are just one piece of a well run organization.   A sustainable organization - one that will endure both the triumphs of successful programs - as well as the pressure to achieve more impact with constrained resources - requires dedication evidenced by the Trailblazer BOD, staff - and volunteers! In today's complicated and often fretful world, it can be easy to turn away when the "job" seems never ending or unachievable - but I can attest to the dedication and devotion that TB staff has today as well as the future to support the people of Cambodia.   Nancy FellGlobal Leadership/Nonprofit Management Regis UniversityDenver, CO  (former affiliate faculty)  
Trailblazer Foundation	217651	1	/users/profile/281190	Anni T.	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	I was a volunteer for 4 weeks with Trailblazer in Siem Reap and had the most amazing and enlightening time. It is remarkable how much the Foundation has achieved both on the water filters and wells front, and also on the educational front via various amazing school projects and teaching local families how to provide for themselves. I worked with the water filter team and felt privileged to work with such a dedicated team and also humbled by the dignity I observed amongst the families to whom we delivered the filters. The Trailblazer Foundation, under the direction of Chris and Scott Coats and their wonderful staff, deserve every accolade going and all the support we can offer. I will be volunteering with them again. Nina x
Trailblazer Foundation	216012	2	/users/profile/279458	2TreeGarden	Advisor	5	09/20/2014	Scott Coats and Chris Coats started Trailblazer Foundation with a simple assumption -- communities have within them both a desire and the intelligence to move forward.  As a person with 38 years of nonprofit executive leadership and consulting experience, I know when someone just has the right idea, sweeps the silly doubts, questions and industry fads aside and does what is important in the right way.  Traiblazer has done that, giving substantive expression to the term empowerment in the most vulnerable and marginalized villages in Cambodia.  While more esoteric and better funded groups have their agenda about this system, that change or a host of shoulds that are completely out of touch on the ground, Trailblazer just takes another dozen steps forward, connecting local villages and regional structures, facilitating trust, nurturing hope, moving to the next village when the consistent results have manifested the roots and trunk of a sustainable future.

Trailblazer Foundation	215478	1	/users/profile/278895	Elodie	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	Hey there !  I completely loved this experience ! This is amazing how giving your time for a good purpose make you feel so happy. My experience at Trailblazer was my first volunteering and not the last :). I've learned a lot on myself but also on the power of volunteering.  Think about that you are helping people having access to clean water ! Imagine how you would feel, living aaway from any grosseries shops without water ? Having to go by waking/motocycling everyday  just for getting water seems unbelievable for you ? but that's their daily life and traiblazer is changing this!  I am very glad I worked with trailblazer. The staff are really nice and funny, volunteers I met were also very nice and actually thanks to traiblazer I am gonna go meeting them in Canada and elsewhere. Plus living in Cambodia was such a good experience :)  Trailblazer is really a good NGO much better than some others who are building a business on the money that they ask you to pay for volunteering...

Trailblazer Foundation	214546	1	/users/profile/277820	murphyce	Volunteer	5	09/10/2014	Leadership & Philosophy: Originally visiting the Trailblazer Foundation (TF) while volunteering with a partner organization, I was completely captured after speaking with the co-founder, Scott Coats, about TF's work, philosophy, staff, volunteers, and impact. I was so caputred that I asked if I could stay for a month and volunteer. The focus for TF is on actually listening to the people to help guide them towards sustainable solutions. I saw far too many nonprofit organizations throughout Southeast Asia and Cambodia that go in with preconceived ideas of what will work and then do it (in a western/non-localized way) with minimal to no villager interaction. Now those villagers are waiting for the next handout. Instead, TF has a sustainable development model where the communities invest in their own futures (for instance each villager pays a small amount for each biosand filter that is put into a village fund for the villagers to take loans from and managed by an appointed villager). This allows the villagers to feel included in their own growth, and it encourages them to problem solve and develop solutions. It may be a slower solution sometimes, but it is a far more sustainable future for these villagers to empower them to create their opportunities with TF's support.  The Crew/TF Team: The team that works at TF both inside and outside of Cambodia is incredible! It's obvious that they enjoy what they do and are proud of it! They are a smart team and very fun to work with and learn from, and they really care about the people they are supporting. They're not just building filters and wells and agricultural systems. They're providing clean water, access to water, and sources of income to some of the poorest people in Cambodia who would otherwise continue facing uncontrollable illnesses and unhealthy levels of poor nutrition.  Beneficiaries & Impact: I had the pleasure of meeting with different villagers while gathering information with a TF team member for case studies/impact assessment and for the Village Savings Funds. Wow. The beneficiaries of TF's support are truly inspirational. They all have endured challenging hardships, yet they are so resilient and share a smile with the world that brings so much warmth to the atmosphere.  Volunteer Work: My volunteer experience was different than most, but if anyone is ever looking for a more hands-on opportunity to volunteer, then the Trailblazer Foundation would be an amazing place! Most volunteers have the opportunity to help in not only building the filters, but also in delivering them to the villagers with the team. An experience that can never be replicated.  I am grateful to be a part of the Trailblazer Foundation's family going forward and continuing to support their amazing work! Thank you, TF! 
Trailblazer Foundation	186985	1	/users/profile/243992	Rach33	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	This is one of the best organizations I have ever volunteered for. They truly are trying to make Cambodia a better place and challenge poverty. I was so inspired to see how the whole organization was run and the amazing things they do for people everyday.  I searched online for various volunteering opportunities in Cambodia but kept finding organizations that made you pay high prices to volunteer and had development practices that were questionable on whether they were really helping people. However, I was so glad to find a REAL volunteering experience when I stubbled upon the Trailblazer website and thought hey, this is just what I am looking for! This organization is honestly helping Cambodian people in so many ways and with very ethical, smart, just, and respectable ways. Upon arrival to the organization I found that the staff were so welcoming and really make you feel a part of a team. I got to make water filter deliveries to communities, work in the garden, filter sand, and many other hands on activities. Visiting communities with the organization really shows you what their work is doing to improve communities and lives. I was only 19 when I volunteered here, if you are a youth looking for a ethical organization to really get to know the true people, culture and realities of Cambodia then I really recommend volunteering at Trailblazer. It changed my life in many ways and I hope it does for you too. Thank you Trailblazer!!  -Rachelle from Canada.
Trailblazer Foundation	166535	1	/users/profile/221258	Chada	General Member of the Public	5	08/30/2013	My friends and I went to Siem Reap wanting to help a village school build a library. We had no idea where to start. Having read about The Trailblazer Foundation in the book 'Unsung Heroes Cambodia' which had just been launched during our first visit in June 2013, it was one of the organizations we approached for advice. At the end, it was the ONLY organization that gave us plenty of advice and shared with us their experience. Their country director even helped us to get our project started and continues to help us in monitoring the progress of the building, as we are not based in Cambodia. We were very fortunate to have met Chris Coats, one of the founders, on one visit in July. We saw the various work TF is doing, first hand, and we were just in awe of the magnitude of positive effects their work has in the lives of thousands of Cambodians. 
Trailblazer Foundation	164379	2	/users/profile/218454	HeatherG427	Volunteer	5	08/07/2013	The Trailblazer Foundation is a fantastic organization that is truly making a difference in the local community. I had the privilege of volunteering with them for 10 weeks in 2012. During my time at Trailblazer, I volunteered with the awesome guys on the Water Filter Team, doing work involved with building, distributing, and assembling bio-sand water filters and their components, and I also helped out with agricultural projects on occasion.  One of the best parts about volunteering with the Trailblazer Foundation is that you can immediately see the impact you are having. From day one, I could understand how the work I was doing would benefit people in the local community. And, better yet, just days after I started volunteering, I was able to go on a water filter delivery where I helped distribute and assemble water filters in a local village.  On the water filter deliveries, I was able to meet the families that were receiving the water filters and see the end result of our hard work. Having the opportunity to see exactly where your time and effort are going makes a world of difference and really drives home the importance of what life-changing work is being done by Trailblazer.  In the span of my 10 weeks at Trailblazer, I was able to help build, distribute, and assemble 85 water filters in 10 different villages! It was such an incredibly rewarding experience that I won't soon forget! I really cannot speak highly enough about the Trailblazer Foundation and all the wonderful people that work there. I'm grateful to them for letting me be a part of the important work they do, and I definitely recommend volunteering with them if you're ever in Cambodia!

TF are a lean organisation dedicated to delivering sustainable projects like providing clean water through bio sand filter and wells with very little of their funds burnt in overhead.  They have a number of other projects (agriculture and school development) which we saw at first hand last year when we visited Siem Reap.  A very inspirational organisation which improves the lives of the poor in Cambodia.We continue to be engaged with TF since our visit last year by raising awareness and funds in our local community.

Trailblazer Foundation	145879	3	/users/profile/192476	tblodg20	Volunteer	5	12/04/2012	This is one of the most upstanding and genuine organizations that I've come across in my world travelers. The organization is no frills, putting all its money towards those its intended for and little towards themselves. They are constantly listening to the people's needs and testing new programs. I worked on several projects in my several weeks volunteering -- from preparing the biosand water filters, to prepping a self-sustaining mushroom operation, and then into the rural areas to drill wells. I was able to see first-hand the community's appreciation of the gift of fresh water. Best yet, the organization provides stable employment for locals, and everyone involved is friendly and dedicated. I love the sense of community and respect within the organization. An amazing place to volunteer and a great organization to support!

It's a wonderful charity that ploughs all it's donations into providing clean water and developing sustainabity for the most in need communities in the country.  They are very innovative in their ideas from bio-sand filters, to test gardens to teach others and encouraging small business ideas.  The team are friendly, committed and really keep their goal in mind.  From a volunteering perspective, they are one of the few in cambodia that don't try to charge huge fees to foreigners to help out - you can turn up, give as much time as you can and know you are helping a great cause.  I hope they continue to do well and wish Scott & Chris all the luck in the world for the future.

We researched carefully before choosing Trailblazer Foundation. Scott and Chris are inspirational, the dedication they have to changing lives is immeasurable, the difference they've made is astonishing. We consider the time spent at Trailblazer to be the most rewarding of our 9 month journey. We made water filters, then delivered them to remote villages and saw first hand the difference Trailblazer Foundation are making to wonderful people in desperate need. We learned a great deal while we were there, about both the problems facing locals and the solutions. We learned about sustainability and how to help effectively, to achieve long term improvements. Everyone we met there was lovely. The staff and volunteers - the well drilling crew, the people stuffing bags full of mushroom growing medium, the gang sorting gravel for the filters - all lovely. There was alot of laughter and some have become firm friends. Whenever we think about taking another trip (and I hope it will be soon), the starting point is always Siem Reap and Trailblazer!

Connecting with the Trailblazer family changed my entire experience in Southeast Asia. I felt immediately welcome and was given work in the test garden where I was interested in learning more about organic gardening in Cambodia. My new friend Narem taught me many things and even showed me his favorite lunch spot. This organization is truly walking the talk and making positive impacts on the Siem Reap community. What is particularly impressive is that Scott and Chris are striving to make this Foundation sustainable long-term by empowering and engaging local people to take charge and run as much of the organization as they can. Highly recommended!

Trailblazer Foundation	87453	1	/users/profile/98128	Coats	Advisor	5	04/27/2011	Trailblazer Foundation was founded as a tax exempt non-profit in Wyoming, USA April 2004.  Trailblazer works in Cambodia, specifically Siem Reap Province, bringing clean water and hope to rural villagers.  Since 2005 Trailblazer has provided access to potable water to over 70,000 people through bio-sand water filters that are constructed locally at their work site.  A recent study they conducted shows families using a water filter have a larger home, better roof, more livestock, and generally a higher economic status.  Trailblazer's implementation method focuses on villager participation and appropriate technologies, which ensures sustainability and success in their projects.  Trailblazer also supports women in vocational training opportunities and small business, as well as, education for rural students by constructing government schools and a library.  Recently Trailblazer has established an agriculture program to help rural farmers increase crop production through a low tech drip irrigation system, whereby providing additional income securities.  They employ Cambodians and have 11 staff in their Siem Reap office.

For example, in my new role with Wildlands Restoration Volunteers, we are working on restoring habitat for the northern leopard frog and Preble's Meadow jumping mouse, and funding is available to do this work.  I don't know if the attention to these species would have brought funding to this important work if BCA hadn't worked very hard to raise awareness about them in the press, and fought hard for federal designations under the Endangered Species Act. I truly believe in the mission of BCA; I'm now a donor and will continue to donate as long as I can. I think it is sad that money for advocacy work that is so vital is so sparse, and I will continue to encourage others to put money towards this work as a donor.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	89198		/users/profile/6360	kdriese	Board Member	5	05/25/2011	The Biodiversity Conservation Alliance is a strong, grass-roots, environmental group that works tirelessly to safeguard Wyoming's natural attributes, which are constantly under pressure in many ways, but especially from oil and gas extraction and associated industrialization of Wyoming landscapes.  If you love Wyoming's natural places, consider donating to BCA.  They accomplish much with a small budget thanks to the dedication of their staff.  An example is the fight to protect the unparralleled beauty and solitude of the Adobe Town area from development.  
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4623	17	/users/profile/6360	kdriese	Volunteer	5	05/19/2009	The Biodiversity Conservation Alliance (BCA) is a smart, science-based environmental group that works tirelessly to protect the frequently maligned landscapes and ecosystems of Wyoming and bordering areas.  The staff works all the time and is impressive in the amount of hard scientific research that they do to contest ecological unsustainable or unreasonable development in the region.  They deserve a huge amount of credit for protecting Wyoming in the face of the relentless oil and gas industry and other industries that put profit before sustainability.

They promote using falsehoods and pictures that have been doctored.  Molvar over-rates his knowledge constantly. You would be wise to avoid this so-called non-profit because they are not truthful in what they tell the public.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	37742	7	/users/profile/38435	wwwnazilieskillus	Volunteer	0	04/30/2010	I did inventories of older files dealing with legal, public relations, and Federal agency work.(There was an amazing amount of material.)  I am now working on sorting and listing clippings files.  I am retired and I was asked to volunteer about two years ago.  I have always been treated with humor and smarts by a dedicated staff that has always been quick to answer questions.  I have occasionally had a free lunch from the deal.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	37740	1	/users/profile/38434	stratton	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/30/2010	Biodiversity Conservation Alliance is an outstanding organization that is willing to take measured, but tough stances in defense of wild places. Their staff is first rate with significant on the ground experience that leads credibility to their efforts. Their policy positions are grounded in a strong scientific perspective.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	37736	4	/users/profile/38432	jkessler	Board Member	5	04/30/2010	BCA is a hard hitting, no nonsense group that provides wildlife and natural places a strong voice to counter forces of exploitation and damage. But, in addition to their work to halt the damage, BCA also provides science-based conservation plans and positive alternatives to the status quo.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	34655	1	/users/profile/35528	newrodeo	General Member of the Public	1	04/05/2010	I haven't been in the area too long, but constantly find BCA promoting false statements about land usage.  I support most of the stated mission of BCA, but find the organization to be fundamentally flawed.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	34646	1	/users/profile/35515	ecoarthulle	Client Served	5	04/05/2010	I was in Laramie when BCA was founded and followed their important work for years. Inspite of tremendous pressure and rumors of death threats, they carried on helping to save Wyoming's wildness.With minimal but dedicated staff, I watched them accomplish miracles for wildlife species.  I still keep up and donate every year, even though I've moved away! Someday I want to make one of the field trips to Red Desert & adobetown. best, Lynne Hull
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	34573	2	/users/profile/5763	Leila Bruno	Former staff	5	04/03/2010	Matthieu Ricard once said, "What counts is not the enormity of the task, but the size of the courage" This is what I have experienced over the years with BCA -- it is an organization filled with the kind of smart, caring people who just don't give up. And in Wyoming this counts for so much!  Even tho some of the staff people have changed over the twenty years this group has been around, the mission hasn't -- they're still using science and law to win on behalf of clean rivers, old growth forests, restored prairies and all the beautiful wildlife living in these landscapes. It takes a lot of grist and heart not to go down into despair in this environmental crisis -- I love and admire all these folks for continuing their work. They inspire me.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	5233	14	/users/profile/7029	Jamie Egolf	Donor	5	06/16/2009	I've rarely seen a more hardworking, knowledgeable, talented, and dedicated group of people in a non profit before.  The history of BCA set the stage for the highly educated group that would follow the efforts of Lela Bruno when the group was called Friends of the Bow in stopping the ragged clear cutting of the Medicine Bow National Forest.  Now they tackle education, leadership, litigation, organization, and fund raising in order to protect habitats, clean up tainted water from Coal Bed Methane production, and dedicate rare areas like Adobe Town, protecting the area from drilling and other destruction. We can also thank them for the reintroduction of the Black Footed Ferret and protecting the pocket gopher.  This is a hard time for non profits, and we need to be certain that they remain in their habitat too!
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4787	18	/users/profile/6528	Jason A. Lillegraven	Board Member	4	05/29/2009	This is a no-nonsense, pro-environment organization that provides a good balance between first trying to convince by reason and, if that doesn't work, going after the problem following law and the courts. The Director is a brilliant and seriously committed advocate for nature. He is not afraid to deal with -- mix it up with -- the largest of public or private agencies. He gets things done and decisions made! His small but dedicated staff is allowed to operate semi-autonomously, but internal communication remains strong and positive.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4619	17	/users/profile/6357	Rick	Donor	5	05/18/2009	BCA HAS IMPRESSED ME CONSISTANTLY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THEY ARE REMARKABLY EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. THEY ARE VERY DESERVING OF INCREASED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND ARE SUCH GOD STEWARDS ON HOW IT IS USED.

Also, their ability to take on tough issues in Wyoming through a science-based approach.  Gutsy organization.  I appreciate their Smart from the Start report on wind developmnet in Wyoming. Finally, they are an organized group that fights for the biodiversity of Wyoming.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4597	14	/users/profile/6311	SarahBCA	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/16/2009	I love this organization!  I like its foundation in science, grassroots advocacy and direct experience with nature.  I think its use of consensus is key for good decision making.  I learn something every day at BCA and have high regard for my colleagues.  BCA is hard-hitting and doesn't fall for fads in our field.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4596	16	/users/profile/6334	Leeschwa	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/16/2009	BCA is fantastic about getting the word out on issues. The only feedback I would have that is "constructive" is that sometimes, like so many environmental organizations, BCA relies on emotional rather than hard factual impact.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4594	16	/users/profile/6332	WaterTrick	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/16/2009	This organization is science-driven as it maneuvers through often difficult social, cultural and political realities. Its staff and board possess a clear understanding of its mission. We place only the need to maintain scientific, personal and organizational integrity on par with the importance of doing all our resources allow to protect wildlife and wild places in Wyoming and surrounding states.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4591	17	/users/profile/6331	brndnbeard	Donor	5	05/16/2009	BCA is an outstanding conservation organization with a dedicated staff and ambitious but effective goals. I only wish that BCA would team up with some of the fledgling conservation organizations in Idaho such as "Friends of the Clearwater." It would give BCA a broader base and would serve to strengthen the others.
Biodiversity Conservation Alliance	4589	20	/users/profile/6329	Dianne Duncan Perrote	Volunteer	5	05/16/2009	This group is informed, passionate, and dedicated.  Did I mention creative?

Black Dog Animal Rescue	311425		/users/profile/402777	Abbi F.	Board Member	5	10/17/2016	Before joining the Board of Directors for Black Dog Animal Rescue ("BDAR") in 2016, my family adopted a dog rescued by BDAR.  I have never met a more wonderful dog, and I am forever in BDAR's debt for bringing him into our life.  Our dog joined our family during a time of loss, and he truly helped us more than we helped him.  He was not a Band-aid to our grief, he was the cure.In short, BDAR is an incredible organization. It takes the homeless animals that no one wants, and the animals that shelters cannot help.  Many of these animals have been abandoned, abused, and passed over time and time again.  BDAR takes these animals, and through the help of selfless volunteers, gives them a chance to do what they do best  love unconditionally.In the past year alone, BDAR has given over 400 dogs and cats the opportunity to live fully.  That is hundreds of people across Wyoming and the region who, like me, have had their lives enriched by an animal saved by BDAR.  Words cannot express how thankful I am for BDAR, nor how proud I am to serve on its Board. 
Black Dog Animal Rescue	311049		/users/profile/402385	Meredith25	Board Member	5	10/15/2016	Before joining the Board of Directors in 2015, I was an adopter, a foster mom and then adopted one more. My last adoption brought balance into our family and between the two dogs currently living with us. BDAR is a true advocate for those less fortunate animals and strives to provide the best outcomes for each one they encounter. It's been an honor and a privileged to be able to serve this organization, which has an outstanding Executive Director and caring staff.
Black Dog Animal Rescue	305105		/users/profile/396333	bbenskin	Board Member	5	09/16/2016	I have served on the Board of Directors of this organization for four years.  During this time BDAR has experienced an extraordinary financial growth of five fold enabling it to move into larger quarters and increase its staff.  This has allowed BDAR to leverage its volunteer base and provide a better venue to allow potential adopters to meet and bond with the animals.
Black Dog Animal Rescue	226802	2	/users/profile/290534	KellieBrodrecht	Volunteer	4	10/26/2014	I have volunteered with BDAR for 8 months now and it has been such an amazing opportunity for me.  I have volunteered for other rescues in Wyoming but none of them have compared to BDAR.  Black Dog Animal Rescue has such a great crew of volunteers who become your best support system and your biggest fans.  Volunteering with BDAR is so easy!  They are extremely organized and have such a good system which makes everything run smoothly and the dogs get the best care possible.  BDAR doesn't only provide wonderful care for dogs it provides wonderful care to their volunteers.  I'm extremely happy I became a foster home with such an amazing rescue.  I look forward to the years to come and I can't wait to watch BDAR continue to grow. 
Black Dog Animal Rescue	226707		/users/profile/290440	MissyMoellenberg	Volunteer	5	10/25/2014	I have volunteered with BDAR for nearly 3 years. During this time I have seen the organization and it's programs expand greatly.  In the past year, the PASS (Positive Alternative to Shelter Surrender) program was conceived, offering rehoming assistance to owners who can no longer keep their dogs. Several people have been able to utilize this program, and avoid the stress (for themselves, and their dog) of taking their dog to an animal shelter and possibly face an uncertain fate. As the organization grows and branches out further in the state, BDAR will undoubtedly be seeking to find new, life-saving methods to implement.
Black Dog Animal Rescue	225702		/users/profile/289458	Susan351	Donor	5	10/23/2014	Black Dog Animal Rescue (BDAR) is a marvelous example of a simple idea by one person that has grown and grown into a unique and highly effective rescue organization for dogs.  BDAR saves hundreds of dogs every year by taking at-risk dogs from Wyoming shelters, providing them with spay/neuter and medical care and placing them in foster homes until adoption.   The program is more successful than many of Wyoming's municipal shelters at finding adopted homes for dogs.  It has been a journey to keep this tiny organization alive and now it is growing and making a difference in Wyoming.  If you are looking for a place to make a donation that really makes a difference in the lives of dogs, please consider a gift to Black Dog Animal Rescue.  Hundreds and hundreds of adoptable dogs have been save and hundreds more can be saved in the future.  BDAR is part of the solution to creating a world where we can Save Them All!

Everyone goes above and beyond the "call of duty" to ensure each dog entering the program finds a warm, wonderful, loving, and forever home.  I have had the great privilege of being involved with Black Dog Animal Rescue since its inception.  It has been, and still is, an amazing journey to watch the organization grow and realize dream after dream!  Thank you, Black Dog, for everything you do for all the dogs entering the program. . . . .BLACK DOG ANIMAL RESCUE ROCKS!!
Black Dog Animal Rescue	223417		/users/profile/287165	Bailey A.	Volunteer	5	10/16/2014	I have been volunteering with BDAR for a little over a year, and I have enjoyed every minute of being involved with this wonderful organization. The more experienced volunteers have been great mentors to me and have helped me grow into a larger role. They took the time to get to know me and utilize my skills in a way that benefit the organization. I admire Britney's leadership and her determination to fulfill the important mission. The mission serves as a guiding light for each decision that is made which guarantees the long term viability and success of the organization. This can be emotional work, but Britney ensures each step forward is made with a level head. It has been great to see BDAR grow over the last year and I can't wait to see what the future brings!
Black Dog Animal Rescue	222364		/users/profile/286071	Mamagoose	Board Member	5	10/13/2014	Black Dog Animal Rescue is a wonderful organization that rescues the hard to place dogs from shelters and provides them with medical care and training if needed.  They then place the dogs in foster homes where they get to live with a family until they are adopted.   BDAR works very hard to make sure the dogs are well taken care of and socialized and that they ultimately go to responsible pet owners.  It has saved hundreds and hundreds of dogs in the few years that it has been in existence.
Black Dog Animal Rescue	218489		/users/profile/282061	3dogs7catsandabird	Board Member	5	09/30/2014	I have been in love with this organization since I first met Britney Wallesch, the founder.  Since then, I've become an adoptor (twice), a donor and a board member.  This is trulay an organization with a heart as big as its goals.  They aren't just saving the animals they can, they are paving a road for a better, brighter future for homeless animals.  
Black Dog Animal Rescue	215819	1	/users/profile/279271	Banditolover	Board Member	5	09/19/2014	Over time, I became so impressed with Britney Wallesch, our Executive Director, and her passion and mission for Black Dog Animal Rescue that I introduced myself to tell her that.  It wasn't long after that I told her I would be interested in serving on the board.  And here I am today.  I am enjoying doing my part to further BDAR and I now feel I am aiding animals who only want what they deserve - a home and lots of love.

Black Dog Animal Rescue	201126		/users/profile/262592	rsgmeza	Client Served	5	05/28/2014	My husband and I have been supporters of BDAR for some time; however, their role in our lives recently graduated from supportive yet casual, to life changing.  BDAR allowed us to find our newest family member, Scott (formerly Ferguson).  I can't imagine what his little life was like before BDAR found him, but I do know that once he was found, BDAR welcomed him to the BDAR family (and a wonderful foster home) showing him the love he has always deserved.  We can no longer imagine our lives without the baby of the family, and are so thankful that because of BDAR, we don't have to.     Thank you BDAR for making this all possible!
Black Dog Animal Rescue	201109		/users/profile/262575	andrea.sullivan	Volunteer	5	05/28/2014	I looked for a long time for the right place to volunteer for what I really believe in and have a passion for. I've found the perfect place to do just that in BDAR! BDAR uses well researched models and data from the Humane Society of America, ASCPA, Petfinder and SAWA (as well as other valuable resources) to guide the organizations growth and structure.  It's very well organized with its data, documentation, transports, supplies, procedures and delegation. The staff is the highest level of professional and really amazing at what they do.... not only in the heart that is put into every single dog, but they are efficient and flexible enough to meet continually changing needs and challenges that arrive, whether it concerns one specific animal or the larger vision of where we want BDAR to be in 5 years time.  BDAR offers training and continuing education for all that are interested.  I believe the best thing about BDAR is that it has become more than an organization....BDAR is the one constant that these dogs can guarantee will always be with them. Once you are a BDAR dog, you are always a BDAR dog....you are taken care of no matter what happens in the future. I love volunteering knowing that we are that great constant in a dog's life that they wouldn't have had without Black Dog Animal Rescue.

At first, we started helping out in small ways, but as all good non-profits have a tendency to do, we were quickly drawn in by the enthusiasm and dedication of the staff and volunteers and began helping in any way we could, including fostering dogs.  We're so thankful for the community of like-minded individuals we've found ourselves in, and we look forward to continuing to support BDARs rescue efforts for years to come!
Black Dog Animal Rescue	201082	1	/users/profile/262542	adeebish	Volunteer	5	05/28/2014	I've been Volunteering with Black Dog Animal Rescue since August of 2012.  We have adopted one dog from them and fostered 35 others. The dedication and time their volunteers and staff put in to save the homeless dogs in Wyoming continues to amaze me.  Giving, selfless, dedicated, hardworking are just a few words I'd use to describe their volunteer base.  This organization is making a big impact in a state that is large and rather rural. After sharing our home with 36 foster dogs dogs over the past few years I've come to realize that all those dogs needed to find a loving home was a second chance, a little love and most often a little time and training invested in them. You better believe that every single life we've saved is worth our efforts and the time these folks put in. I fully support BDAR's mission to provide homeless animals across Wyoming with guaranteed safe and secure placement, promote the use of proven life-saving programs in our communities, and advocate for animal welfare.  I'm proud to be a part of this life saving organization.

Pryor Mountain Wild Mustang Center Inc	104303		/users/profile/139847	Loribell	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	I have been volunteering for the PMWMC for several years now. The Pryor Mountain Wild Mustang Center is very special in that it is the first and foremost organization that gives the facts about the Pryor Mountain Wild Horses. The people are honest and do their very best to inform the public about the Horses. Those involved have given countless hours of their time to preserve and interpret the wild horses on the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range. The Center is a very important part of the community and they have programs at the schools to educate the children about the importance of these very special horses. At the Center many visitors come every year to learn about the wild horses and gather information as to where they can view the horses. The people involved with the Center are very helpful and are very dedicated to the cause. I helped install water guzzlers up on the Pryor Mountains so that the wild horses would utilize different parts of the range. The water guzzlers are now being used by the horses, so this project was successful. All involved are very passionate and hard working people. I would encourage anyone interested in these horses and the Center to volunteer their time. These horses are a National Treasure and they have a voice with the Pryor Mountain Wild Mustang Center!!!

The Pryor Mountain Wild Mustang Center drove us up there in their 4 wheel drive truck.  Mine wouldn't have made it.  They knew where to find the horses and all their names.  They provided lunch and refreshments and great company.  It was a wonderful time.  The Center is pivotal in helping the public understand the situation of the wild mustang's and their struggle for survival amongst the BLM wanting to round them all up and put them in holding pens...no longer free to roam their native land.  The Center is awesome!

As a professional photographer, leader of wild horse workshops and author of Among Wild Horses: A Portrait of The Pryor Mountain Mustangs, I have often depended on the knowledge and help of this non-profit group. They play an important role in educating the public about the Pryor Mountain wild horse herd, providing valuable information to visitors to the area and to the public, in general. They also provide time and hands-on labor to help with projects that are in the best interest of the horses. In addition, they are the caretakers of the archive of important historical documents related to the history of these special horses.  
Pryor Mountain Wild Mustang Center Inc	103588		/users/profile/138500	carrots	Donor	5	01/17/2012	Horses have always been my first love, especially the wild mustang.  And I had always dreamed of being able to do art depicting how a wild horse truly is, and to be able to do something to make the life of a wild horse be better in the world for how it is today.   To be able to help the general public understand the plight of the wild mustang  horse was always a dream, a vision that I was never able to make come true until on July 13th, 2011 when I came across the Pryor Mountain Wild Mustang Center in Lovell, Wyoming.  A dream long awaited for was now finally coming true.  I have lots of horses to use for art and a place to donate to and a place that truly does help the wild mustang.

The organizer, Deb Thomas, is extremely knowledgable in all these matters and works incessently on our behalf.  She helped us organize Pavillion Area Concerned Citizens, PACC.  As a local group, and through Powder River Basin Resource Council,we have been in contact with the Department of Environmental Quality and other state and national organizations. As a landowner with 24 gas wells on our land, we have contaminated water, soil, and air.  Powder River Basin Resource Council has helped immensely, working on our problems, calling attention of our plight.  We do have the attention of state agencies.  Deb Thomas and our local chairman, John Fenton, have been to the state legislature and also to Washington, D.C. to share our experiences and hope for help in solving our problems.  They have appeared at the meetings of Wyoming Oil and Gas and offered rule changes to make drilling safer.  We don't want to keep the gas company, Encana, from getting the natural gas, but we expect them to use safety measures at all times to ensure our water, soil, and air are not contaminated.  We feel the grassroots organization of Powder River Basin Resource Council have helped us immensely in our plight.

He has made every effort to the best of his ability to obtain a successful non-profit organization.  Lamarr's heart is with the children and his dedication to the cause is undeniably genuine!  To all that have been able to assist with this non-profit organization and other organizations that are considering to donate should be for the same cause.  It is not wasted money.  In fact, this organization is investing in our children within the community!  I hope and pray it will be everlasting for the sake of our children and for the sake of an organization dedicated to the children!  Great parade today and loved seeing those dedicated young Brave CATS be a part of it!
Paws and Claws Animal Adoption and Care Center	234873		/users/profile/305245	Barbara203	Volunteer	5	12/03/2014	I was there for the shelter's grand opening, was impressed then and still is now, every animal is so well taken care of and loved.  A few months back there was a fall cleaning day, I think  the volunteers   had more fun playing with the cats and dogs than cleaning.   ONE HUNDRED THUMBS UP!

Everyone at this shelter, (staffed only by volunteers), truly cares for every furbaby that comes through the door. They go to great lengths to make sure each animal is adopted to the right family. This facility is so clean and well run, every shelter should aspire to be this nice. The place is so wonderful I drive an hour just to volunteer there. 
Paws and Claws Animal Adoption and Care Center	234766	1	/users/profile/303090	Kimberly106	Volunteer	5	12/01/2014	The animals at Paws & Claws get the best care available. Whenever an animal is sick, they are taken to the vet right away, and are quarantined away from the other animals until they are better. We clean the facility every day so the animals are always in a healthy environment. Not just anyone can adopt an animal. Every precaution is taken to make sure that the pets go to a wonderful forever home. I can only hope that shelters I volunteer at in the future are as great as this one!

Volunteer Teacher Thailand	304675		/users/profile/395851	Lydia A.	Volunteer	5	09/15/2016	I spent a month with volunteer teacher Thailand over August and September. I had not done any teaching before I came to Thailand and was a little nervous that I would not know what to do. However the team at VTT were brilliant. They had all the lessons planned and explained me exactly what I was expected to do and how I should do it. You are never left alone whilst teaching as you are paired up with another volunteer. The children are fantastic and very keen to learn English, they are what made my experience of Thailand so enjoyable.  If you also want to explore more of Thailand whilst volunteering, VTT is brilliant as it is very close to Phuket and islands such as Phi Phi, so you can easily go and see the sights during the weekends. I found VTT to be a brilliant experience, which I have learnt a lot from, and would definitely recommend it anyone who wants to teach in Thailand. 
Volunteer Teacher Thailand	303243		/users/profile/394404	Luke13	Volunteer	5	09/11/2016	I went to Thailand with Volunteer Teacher Thailand in August of this year. I had done some reserach and so I wanted a volunteer organisation where I felt like I could make a differnce. Pupils in Thailand really suffer from a lack of English teachers, particularly for tourism and to get into university so I felt this would be perfect. It far exceeded my expectations. The lessons were all organised once you get to the office, which makes life far easier, and the kids are awesome! The schools I was placed in (both a primary and secondary school) were excellent. I cannot recommed this organisation enough if teaching is something you want to do.  
Childrens Discovery Center	322651		/users/profile/416611	Joanne61	Client Served	5	02/03/2017	I chose to send my 3 year old daughter to the Pinedale Children's Discovery Center because, as an educator, I saw the immense value in their hands-on, engaging, meaningful curriculum, the healthy meals, and the amount of time the students spent outside. A year later found my daughter thriving, and my 2 year old son, newly attending, suddenly exhibiting some very difficult behaviors. The staff of the CDC were supportive, loving, understanding, and all around amazing through it all. They put in extra hours, miraculously summoned up patience and love to survive his tantrums, supported him lovingly when he kicked and screamed, and continued to love and support him no matter how difficult his behaviors were.  I'm confident that any other preschool setting would have expelled him...but through the support and encouragement of this amazing non-profit preschool, we found the resources we needed to help my child grow and progress. Today, he is practically a different kid--a testament to the effectiveness of skilled early intervention. My son isn't the only child who has benefited from the above-and-beyond care and expertise of the highly qualified staff here....and I am grateful for all of them, everyday. This preschool is an amazing facility.

They came to my home interviewed me during my divorce case.  Judge Wolf was presiding many years ago.  I gave them my complete story as a  combat veteran, with the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential  Unit Citation  and other medals.   I begged them practically to understand that I was gainfully employed, and doing my best to cope with what had happened to me in the military.  I thought they would treat me fairly.  When I went to court they were there.  My children were young and very impressionable.  During the court proceeding my children were taken out of the room and asked who they would rather live with.  I never got a chance to say anything.  So as a combat veteran, and one who just told the truth, all my children went to live with my ex wife.  All four of them.  Do you want to know what I think of CASA?   I don't think you do.

I had bad experiences here that led me to a very dark time in my life.  It brought violence and hate into my life, and I spent years in recovery.  At the conclusion of my time there, I was jobless without any credentials to further my life experience.  I had a child that I could not provide for and I had no home.  I surrendered my life to this organization and found myself broken.  When I approached the leaders of the organization about my situation I was told that I was simply not following Jesus.  This is a cult-like atmosphere that should be avoided at all costs.

Buffalo Bill Memorial Association	118175		/users/profile/154328	dotw	General Member of the Public	5	07/12/2012	The Gala Fundraiser for the Rocky Mountain Repertory Theatre in Grand Lake was over and wed wona three-night stay in Cody, WY and tickets to some of the events at the September 2011 Rendezvous Royale! We were excited. With grandchildren in Alberta, wed passed through Cody a number of times on our drive to Canada. But we were always in a hurry to get there or exhausted and ready to be home on the return drive to Colorado. Wed cruise by the Buffalo Bill Museum, give it a passing glance, and drive on. But this time, Cody would be our destination and the museum our focus! My husband and I are career educators who lived, until 8 years ago, in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. We love learning, travel, history, and museums. Based on our experiences and the small size of the Cody community, we expected to be enthralled by the art events of the Rendezvous and underwhelmed by the museum. Some dusty artifacts, a few dioramas, and cowboy lore summed up our expectations. We were absolutely astounded to enter the complex, obtain a brochure and read about what awaited us! The five major museum themes, the quality of the displays, the richness of resources and authenticity, the superb scholarship exemplified by the McCracken Library, and the gift shop that offered learning experiences to take home all combined to leave us excited and wanting more. We toured and explored, experiencing the familiar frustration weve often had in high quality museums throughout the worldso much to see and read, study and ponder, and not nearly enough time! As relatively new to the West, we were fascinated by the Plains Indians wing, appreciative of the Firearms section, and intrigued by the art. The latter came to life in a number of ways as we participated in the Rendezvous events. We came a day early to fly fish on the Yellowstone River so the gallery devoted to Yellowstone offered greater insight into the outdoor region wed just enjoyed. And then the namesake exhibit, a Western figure whom wed confused with Wild Bill Hickock. (Remember our suburban background. We wore cowboy boots and Stetsons only for Halloween. All the Wild Bills seemed alike to us!) We left enchanted and with hotel reservations to return in 2012. We also joined the museum, took home an armful of books about Buffalo Bill and Annie Oakley, along with a terrific Western shirt to wear in Colorado. And then we called friends and family, sharing our enthusiasm and appreciation for the Museum and its offerings. The resultwell be joined by my sister from Illinois and four good friends from Grand Lake, all new to Cody and Buffalo Bill, but each one interested and excited. May their fervor, like ours, expand the knowledge and support of this magnificent center that lies in a small town near Yellowstone. We envision returning again and again in the years to come!

It is an unfair and undemocratic process of planning for the future based on the Delphi Technique to manipulate the public into accepting predetermined conclusions and create a group consensus.  This project needs to be defunded and stopped.  It is a threat to private property rights.  The vision document creates a false statement of support for EPA Smart Growth, Sustainable Development, and UN Agenda 21.  This is not a grass roots process; it has been a top down cookie cutter model of Smart Growth just like Envision Utah.
Laramie Project Graduation	201513		/users/profile/263002	UnhappyLaramie	Volunteer	1	05/31/2014	Let me start by saying that if I could rate this event lower than one star I would. The problem I have is with how they awarded the prizes. I learned that the person that won the vehicle also won a plat screen tv. After a prize is awarded their name should be removed from further drawings. So that I am clear, I will not donate to this event when my next child graduates and will encourage others to do the same. 
Pet Partners Of Carbon County	199476		/users/profile/260415	sctthrld	General Member of the Public	1	05/02/2014	* Incorrect spelling in their Mission Statement is amusing, and I find that the name Pet Partners of Carbon COUNTY is misleading.  They only assist the City of Rawlins, while there is such a need IN Carbon County and its other communities.  A newsletter from 2010  claims credit for TNR clinics which were 100% funded by those rural communities, NOT Pet Partners.    Follow-up or contacts for future clinics would of course be hugely beneficial, but to date have never been extended. *On a positive note, the few low cost coupons offered for S/N helps, but only a few.*Personnel can be, and are occasionally abrasive. 
Foundations Of Liberty Inc	141811		/users/profile/188200	Bucko101	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	The same people that provided seminars on the Constitution for Congress and their staff on Capitol Hill operate this organization.  They were highly regarded then, as they are now, for accuracy of history and interesting stories to demonstrate the principle under discussion.  The purpose and accomplishment of our Founders is documented by their own writings.  In other words, real learning takes place in a manner it will be remembered.    This organization is frugal with donated funds and reports frequently on the progress of projects and programs rather than once each year in an appeal letter.  They also go beyond the call to answer questions whether pertaining to seminars, presentations or just a random call with a question.    I read one letter from a chief of Staff in a Senate office that had a double major in college of American History and Political Science, but he had learned more from twelve hours of their seminars than in four years of college.   Their service to the public ranges from Kindergarten to senior citizens.  They have a division for youth sixteen to twenty years of age where they learn the values of Americanism.  American Exceptionalism, (not superiority of the people, but the form of government) and the success principles of business, i.e., goals and objectives, rules of civility, learning from adversity, accurate thinking,  seeing a community need and planning, executing, completing a project to fill the need and writing  a report that can be used by other communities.   Providing the youth opportunities to participate in Town Council, serve on volunteer committees, intern locally, at the state legislature and Washington, D.C., gives them hands on experience.  They learn from group instruction and online interactive programs and then they put the learning into practice. I don't know any other organization that does so much with so little.  They far exceed the expectations of a non-profit organization.                      
Heart Mountain Japanese-American Memorial Foundation Inc	107802		/users/profile/146376	Zann	Volunteer	5	03/10/2012	When I first heard about the plans for this museum I was skeptical as I thought it would be depressing or poorly done.  In fact, it is amazing!  I learned so much!  I was inspired and moved all at the same time.  It is a historic place with amazing relevance for today and the displays are fantastic!  Everything you see counts toward the whole story and a person can see it several times and still be learning and seeing new things.  But, at the same time, a person can come in for an hour, get a lot out of it and not be exhausted.

Childrens Western Wish Foundation	125147	1	/users/profile/170289	Daniels mom	General Member of the Public	5	10/11/2012	I would heartily recommend the Childrens Western Wish Foundation.  In my city, this foundation grants wishes for individuals with disabilities to be a cowboy/cowgirl for 2 days.  The individuals are treated as the stars of the rodeo(sorry for the participants who are doing all the work) and have their moment to shine.  The individual who is selected receives clothing in their size, a straw hat that fits their head and which is signed by the participants, gets VIP seating at the rodeo and has a wonderful time. For many of our individuals with disabilities, there are not opportunities for them to be treated this way. Childrens Western Wish Foundation makes that happen-- not only for the individual, but for their family as well.

If we didn't have the volunteer force in place, some of the families would be on the streets, perpetuating the awful cycle of poverty.  We need to grow and continue in efforts to coordinate with other agencies and programs involved with the homeless.  Since joining the volunteer force, we have seen at least 4 other Church communities come on board.  We continue to try for 12 host Churches. Kudos to the Cheyenne Interfaith Program !

Sheridan Angels Inc	272733	1	/users/profile/361841	AnnieNMouse	Volunteer	1	11/23/2015	When the Sheridan Angels started it was with great intentions and I believe had great success.  As the popularity of the non-profit grew and the charitable donations started coming in, I believe greed took hand.  The board of directors is made up of a husband and wife and one other person.  Meetings are not done and approval is done by 2/3rds vote. Basically husband and wife.  The NP has been given large cash donations and it is at that time, the Director decided to pay her self a substantial amount of money, all but depleting the reserves that should have been going to the community.  Since the program was started the Director used food, clothing and donations for her own personal gain.  It is all done with the disguise that she is doing it out of the kindness of her heart.  This is not so.   I  believe the compensation of the executor should not deplete the reserves of the organization and I  believe all salaries should be transparent and that information should be readily available to any potential donors.
