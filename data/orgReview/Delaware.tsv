Jewish Federation of Delaware Inc	322247		/users/profile/415959	AME17	Volunteer	5	01/27/2017	While I have been a donor for many years and have increased my donation every year I have just recently  become a volunteer.  I have always been exceedingly happy with the services this organization provides to our community and to its sister city in Israel.  Being a volunteer has given me a new prospective on the efforts expended by both the professional staff and the "army" of dedicated volunteers that makes these services possible.  This is truly a wonderful organization to both support and to participate.  I hope I am able to continue to donate and to volunteer.

Their professionalism and attention to detail allows our lay leadership to reach higher and achieve more in every aspect of Jewish communal life. Their outreach spans the state of Delaware and parts of Pennsylvania and is relevant to multi-generational, multi-cultural and inter-faith families, individuals and communities. We may be small but we are mighty or as JFD says... "WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER"

Over the past year, they have come to me with new ways to be involved Jewishly including a larger role in Women's Philanthropy and encouraging me to apply for a national fellowship. It's great to see how the funds raised have a positive impact on Jewish Delaware.

Energy and interest are truly valued by both lay and professional leadership here in Delaware. This community has not only become my home but where I look for support, for information, for inspiration and my gut reaction to this has been to pay it forward and give back.

JFD has expanded my social circle, brought me all kinds of new experiences, and made it clear to me that I really would not want to live anywhere else right now then right here in Delaware.

Volunteer	5	01/27/2017	Jewish Federation of Delaware does an amazing job of mobilizing our Jewish community as a collective towards the greater good for immediate needs in our local orbit, but also does a formidable job of connecting all of us to Jewish communities around the world that need our collective help. I am a proud supporter! I am actively involved as the co-chair the PJ Library program, which provides free Jewish books and music to children throughout the state and into the surrounding Brandywine Valley of Pennsylvania, and most recently participated in a focus group of parents and young professionals where we were given the opportunity to share our thoughts on where the future of Jewish Delaware should be headed. It means a lot to know that Federation takes seriously their role of "speaking" for the rest of us!
Jewish Federation of Delaware Inc	282222		/users/profile/207837	Ellisha C.	Volunteer	5	03/13/2016	The Jewish Federation of Delaware is the one organization in Delaware that is truly able to convene the whole Jewish community around Israel, security and continuity.  From the PJ Library to the Community Relations Committee, from the Siegel JCC to the Kutz Home, locally, the Federation provides for the needs of of community, cradle to grave.  And the Jewish Federation is the only Jewish community organization that I know benefits Jews in need across the globe and here at home.  I highly recommend!

Volunteer	5	04/29/2013	I have been a non-profit professional for ten years, and recently switched to a volunteer role with the Jewish Federation.  I must say that the Jewish Federation of Delaware is one of the best out there!  Yesterday was the Federation's community-wide Israel Independence Day celebration, which began with a PJ Library concert for young children and their families, and nearly 100 people came out on a Sunday morning to be a part of yet another quality program.  Pretty impressive, and it's just one of the many ways in which this organization strengthens the Jewish community in Delaware, bringing people together around a common cause throughout the year.

Our CEO, Seth Katzen, has an amazing staff that makes it all run smoothly.

All of the agencies know what is happening.  I recently was on vacation in California, but kept up to date with what is happening in DE from my emails.  Also, as the chair of the NFC, that includes 6 other Federations and partners in Israel, I always get the support I need from Seth and his staff, as well as helping to communicate our message to DE.  There is so much the JFD offers it is amazing, from PJ Library, to relevant movies and events for the community, the JCC, support for JFS, Hillel ( I am president of the board), education, the Synagogues --it is an outstanding organization.

All of these programs and services exist because of the dedication of the wonderful staff and many volunteers.  When volunteering for these events a stron commmunity is built.  I have participated in events like the one described, in Mitzvah day with hundreds of volunteers, and gon on multiple missions to Israel with my Federation.  I have also been on the board in various positions. It is an honor to work with this group to people.

Its leaders are a part of the community and are always supportive of other agencies' missions.   I am a volunteer who truly values my role as the chair of the committee that oversees the Jewish Voice, our Federation's monthly publication.   The publication's success is directly related to the fact that it is valued from the top.  The CEO/Executive Director and the Editor view it as a priority, and as an avenue for Federation and its sister agencies to have a voice.  The community values the Jewish Voice as a source of information and as a way to stay connected to other Jews.  In Delaware we are lucky to have such a strong Jewish Federation!

While we are located an hour away from Wilmington, Seth is always available to assist with guidance and information or to listen and respond to our needs.  He has made sure we are included in the Federation grant awards that help our extremely small shul cover our programs and to encourage more Jewish offerings  in Central Delaware.  We are very grateful for his leadership and continued support.  When we visit the larger Jewish synagogues and the Jewish Community Center upstate we always feel welcomed and part of the bigger Jewish picture by Seth.

It is a wonderful outlet for volunteerism that really makes a difference in people's lives.  My particular interest is in public policy issues of concern to the Jewish community here and around the world.

It all started after a day of volunteering during which my sons became involved in some activities and met other Jewish children in a non-academic environment.  I've had the joy of helping out when and how I can.  They are always so appreciative of whatever skill and time I can lend, that I don't feel bad (well too much) when I can't do all that I want to to help.   It is a great connection to the Jewish community in Delaware, in the US, in Israel and the world.

Seth Katzen and Wendy Berger are fantastic executives who show their passion for what they do and Ellisha Caplan is an amazing programmer. The Jewish Voice, their print newspaper, as well as the electronic version of it, are timely and represent the community well.

Jewish Federation of Delaware Inc	150949		/users/profile/201332	reganfdavis	Volunteer	5	03/12/2013	Having moved to Delaware as middle-schooler in the early 90s, I quickly became involved with the JCC and my family joined a local synagogue.  While I felt a connection to the Delaware Jewish Community, it was not until my husband and I returned to the area, after a short leave from 06-09, that my true sense of connection began.  I hit the ground running after being nominated to join an impactful Jewish Federation of Delaware leadership program.  Since then, my husband and I have continued to grow our involvement by helping to initiate programming, join agency boards, volunteer, and otherwise become connected with our local Jewish community and beyond.  But, more importantly, we our raising our 2 young sons with a sense of identity and involvement so that we can continue to build our capacity locally and abroad, with the assistance and commitment that JFD provides. Under the strong leadership of Seth Katzen, Wendy Berger, Ellisha Caplan, other professionals, and an amazing team of lay leaders, Jewish Federation of Delaware is an wonderful resource with plentiful opportunities for engagement and possibilities for paying it forward.

Seth Katzen and the entire JFD team have been one of the best groups I have worked with.  There is no substitute for the gratification that I feel when I know that my time and donations go to groups making a difference.   Hillel at the University of Delaware and  The Kutz Home in Wilmington are just two of the organizations that we help improve life daily not just in donations, but also in volunteer time and mentoring. On a personal side, I have made some of the most wonderful friendships as being part of the JFD.  I would recommended to anyone getting involved with the Jewish Federation of Delaware .
Jewish Federation of Delaware Inc	149115		/users/profile/198668	Susan185	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/08/2013	The cohesiveness of the Delaware Jewish community is due in large part to the actions of the Jewish Federation of Delaware. Opening up leadership and other programs to not only member agencies but also to non-affiliated organizations like synagogues, Chabad, Hadassah, etc., is a hallmark of JFD. JFD has very good community communications, via weekly emails, monthly newspaper, and targeted emails to particular interest groups. As a consultant to nonprofit organizations, both Jewish and secular, I find the fact that leadership is open to exploring ways to make a very good organization even better to be a strong positive.

It was the fine institutions which they support which helped our family make the decision to relocate 3,000 miles from our home in southern California.  The Jewish Federation of Delaware is the glue which keeps our Jewish community of 12,000+ together.   I am especially impressed with the Jewish Federation's CEO, Seth Katzen.

Seth Katzen's strength as Executive Director goes beyond his leadership role to include skills in public relations, advertising, promotion, and relationship building.  The results are well-designed communications that include monthly issues of The Jewish Voice, weekly Shabbat eblasts, and programming and activities that are well-thought out, managed professionally, and marketed expertly.  Seth's team of leaders, including Wendy Berger and Ellisha Caplan, and his Board President, Robin Saran, extend their leadership roles beyond their active roles with the JFD to the community at large, actively participating and supporting the Jewish community as a whole.

The staff and administration create a nurturing and educational environment unlike any other. It is an international community with well trained staff and excellent facilities. Their new playground is beautiful. The children have a new garden and playground equipment. The newly renovated facilities are bright and cheery. They have not only an appreciate for foreign languages and academics, but also a strong music program unlike any within the Delaware region.

Now, they are 33 and 35. The school was located near my job at that time and allowed me to commute to work with my them. This afforded me the luxury of knowing that I was not too far away, if they needed me. St. Michael's provided exceptional learning opportunities and care then and continues today. My granddaughter attends the school now. She came when she was 3months old. Today, she is 2years old. 
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	135574		/users/profile/181452	LeeDaney	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I had the privilege of serving as the campaign consultant for St. Michael's very successful multi-million diollar capital campaign several years ago to more than double the size of the school. From the very inception of project planning, the school's Director, Director of Development and the entire Board of Directors planned and executed a near-perfect campaign.  For St. Michael's leaders, this initiative was a major, major "step up" but in the face of a desperate need for additional space to serve additional deserving children, they executed with an infectious enthusiasm that earned the support of hundreds of major foundations, corporations and individual philanthropists in the Wilmington area.  This 24 month project could be the text book model of how to conduct savvy project management.  A top drawer non-profit.

Now she works at the school during her college breaks. Certainly, St. Michael's provided her with a foundation of learning for her lifetime. But more importantly, it's the VIRTUES instilled in her both then and now by teachers, staff, students and families that make me so proud of her. St. Michael's teaches every student kindness, empathy for others, understanding, tolerance, and more. That speaks volumes for St. Michael's and puts them head and shoulders above any other program around.
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	133837		/users/profile/179594	Ballerina chick	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/05/2012	I have been working at St. Michael's for over 14 years and it holds a very special place in my heart.   From its founding in 1890, it has been a place where every child is welcome regardless of their circumstances or their familys financial situation.  St. Michaels overall philosophy is that the child comes first.  This philosophy was introduced to me by the Executive Director, Helen Riley on the day I interviewed for a position at the school.  There was such passion in her voice and it appealed to me very much because I had spent most of my life putting children first.  My life had been dedicated to lovingly teaching children from my own two daughters to the thousands of students I had taught in dance classes over the years.  So, the feeling that I had found a place to continue this devotion of mine was welcome.   As the years have unfolded for me at St. Michaels, I have come to see that Helen Rileys passion is real and it is contagious.  It permeates the entire school from the faculty, the staff, the families and every visitor that comes to find out what St. Michaels is all about.  Mrs. Rileys lifelong dedication to improving the lives of little children has led a rally to bring equal opportunity to a quality education to thousands of children who might otherwise be left behind.  No one benefits more than our children!  I eagerly ask you to consider making St. Michaels School one of your 2012 Great Nonprofits.

Its visionary leaders combine compassion and concern for young children and families with a pursuit of excellence at all levels of services.

My wife and I were always very impressed with the manner in which our children were cared.  Many of the teachers at St. Michael's were my daughter's favorite people at that time, and we believe that those teachers cared for and about our children as if they were their own.  To this day, when I visit St. Michael's, many of those same teachers will always cheerfully ask how their girls are doing.

During that time, I have come to know St. Michael's as what our foundation considers THE model for state-of-the-art early child care and education .  We have also come to know Helen Riley, the school's leader for some 27 years, as an extremely effective leader and policy advocate around excellence in early care and educaiton.  In fact, over the past 27 years, the Jessie Ball duPont Fund has awarded $928,890 in grants to St. Michael's School in response to their excellent proposals and exceptional work on behalf of children, children who are most often the most disadvantaged children in Wilmington, Delaware.

This is a top notch program with a long (over 110 years) and illustrious history.
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	132606		/users/profile/178254	Mary Morton	Donor	5	11/02/2012	St. Michael's School and Nursery serves its community well. It encourages participation from fathers and mothers of all children as well as grandparents and community members. The children arrive with smiles, looking forward to a day of learning that might include study of a foreign language, computers, art with a local artist, and many other opportunities for learning. The new playground and the children's garden add to the wonderful day ahead.  As a donor, I am proud of te scholarship program which allows many children (most of the 200 + enrolled) to take advantage of this wonderful school and nursery. St. Michael's is relentless in its fundraising and uses the money received very well. It is a joy to be part of this wonderful program. 
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	132588		/users/profile/178237	rlwaibel	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2012	This school reaches out to the community and includes both the "haves" and the "have nots" with the same level of care and love.  My granddaughter attended the pre-school and is now in the third grade, but she still remembers her positive experience at St. Michael's.
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	132561		/users/profile/178208	jpme	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	I've volunteered for St. Michael's, and been a member of its Board of Directors, for several years. St. Michael's is a model program for early childhood education in Delaware. Its staff are highly qualified, well-trained individuals who care very deeply about the school, and most especially about its students and their families. Nearly 80% of St. Michael's students receive tuition support, demonstrating the extent to which the school serves the community.
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	132449		/users/profile/178087	imabiah	Client Served	5	11/01/2012	My youngest son attended St. Michael's from the time he was 6 months old until he entered kindergarten. I was also a parent liason to the board for a time. Our experience at St. Michael's was all good. The staff was consistently kind and attentive (especially Mr. Hendrix, who was wonderful!!!). The facility went through some improvements during our time and after, and it's top rate. Among my favourite qualities, though, is that St. Michael's serves a wide range of children from a wide range of ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds. Some pay full freight, some have vouchers, but ALL get the same excellent care and educational opportunities. I am proud to say that my son is an alumni!
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	132344		/users/profile/177976	susancass	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	I have been an active volunteer and board member at St. Michael's since 1995.  St. Michael's is a model program for early education in Delaware and our region.  St. Michael's is a real school. All our teachers have college degrees.  We have a campus that includes a beautiful library, a stage for performances, a state of the art playground, a cafeteria that provides healthful meals and snacks, a computer lab, and an indoor play area.  Our executive director, Helen Riley, is an inspired and creative educator.  We have a bi-lingual curriculum that starts in the baby rooms and goes through second grade.  Most importantly, our teachers and staff provide a loving and caring place for our children to learn and grow.  St. Michael's welcomes all children regardless of ability to pay.  There is no better place for your charity dollars than St. Michael's scholarship fund.
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	132339		/users/profile/177970	mjmommy	Client Served	5	11/01/2012	I have been a parent at St. Michael's for the past 3 years and I must say I am proud to say that my child attends St. Michael's. They are his family away from home. The teachers at the school are very caring and nurturing to the students and the staff members are very knowledgeable in the information pertaining to the school and activities in the community. When I drop my child off to school I know that I am dropping him off to a safe environment and an environment that I know my child will learn and grow. And picking him up is the best moment because he has a lot to talk about his day. They take the children on trips and they have activities to incorporate families together. This school is not just about getting their money, they are about their children learning and trying to help build families and also having fundraisers to reduce tuition. If it was anything that I would need to say to St. Michaels is thank you for everything that you have done for my son and I.
St. Michael's School and Nursery, Inc.	132282		/users/profile/177905	steve1952	Donor	5	11/01/2012	St. Michael's has been serving Wilmington's working families since the 1890's: it is the state's oldest child care facility. Today the school serves about 150 children, 80% of whom receive tuition assistance so that they can afford to attend. It is a pleasure for me to support St. Michael's with my donations because the school is very well managed, the faculty and staff are caring and accomplished people, and the kids there receive a great start in life.

She has been there several months.  Her first teacher (Ms. Duramus) was the reason I/we enrolled her there.  Sadly, she passed away.  However, her new teacher (Ms. Mariamh Diallo) is wonderful!

Now she has moved to another classroom and the teachers there (Ms. Saliou Djan Diallo , Ms. Saira Hernandez and Ms. Wanda Ramos-Flores) are also very good with her.  I can really say the staff at St. Michael's School and Nursey are all very nice.  Of course there's Ms. Finley who always greets you with a beautiful smile.

I went there as a child and many years later I sent my oldest daughter there.  It was wonderful seeing some of the familiar face that I seen when I was a child.  St. Michaels staff treated me and my daughter like family for the 5 years she was there.  So when I decided to have a 2nd child some 12 years later it was only natural to send her to St. Michaels for daycare.  At one point I was having personal issues in my life and St. Michaels proved me with support without judgment.  I feel secure dropping my daughter off every morning where I know she will get the best care possible.  Thanks you St. Michaels for all that you do for your students and their parents!

The administration and staff are friendly.  The curriculum for the daycare is varied and robust.  The children are introduced to and learn about a wide array of cultures while domestic traditions are also celebrated.  The administration has worked hard to ensure that the school's facilities are modern and clean (including very recently upgraded classroom equipment, bathrooms, HVAC and a brand new playground w/ a child-size synthetic turf soccer field).

In it's early years it was envisioned to help women have a better understanding of financial matters that traditionally we were not as exposed to as men, but the concept has grown and the classes are varied, geared to many levels and good for any gender.

They have an dedicated staff who produce a wide variety of fabulous financial education programs and events throughout the year for the entire State of Delaware.   The largest programs and perhaps most well known are the From Purses to Portfolios Program and The Money School.   "Purses" is financial education designed for women and The Money School offers almost 700 free financial education classes annually - both are wonderful resources that build up our community in such difficult economic times.  Check them out....www.dfli.org
Delaware Financial Literacy Institute	142043	1	/users/profile/188464	BlessedbG	Volunteer	5	11/22/2012	I have had the wonderful opportunity to attend the first financial literacy conference a few years ago and became 'hooked" on the life-changing experiences I have received as a result. I have learned so much about finances, budgeting, getting out of debt, savings, and credit repair, etc.  I am so amazed that there is an organization that truly cares about the financial health of our community and works tirelessly to provide the tools to guide you to financial success.  The program is administered through excellence under the leadership of Ronni Cohen and her talented staff.  The volunteer instructors donate their valuable time to share their expertise at no cost to the students who attend the excellent classes presented throughout the year. I am advocate for this great program, telling people wherever I go about the DFLI and the Money school classes.  My affliation with the agency, first as a student, then as a volunteer and advocate, has been life-changing.  My knowledge has increased about finances; I have experienced more joy as a volunteer: my own personal self-esteem has improved through the support and confidence I have gained from the program. Additionally, I have met new friends and had very positive experiences through DFLI and the Delaware Money School. Wonderful job, well deserving of recognition.  Meta McGhee
Delaware Financial Literacy Institute	141906		/users/profile/188315	VR35426	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/21/2012	I had the honor of working closely with this organization and was their "Executive on Loan" for a little over 2 years.  The Executive Director, Ronni Cohen, is one of the most hard working, caring, genuine, and professional women whom I have had the pleasure of meeting.  I am thankful to be able to call her a dear friend.  Her staff shares the same passion, enthusiasm, and dedication as Ronni.  Their signature program, From Purses to Portfolios, has grown to attract thousands of like-minded women (and men) to take control of their financial lives.  Because of this program, they now have a more financially stable future; even in these trying economic times.  The community who gets involved in their programs have the tools and resources to become more savvy in regard to their personal finances.  DFLI offers hundreds of FREE Financial Education classes which vary greatly and touch on many topics.  The diversity of their classes have helped many thousands of people, whether they are in the low to moderate income bracket, middle income, or upper income category.  They teach everything; basic budgeting and savings classes, estate planning, investing, couponing, and the list goes on and on.  DFLI holds events that are so well put together, organized, and cover various topics that are relevant to today's current economic conditions.  They have Money Clubs which bring people together to share success stories and ideas on how to save money, find deals, buckle down on nonessential shopping, and setting realistic savings goals as a group.  These groups encourage one another to make a plan and inspires them to stick to it.  I cannot say enough about this AMAZING organization who helps people improve their lives and gives them the support that they need to do so.  DFLI will forever be near and dear to my heart! 
Delaware Financial Literacy Institute	141866		/users/profile/188267	GailChick	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	For over 15 years the citizens of Delaware have enjoyed the resource of The Delaware Money School, a unique program in itself.    However, DFLI, proud parent of The Money School,  never "sits on it's laurels" -- the staff looks and listens for opportunities to assist.  Ideas from the community are welcome. Once identifying the need, a solution is actively sought.   The diversity of programs created over the years attest to this; bank at school, youth entreprenuers, financial literacy programs within the prison population, Purses to Portfolios, Money Clubs and the list goes on.  This is an excellent non-profit with a strong board and a creative and dedicated staff!

Through the Delaware Money, 100s of free classes in topics from basic budgeting to investing, savings to the stock market are offered. I've been taking Money School classes since 2008, and I've benefited enormously. I am wiser about my finances, I track my spending and have increased my savings, and I've taken a more active interest in my retirement account as offered by my work place. The staff at DFLI work tirelessly to provide useful programs, advice and support for people across the financial spectrum. I've met such a great bunch of like-minded people, serious about getting serious about their finances, whether that was a baby emergency fund, a vast stock portfolio or anything in between.  No one is out of place at a Money School class, so long as you are breathing and have an interested in improving your financial life.

By using leaders with expertise in each aspect of financial management, we can gain the knowledge to lead more satisfying and fulfilling lives. It's my philosophy that most domestic arguments are about money. When we learn to manage our money better, then we are happier people with much less stress in our lives. It is a great accomplishment to see your debt decrease and your savings increase. That is the goal of this organization. They hold informative, educational and inspiring classes and conferences and they keep expanding their programs with great ideas for the future. I have learned a lot from the classes I have attended and I appreciate all the hard work the staff invests in making this happen.

When I realized that I was not managing my finances enough to pay all the bills each month, I decided to ask for help.  DFLI answered my call.  My particular situation was because of underemployment, but I met people in my classes with different situations representing a diverse population of DE.  The class was positive and encouraging experience that gave me the skills to manage the money I earn, pay my bills every month and get out of debt!  I began to take more of the various Money School classes that are offered all over the State of DE.  DFLI is providing a valuable service to the citizens of DE.  The easy to enroll online system, friendly instructors, free cost and self enrichment are the reasons I continue to support DFLI six years later.

My children attend and have attended the 5 star, NAEYC accredited pre-school, participate in the Kids Place after school and Kids Club programs, attend summer camp, participate in summer and winter swim teams.  The coaches are fantastic.  My daughters favorite camp activity this summer was the high and low ropes courses. I never have to wait for equipment in the state of the art fitness center and there is always room in the group fitness classes.  Im looking forward to working with a personal trainer this fall.  As a family we enjoy the indoor and outdoor pools, Sunday Fun Day in the gymnasium, and many social events throughout the year. The 32 acre family campus has a multiple-purpose 1/2 mile out door track, sand volleyball courts, tennis courts, high & low ropes courses, an outdoor amphitheater, out door pool, baseball diamond and sports fields.  There is so much to do. The Siegel JCC offers programming for children, adults and seniors.   There are so many great volunteer opportunities as well.  Fantastic staff. Fantastic place.

The Bernard And Ruth Siegel Jewish Community Center Of Delaware Inc	253379		/users/profile/341563	sarahba	Former staff	5	08/19/2015	The JCC has been central to our family's life in Wilmington for the last 25 years.  Both of my sons were cared for, lovingly, in their Early Childhood Center and camps, participating in sports and various activities throughout their childhood and teens.  Even now, when they return to Wilmington, the J is one of the first places they head to for pick-up games with old friends.  For me the J has been the place where I began my path to physical fitness, taking full advantage of their personal training back in the 90s.  Now I thoroughly enjoy the state of the art fitness center, swimming pool and outdoor campus which has the advantage of being adjacent to a state park.  Most important to me, however, has been the opportunity the J gave me to grow personally as a volunteer.  I developed valuable career skills doing work I wouldn't have been exposed in to my professional career.  I also had a chance to observe and actively participate in the JCC's outstanding governance with a group of committed lay leaders.  Having served on a number of boards, my observation is that the JCC is among the best - focused, strategic, forward thinking, and very well run.  My current role is general member, but I have also been an employee, as well as a volunteer, a board member, and a past president.  I've seen it all, and I give them 5 stars.

Our Early Childhood Center is one of the top rated in the state, and we are expanding its capacity so serve our young parents needs even more.  We continue to improve our Camp with great programs and challenging facilities like a new ropes course.  Our Senior Center engages with diversified programing experiences and road trips.  We continue to invest significantly in new exercise equipment and expanded fitness class hours,  making our fitness center the place to be to work out, and enjoy a post-workout cool-down schmooze. Our walls welcome members and guests with displays of beautiful art. Our building and grounds host community events, engaging speakers and educational forums, and we host the best attended five mile race in the tri-state area.  And if our members want to enjoy our beautiful campus while taking a break from everything going on in our indoor facilities or outdoor pool, they can now stroll or run our brand new J-Loop --  a half-mile paved path circling our athletic fields.   The JCC  is the place to be as a community, and we want that to continue and expand.  After all, it is the people that make the Siegel JCC something special.  We have enthusiastic members from all walks of the community, dedicated volunteers, devoted staff, and generous donors.

I work with families who are caring for a loved one who is dying. They sometimes have the additional burden of being unable to pay the rent, an electric bill, of having a broken a/c unit or simply being unable to put groceries on the table. I can part the clouds for a brief moment for these families by contacting Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation. Rozie and her staff live up to their name...they are compassionate and quickly send the financial relief my families need. These families get not only the financial help they need, they also feel that sometimes, when things seem to be going all wrong, complete strangers can help restore hope.Mamie Keller, LMSW

One particular case stands out in my memory & I am grateful for the assistance provided by Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation (CCHF). Using comfort fund accounts, we were able to fulfill a dying mother's wish to provide an unforgettable 3rd birthday party for her son. We also provided her son with a stuffed Courage Lion from a bereavement program developed by CCHF & dressed it in a shirt with a picture of him and his mom.

Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation	214936		/users/profile/278260	tflores	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/13/2014	I am a Clinical Social Worker with Compassionate Care Hospice.  I have the privilege of working  in the Lakeland, FL office currently and previously worked in the Parsippany, NJ office.  Not often when you give to a charity do you know exactly where it goes, one hopes it is given to whom it is promised.  This is not the case with the Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation:  I see with my own eyes where the money is going and hear the joy and gratitude in the voices of patients and their families.  Just in the last  month they have paid the rent for 3 of my struggling families.   Summer is a very tough time in Florida with high electric bills,  in the last 2 months 6 of my patients have had their electric bill paid when it was about to be turned off. The foundation has provided just in the last month 3 Walmart gift cards for food and 1 for school clothes for  my families.  When I worked in NJ a memorable moment was when a 29 year old AIDS patient had to move into his mothers home.  The only room the hospital bed would fit in was not properly wired since the house was very old.  The Foundation quickly wired the room so that this young patient could spend his last moments in his comfortable hospital bed.  As the LCSW working with my families I get the hugs, tears thanks and blessing from the families for taking some of the financial pressure off during difficult times.  Truly I am merely the messenger getting to work with a fabulous organization where I see weekly where our contributions go.  Tonya Flores LCSW

When I was in the Social Worker role, Compassionate Care Foundation helped a family buy a dryer so the daughter did not have to hang the clothes out on a line outside.  The daughter was so happy that she now had a dryer to dry their clothes, and she could now spend more time with her mother who was a patient on our services.  The daughter could not thank CCH enough for the dryer.  As a Bereavement Coordinator, the Foundation helped a family pay their rent, because they had paid the money they had for the rent towards the patients cremation cost and service. The family told me if it was not for CCH Foundation's help they would have lost their home.   The Foundation has been their to help our patients and families, and without the Foundation's generosity our patients and families would have had to carry more stress then they were already feeling.  The Foundation is such a blessing for our patients, families, and Bereavement survivors. 
Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation	183049		/users/profile/239949	Jeff Slater	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2013	As a professional Hospice Social Worker, it is difficult to find the words to describe how important and valuable  the services Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation (CCHF) are, this is largely due to the positive emotional effect experienced by both the dying patients and their families. This organization has left an indelible mark on thousands of human beings. There are many people who have had their dying concerns eased simply through having the chance to see a distant loved one or having the financial stresses of the family eased. The significance of this nonprofit can not simply equate to dollars. There is a human element that can not be measured and the services provided by CCHF have demonstrated an organization that is willing and knows the importance of thinking critically and is motivated to  personalize the assistance offered to dying patients and their families. Tickets have been bought  for children so that they could spend last moments with family members and patients able to travel to their country of origin have had CCHF's compassionate understanding so that they could be buried on their native soil. One of the invaluable outcomes of CCHF's involvement is experienced by the elderly survivor of expired patients. Paying one months rent for someone who has  been financially dependent upon their significant other's income sometimes for over 50 years has been a godsend for people living close to the poverty line and a check away from homelessness.  Lastly, the look of gratitude and appreciation  patients and their families positively affected by the efforts of CCH helps to make a difficult job that much more rewarding. 
Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation	181391		/users/profile/238115	hbgsw	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2013	Being terminally ill evokes many difficult emotions and worries for patients and their loved ones. Financial hardship, loss of independence and concern about having to leave the comfort of home are major stressors. I have witnessed how the CCH Foundation has relieved these worries and allowed patients to remain at home by providing financial assistance for emergency response systems and household expenses so that loved ones could take time off work to provide care and not worry about falling behind on basic costs of living. The Foundation has also granted some special requests, specifically focused on enhancing quality of life when life is coming to an end. Hospice care focuses on comfort, and the Foundation takes it a step further by providing financial assistance to help patients enjoy the comfort of home when facing the end of life.
Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation	177479		/users/profile/234039	tonybolden	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/14/2013	As the director for a community hospice in South Jersey I have had the opportunity to see how the Compassionate Care Hospice foundation has helped numerous hospice patients and their family's. Although I am often not able to directly see the impact of there wonderful support, I am able to experience it through our hospice team who care for our fragile patients and family's. Every day the CCHF does so many of the things you may expect a foundation to assist with: payment of rent, utilities or even an air conditioner during one of our many heat waves. But it is the ways in which the foundation goes above and beyond which really makes there mark for our patients and family's.  It may include things some of us would take for granted like arranging transportation so a patient can enjoy a professional baseball game, or something much more significant and meaningful such as honoring a patients last wish to return to their native country. 
Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation	172931		/users/profile/228932	stevenrk52	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/02/2013	This past summer a 93 year old woman sat in her apartment where the temperatures fluctuated between 90 and 100 degrees many days. She did not complain. She asked for nothing. As a medical social worker charged with the responsibility of helping those with little resources left, I contacted CCHF.  Many patients are near life's end and very uncomfortable. Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation ensured an air conditioner would be delivered to her apartment. They made this woman believe in Santa again!! Her eyes lit up when the cool air made living less uncomfortable. She was so happy, so grateful. Simple things we all take for granted become special gifts to those who need a break at the time of their life when only days remain. Rozie and the staff at CCHF  are special and many of us truly believe that at nights end they do not need cars to go home. They have wings because they are ANGELS....so special and so helpful. God Bless Them
Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation	172575		/users/profile/228503	jessicathreadgill2010	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2013	Working as a social worker in any field, you know how challenging it can be to find resources for families in need.  The Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation is such a valuable resource, as they are able to help so many of the families with which we come into contact.  So often, the assistance that is awarded contributes greatly to our patient quality of life and helps maintain many of these patients in their homes.  I am extremely thankful to have access to such a wonderful resource to help meet the needs of our patients that cannot be met in their immediate community.  Thank you Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation!!!

The crew at the Foundation have helped with some extraordinary situations....like the young girl who lost both her father and step-father in the same year....the Foundation came through with Summer Camp money AND rent for she and her Mom snd School Clothing cash!!!Or the lady who was living with her husband and able to "Just Make" all of her expenses....The Foundation came through with monthly expenses so that there was cash for the couple to enjoy the patient's last Christmas with their first Grandchild for her first Christmas...the baby and her mom needed to drive through So Carolina to Penna and needed cash to get there....Or the young couple who was behind on mortgage and utilities and property taxes because our pt (age 42) could not work and her husband lost his job because of needing to care for his wife. The husband spent the pt's last month taking care of her at home and didn't need to worry about how he would get through.....

Rozie & staff are kind, understanding, patient & resourceful when it comes to meeting the needs of the patients. It's a relief to know an organization such as this is available to help at such a crucial time in one's life.
Compassionate Care Hospice Foundation	138820	1	/users/profile/184903	pheiland1	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	The Foundation has help countless terminally ill patients and their families with basis life needs such as rent or mortgage payment, utility payments, home repairs related to patient and family safety, helping patients accomplish that "one last thing" that they otherwise could not do. As a Board member and a Hospice Program Director I see first hand where every donated dollar goes and, believe me, every dollar makes an incredible difference in the lives of patients and their caregivers. Almost all my staff donated to the Foundation through payroll deduction because, they to see the results of Foundation help first hand. Patricia Heiland

I do not know how this world was getting along before SEE came into existence and they opened my eyes to what an education really is. Helping children, by providing the most basic of tools that we take for granted every single day, is something truly amazing and special. We as Americans take even basic notebook paper for granted and throw away so much. By working with local schools here in the US, SEE is teaching kids how they can positively impact the world around them, reducing the waste of partially used school supplies and providing a brighter future for children in developing nations.

Neighbors Sharing with Neighbors in Crisis	88005		/users/profile/98837	Marty	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	 I called Adopt A Family and they were able to assist a client of mine who was new mother with no income enough baby items to get the baby set up in a new home.   Prior to receiving a crib the infant was sleeping in a single bed with the mother.In addition to that particular client they have assisted many children with Christmas gifts and gift cards.  Those children would not have received any gifts if it had not been for their Christmas program.They  also assist many, many children wth school supplies.It always amazes me how through the years they are able to keep track of families they have assisted so they do not assist the same familes year after year.
Neighbors Sharing with Neighbors in Crisis	87996		/users/profile/98826	ciookie	Client Served	5	04/29/2011	Hello, I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the Adopt A Family programs.  My sister moved to Delaware last year.  she had 2 daughters Sarah and Savanna.  She also had My 2 brothers Micheal and Cody.  Their ages ranged from 3 to 16.  She had had my brother sense 2004.  My parents had both died.  They passed 8 months and 2 days apart.  My sister only received social security for the boys.  Her husband, at the time would not help her.  I help as much as possible, but with the economy could not do it alone.  I took her to adopt a family.  The staff especially Ms. Banning was so helpful and understandable.  They help her with both the boys school supplies.  The boys got everything needed to start school her.  They felt good when they went to school.  No one knew the help received from adopt a family.  Adopt a family also helped my sister with items for her home.  The support  from adopt a family was and is outstanding.  I am so thankful for this program and support it 100%.  I also volunteered one year at Christmas.  It was December 24 and a young man came in, he was so upset because he had no income, had lost his job, and had no money to get his daughter anything.  Ms. Banning quickly got to work and assisted the young man with some toys for his daughter.  The young man was so grateful to her.  Adopt a family helps parents and children all over Delaware who would not be able to buy gift for their children or even have a Christmas dinner.  Christmas is a time for caring  and sharing.  I hope to see this program continue to support our neighbor hood and other areas of the state.  Thank you so very much for all you have done and continue to do.  Barbara Lister (302) 424-0568

I have seen first hand the difference Adopt a Family makes in the lives of our clients.  Adopt a family gives school assistance to needy children who would not have any supplies to start school with.  The also provide assistance during the holidays to children and families who would hav NO gifts for their children and some who can't afford to buy much for their families at Christmas.  I deeply appreciate all of the great work they do, the are a worthy organization and they deserve any and all help that can be provided to them.

They have served some of my clients with Christmas items, household items and school supplies which have been a blessing to all involved.Adopt A Family is very careful to match families with donors/vendors who do the best they can to meet the families personal needs.With the school supply program they make sure that they have the list from the schools and  teachers personal classroom request so once a child knows which class they are assigned to will get the appropriate materials and no be given a bunch of supplies that they will not use or need. This avoids waste of materials  It has been a definate plus having this agency to deal with through the years.

Pets Enriching Troops Association	313717	4	/users/profile/405072	smw520	Client Served	5	10/24/2016	Our daughter obtained her Service Dog just two weeks prior to our move to the Air Force base in the UK.  She had waited for this dog for 22 months and now Sophia was trained and ready to meet her new owner.  Our daughter struggles with seizures, autistic spectrum disorder and learning disability.  She is easily overwhelmed in social situations and becomes very anxious.  We had no doubt that Sophia would help change her life.  But we had moved thousands of miles away from Sophia's trainers.  While our daughter quickly bonded with her dog, she had not developed the confidence needed to handle Sophia to her benefit.  To our great good fortune, Pets Enriching Troops stepped-in.  Our need was not to train Sophia; she had been in training since a pup!  What we urgently needed was for our daughter to receive help learning how to work with Sophia.  PET classes have greatly boosted our daughter's confidence, given her a sense of belonging in a new country, and teach her something specifically practical for her individual needs every week.  The before and after changes for our daughter are difficult to describe in a brief review.  Her Service Dog has been a blessing  and our daughter's capacity for independence has dramatically increased.  The most important point to be made is that without PET support and coaching, our daughter would not be able to take advantage of her Service Dog's advanced training.  The gentle, individualized, encouraging instruction by PET Trainers is priceless.  My husband and I have no doubt that our daughter will remember her PET friends for the rest of her life.  We have no doubt that her PET friends have helped set her on a course with Sophia that will be a joy to follow.

He was only 3 years old and died on my birthday. It was a HUGE shock. I have been so incredibly sad and devastated. I moved to the UK with only half my heart. But my dreams of having a therapy dog to take to nursing homes and hospitals didn't die when he did. So in my grief I sought P.E.T. out and became a volunteer. Interacting with P.E.T and seeing the therapy dogs at work has truly made me happy and has brightened my life. P.E.T., I cannot thank you enough for mending my broken little heart.

My dog and I have thoroughly enjoyed attending the obedience classes offered by PET for several months now.  We've learnt lots and had buckets of fun along the way. We've recently joined their PET Me team and are excited to take the next step and become a certified therapy dog team.The PET team consists of wonderful people committed to offering quality services to their local community. They deserve a 5+ star rating!

Literacy Delaware	319374		/users/profile/410821	Jack Winn	Volunteer	5	11/22/2016	I have been a volunteer ESL tutor for this organization for about 16 years and it has been one of the most rewarding experiences in my life. Teaching English to adult learners who are so in need of better language skills has helped give me a much greater appreciation of how difficult it is for people who have taken the unbelievably brave step of leaving behind their native cultures to try and make a better life for themselves and their families. I have come to know so many of their life stories and have learned from them at least as much as I have taught them. I have helped mothers and fathers gain the confidence and courage to connect to their new communities with a better knowledge of our language. It is a huge step, for so many of them, to be able to make an appointment with a doctor or dentist, to be able to help their children do their homework, to attend an open house at their kid's school and speak to the teacher. To help teach basic things which most of us take for granted like not being afraid to ask directions from a stranger or to ask an employee at some business for help in finding an item or getting some kind of service. It is such a wonderful feeling to hear that one of my students can now bargain for a price or for a raise in their wages or to ask for extra instruction at their work so they can advance to a higher paid position. Helping others to be able to help themselves is a thing that one cannot put a price on and by passing along our compassion and love, we make ourselves better people as well. Literacy Delaware has enabled me to do truly meaningful work in my life and I tell everyone I know that it is one of the most soul fulfilling experiences of my life. The employees and other volunteers who I have met in this organization are some of the most caring and giving people who I have ever met and I am so proud to be associated with them.
Literacy Delaware	319351		/users/profile/410791	Barbara283	Volunteer	4	11/22/2016	I have been with Literacy Delaware for two years now, working with the same student. We have seen plenty of progress and have gone through a lot together. Literacy Delaware has expanded their reach to cover the entire state of Delaware now and are working hard to reach as many people as possible.

Literacy Delaware	319341		/users/profile/410775	LVSA32	Volunteer	5	11/22/2016	Literacy Delaware provides an important service to those wishing to improve their English and adults who want to complete a GED degree. Both efforts, enable these members of our community to find and improve their employment options, support the education of their children and more fully participate in civic life. On a personal level, students gain confidence and form friendships.  Learning about their cultures and answering questions about  life in the US is enriching to me as an instructor.  I'm happy and proud to serve Literacy Delaware. 
Literacy Delaware	319331		/users/profile/410753	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/22/2016	I have volunteered with Literacy Delaware for about 15 years.   My students have been both basic readers and English second language.  My current student is about to be interviewed for her citizenship.The staff is there to help the student succeed through the teacher.  There is ongoing training that enables the teachers to keep up-to-date on the latest techniques.  They are only a telephone call or email away.The students are tested periodically to ensure that they are moving along on grade level.  All of the students with whom I have worked love the program and often tell their friends about it.  To summarize, this is a group that helps many and makes their lives more productive.

Literacy Delaware	286853		/users/profile/376924	Susan_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Holding the Keys to LiteracyIn 1992, I was a VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) Volunteer in Wilmington, Delaware. I was assigned to the Literacy Volunteers of America office, where I recruited adult literacy tutors and adult learners. I assessed adults who needed help with basic literacy and English as a Second Language skills.   I recruited and assessed in the community at large and in the men and women's prisons in Wilmington, a city that has recently been dubbed, 'Murder Town'. I took on this assignment, at a time when I was uncertain of my own path, as I entered into adulthood. It was through my many gritty, heartbreaking and inspiring experiences that I committed myself to the teaching profession. It was here I realized that I felt 'called' to teach reading to children. I am committed to helping kids, who are emergent readers. Trouble shooting learning differences and figuring out ways to teach and learn, so that every one of my students is successful, is imperative. I strive to develop inspiring, hands-on lessons that will capture a child's imagination and breed success. READING, is the key to employment. Working with so many adults who were  experiencing unemployment, under employment, incarceration and recidivism due to the fact that they could not read. I am now in my eleventh year as an elementary school teacher...who helps to give the gift of reading to children, everyday.
Changing Fates Equine Rescue of Delware, Inc.	96768	2	/users/profile/113044	kim_antion	Donor	5	08/28/2011	I have moved to DE in 2005, and  became aware of Whimsical Equine Rescue shortly after I moved here, I met with Karen and explained to her that I was interested in Adopting a horse. Karen was so nice explained how the adoption program worked and explained to me it was not as easy as just picking out a horse. Over the next 6 months of visiting Whimsical Equine and getting to know HotShot Dancer along with all of the other wonderful horses that they had looking for homes, Karen had me meet Lisa, at that point they came to my home and made sure that not only did I have enough room, but I had the proper fencing and proper shelter, I loved that they just did not allow me to adopt a horse but they cared so much about HotShot Dancer that they wanted to make sure that he was going to a good home, Well HotShot Dancer has been with me since 2007, and I hope to be able to bring more to my home. Whimsical Equine Rescue are not just a Rescue, They love each and every animal that  comes to them, and they are very cautious and very thorough about who is lucky enough to adopt one of their precious Horses.
Changing Fates Equine Rescue of Delware, Inc.	96551		/users/profile/112713	ldemitryfancy	Client Served	5	08/25/2011	My name is Laurie Demitry and I started a non-profit with my daughter called Nova Therapy Minis www.novatm.org/  We adopt rescued abused/neglected miniature horses and train them to be therapy horses.  Two of our three miniature horses came from Whimsical Equine Rescue.  At my age,  I believe I have what one would call a seasoned perspective and there's not a lot that really impresses me.  Whimsical Equine impressed me or the women that run Whimsical Equine impressed me.  in truth, I have a daughter I would love to have exposed to them on a regular basis if I were only closer.  They are committed, unselfish,  caring and incredibly hard working.   The facilities were immaculate and as a horse owner myself, I know how much work goes into that kind of standard of care.  On another note, we adopted one mini and then went back for his half brother.  They are the backbone of our program and are adored wherever they go.   Rescue work is physically and emotionally exhausting and Whimsical Equine is an example of the best of rescue.  I hope that knowing two of their rescues are bringing great joy to everyone they interact with brings them joy as well.  Definitely a GREAT non-profit!!  Laurie Demitry, www.novatm.org/

Any time I get a plea for a horse, I always email Whimsical.  They may not always be able, at that time, to take the horse but they are always there to help, whether it be in aiding the owner in resolving a problem which allows him to keep his horse(s) or to assist with finding placement with another rescue.

They advised us of a great older Arabian mare named Ariea. My family went to visit. The staff was amazingly helpful, friendly, and compassionate. They are very knowledgeable about their animals.  We adopted Ariea months ago from Whimsical.  Ariea has been wonderful with my children, great with other animals, intelligent, great on trails, and has been one of the best horses I've ever owned. We had a great experience with the agency. There needs to be more adoption agencies out there like Whimsical!

He has been a great horse for our family and has helped my daughter win many blue ribbons. Whimsical was very up front with us about the horse before we adopted him...what they believed his strengths and weaknesses were. We couldn't be more pleased with our relationship with Whimsical. They have remained connected to us, always available with help and advice. I LOVE that they retain ownership of the horse, ensuring that the horse will always be cared for. They also must ok where the horse is kept. This gives us a sense that there are people besides us who care about how our horse is treated.  We were novices in horse ownership and Whimsical Equine Rescue guided us and we still now that their expertise is available to us if we need  it.

I came across Whimsical Equine on the internet through their ads in The Guide.  My first phone call got me.  I spoke with Karen and she was so friendly and helpful with what I was looking for that the up coming weekend I went to meet them.  I actually went to meet Arthur but met Missy as well.  Through the following 4 months I came and went as much as poss. to visit Missy.  Logan falling in love more and more each time.  Logan and I talked all of the time about Missy becoming part of our family.  But me being the protective Aunt I wanted to make sure I made the right decision.  Who would have thought Logan being a real beginner would have a 20+ yr old standardbred mare as her 1st horse. Missy is the best.  She and Logan are a real pair.  And she and my gelding are glued at the hip.  Thank You So Much Karen for your time and patience with us.  Whimsical is a wonderful facility.  They care and recondition horses to find their forever homes.
Changing Fates Equine Rescue of Delware, Inc.	47935	6	/users/profile/48766	robinw	Volunteer	5	07/08/2010	I have been volunteering at Whimsical Equine Rescue, Inc. since May 2009.  In that short time I have seen volunteers come and go and I have seen horses come and go.  I have seen Karen and Lisa make themselves sick trying to care for all of them.  I have continuously tried to find ways that I could help because I truly believe in what they are doing.  These animals are part of Americas history.  We used them to work our farms before the machines took over.  They run at our race tracks and make money for their owners, just to be tossed aside when they can no longer run.  Some owners do care enough to see that they end up in places like Whimsical where they can find good homes.  Some just send them to auction and the animals ends up who knows where.  Whimsicals biggest need is for money. I know everybody asks for money.  I always have the same reaction you and everybody else.  Back in October I saw the horses brought in due to neglect and abused.  The horses were so malnourish, it broke my heart.  With hard work and a lot of money they are almost ready to find their new homes where they will get the respect and love they deserve.  What does Whimsical get out of this?  Just the warm fuzzy feeling knowing they helped make it happen.  These horses are receiving a second chance at a happy healthy life they deserve.  I work a full time job and have a family to care for.  I put in the time and financial support I can and I am proud to have just a small part in helping. I orginally wrote that story for the March 2010 Whimsical newsletter.  Since that time I was asked to become a board member.  Naturally, I said yes even though my only reward is that warm fuzzy feeling of doing what's right.
Clothing Our Kids	317892		/users/profile/409019	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/01/2016	I volunteered on a Sussex County elementary school for six years and heard sad stories about children who only had one set of clothes or a pair of shoes that were falling apart. I've seen them grow because there is such a huge need and the woman who started COK is so passionate about helping these children. She is tireless! COK now works directly with school nurses to make sure these children are given clothes.

Clothing our kids is all volunteer, and has grown exponentially since Mary Rio began the effort in her home distributing second hand clothing five years ago.  What these children did before, I don't know!  Thanks to all our sponsors and corporate donors we now distribute mostly new clothes to children who otherwise have nothing.

The head tier of the agency keep bringing in more animals and when you have to make new pkaces to put more animals, you are overcrowded and need to learn other ways to help those animals.  Being overcrowded us not safe or healthy for any of them.  I know they want to help all, but there are limits that have to be set and adhered to.

Connections Community Support Programs Inc	285288		/users/profile/375269	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/08/2016	My name is Crystal and I started with Dress for Success Program years ago.  My first encounter with the organization blows my mind.  I was in a bad relationship, bad job and thought of nothing better for myself.  Until one day I was invited to attend one of the Saturday meetings and from that day on my life was changed.  They taught me how to take seven pieces of clothing and make outfits for a week.  I loved this, especially since I didn't have very many clothing to wear.  They taught me how to do resumes and how to do successful interviews.  My first practice interview went well.  Before going to my interview the instructor had given me some good advice.  She suggested to me, in doing my interview ask the interviewer to share a personal story about her in the work place and I did just that.  At the end of the interview she told me I did a great job and it was her pleasure to talk with me.  I then said to her in a laughing way," If this was a real interview would you hire me?" and she said "Yes."  I then said, "Are you guys hiring? And she said, "Yes, I said, Will you hire me?  And she said," YES."  I was hired as a full-time bank teller.  I now reside in Atlanta, GA and was once again invited to attend a Saturday Dress for Success (DFS) meeting.  I 'm now a part of the Processional Womens Group (PWG), and giving back to women and I just wanted to say, Thank you. 
Connections Community Support Programs Inc	45948	1	/users/profile/46821	bonniesil	Board Member	5	06/26/2010	I recently joined the board of Connections because of my interest in the work that they are doing and the positive impact that they have on our community. They work with a very vulnerable and underserved population, and they meet both the spiritual and physical needs of their clients. I have been impressed by the way that the very hardworking, caring, and dedicated staff members treat their clients with dignity and respect. Connections not only provides food, shelter, and support to its clients but helps them to become productive members of our community through the Connect to Work program in which clients who have barriers to employment are trained to get and keep a job. Connection provides employment both directly through the establishment of its own businesses and indirectly through contact with the community at large.

Connections opens its doors on Sunday for anyone to get some shelter and something to eat and drink. I think it is wonderful for the people with no where to go to have a safe place to go and get a little rest and whatever else is available for that day. Rochelle is always pleasant and friendly to all the clients and they give her respect because she gives them respect when o often others do not.

Connections Community Support Programs Inc	23405	10	/users/profile/24499	Connectionsbeliever	Volunteer	5	12/04/2009	Over the many years that we have been involved with Connections, I have had the oppotunity to see first-hand the numerous lives this organization touches, and the difference it makes in those lives. From help for the homeless to substance abuse treatment and rehabilitaion programs, to housing programs for low-income families and shelters for at- risk women, this organization does it all. Their selfless and tireless staff has a genuine caring for the people they serve that is evident from the first moment you meet them. To them, what they do it isn't a job, but a calling to take on the responsibility of caring for the less fortnuate among us. Recently, our staff volunteered at an event held at one of Connections locations. There, Thanksgiving dinner was served to more 350 people who otherwise may not have had one. Maybe not uncommon at first glance, but the operative word here is SERVED. This was not the usual cafeteria style meal served in other (worthy) kitchens. These folks were seated at their tables and waited-on by the Connections and volunteer staff as any one of us would be at our favorite restaurant. We could see that this special treatment alone was uplifting for many of those who dined at Connections that day. Folks who likely never have an oppotunity to go out to eat, were treated like we would expect to be treated at the best place in town. Connections staff prepared dozens of turkeys, with all of the trimmings - nothing spared. It was first-class treatment all the way. It's this willingness to go the extra mile to truly make a differnce in the lives of the people in their community that differentiates Connections.

Claymore Senior Center Inc	196519	6	/users/profile/256865	SteveC536	Client Served	5	03/26/2014	This is one of my first reviews on-line. I just wanted to thank the members and staff at Claymore Senior Center for making my experience there so enjoyable. It was suggested to me by a friend that I give Claymore a try and wasn't disappointed. With the recent loss of my wife, it has been hard to get back into things. Claymore has been a nice diversion for me...especially the Wii bowling on Thursdays. Thank you again!
Claymore Senior Center Inc	125357	8	/users/profile/170529	Joe_11	Client Served	1	10/14/2012	The Direcor, Donna, is incompetent and lacks the education and experience to be in the posiiton she is in. She brings all her personal problems to work and is ALWAY on the phone regarding them. You cannot speak with her. She also seems "out of sorts" at times. Makes me wonder what problems there might be. I left, too much drama and gossip. The Board should replace her. The centers and seniors deserve better, and not a bunch of dysfunctional craziness from Donna.
Claymore Senior Center Inc	117595	7	/users/profile/159871	Catherine T.	Client Served	1	07/03/2012	This place has potential, but they need to replace the Director, Donna. I was a former member there, and got tired of the gossip, drama, and just plain crazy atmosphere that seems to come from the Director, Donna. It appeared to me, and this is my opinion, that she was more concerned with her personal affairs than with the Center. The staff is nice, but high turnover due to difficulty working with Donna. Hopefully, the Board will take notice and make some much needed changes. I am currently happy at Mid-County, but would return if they replaced the current Director.
Claymore Senior Center Inc	111613	7	/users/profile/151978	Todd9	General Member of the Public	1	05/09/2012	Don`t waste your time at Claymore, Rude Director Mary H2012-04-06 I toured the Claymore Senior center as I was interested in some of the programs they had to offer. I could not have been more disappointed. I found the Director, I think her name was Donna, rude and completely disinterested in myself as a prospective member. If she is going to deal with the public, she really should work on her people skills. Also I thought this was an active Senior Center not a nursing home.It seems they treat the members like small children. Again, I mainly interacted with the Director. The cleanliness of the facility also left a lot to be desired. Needless to say this one is off my list, mainly becuase of the rudeness of the Director Her rudeness, incompetence, and indifference were really disturbing. She is NOT a very nice person Pros: None Cons: Rude Director, Dirty Facility, Limited Staff, Nursing Home Atmosphere

I know that this charity started out of a desire to honor the memory of Debbie Sipple and her love for animals, but Debbie's Fund has worked hard to establish the structure and integrity required for lasting strength and growth.  Debbie's Fund fulfills a unique role in building bridges among animal support donors and clients.  They manage their funds well and are an all-volunteer organization.  And they need more volunteers!!!  
DEBRA L SIPPLE MEMORIAL INC (Debbie's Fund)	44595	9	/users/profile/38221	debbiesfund	Board Member	5	06/19/2010	We started Debra L. Sipple Memorial Inc. in 2004 following Debbie's death. We currently support 7 local groups with grants including the Kent County SPCA (Delaware). Our philosophy is to raise money in ways that do not compete directly with the groups we help. We have the PAR FOR PETS GOLF OUTING and the WHEELS AND WINE CAR SHOW among other fund raisers each year. Long term we hope to develop an endowment that will provide an income to be used for a variety of animal related causes. Our greatest need, besides funding, is to expand the number of volunteers and event managers.Website: www.debbiesfund.com

Jewish Family Services Of Delaware Inc	147552		/users/profile/195150	Dawn Edgar	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/02/2013	My father is infamous for imparting words of knowledge for self-improvement. It is customary for him to make comments such as first impressions are everything to further his attempt to remind me that I must always put my best foot forward in every situation in order to assist others. JFS is no different! I came to this agency as a student intern in the counseling department and like many such as myself who deeply believe in the values of this agency and learned of the many ways in which to serve, I made the decision to take on additional roles to be of assistance to mankind. Simply put, JFS continues to put their best foot forward assisting people of various creeds and backgrounds.  I am particularly impressed with the many services rendered in attempts to wrap around their clients and their families identified within the community. Being that the hands of time are quickly moving in the direction of multimedia, JFS continues to follow the trends by making their presence known through media vehicles such as Facebook, engaging young adults in programs such as Future Net and Media Matters.  Therefore, I am strongly convinced that this agency will continue to grow and serve the community making first impressions while placing their best foot forward.

I know of one client, and older gentleman who was having trouble making ends meet. After several dead-end phonecalls  with other organizations, he connected with a Care Manager at JFS. The CM connected him with resources that same day - sending him home from the office with a bag full of food from the JFS food closet, helping him sign up for Meals on Wheels, and assisting him in applying for entitlements. This is just one of the many lives that JFS has changed.

It was our first experience volunteering for such an organization and I must say, we are all impressed.  We are amazed on how many families  this organization assists - not only with food but with domestic needs, housing, etc.  In addition, I am impressed with the professional manner the organization is managed, how the operation is run and more impressed with the caliper of people who also provide their time to help others who need assistance to get through life's difficult times.   We always find it a rewarding experience contributing to assist others from our community as well as being a part of the Family which make Christ Sevants Mission so special.

He talked about how Kind to Kids impacts the lives of children in need. It was so inspirational! A packed house and sold out event - I was in tears as I met the former foster teen who overcame many hurdles and is now attending college with a major in criminal justice. So amazing how our children can succeed when given the proper resources. Thank you Kind to Kids - you have my strong support!!

It is a place where every single student is welcome by the buoyant genius Rabbi Sneiderman and his amazing super-woman of a wife Roni. Without them, I can confidently say I would have been lost. College is a tough place to be Jewish but the Rabbi and his wife made it easy and pleasant. After college I am positive that my life will be different because I knew them. They are amazing! Donate!

Roni (his wife) makes the best challah and shabbat chicken. The Rabbi is always willing to sit down an talk about life and always has the best advice to offer. He is the perfect Rabbi for a college campus and truly understands what a Jewish College student is looking for and how to connect with them.
Chabad at the University of Delaware	12590	9	/users/profile/14612	jordandov	Client Served	5	10/08/2009	Rabbi Eliezer Sneiderman and his wife, Roni, provide a Jewish home for all Jewish students on the campus of the University of Delaware. Shabbat and holiday meals and prayers, Torah classes, meaningful social interaction, and rabbinical guidance are available to students every day. I did not take advantage of their warm hospitality until my senior year and have regretted not coming sooner in my college career. Rabbi Sneiderman guided me during a time in which I needed to make difficult choices. He opened his home to me and I was able to see first hand, every day, how an observant Jewish family lives.Today I am married. My wife and I have four children and live in Israel. There is no doubt in my mind that my life would be drastically different if not for the Sneidermans.

I lost my 14 year old son, AJ, to childhood cancer.   As a fellow childhood cancer advocate I work closely with Joe McDonough from B+ and can emphatically state that his head and heart are both entirely focused on making a dramatic difference for children and families enduring this incredibly rough road.     Please support the B+ Foundation and it helps children and families battling childhood cancer.

I was impressed by his devotion and dedication to helping fight kids cancer. His compassion and empathy for families going through an unimaginably difficult and life-changing experience is genuine. In a few short years, the B+ Foundation has done good work to heighten public awareness of childhood cancer and been a leader to help educate, raise funds and work towards better treatment and funding and hopefully one day eradicating this disease.

I'm wasn't a huge soccer fan but I am now thanks to Andrew. His story touched me through my boyfriend who played soccer against Andrew. Following Andrews death I got the chance to meet his father at a Student Government meeting and really became interested in this foundation and helped promote it to my family, friends, and people who just asked about his t-shirts I was wearing. I went to Florida and had people ask me about my t-shirt and I was surely happy to tell Andrew's story. Not only does the B+ Foundation have a great meaning behind their logo, but they have helped so many cancer children and their families! I highly suggest getting to know this foundation and becoming a part of the fun!! 
Safe Haven Animal Sanctuary Of Sussex County Inc	140885	1	/users/profile/186981	No Kill Delaware	Professional with expertise in this field	3	11/17/2012	I have written one review about Safe Haven Animal Shelter as a Donor and volunteer.  I am writing this more critical review as a person with some expertise about animal shelters (see note below). Any No Kill shelter is infinitely better than a pound that resorts to convenience killing, of course.  However, as a No Kill shelter, Safe Haven has management problems that make it less effective than  the other No Kill shelters in Delaware. Certainly some of these problems at Safe Haven can be attributed to its start-up, with a new building and new staff in 2012.  However, the Executive Director and Board of Directors need to focus on these problems and resolve them if Safe Haven is to reach its potential.  MEDICAL CENTER The Executive Director did not hire a full-time veterinarian or equip the Medical Center on a timely basis, despite the fact there were funds earmarked for that from a major donation.  This impacts not only the care of the animals in the shelter, but it also means that there is no Trap Neuter Return program, and no high-volume or low cost spay/neuter for the pets in the community yet.  ADOPTION Safe Haven must increase the numbers of animals adopted into good homes.  As a No Kill shelter with a dog control contract, Safe Haven must quickly move animals from the shelter into good homes by more effective use of social media, ads in newspapers, and special events and promotions at the building and at off-site locations.  One factor impeding the adoption of a number of animals is the Executive Directors bonded pair policy; when two animals who came into the shelter separately get along, the Director sometimes decides they must be adopted together, which makes it much more difficult to get them into homes. Finally, the building is only open to the public a very limited number of hours a week  just on Fridays and Saturdays; people who want to see the animals on other days must make appointments.  That definitely hinders adoptions.  FOSTER HOMES Safe Haven needs to work harder to develop a good network of foster homes for animals who should not be in a shelter:  young puppies, kittens, and dogs or cats who are sick or elderly.  VOLUNTEERS More volunteers are needed not only to help with the animals in the new building, but also in the private kennels where dogs are being boarded on an overflow basis because there is no room at the sanctuary.  Dogs and cats in shelters need attention and love on a daily basis, and volunteers are essential for that.   REPORTING Delaware shelters are required by law to report online their statistics on a quarterly basis including data on intake, adoptions, returns to owner, transfers, and euthanasia.  Safe Haven has not posted their statistics online.   NOTE: As the blogger for No Kill Delaware, I follow the literature and national news about animal shelters, with a special focus on Delaware shelters.  Four of the five shelters in Delaware are committed to the No Kill ethic: Safe Haven Animal Sanctuary, Faithful Friends, Delaware Humane, Delaware SPCA.  No Kill shelters save 90% and more of the animals. The Kent County SPCA in Delaware is not committed to No Kill ethic and their save rate is much lower than 90%.  No Kill advocates are working to make Delaware a No Kill state.  Delaware has a very progressive Companion Animal Protection Act (CAPA) based on the model of the No Kill Advocacy Center, a national advocacy group.  No Kill shelters are guided by the "No Kill Equation" developed by Nathan Winograd, an important leader in the No Kill movement.  The No Kill Equation includes rescue partnerships; foster care;  comprehensive adoption program;  Trap Neuter Return for community cats; volunteers; community relations; medical/behavior rehabilitation;  high-volume, low cost spay/neuter for the community; pet retention programs; and a hard-working compassionate Director.  While this is a challenging set of programs, they are critical to the success of a No Kill shelter. 
Safe Haven Animal Sanctuary Of Sussex County Inc	138909	1	/users/profile/185003	NoKillDelaware	Donor	4	11/14/2012	Safe Haven Animal Sanctuary, a No Kill shelter  for dogs and cats, finished their new building in 2012, hired full-time staff and filled the sanctuary with hundreds of dogs and cats.  This has been challenging, of course, but as a donor and former Board member, I believe that Safe Haven is a No Kill shelter that is working hard to save the abused and abandoned animals in Delaware.    I know the Executive Director to be completely committed to the No Kill ethic, which is critical.  The review here on Guidestar by jrzygrl412 fails to convey what was accomplished by Safe Haven in 2011.  Without a building, we pulled over 100 dogs from death row at the kill facility in Kent County, Delaware and  placed the dogs in foster homes or boarded them at private kennels until they could be adopted.  For the full story, please see the 2011 Annual Report, which is posted online at http://www.safehavende.org/images/stories/annual%20report%20for%20web.pdf    All of this was accomplished in 2011 with only one full-time employee - the Executive Director.   We relied heavily on volunteers, and some did get burned out but most were completely dedicated, and we managed to save the lives of those dogs so they would have a second chance.  With a full-time staff,  hundreds of dogs and cats are now being being well cared for in Safe Haven's sanctuary.   As of July, 2012 Safe Haven is now doing dog control In Kent County according to the new model shown to be so successful in other parts of the country; the objective is to try finding the dog's home if at all possible, rather than automatically taking the dog to the shelter.   The dogs who are taken to the sanctuary are safe from being killed.  People who want to help a No Kill shelter committed to helping abused and abandoned animals can be confident that their donations will be put to good use at Safe Haven Animal Sanctuary.    
Safe Haven Animal Sanctuary Of Sussex County Inc	107451	1	/users/profile/145544	jrzygrl412	Volunteer	1	03/02/2012	Is NOT what you think it is! I was a volunteer but no longer. Dogs are not being cared for, plus this facility is STILL not open, Safe Haven pushes these dogs from kennel to kennel. If different responsible Board members would take over this mess, I would certainly start volunteering again.  I socialized and worked and walked these dogs,  Took them to adoption events, but there are too many and they just keep bringing them in....

National League Of American Pen Women Inc	59640		/users/profile/64539	pwpoems	Volunteer	4	01/07/2011	I've been a member of the National League of American Pen Women since 1985 and although I've moved around the country several times, I've always kept up my membership in my small branch in rural Mississippi.   The beating heart of the League is its National Headquarters, the Pen Arts building, in the Dupont Circle area of Washington, D.C.  where national records are kept and where the National Executive Board meets four times a year.  But the lifeblood of the NLAPW flows through its branches and members-at-large all over the nation, from Vermont to Hawaii, Florida to California and almost everywhere in between.   This is where creative women find inspiration from each other,  and work together in their communities to fulfill the mission of our over-100 year old organization.  The NLAPW is uncommon as a nationwide organization in welcoming professional women in three disciplines:  Art, Letters and Music.  We have composers, poets, novelists, choreographers, watercolorists, sculptors, painters, arrangers--the list could go on.   Our diversity is our strength and our creativity our power--the power to bring art to many lives.

Soldiers Undertaking Disabled Scuba	174828		/users/profile/231131	Tom Spight	Donor	5	10/07/2013	I donated  a set of SCUBA geat to SUDS and later visited them on location where they were  training the wounded warriors.  John Thompson, the founder and President, introduced me to the soldier who was wearing the gear that I had donated.  The soldier, who had given an arm and leg for our country-literally- thanked me repeatedly for my support of the program.  Our dive club supports SUDS with an annual benefit and John comes and brings several of the graduates of the program.  It is wonderful to see how much this program benefits them.  I have no doubt  about the worthiness of this program, and will continue to support it.

They take wounded warriors returning from battle and restore some of the mobility they may have lost due to injuries.   It must be very liberating to be unshackled from gravity and learn a skill which will last a lifetime. The physical and emotional benefits must be so uplifting!   Note: They have moved to SUDS Diving, Inc. PO Box 2504Beaufort, NC   28516 I support SUDS monthly and urge you to do the same. It's a small token of thanks to those who have given so much.

Urban Bike Project of WilmingtonInc	97922		/users/profile/115608	JamieM	Volunteer	5	09/22/2011	I love volunteering (and working on my own bikes) at UBP. No egos, no politics, no meetings, no obligations, no stress... Just nice respectful and helpful people who love bikes, and love helping others get the most out of their bikes. Plenty of know-how to go around -- I learn something new every time I go in.  Whether you like helping newbies pick out a bike, like to organize things, or want to learn how to take a bike apart into 200 pieces and put it back together, there's a role for every level of experience, even if you don't know anything about bikes (yet).

K.I.S.H. Home,Inc.	58003		/users/profile/61545	Community Health Systems Inc California	Board Member	4	11/28/2010	I joined the cause of K.I.S.H. Home, Inc. in 2009. Since then, I have changed my view of what they youth means to the community and our future. The mission of K.I.S.H. Home is to empower the young women coming out of the foster care system in Delaware, teaching them important life sustaining skills. These are our future workforce, teachers, physicians, and mothers. K.I.S.H. Home, Inc. is definitely a great nonprofit and because of the way they embrace their responsibility in caring for and nurturing the youth, I will continue to support this organization in any way, fashion or form, that I can.

This is such a wonderful misison of fulfilling the commission that God has assigned to you. Kishma and I worked together for several years, we have traveled and worshipped God together, and over the years we became close friens.

Brandywine Counseling, Inc.	38791	1	/users/profile/39693	lalbright	Client Served	5	05/13/2010	My experience as a BCI client has been very positive. I have been able to utilize many of the programs they offer. Ive been on and off the methadone clinic for years and when ever I came back they welcome me with open arms. Almost two years ago I was pregnant and in active addiction. I got back on the methadone maintenance program but my use continued. My counselor at the time helped me get into the BCI Lighthouse program, a residential treatment center for women with children. Normally they dont take pregnant women but my counselor pressed the issue and got me in at 24 weeks pregnant. On my 3rd day there my water broke and my son was born early. BCI was there for me every step of the way. Fourteen days after he was born he became ill and I was informed that he needed to be flown to Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. BCI employees were there with me when I received the news. Once in PA my son underwent surgery and the waiting room again was full of BCI employees. Eventually my son could not fight anymore and he passed on August 30, 2008. BCI employees were at the funeral and when it was over they took me right back to the Lighthouse Program. I have nothing negative to say about BCI, Im grateful that they have not given up on me yet. Still to this day I struggle with sobriety and BCI is still by my side.- Lynn Albright
Brandywine Counseling, Inc.	12474	1	/users/profile/14504	peanutsbuddy	Client Served	1	10/08/2009	Brandywine Counseling has a lot of wonderful programs and does a lot of good in the community however one area that is severely lacking is the Newark, Delaware methadone treatment physicality. I am personally involved with several clients who after several years of recovery are hanging on for dear life with no medical help from Dr.Glick. One client in particular has 2 + years clean with no dirty urines or behavioral issues since day 1. After requesting an increase in medication it has taken more then a month to get a denial due to an old belief of following SML levels completely and totally disregarding the clients input. Why does it take a month? This is not one case but many! No matter what is going on in the clients life if SML levels are at 400 or above it is automatically denied. This is 1970 & 80's medical practice and is not up to today's standards. The amazing thing is once the client is denied an increase he or she is then deemed "unstable" with no further help from medical staff. If no medicine is in order and they are unstable then how do you make them stable? No extra counseling or any other suggestions are provided. I have watched many of person know that they are not felling right they have all the signs and symptoms of to low of a does and are on the edge of relapsing beg and plead with the doctor and medical staff that they are in need of an adjustment and no help is given. mind you I am not talking about clients who are new to treatment. I am speaking of clients with several years of sobriety and who has made excellent progress in treatment. How is it acceptable to deny them the proper medical treatment and send them back to the streets with a death wish. this is pure ignorance on on doctors part who is well pass his years of practicing good wholesome caring medicine. This is one of the reasons why they have such a high relapse rate and yet the stubbornness of the medical staff continues to kill people on a daily basis. This is a matter of Life and death for many and this field has no room for cockiness or an unwillingness to change with medical advancements and scientific proof. If you are looking for methadone treatment look elsewhere there are many other clinics who practice 2009 medicine.
Brandywine Counseling, Inc.	4433	1	/users/profile/6145	ronzo	Client Served	5	05/01/2009	I Am a client there and have been in and out of BCI for close to nine years is been a bumpy ride for me but it would have been allot worst for sure. They really take it upon themselves to provide you with the up most care and affection they possibly can. And in this day and age that is saying allot for an organization that first isn't making money second they have to  deal with the worst of all diseases,drug addiction it is the only disease that half of society will not even recognize as a disease even though the surgeon general made it official in the late 80's. But at least the  police officers of this country appreciate what they do there because it keeps the crime down, "in there part of town anyway". You might say how? well if a drug addict needs drugs every day to keep from getting sick. When he or she run's out of money look out, because someone is getting robbed so thats how. If we don't have to worry about getting sick thanks to brandywine counseling then everyone on drugs gets the medication and mental stability to keep off of drugs then everyone is happy and there car radio's are snug and secure in there dash boards.do you know there for bringing down crime in the home such domestic violence as well as crime to others like robbery and assault? But also they save lives because one of the thing they teach you there is you don't really have a choice in the matter because drugs will inevitably bring you to poverty, institutions or death in the end. So if there is anyone out there that wants to come clean I would really recommend BCI. It's a great place to turn your life around and get your freedom back from addiction, and make amends with family and friends not to mention your higher power. The sad part is you don't notice this until you admit you have a problem like they say the first step is admitting that you have a problem and when you come clean for a decent amount of time you just begin to realize not only where those drugs put you but where they were getting ready to take you hence the poverty, institutions or death. If you haven't actually all ready made it that far to begin with the sooner the better thats all and if your lost in the sauce like most drug addicts it might be time to ether reconnect or in the worst case get a higher power for your own sake! Do you know what the word bible stands for book of instructions before you leave earth. Thats a gift from me to you!

First State Animal Center And Spca Inc	143637		/users/profile/190100	Phyllis C.	Client Served	5	11/28/2012	My husband and I adopted Missy 2 years ago from the Kent County SPCA.  She has been a wonderful addition to our family.  Her name at the shelter at that time was Pixie.   When we put in to adopt her, we were told she had heartworms and that the shelter would treat her for them.  We took her home and brought her back a week later for the treatment.  When we got there, because she wasn't showing any physical signs of the illness other than the positive test, the shelter's vet took the time to retest her to confirm the diagnosis.  Thankfully due to the thorough effort of the staff veterinarian, it was found that Missy didn't have heartworms, so she wasn't subjected to unnecessary treatment.  Instead, Missy stayed the night and was spayed the next day, since her spay surgery was supposed to be delayed until the hearworm treatment was completed.  We were grateful that the shelter worked her in for the surgery and saved us an additional trip down to the shelter.   We can't thank the shelter enough for taking care of Missy during her time at the shelter.  We visited the Kent County SPCA a number of times while we were looking for the right fit for our family.  The shelter was always very clean, and the staff was always helpful and pleasant.  Thank you for the bringing us Missy, and for all the other great work you do!!!
First State Animal Center And Spca Inc	141317	1	/users/profile/186981	No Kill Delaware	Client Served	1	11/19/2012	In 2011, I adopted three dogs who had been pulled from death row at KCSPCA.  Every time I look at my dogs, I am sickened by the knowldege that they would be dead if a rescue group had not pulled them out of KCSPCA.     Baxter, my Boxer/Pit Bull mix, was on the KCSPCA kill list because he was evaluated as being "aggressive" and also as hating men.  He is a goofy love dog and he doesn't have a mean bone in his body.  He adores all the men in my family.  Pearl, my beagle, was on the KCSPCA kill list for being too "shy," and she is indeed shy and fearful.  So what?  She loves the other dogs and she loves me.  She is still a little afraid of my husband but lately has been sniffing and licking him more often. Papi, my other beagle, was on the KCSPCA kill list for being too old.  And yes, he is a senior, but he is healthy.  He loves cuddling and he loves his food and treats. We will love him every day for as much time as he has left.   It is horrible that my three dogs would have been killed at KCSPCA.  It is horrible that any dogs and cats are killed for space at KCSPCA.  Unless they are in such pain that it is truly a mercy to put them down, these dogs and cats should be allowed to live and love in new families who will cherish them.  Kent County SPCA chooses to kill homeless cats and dogs. The KCSPCA save rate for the 2nd quarter of 2012 was only 67%, with about 1,000 animals who were killed or died at the shelter.  http://www.kcspca.org/about-us/shelter-statistics.htm Kent County SPCA has said in the past that they cannot go No Kill because they have dog control contracts.  That is no excuse: other No Kill shelters across America do animal control.  In fact, two shelters in Delaware have dog control contracts.   About a year ago, the KCSPCA shelter Director resigned, and the Board of Directors had the opportunity to choose a new Director who would reform the facility and go No Kill.  Instead the Board chose a new Director who is perfectly happy to continue the convenience killing that has long been the tradition of KCSPCA.   I am the blogger for No Kill Delaware, so I track on an ongoing basis what is happening at KCSPCA in relation to the literature and news about American animal shelters.  I also compare what Kent County SPCA does with the four No Kill shelters in Delaware: Safe Haven Animal Sanctuary, Faithful Friends, Delaware Humane, Delaware SPCA.   No Kill shelters are guided by the "No Kill Equation" developed by Nathan Winograd, an important leader in the No Kill movement. The No Kill Equation includes rescue partnerships; foster care; comprehensive adoption program; Trap Neuter Return for community cats; volunteers; community relations; medical/behavior rehabilitation; high-volume, low cost spay/neuter for the community; pet retention programs; and a hard-working compassionate Director.  KCSPCA could implement the No Kill Equation and be a No Kill shelter, but the Board of Directors and the Executive Director refuse to stop the killing.

A Buddy For Life Inc	235004	5	/users/profile/309076	rayvendawn13	Volunteer	1	12/05/2014	I volunteered for this organization from February 2013  May 24, 2013 when I was informed by the volunteer coordinator, Jess Maslo, that I could no longer volunteer because Cecil County was receiving too many complaints about the cat room. While there I brought with me cleaning materials and always keep an emergency stash of kitty litter in my vehicle because they ran out and "would buy more tomorrow." I found a dying cat while doing a thorough cleaning of the cat room. He was wrapped in a bunch of sheets in a corner. He was in severe respiratory distress with matted and wet green drainage in his eyes and nose. He was sneezing constantly and wheezing. He would mouth breath at times and I noted he had red ulcers on his tongue. The person in charge of the cat room was gone for the day. I notified the co-director downstairs and she texted either the vet or the vet tech (who finally admitted she was not a licensed vet tech). This was at 3 pm. The plan was that the animal control officer would take the cat to the vets house when she got off work. There is no running water to the second floor. They now have dogs who have been crated on the second floor for over a year. The negalect and abuse has been reported to the county by multiple people, some of whom like me was told they could not come back. They tried to hide a dog attack. They lie constantly to questions are posed by the county oversight committee. The abuse and neglect is obvious and our county is not doing anything but they continue to give them 60,000 a month which was supposed to be used for the county 8 day stray hold. Instead they are using the money to fund their rescue. The vet associated with the shelter is on probation. Despite all the reporting, trying to allow HSUS or the ASPCA in to help, the county administrator, Tari Moore, has refused any help. They ahve slid into a severe hoarding problem which was predictable but could have been prevented if county officials started acting when they were first notified in May 2013.

Beyond rehearsals and performances, all students (actor/singers, pit musicians, and tech folks) are provided with master classes with professionals from local theatre, as well as Broadway.  Amazing productions have included Les Miserables School Edition, West Side Story, Urinetown, Ragtime, Hairspray, Jekyll & Hyde, Drowsy Chaperone, Spamalot, and Titanic.

DAST - DELAWARE ALL STATE THEATRE	306798	1	/users/profile/398106	Linda440	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2016	This is a great organization that offers children in Delaware and surrounding states (Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey) the opportunity to perform together in performing arts at the highest levels. The concept was birthed by Jeffrey Santoro. He felt that performing arts students should have an opportunity to have an "all state" experience like athletes, choirs and bands do.  So "the best of the best" get to perform together, coached by an adult volunteer team who are all respected professionals in the theater world. The kids have reported that the experience is amazing and the audiences are treated to a broadway worthy performance. As part of the program, the children also have the opportunity to attend master classes in New York City with broadway performers.  The children pay no fees to participate (unlike the all state athletes, choirs and bands) as all costs are covered by the non-profit organization.  So children of all economic backgrounds are able to benefit from this amazing experience. This organization is truly a "labor of love" for kids and for theater and deserves your support !

There was no reviews so I wanted to make a note.  I was the one who wrote that statement. They not only helped us deal with something few could possibly grasp --as far as what we went through-- and gave us the ability to have her home with me at al times.  You see, being in a hospital isn't what my Lady wanted.  I'm so grateful for what they did for us and myself and our Son after we lost the love of her life.  The CF foundation didn't do anything for us except to get the word out I guess.  But this organaization, these wonderful people are indeed the real thing.  The Billy Cook Foundation was formed after a wonderful stronge couple lost their Son Billy from cystic fibrosis.  I had met him just once before he later passed away.  He was indeed a remarkable person with a great way about him.  he was loved by many.  As so with Kari, she was simply a wonderful caring person who showed her love with me and our Son which was beyond any I have seen in my life.  These wonderful people gave us a second chance so we could "live" a little while she was still alive.  If you have ever been through a loss from illness, you would know what I mean by that.  Anyway, thanks for reading and I don't ask for much, but please, if you are able in any way to help them help others ( many which are kids ) then please provide them with youre love.  They will "pass it on" to those in need.Thank YouTim Perry

Brandywine Baroque Inc	143174		/users/profile/171976	Maria48	General Member of the Public	5	11/27/2012	I actually work for Brandywine Baroque, but over the years I have watched this great music ensemble educate and perform Baroque period music on antique instruments in a beautiful venue.  It is a rare opportunity and a treasure of the Brandywine area if you ask me.  They hold masterclasses once a year (a new addition to their schedule) to help educate other musicians as well as have moved to perform in the Rehoboth area.   They are passionate and always trying to reinvent themselves in hopes of drawing a bigger audience in a very arts driven area.  
Friends Of Middletown Robotics Organization	138854		/users/profile/184369	cissyk	Donor	5	11/14/2012	I cannot say enough about the Friends of Middletown Robotics Organization and the Robotics Team 1370.  When my son decided to join the team his sophomore year of high school, I had no idea what kind of positive impact this organization would have on his life!  We were so impressed with the team and the mentors providing an environment that was hands on learning and fun!  The volunteers of this organization provide the leadership and dedication that is over the top!  I have worked with people in the past (getting paid of course) that do not work anywhere near as hard as these volunteers!!  Their love of engineering and guidance brought my son back his junior year.  He gained more experience and knowledge by working closely with the organization and attending competitions!  His passion  grew for engineering, he enjoyed every aspect of being on the team and was building long lasting relationships with some great people!  Not only did he join his senior year, but was named President of the Robotics Team!  The guidance these volunteers provided assisted my son in choosing his major for college, Biomedical Engineering.  I am truly in debt to this organization for helping my son with his direction in lfe!!

Hospital Billing & Collection Service Ltd	10243	1	/users/profile/12113	Uncle Bill	Client Served	2	09/11/2009	I was a patient at one of HBCS' clients (Newton-Wellesley Hospital aka NWH) in March 2009. I went to the ER one Saturday afternoon with a kidney stone. Because it appeared as only 4 mm wide, the hospital told me to go home, but return if I felt bad again. Within 36 hours the stone was 6 mm wide and wedged in my left urethra. I developed a fever and infection that required a cystoscopy.The hospital charged me $50 for the first ER and then another $250 for the inpatient visit. I refused to pay the $50 because I had to wait in line on a first-come/first-served basis.All calls to NWH's billing department automatically go to HBCS. The staff at HBCS are high-pressured, intransigent, and patronizing/matronizing. Several threatened to send my account to a collection agency (as if HBCS weren't a collection agency).Through Guidestar I discovered just how two-faced the section 501 legislation is. How is it that the State of Delaware provides tax-exempt funding for HBCS? How is it that an officer of one of its clients gets $30,000 annually to be on the board of directors?I have written a brief document that I'm sending not only to a staff-person at NWH describing HBCS' rude and intransigent behavior, but also to one of the supervisors at HBCS.One might think I'm making a $50 molehill into a mountain; however, I believe I have scratched the surface of a larger problem. I briefly reviewed  recent form 990s. I have worked in clinical and financial hospital systems most of my professional life. I even worked at Partners Healthcare (parent of NWH).

Forgotten Cats Inc	73352	3	/users/profile/80166	fcvol	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	Forgotten Cats works to humanely reduce the homeless cat population and prevent the suffering of kittens born to abandoned cats each day. They do this by working with colony caretakers to trap, sterilize, vaccinate, and return every cat within a colony. They provide the necessary medical treatment for sick or injured feral cats, stray cats, and kittens. They work to find homes for adoptable cats and kittens,  provide education about spay neuter, and  assist other cat rescue groups with trap, neuter, and return programs within 4 states.What makes Forgotten Cats amazing is that they are able to accomplish all of this with essentially an all volunteer organization.  In the last 6 years, over 40,000 cats were sterilized in one of the 2 Forgotten Cats low cost clinics thus preventing the births of approximately 3 million kittens.  In addition, about 1000 homeless cats are rescued from the streets and adopted into loving homes each year.  Forgotten Cats is comprised of the most amazing,  hardworking, caring people that I have ever known.  Once any volunteer sees the good that this organization does, its impossible to not become more involved.

Nativity Preparatory School	67656		/users/profile/73942	Sharon M.	Board Member	4	02/13/2011	I became a board member of NP after my husband was introduced to the school through his job. The inner city school is tuition free for boys in grades 5th through 8th. The school provides an education for the boys in order to prepare them to enter one of the independent schools in the area and then college. In addition to the boys attending an extended day throughout the school year they also attend a summer session. The best part is that the boys' guardians must be involved in the child's education. It's amazing to see these boys grow and mature and realize their own potential. The first NP graduation class are freshmen in college this year. The school maintains contact with the boys all the way through college. It is great to see these successes which hopefully with have a domino affect on those who have been touched by Nativity.

The Trinity Bible School Of Hempstead	240071		/users/profile/326103	truthGodsway	General Member of the Public	4	03/27/2015	I attended this school for many years.  The Christian education I received there was superior to other schools I have attended.  My understanding about God through His word, His will and and purpose for man was revealed there.  My personal life increased spiritually and my walk with Jesus became uncompromised as I began to understand more about Him through the study of His word.  The Theological curriculum, the Founder, President, Dean and Teachers there were devoted to the truth and immutability of the Bible, its relevancy in the world today and its application in the personal lives of each student.  They did nothing short of representing and teaching the God of the Bible, His truth and His will for our lives.  I earned serveral certifications from the study of General Bible to Escatology and many other subjects. It was through and become of this school that I was accepted into the Doctoral program of one of the best Theological Seminaries in the country.   I truly enjoyed my experience there and I am more than grateful to God for providing me with the opportunity to go to this Bible school.  I shall be forever grateful.  I now am also a teacher of the Bible.

Pam uses props to paint a picture for the ladies and provides concrete biblical principles to help keep them moving forward in their lives.  I enjoy watching how the ladies come into the room and they light up with seeing Pam.  It is because Pam's genuine love for the ladies is visible.

Southern Delaware Botanic Gardens	286682		/users/profile/376752	Raymond_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	At a time when there are so many valid and pressing needs for help, it can at first seem frivolous or at least low priority to donate to the creation of a beautiful public botanic garden. If we are to progress as a nation, we also need to be able to support those endeavors which enhance the quality of life, that expand our appreciation of music and the arts, that make the beauty of nature more accessible.While I have donated to a range of deserving causes, the donation that has had the greatest  immediate impact and was most personally meaningful has been the volunteering and financial support I give to the Delaware Botanic Gardens. www.delawaregardens.org Helping this 'garden to be' advance from a visionary dream to a real, achievable public garden has been a wonderful way to give back to our community. The project is a creative combination of preserving our coastal plain environment, enhancing the natural native beauty of 37 acres and generating economic vitality in a rural area in need of new opportunities. The Delaware Botanic Gardens project has brought together a wide circle of our community and leading companies. The most recent validation of this project has been the addition of Piet Oudolf, the world famous garden designer who has agreed to create one of his iconic Meadow Gardens. We all recognize that the Botanic Garden will be a major asset to the children in our region with its planned outdoor living classroom. It will be a positive venue for family activities. It will be a source of new jobs. It will be a place to enjoy and be inspired by the beauty of nature. It will celebrate environmental awareness and sustainable land stewardship. This is why I gladly have given time and money to this very worthy nonprofit organization.  Public gardens are indispensable to the quality of all of our lives. Let's join together this Giving Tuesday by giving back to improve the present and to create a better future.
Sojourners Place Inc	236926	1	/users/profile/321138	RK_SP	Board Member	4	01/16/2015	Since opening in 1991, the mission of Sojourners Place has been to assist homeless men and women on their journey to self-sufficiency through a case-managed, residential program. Sojourners Place is unique in that resident men and women can stay as long as necessary to get their lives back on track. Up to 50 residents can be accommodated in our facility.   Programs provided include drug/alcohol counseling, mental health therapy, educational training, and access to job training. When residents leave Sojourners Place, they leave with a job, a savings account and a place to live.  Sojourners Place does not charge its residents fees, and consequently is dependent on continuing support from individuals, corporations, the interfaith community, grants and government agencies.   Roman KalpasBoard Chair

From start to finish, the members of this organization and the community that supports them made our week memorable and beyond. I am overwhelmed with joy, tears, laughter and fun thanks to everything they put together to make our time at Bethany Beach extraordinary.  Our personal hosts were amazing, the business owners were amazing and the beach was amazing! We made some new friends and we will hold this slice of heaven close to our hearts forever. Praying for the continued success of this organization as they bring smiles (and happy tears) to many wounded warrior families. THANK YOU!!!

It simply gives parent and their children great hope and relief whereas they may never have had a chance. A small donation can change so many lives through the proper education.  Keep up the great work. Our children and society needs more like Faith First Educational Assistance corp.
