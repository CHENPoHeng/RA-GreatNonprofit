FINDINGbalance	287858	2	/users/profile/377988	Rebecca163,	Client Served	5	05/01/2016	The Lasting Freedom program (part of Finding Balance) has made a remarkable difference in my life.  I had been searching for help from eating disorder thoughts and behaviours for over two years when I found and decided to join Lasting Freedom.  I have not regretted it for one minute!  I have continued on with the program each session since I started with them in July 2015.  This is the first support program that has shown me that there is hope of recovery from an eating disorder.  Previous to this, I felt alone, hopeless and helpless.  Lasting Freedom takes a different approach.  This program has made me realize that I am not alone.  There are many adult woman diagnosed with eating disorders. Also, it has helped me to realize that I am not hopeless.  There is always hope because of Jesus!  Help is there.  Help is available to those who are searching for it.  I feel valued and loved.  I feel like I matter.   I am thankful for this program and the women who have worked hard to create it and keep it going.  I would highly recommend this program to anyone who is feeling trapped inside of an eating disorder.

FINDINGbalance	302497		/users/profile/378384	Margaret80	Client Served	5	09/03/2016	Working with the Finding Balance Program and participating in their on line program "Lasting Freedom" is bringing so much Hope into my life!   This program has challenged me to work at changing my own attitude about so much in my life.  I am learning that God is right here with me all the time.  I am learning to ask God's help and realize that I am not on this journey all by myself. The facilitators of this program are just so very honest and patient.  They nudge you just when you need a "nudge" and they share their own struggles in such a genuine way.  I am making positive forward progress.  This progress might be deemed slow by some but I am learning that "slow" is real progress.  I was experiencing so much shame in my life over my compulsive overeating.  I just did not think I could ask God to help me first because I felt like such a failure.  Finding Balance has taught me to try each and every day to put God first in my life.
FINDINGbalance	288170	1	/users/profile/378384	Margaret80	Client Served	5	05/03/2016	I am so very grateful that God led me to Finding Balance.  I had been struggling with my eating disorder for years.  Periods of Recovery and then periods of relapse.  I have been in Recovery successfully from addictions for 29 years.  My personal struggles with my overeating have been longstanding. I just could not seem to get recovery with my overeating - I needed something more for the Eating Disorder.  I appreciate all the people and programs that have given me support.  However, I am finding and developing such a sustaining relationship with God thru a woman's program called Lasting Freedom.  Finding Balance has such dedicated facilitators and many of them with there own personal recovery from an Eating Disorder.  God Bless all the staff.      Maggie/AZ

It is ran by people with hearts for God and serving others. What I appreciate about Finding Balance is they are very clear on what their mission is and very deliberate in going about it. Through Finding Balance I have gained a closer walk with God, a community of Christian women who are committed to God and their recovery and great strides in my own recovery. I truly believe in what Finding Balance is about and hope to be a part of it's success for years to come.

FINDINGbalance	287991	2	/users/profile/378184	Writer	Client Served	5	05/02/2016	Finding balance is one of the greatest blessings in my daily life! Not only are their daily emails full of scripture and encouragement, but their website is also full of resources for those struggling with body image and eating issues- and for those just wanting to learn more about finding a healthy balance with those things! I have also been blessed to attend Hungry for hope which was truly life changing for me in my eating disorder recovery and in my relationship with God. As a nutrition graduate studying to become a registered dietitian, Finding Balance stands for everything that I want to incorporate into my practice- most importantly that GOD- not food or our bodies- is the one worthy of our worship! Thank you for continuing the great work! 
FINDINGbalance	287990	2	/users/profile/378183	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/02/2016	I have been beyond blessed by this nonprofit, Finding Balance.  I am a practicing Licensed Professional Counselor who works with clients who struggle with their weight and their negative view of themselves.  Not only is this helpful for my work with clients, but this organization has helped me personally, as I also have struggled to have a healthy, and godly perspective of myself and my weight.  I have personally been most encouraged by Finding Balance's "The Daily Vitamin" that they email out each day to their subscribers.  Whenever I read these emails, I am so encouraged by what I read because the words that are being spoken are based on the Word of God.  These words have great impact each day I read them, whether I am struggling with my weight that day, or another struggle.  I am so grateful that there is an organization like Finding Balance in existence to help people remember what is the Truth!

The people who work with this non-profit consistently demonstrate integrity and they value providing high-quality resources to the people that they serve.

With weekly group meetings, online support, and encouragement from staff and mentors, I am finally experiencing freedom from eating issues. This is not a diet plan, but true, lasting change. Because of Lasting Freedom, I am hopeful that I can move on from an eating disorder and live out the calling and purposes that God has created me for! 
FINDINGbalance	287954	2	/users/profile/378142	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2016	FINDINGBalance is about more than just food/weight issues - it's about living life in a God-drenched manner. I don't have to be who culture says I do. The daily emails strengthen and encourage me. They are a bit of joy (and sometimes challenge) in my day. I'm so excited to be becoming more like Jesus and learning to love myself more (as I am). What a blessed ministry!

It's one thing to be loved by people you know, but when people you've never really met before  go out of their way to help you and love you back to life, it's something very special. The work that the team at FINDINGbalance do is excellent, and done with great care for each individual. There is space for everyone's voice to be heard and discovered, which is especially important in FINDINGbalance's line of work.

FINDINGbalance	287740	2	/users/profile/377873	Writer	Client Served	5	04/30/2016	I cannot say enough positive things about Finding Balance.  Prior to joining this group I had struggled with an eating disorder for more than 8 years and thought that I would always have "moderately recovered" symptoms.  After just a few months of working with FindingBalance, I now have hope for a future in full recovery.  Nothing can explain the changes that I have been able to make in my life thanks to this group.  
FINDINGbalance	287663	1	/users/profile/377788	Writer	Client Served	5	04/29/2016	I've struggled with a tenacious eating disorder for over 20 years (about half my life), and for most of that time have understood that my issues with body image, shame, control, and fear are spiritual in nature - that is, heal-able only by knowing who I am in Christ... my identity as a beloved child.  I continue to struggle mightily with my E.D., despite knowing that God is mightier still - I have much distrust and mis-beliefs about God's nature to still work through, but FINDINGbalance has kept me on the path of truth.  I have hope for recovery, however long it might take, because of FINDINGbalance and my participation in Lasting Freedom - the stories I hear from those who have recovered, the just-at-the-right-time encouragement from the webinar speakers, the prayers and fearless love of Jeanette and Constance... My life has definitely been touched in tangible and intangible ways, and I am incredibly grateful for this community.

FINDINGbalance	257473	3	/users/profile/345904	Writer	Donor	5	09/15/2015	I was introduced to FINDINGbalance in 2011 when I agreed to accompany my wife to the organization's annual conference in Colorado Springs Colorado.  While I initially saw this as an opportunity to sample the states blue ribbon trout streams, what I found was something much more amazing.  If you are struggling with an eating disorder or body image issues, this is your community.  If you are looking to invest in a non-profit, one that is truly changing lives, this is it as well.
FINDINGbalance	256809		/users/profile/39945	acopyofhim	Client Served	5	09/12/2015	I first met Constance and learned about Finding Balance in 2003. In 2005, during the middle of my graduate work, Constance held a 12-week small group pilot program. For the first time after 19 years of food, weight, self-esteem and body image struggles, my pain was validated. It even had a name. And with that name came hope of getting well and reassurance that I'm not alone. Finding Balance changed everything. Now, ten years later, I am a competent thriving Physician Assistant in a psychiatric practice offering the same validation, hope, and reassurance to those struggling with illnesses ranging from depression to schizophrenia, from ADHD to panic attacks, from victims of rape to alcoholics, and even some with food and weight issues. And the interesting part, no matter the psychiatric diagnosis, roughly 80% of my patients rate their appearance as a moderate to severe issue for them. Constance was right, God won't-and hasn't-wasted my pain. Finding Balance is crucial to our society in breaking unhealthy social norms. I am proof that helping just one person can have an exponential impact in ways never imagined. And I couldn't be more greatful. 
FINDINGbalance	39014	2	/users/profile/39945	acopyofhim	Client Served	5	05/14/2010	Finding Balance's (Fb) primary goal is to let people who are controlled and defined by their unhealthy relationship with food and body image that there is hope out there.  There is this amazing and marvelous God who wants to restore the broken and the captive.  When I started the Fb small group I thought my only chance at the perfect body was an all out eating disorder.  I learned that I was wrong.  The perfect body wasn't going to bring the perfect life that I was hoping for. I was crushed and broken. And what Fb did was walk along side me and tell me that I don't have to fight this battle alone. They told me that all this pain I was overwhelmed with was something that God wouldn't waste but in fact use for His glory. God would give my pain purpose. So instead of dropping out of graduate school then, I am now a full-time healthcare provider that gets to speak truth in the lives of the patients that I see day to day. You know, often it's said that you can't keep your recovery unless you give it away.  Fb has come to hold such a valuable and special place in my heart that I financially contribute to their cause (altough it doesn't seem like much) and I get to bring encouragement to others who struggle through the FB blog. Fb helped launch my recovery, and the joy that I have today is because of them.

Fb currently has an online recovery support group, Lasting Freedom, that has members from all over the world coming together to support & encourage each other as they/we seek freedom from disordered eating and body image challenges. I have been an active LF member for almost 2 years, currently volunteering as the Lasting Freedom Site Moderator. The support of this community has helped me walk the recovery path with grace, strength, and a solid faith-based foundation! I love this community and this ministry so much!
FINDINGbalance	39179	2	/users/profile/40126	MINIgirl	Client Served	5	05/17/2010	People had been telling me for years that, because I was not underweight or overweight, I didn't have a problem with food, but *I* knew there was something wrong with my private relationship with food & binging & over-exercising, and as a Certified Personal Trainer, the guilt overwhelmed me. In Spring 2005, I read Constance Rhodes' book, "Life Inside The Thin Cage", and soon after, I contacted her by email about how the book spoke to me. I wanted more information about EDNOS and Constance was creating a workbook for small groups (which would become "Finding Balance with Food"), so I waited for it to be completed.  In Spring 2006, our church had an epidemic of deaths due to unhealthy lifestyle choices, one was a young woman, 29 years old and mom of 2 small children. The church pastor was aware that this was a problem and he knew I was interested in helping. He encouraged a friend and I to start a "body image/food issues" support group. We used several different books in our Bible study group, as well as the "Finding Balance" website and e-newsletter to assist us and guide us as leaders while we waited for the "Finding Balance with Food" curriculum to be completed in Franklin TN. In Fall 2008, when Constance was looking for pilot groups outside of Tennessee to test the curriculum, our church group volunteered, and I must say good things come to those who wait! Our San Jose CA FBwF pilot group had 10 women, ranging in age from 43 to 71 years old. This group dynamic brought challenging discussions about food attitudes and life-long poor eating habits, as well as revelations about body image & aging. The curriculum was well-organized with videos, discussion sheets, leaders' guide, and easy art projects. I confess that when we started, we were not excited about doing these art projects, many of the women said they personally weren't creative and resisted doing them. However, the time we spent on these projects became the highlight of our meetings; they were relaxed, easy, and took us back to "little kid" days when a piece of paper and glue and glitter were fun, back to a time when we were not judgmental about ourselves and our bodies. As a result, "Life Inside The Thin Cage" & the FBwF curriculum is the benchmark for our group and we are planning to begin a weekly Fb Gathering  in June 2010.
FINDINGbalance	256447	1	/users/profile/344844	Writer	Client Served	5	09/11/2015	On a whim I submitted a guest blog post to FindingBalance.  Constance reached out to me personally and encouraged me in writing and speaking.  I appreciated the personal connections and broader view of eating disorders I gained through my interactions with FindingBalance.  I lived in a very rural area with little connection to resources, and appreciated the daily, Christ-centered encouragement and trustworthy information available from FindingBalance.  I never had to worry that something there was going to trigger me.  If you are struggling with food issues, you know it is an assault waged every day on your mind and body.  FindingBalance has the best personal, daily online resources that I know of.

The following year I made a point to attend the conference. Finding Balance had such a strong on impact on me and my recovery. I not only learned so many things and heard so much needed information, I realized that I was not alone. I made connections with others and that was huge.

I learned more about the organization and decided I wanted to volunteer for them. I am newer to helping out, but have been blown away. Everything they do is thought through very well. It is real, authentic, and grace filled. People need to know they aren't alone, and Finding Balance does a great job at building a team, so people feel that there is a way of pushing back darkness!

The volunteers are amazing at helping and putting together meaningful experiences where those that suffer from eating issues can have space to heal.  God uses this non profit to heal the hearts of many.  We are blessed too have this resource, that.can be used all over the world,  
FINDINGbalance	207045	1	/users/profile/269586	JeanetteHenriques	Volunteer	5	07/23/2014	I have served as a volunteer for FINDINGbalance for the last 9 months.  After serving in various other roles in eating disorder recovery programs, this program far exceeds any other I have served. The level of detail involved in each program that FINDINGbalance puts together is superior to other non-profit eating disorder programs. This program listens to its participants and volunteers and brings all the feedback together to create programs that are timely and pertinent to the issues of its members. The information provided is practical and applicable to anyone regardless of how far they are into recovery.  I have had the privilege of watching our members grow and reach new levels of freedom that they had not obtained through other resources. FINDINGbalance offers hope and walks with individuals so that they can start to have that hope of a life free from the chains of eating disorders.  Each week I am excited to listen to what steps the members are making towards a life of freedom.  Over the last seven months the community has developed into a very supportive and encouraging environment that challenges its members to walk in accountability and freedom from the eating disorder.

FINDINGbalance has given my wife the structure, community and overall HOPE that she has sought in her battle with ED (eating disorder).  I have been effected as well.  I was approached by my (nervous) bride asking if I would attend "Hungry for Hope", FB's annual conference.  We went together as "rookies" and were shown God's AWESOME power through the lives of numerous women!  I am amazed how God is working in the lives of these women through FINDINGbalance.

I have struggled for so many years to "get rid of" my eating disorder, but it wasn't until I became involved at FINDINGbalance that I truly know what it's like to live free from it.  The support and encouragement I receive from my online group has far exceeded any community I've experienced from my church, my friends, or my family.  FB has inundated me with the truth of God's Word and shown me that my value is not in my physical body.  Everything about this ministry is rock solid!

My husband and I attended the Hungry for Hope conference in Colorado Springs, Co and were introduced to Constance Rhodes, Travis Stewart, and many other caring professionals. We learned a great deal there and found resources to help us navigate the nightmare of an eating disorder. After 5 years, 3 residential treatment facilities, a month in the hospital and a series of relapses, we are so thankful that she is now walking in recovery. The support we received was a lifeline in a very dark, stormy season!

A place where I don't have to perform or buck up. A place where vulnerability is valued and change doesn't have a time-line. A place where I don't have to look good. A place that won't try and fix me...but instead love me. A place where I can expose my deepest shame and be called beautiful. A place where I can bring my broken pieces and fragments and process them and mend. The resources at Finding Balance seem limitless. At anytime of day or night I can search a topic that is relevant to my recovery from food issues and find encouragement and help. I can't even put into words how useful/helpful this has been in my recovery. In the time I have been involved as a client of this non-profit organization I have found so much freedom and hope from my food/eating and body image issues. To say I am grateful doesn't begin to describe the depth of my hearts joy and freedom.

Findingbalance Founder Constance Rhodes vision to help, heal, educate those striken with many forms of eating disorders, addictive compulsions, identity issues and more has given LIFE to my wife who has battled Anorexia & Bulimia for over 35 years to most recently dead without hope and the fight to live. Because of Findingbalance we are encouraged daily from the unconditional love, support given through this ministry. When Constance offered to fly to my home with her team to minister and bring life and hope to my wife not knowing the outcome we would face together, truly examplifies the commitment, passion Findingbalance has to healing, wellness and completion. Today through the Leadership of Constance my wife is alive and in treatment getting back what was lost and creating a pathway to Live Life once again.

There is simply no other non-profit organization of its kind! FINDINGbalance is uniquely multifaceted in reaching many different populations both affected by eating disorders as well as those Christian professionals working to treat and serve the needs of eating disorders and negative body image. Now when a client first begins seeing me, one of the first things I do is to make sure they get signed up for the Daily Vitamin to be delivered to them via email. Their response to getting these daily truths is overwhelmingly positive and a great benefit to myself as a Christian counselor when our clients get to hear truth from two-fronts. 
FINDINGbalance	174474	1	/users/profile/230750	clmblum6	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	Finding Balance is a rare organization because it is the only one like it. The community and hope it creates by the work it does, encouraging hope in the field of disordered eating and eating disorders is like no other. With the wonderful leadership and passion of Constance Rhodes to the amazing qualified board members and volunteers. Fb is helping thousands of women break free...not by just words, but from community, resources, relationships, books and curriculum, and life changing conferences. I can't say enough of the enormous capacity of change Fb has made and will continue to make in thousands of peoples lives who are hurting. What a gift finding balance is.

FINDINGbalance	174354	1	/users/profile/230623	sydneyphillips	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	FINDINGbalance is a unique organization with unique content; there is nothing else out there like FINDINGbalance. Constance Rhodes' "daily vitamins" are just one example of daily encouragement and acknowledgment of God's perspective on this issue that are truly effective. I wish I had something like this group when I was going through the worst of my eating disorder, but I have to be constantly reminded of God's truths to continue to live free. I appreciate that FINDINGbalance's core values consist of balance, no matter what the eating issue. In my opinion, this is the only way to live free.I found FINDINGbalance through a friend and attended Hungry For Hope this year, which is FINDINGbalance's annual conference, and it gave me fuel to keep going. It allowed me to meet others who desire community and transparency on this issue, which is the only way it can be conquered. Constance Rhodes, the founder of FINDINGbalance, is one of the most spirit-filled, intentional people I have ever met, and I look up to her as a leader, woman, entrepreneur, and friend.
FINDINGbalance	174179		/users/profile/230387	JeanetteYates	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2013	I found FINDINGbalance through research for my blog which also focuses on faith-based body image.  I really liked how unique a resource it is.  Having several formats--books, Bible Studies, in-person and on line groups, blogs, and events have the capacity to reach so many people.  I really felt that Fb reaches a group of people often left behind in the big recovery picture and also gives a Christian perspective that is often lacking in the discussion of body image.  I have since read the book by the founder and attended a FINDINGbalance event that was life changing for me and others who attended.  In my own blogging and mentoring, I have referred many people to this resource.  Another great thing about Fb is that the founder and board always come up with new ways to reach out and make a difference.  The various events and campaigns reach worldwide.

Not only am I a huge fan of the founder, Constance Rhodes, but the work that she's doing through her organization to impact lives is tremendous. She's endeavoring to provider leadership and answers for issues that are difficult to address, at best. FINDINGbalance has a reputation of being a high caliber organization and I couldn't agree with it more. You'll be hard pressed to find better content anywhere else. 
FINDINGbalance	173463		/users/profile/229606	lauraleemasterlcsw	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	     I have been a Christian therapist for more than 27 years and I have worked with many women over the years with eating disorders and I am continuing to work through my own disordered eating issues.  When I found Finding Balance's curriculum five years ago I was blown away by how relavant and Christ centered the materials were.  I came to a new understanding of how profound my distorted self-view was and how closely linked it was to my disordered eating that started in my early formative years.       Constance opened me up to exploring my own unhealthy patterns and how I was helping others but not uncovering my own shame, and lies that I had hidden deep within.  I felt like God did a surgery of sorts on me that cut below the mask I was wearing that I didn't even know I had on.       As I led women through the curriculum I saw how impacted they were by the truth within the Finding Balance message and more importantly God's truth arising out of it all.       When Constance asked me to join the Board of Finding Balance I was more than thrilled to say YES because I believe in the message of helping people Heal from the inside out and to walk in Freedom.  I feel passionate about getting this message out to a much larger audience and therefore I volunteer a geat deal of time to helping this organization grow and flourish for the Glory of God.       I would definitely endorse this organization and give it five star rating.

Finding Balance also has curriculums for small groups to help with daily, weekly, and monthly accountability.   I think Finding Balance should be a nationally recognized organization with representation and small groups in every state.

Her website has so much depth - unlike any other I have seen. She has more than 600 free video clips, numerous articles, book reviews, everything you can think of.

The resources found through FindingBalance are professional, helpful, encouraging, and rooted in Truth, which sets FindingBalance apart from other resources out there.

Over the years she has impressed me time and again with her incredible work ethic and steadfast commitment to providing life-changing, and often life-saving, support for those struggling with eating disorders. In addition to creating world class resources, Constance also makes herself personally available to those the organization serves, sharing counsel and even praying with those who are wrestling with these issues.  Having someone who really understands take the time to listen and invest in a young woman's life can be the difference-maker; the doorway to real hope for those caught up in anorexia or bulimia. If you are a person who has a heart for women finding freedom from eating and body image issues, FINDINGbalance is truly one of the most innovative organizations out there, and the only national organization focused on these issues from a solid, Christ-centered perspective. As a non-profit founder myself, I can tell you that work like this relies on the generosity of others.

I was desperate, alone, and dying in the grips of my eating disorder. With my health on the line, I sent an email to Constance Rhodes seeking help and prayer. Within just a few days, she replied in an email enriched with not only guidance and resources, but compassion and empathy. Her one simple act showed me that I was no longer alone, and that I actually had a life worth fighting for. Following our first interaction, I was able to attend a four month long inpatient treatment stay to find freedom from my eating disorder. I graduated from treatment in February, with my creativity bursting at the seams. Findingbalance gave me an arena to let my words from the heart be published and read by others with similar struggles. I found companionship within the realm of recovery, something I had heard of but never experienced myself. I found myself finding meaning in my new life without an eating disorder. In short, Findingbalance helped me find ME-who I am, Alyee, alive and thriving....and a worldchanger set free!

FB revealed to me the lies I had been believing through media about what beauty means.  Not only did my definition of beauty change, but my obsession with thinness was revealed as a control in my life. I am now able to see myself the way that God sees me which is bringing me freedom.  I am so glad that the experts at FB are speaking out and helping folks just like me see the need to break out of the thin cage and find freedom in Christ - just the way He designed it to be.

FINDINGbalance	83438		/users/profile/92431	dawnhynes	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/28/2011	Constance Rhodes, the founder of Finding balance, has created in my opinion, one of the most impressive resources that exists within the eating disorder community.  The depth of information and extensive list of topics found on her website is second to none.  What many people may not realize, is that most clients with an eating disorder struggle with EDNOS, not anorexia or bulimia.  This diagnosis, Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified, is one that even practitioners find difficult to treat.  This is partly due to the lack of resources available for clients with EDNOS, as well as minimal training opportunities which focus exclusively on this topic.  This is why Fb is such a crucial resource.  It is the only organization that works to not just inform the community about what EDNOS is, but more importantly, it gives a voice to all of those that are truly suffering from the negative effects of having this disorder.  Another unique aspect of Finding balance, is the faith-based component of their work.  This allows those seeking support from God, to have some guidance in how their faith can get them through all of the challenges that lie ahead in their recovery.  The group curriculum developed by Constance, incorporates this approach, and it has proven effective in encouraging clients to break free from the years of struggle with body image concerns and disordered eating. However, what I find most impressive is the passion and dedication with which Constance operates.  The phenomenal website is only part of the picture.  The existence of an annual conference, along with the desire for collaboration with other non-profits, will only strengthen the important work that is currently being done within Fb. I believe the organization they have created, should be a model for all of us in the eating disorder field.

Finally, FINALLY, there's been a change - in her attitude! At long last, she is giving herself a break - allowing herself the chance to explore self-acceptance and self-love. As her mom, I am so thankful.  She is still not what she longs to be - but she's learning to love who she is right now. I am so grateful to Finding Balance for helping my child when I could not.
FINDINGbalance	83179		/users/profile/92063	Travis S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/24/2011	Findingbalance provides some of the most thorough, relevant and practical information and training in the field of eating disorders and body image. Through the Findingbalance.com website, videos, conferences and curriculum and books Constance Rhodes and her team continue to act as a resource to both professionals and laypeople who are concerned with these issues. I regularly offer these resources with the greatest confidence to the patients, clients and families I work with as a professional counselor and ministry leader.
FINDINGbalance	83001		/users/profile/91821	sarahcz	Client Served	5	03/23/2011	I started attending a FINDINBbalance "Gathering" in February of 2010 and have kept going back every week since!  Fb offers a unique support for women of all ages and stages of recovery from disordered eating and body image issues.  The weekly video messages by Fb founder Constance Rhodes and other special guests are always Christ-centered, meaningful, and encouraging. Participating in Fb's programs has been a life-changing experience for me, and I have watched as it has been life-changing for my fellow group members as well.  FINDINGbalance impacted me so much that after a volunteer meeting this February, I approached Constance about a job opportunity with Fb.  After a short, totally God-led series of events, I became Fb's first-ever Program & Development Manager. In fact, I just started this week! Now, I get to give back to the organization that helped rescue me from certain darkness.  I kid you not, I am tearing up as I write this - God is so, so very good. I am so grateful that this resource exists! Thank you Constance and Fb for all you've done - I only hope my contributions to this organization can help others the same way I have been helped.
FINDINGbalance	82951		/users/profile/91742	Fionang	Donor	4	03/23/2011	I attended Hungry for Hope last June and have benefited from it tremendously.  As an Eating Disorder victim, it was great to share experience with others and meet people who have fully recovered from this disease.  More importantly, I was able to hear how God has helped them to fight this battle.  
FINDINGbalance	82833		/users/profile/91579	ahutto	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/22/2011	Findingbalance as an organization is one of a kind in its field...I don't know of another nonprofit that offers such an array of resources from so many experts in the nutrition and counseling arena in such an accessible way to the public. I've been personally involved in Fb as a young woman struggling with disordered eating and body image attending both the support group Gatherings and 12 week small group bible study. Because of the healing and wisdom I gained there, I went on to become a masters graduate of therapy, and now refer many of my clients to FINDINGbalance to help them find support and solid truth that they aren't getting anywhere else. I love showing clients how to access the video commentaries, interviews, and articles to help them on their own journey toward health and wellness. It's so easy to benefit from Findingbalance through the interactive website but it's nice to also go a step further by using the tools to be part of a small group gathering to share the journey with other women. So thankful that this kind of help is out there!
FINDINGbalance	82169		/users/profile/90208	Dana R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/14/2011	My experience with FindingBalance, Inc. has been excellent. I find them to have a wealth of information on eating disorders, treatment, and resources for families and those suffering from eating disorders from a Christian perspective. They are the first organization that I have come across that does such a good job networking between professionals, the community and those who need help. They bridge the gap for those who don't have clinically diagnosed eating disorders but need information and resources for subclinical disorders with which they struggle. FindingBalance has found part of it's niche in educating family members and friends of those who struggle with an eating disorder. It has also networked to build a community of people seeking to build their identity on the validity of Christ's claims through the True Sisterhood. It is an encouraging, humorous, caring website and podcast.

I had been searching for help from eating disorder thoughts and behaviours for over two years when I found and decided to join Lasting Freedom.  I have not regretted it for one minute!  I have continued on with the program each session since I started with them in July 2015.  This is the first support program that has shown me that there is hope of recovery from an eating disorder.  Previous to this, I felt alone, hopeless and helpless.  Lasting Freedom takes a different approach.  This program has made me realize that I am not alone.  There are many adult woman diagnosed with eating disorders. Also, it has helped me to realize that I am not hopeless.  There is always hope because of Jesus!  Help is there.  Help is available to those who are searching for it.  I feel valued and loved.  I feel like I matter.   I am thankful for this program and the women who have worked hard to create it and keep it going.  I would highly recommend this program to anyone who is feeling trapped inside of an eating disorder.  
FINDINGbalance	81996	1	/users/profile/89952	kaylabergholz	Volunteer	5	03/11/2011	I connected with FindingBalance a little over a year ago.  I had the honor in working along side them as a volunteer in June of this past year with Hungry For Hope.  They trutly are so very organized and very professional, with great marketing skills, administration skills and relational skills as well.  They also have great passion that overflows in serveing those who struggle personally, along with professionals working with those who struggle, in all areas of eating dissorders, body image, etc.   I have found that working with them, although I was a volenteer, they made me feel part of their team from the moment we connected.  There was great encouragment, and still is, along with great direction and wonderful follow up. They made the whole experience fun and I am trutly blessed to know them as a non-profit as well as individuals.  I will be joining them agian this year as a volenteer and look forward to it!
FINDINGbalance	81978		/users/profile/89929	benjity	Client Served	5	03/11/2011	Finding Balance has been a key component of my aftercare and continued recovery from anorexia.  When I first discovered their website, through a desperate Google search for, "body image distortion," I was mesmerized by the depth, wisdom and practical help provided by their experts.  Video clips and articles addressing actual women's questions fed my soul, giving me courage and a sense of identity.  The Finding Balance blog has often addressed my exact feelings; the contributors are transparent about their struggles.I have sought many means of continued support for my recovery after inpatient treatment.  Finding Balance has been the most well-rounded and consistent source of support that I have found.
FINDINGbalance	81941		/users/profile/89866	drmichellewatson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/11/2011	FINDINGbalance is an organization that I have used as a resource with clients in my counseling practice.  This site has been extremely useful for me as a mental health clinician because it is a place to refer clients  where there is a plethora of information to inform them and answer questions about eating disorders or disordered eating.  In addition, this site provides practical weekly encouragement from bloggers who bring their heart and wisdom to the table.  FINDINGbalance is run by a CEO with experience, passion, and expertise in the body image, eating disorder/disordered eating arena, who also brings the faith-based focus that many of my clients need and want as they walk their own healing journey.  I consider Fb to be a partner with me in my psychological counseling practice because I can refer to their site as a resource, knowing that my clients will gain credible and excellent information to assist them in their recovery as they use the materials that are provided there.

The format of the FB material is easy to follow, and working with Constance and her team has been an absolute blessing.
FINDINGbalance	42452	7	/users/profile/43162	bbart	Board Member	5	06/01/2010	I knew very little about FINDINGbalance when I sent in my resume, but when I met Constance Rhodes, she was somebody I knew I could trust with my story.  Being in business has taught me that any business is only as effective as its leader.  Constance is the founder and the energy of FINDINGbalane, but she has also made it a team approach, and everyone around her feels her passion and energy for this work.  It's contagious and inspiring.  The depth of the team is so evident in the website and the people supporting FINDINGbalance. The content on the website is comprehensive and relevant.  I am grateful to work with them.
FINDINGbalance	41956	8	/users/profile/42723	lauren8	Volunteer	5	05/30/2010	When I discovered FINDINGbalance, I realized founder Constance Rhodes and I had similar passions for helping free & empower women in the areas of eating & body image.  I knew this was an organization with which I wanted to be involved & serve! I began attending the Fb Gatherings Constance led at the time in Franklin TN, and seeing first-hand the powerful positive impact FINDINGbalance has on women in various stages of recovery from a wide range of eating & body image issues. The application of spiritual Truths has great value for all of us, wherever we are on our journey, as well as the freedom of experiencing genuine, transparent fellowship with other women.When Fb created its "webcast" tools to enable Gatherings around the country & around the world, I was thrilled to host a group here in Brentwood TN. Although my own walk is far from perfect, it is one of my greatest joys to come alongside Constance & the awesome work Fb is doing, and help empower & encourage women of all ages right here in my community. Thank you, FINDINGbalance!!!
FINDINGbalance	40621	8	/users/profile/41524	abryce4	Client Served	5	05/25/2010	FINDINGbalance is an amazing organization that reaches out to women who have struggled with food, dieting, hating their body, and so many other insecurities. There is no other organization quite like it that offers a faith based no-diet approach to changing the way you feel about your body and yourself. The 12-week small group curriculum opened my eyes and completely changed the way I viewed my body. It helped me to break free from the world of disordered eating after years of bingeing to  dieting, to obsessive excercising then not exercising at all, creating a cycle of gaining and losing weight until I hated my body for the struggle it put me through. Constance's raw honesty and empathic way of speaking the truth about our unhealthy thoughts and habits helped me to break free from the control that food and my body held over me. The website allows me to stay connected and find support and encouragement through the hundreds of videos and blogs from people all over the spectrum of body image and eating issues. This organization is so helpful on the pathway to freedom from being controlled by your eating and body issues!
FINDINGbalance	40415	8	/users/profile/41330	kindy-creek	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/25/2010	As a registered dietitian specializing in  disordered eating and family nutrition counseling, I value and appreciate having a cutting edge and relevant organization like Finding Balance to refer my clients to. Our culture is full of confusing body image and food messages that my clients struggle with both as parents and young family members and it is refreshing to be able to direct them to the practical tools that Finding Balance offers on the website and at events. I have firsthand experience working with the Finding Balance team from start to finish in creating the first ever women's conference at the Soulfest Outdoor Summer Music Festival in New Hampshire in 2005. The response from the women attending this 2-day conference was full of appreciation and excitement for the transformation the speaker's and workshops helped to foster through raw honesty and truth. Finding Balance holds nothing back as an organization willing to go 'rogue' even when the topics that are addressed are complex and require going deeper than most organizations feel comfortable going.
FINDINGbalance	40137	8	/users/profile/41064	Eliz.G.	General Member of the Public	5	05/23/2010	The Finding Balance team looks squarely at the "warped mirrors" of the disordered eating mind-set, the existing eating disorder labels, and the current eating disorder industry as a whole. Through their extensive, interactive and professionally resourced website -- together with their strategic use of social media and a variety of teaching tools -- everyone impacted by eating disorders is presented with a clear "mirror of truth" about the entire eating disorder spectrum. This is not only helpful for the struggling individual but also for the lay-counselor or prominent professional. Finding Balance collaborates with existing organizations of all types. Because of its willingness to team with other organizations (rather than compete against them), Finding Balance is able to go where no other eating disorder organization has gone before in bringing healing to the hurting.  I find mentorship in Finding Balance, as I use their wonderful resources and curricula in empowering individuals and groups (specifically those in faith-based leadership roles) to learn and unite, and to extend hope and support to those struggling with eating disorders within their communities. Constance and her team have already done the work. Thanks to Finding Balance, you don't have to have lots of fancy letters after your name to provide cutting-edge, professional, and authentic support to others!
FINDINGbalance	39214	7	/users/profile/40170	cgarber	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/17/2010	As a professional working in the field of Eating Disorders, I receive many calls from various individuals asking me support their endeavors.  The call from Constance Rhodes over 6 years ago was unique.  This individual had done her homework and then some.  She had designed an organization to reach out to an underserved but overly-represented group - those suffering with "eating disorders not otherwise specified".  This phrase applies to all those whose eating disorder does not meet specify criteria for an eating disorder.  As experts know, millions of women and men fall into this category.  Take one example - someone who suffers from Anorexia Nervosa yet still has her Menstrual Cycle.  Again, professionals know this can be more common than the Amennorheic Anorexic.  Constance has made phenomenal progress in less than one decade.  She and her very well selected staff have educated thousands about this misunderstood category of disorders.  Again, EDNOS represents a huge number of untreated individuals who can struggle for a lifetime or can proceed to develop life threatening eating disorders.  Not only has Finding Balance taken on the task of education, but it also serves to unite, link, serve and bring people together.  Constance's published writings and her presentations bring people to the Finding Balance website - the heart of the organization.  One tour of the site can tell you how diversified this organization is able to be while still staying focused on it's sole mission.  The website is the perfect forum for a population that has shame and secrecy about the disorders.  I give all my entering clients the Finding Balance information.  I have seen clients progress from trusting the website to booking reservations for conferences!  Last Tuesday, I said goodbye to a previous client whose brain lost her 22 year battle against the disease.  She was only 38 and leaves behind two beautiful daughters.  Finding Balance was on her phone's contact list.  Going to the website gave her comfort and inspiration for many years, as there are few large faith based sites that cater to this special community.  She never lost the desire to fight, thanks in large part to resources such as Finding Balance. ( She was among the many Anorexics who still had her period, therefore did not meet the traditional criteria for a "full scale eating disorder".) I thank God Finding Balance is available and I support any efforts to continue its sustainability.  Thank you for your kind attention.

Whether a person is dealing with body image issues or is recovering from a severe eating disorder, Finding Balance provides resources to help.
FINDINGbalance	39096	6	/users/profile/40026	kristen-smith	Client Served	5	05/15/2010	I heartily support the vision of FindingBalance as I've come to readily understand my ongoing need for healthy balance in every area of my life. As I've been privileged to benefit from the mission of FB, I've observed that its primary objective is to invite those battling disordered living and eating to a haven of rest, where they can heal and find lasting balance and hope through the exposure of the lies and poisonous roots of the dysfunctional behavior in their lives. FB does this so well through the authentic, transparent, courageous volunteers leading the charity and through its equally stout-hearted clientele as they all persevere in finding and maintaining balance in their own lives. This example alone has tremendously inspired me to live life in similar fashion--letting my heart breathe as I persevere in knowing and practicing what is true about all things, especially what is true about me and my purpose and place in this world. FindingBalance is a charity that heralds a message of hope and life to those who are weary of navigating the storm-tossed seas of "living" disorders. We need to champion this call and this cause by giving it the loudest voice we possibly can so that as many who need to hear can hear the truth that balance and health and order in living are a reality to be found.
FINDINGbalance	39093	6	/users/profile/40024	editor4	General Member of the Public	5	05/15/2010	I've had the privilege of seeing Finding Balance begin as one person's passion and dream and then grow to where it is now. It is a very thoughtful, professional organization that seeks to help people live their lives well and fully. Constance and the Finding Balance team help people recognize and talk about issues that society often wants us to hide. In doing so, Fb has given so many of us new hope!
FINDINGbalance	39035	7	/users/profile/39968	musikgirl71	Client Served	5	05/15/2010	Finding Balance is an amazing support tool here in Franklin, TN as well as in other locations.  I began attending FB about 2 years ago when I was really struggling with my ED and I found it to be a great place to go each week for support. I was trying to get into treatment and was having a hard time due to insurance and finances, but having FB to attend each week while working in my treatments options was a lifesaver.  I would not have made it thru without the support and the assurance that FB would be there for me every week.  I also attended the class offered by Constance and it was very indepth and helped me to begin to uncover the reasons for my ED.  I have since been to treatment and attribute my ONE YEAR of recovery greatly to the FB program.  I feel that this program is helping many people locally as well as in other areas to find the support they need to begin and succeed in recovery.  I highly recommend this curriculum for a support/recovery group.
FINDINGbalance	38984	8	/users/profile/39916	shea2	Former Volunteer	5	05/14/2010	I first discovered fb when I was asked to design the curriculum. My philosophy of design is you must know your material before you can find the most successful method of presenting it. As I met with Constance and read the material, I was struck by my need of this type of resource in my life. I've struggled with my weight for the last several years after being diagnosed with breast cancer at age 35. I developed body image issues and depression after surgery and treatments. I've always been a very driven and disciplined person but have found myself not being able to control this aspect of my life. The beauty of fb is that it isn't a diet program, it goes after the reason(s) behind the eating issue. People don't want to be unhealthy but there is something in their life that brings them to an ED. Understanding the root of the problem, not just addressing the symptoms, allows you to be able to find the right tools to fight the battle that will end the war on your body. Fb goes there in a loving and supportive way and then points you in the direction to find the tools and community to help. What I have experiences so far has make me hopeful for the first time in many years that I will survive this . . . actually, not just survive but thrive.

They are dealing with core identity issues that are devastating the true beauty of women and men in our culture. Fb is not only crying out for us to notice the issue, but is bringing a bright light into these dark places; a message of hope that goes beyond body wellness and touches the soul. Fb gets people in touch with the inherent beauty that God puts in His children; and gives them a new mirror with which to see their real reflection.
FINDINGbalance	38968	6	/users/profile/39896	elaina	Donor	5	05/14/2010	I first heard about Finding Balance approximately seven years ago. My coworker picked up *Life Inside the "Thin" Cage* for me at a conference, but I didn't think it applied to me since I'd struggled with a clinical eating disorder and thought I had left that behind me. However, as the years went by, I got older and started gaining weight, and I realized that the negative tapes from the eating disorder were still playing in the background. I mostly attributed this to a distorted body image, but as I've been leading a Finding Balance with Food study, I've realized that the negative tapes come from a variety of sources--including culture and other women.What's so revolutionary about Finding Balance is that it's about building balanced, healthy relationships--with food AND with other people. It's about surrounding yourself with fellow travelers who are real and honest and trying to live into the truth about who they are as whole people (not just bodies on parade).  And, then, the other super important part that Finding Balance has been involved with is the True Campaign, and their line about the True-Shift is so crucial: to take the time we spend obsessing about our bodies and how we look, and to instead pour that energy and effort into empowering ourselves to accomplish our dreams and to help other people.
FINDINGbalance	38963	7	/users/profile/39888	dr-jerry-law	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/14/2010	In my work as a professional Interventionist I am continually looking for tools to assist individuals suffering from eating disorders.  FINDINGbalance serves as a powerful resource for answers to the complex issues involved in these diseases.  Family members as well and those who are struggling with these diseases will find answers to their questions about ED on the expansive FINDINGbalance website through its impressive library of video clips and articles.  The ease of use of the FINDINGbalance website makes it one of the most effective tools in the battle against ED available to the general public.  Many of the foremost authorities in the country on ED treatment have volunteered their time and expertise to the FINDINGbalance site and cutting edge information is readily available at the click of a button. Constance Rhodes and the entire Fb team are committed to eliminating the stigma and shame often associated with ED and bringing compassion and care to hurting individuals and families.  Their work matters and makes a difference
FINDINGbalance	38950	6	/users/profile/39873	emily10	Volunteer	5	05/14/2010	As a former anorexic, I understand extremes. For Type-A personalities, it's so easy to be extreme, to swerve from starving to over-eating, and I understand the fear which drives both. FINDINGbalance is all about removing that unhealthy fear, and establishing peace. Founded by someone who understands the swinging pendulum of an eating disorder, Fb strives to help former disordered eaters believe in love--perfect love--so that fear might be driven away, and balance restored, through food, exercise, and relationships. I can testify to the power of this organization, and to the need for its message to reach America's seven million women and one million men battling an eating disorder.
FINDINGbalance	38924	1	/users/profile/39841	pablo1	Donor	5	05/14/2010	In my opinion, this nonprofit stands out because it deals with personal issues related to image, consumption, and life habits. Because its approach focuses more on the causes than the effects of negative thought patterns, it provides deep answers to serious questions. Not only have I benefited from their free online service, but also get to tap into a real community that is exceptionally honest. While some nonprofits see valid problems in others or institutions, this one doesn't point fingers. That in itself breeds humility and true care, something our society really needs.

Shores of Grace Ministries	165845		/users/profile/220350	Brendan5	Volunteer	5	08/22/2013	I spent three months with Shores of Grace in Recife, Brazil, and I am soon heading back to continue my work with them. They fill a role in Brazil that few others do, and the work they do saves and restores lives. They are rescuing kids out of homelessness, abuse, and prostitution. In Brazil, the number of kids stuck in this plight is hard to take in. You can go to Recife and see it for yourself: more homeless kids on one corner than all those you have ever seen in any other place, at any other time, combined. Many have been abused or raped or prostituted, and many of themselves are keeping themselves in a constant high with a bottle of industrial strength glue, to numb the pain in their hearts. Shores of Grace is one of the few ministries working actively in Recife and in all of Brazil to rescue these kids. The first rescue home is open and is already full, with 10 girls whose lives have been saved from a bleak future and given new hope. Everyone here has a huge heart and goes above the call of duty to see lives saved and restored.

Two weeks after we returned to the USA they opened their first rescue home for girls. It was full in 2 weeks! The need is great and they meet it with open arms, much love, safety and provision for these precious ones ranging in age from 5 to 15. Everyone on the Shores of Grace team has a huge heart. Children of the team are just as involved in helping to bring love to these precious girls. They hope to open a home for boys caught in this awful web of sex trafficking.

Donor	5	04/05/2013	Shores of Grace goes into the worst parts of the cities in Brazil to seek out those caught in sex trafficking, especially children. They are opening their first rescue home so they will have a place to offer these children. They will live there, be fed, be clothes, be educated but especially be loved by the Shores of Grace team. The team pours into children's lives now, calling them to their destiny. The team visits brothels and prays for the prostitutes, bouncers and owners. They go to dangerous parts of town and have church on the street for ones that often church members cross the street to avoid. They don't just bring clean clothes, good food and books - they bring hope! Nic Billman started the ministry and his brother Luke has joined the team which includes Americans and Brazilians. Both Billman families minister together - even the children, who play with the rescued precious ones and share their parents with them!

They minister that same value to prostitutes and transvestites on the streets of Brazil. I'be seen it first hand and the interaction affected me deeply.
Shores of Grace Ministries	152334		/users/profile/174213	Kirstin N.	Donor	5	04/05/2013	Shores of Grace continues to do amazing work - beyond any human capability without the grace and blessings of God! I've known Nic and Luke since they were young and to see their growth, transformation, and love of God that they share with others is amazing. They have both dedicated their lives, moved their families to Brazil and reach out to those in need every single day. May God continue to bless this ministry so that they can continue blessing others. 
Shores of Grace Ministries	128920		/users/profile/174213	Kirstin N.	Donor	5	10/25/2012	Shores of Grace is the real deal - their hearts and lives are 100% for Jesus and helping others. They continue to amaze me with their ministries, worship and love. Supporting them means spreading God's word and love to the nations, helping those in desperate need and helping to end prostitution and the sex trade.
Shores of Grace Ministries	149025		/users/profile/198534	United Kingdom Movement for Christian Evangelism	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2013	They do the work we all should, helping disadvantaged children and poor people who have lost their hope due to no fault of their own.  If you are able to finance this work and you are reading this please help them to continue their work. If they didn't do it nobody would. If you are reading this Bill Gates then this is the type of work your charity should help. Its honest selfless work that helps support poor disadvantaged people. 
Shores of Grace Ministries	143817	1	/users/profile/190304	Kathy90	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	We are so blessed by this ministry. This minsirty was started by Nic, Rachael, Luke, and Alison Billman. We currently are apart of their record label, Shores Music. This ministry goes into the poorest parts of Brazil, rescuing the families involved in the trafficking industry. They move from the deepest parts of the Father's heart, and step out of the comforts of the america to do so. They see Jesus in the eyes of the prostitute. I'm blessed to know them, and be apart of the Shores Family. If you're looking to invest into something greater and more meaningful, please donate to this ministry. www.shoresofgrace.com
Shores of Grace Ministries	142933		/users/profile/189361	Carol85	Donor	5	11/26/2012	The first time I heard of the work of Shores of Grace, I was captivated. The Billmans and those who work with them are reaching vulnerable people whom are ignored by much of society. They have brought the issue of sex-trafficking to the attention of many. More than raising awareness, the personal involvement that they have in the individual lives of hurting, marginalized people makes their ministry stand apart. The Bethany Project is key in doing this work of mercy! Join me in supporting this ministry!
Shores of Grace Ministries	136685		/users/profile/182621	Masters4	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2012	The work being done by Shores of Grace Ministries illustrates the core of the Christian gospel:  Showing God's unconditional love for the most desperate and un-loved of Brazil's society by teaching them how to love themselves and learn of God's love for them.  Our personal friendship with the Billman family has shown us their compassionate, loving spirits and their desire to reach out to those in need.  We wholeheartedly support them and the wonderful work they are doing.

I love listening to their worship music and just knowing that they are in Brazil  ministering to men and women who need to know how much that Jesus loves them!!  They help those who have been deeply wounded by the world to see their place as God's children.  I love what they do!!!  
Shores of Grace Ministries	133399		/users/profile/179111	Freda T.	Donor	5	11/04/2012	I highly recommend Shores of Grace Ministries.  What they are doing in Brazil and what they want to accomplish is amazing.  They regularly send out newsletters with pictures of the lives they are touching.   They have visited our church (we pastor a church in Maryland) many times and each times the lives of our congregation our touched and changed.

Shores of Grace Ministries	131780		/users/profile/177366	Deborah40	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2012	Our family has been touched by the Billmans and their worship. We are worship leaders too and hunger to have more of this intimate worship corporately. You can tell they have such a close relationship with God by their songs to the Lord and the strong presence of God with that worship. That presence of God changes atmospheres and lives. That's what this world needs is more of God's presence! To pick up and follow God to a new country with children, and to serve on the "front lines" as they do takes hearing and obeying God and that shows their integrity and true hearts to honor and serve Him.  We know they will touch and change lives where ever God takes them because His Presence goes with them!
Shores of Grace Ministries	131757	1	/users/profile/177343	nancy thimm	Donor	5	10/31/2012	I have known Luke and Nic Billman all their lives. I have watched them grow from babies to adulthood, attended their weddings, rejoiced as their own families grew along with their faith.  How God is moving in their lives in truly amazing.  Their ministry in Brazil has had such an impact on the lives of those they are helping.  To teach these lost ones about Jesus who loves them, to open their arms to them and help them to find a better way is truly a gift from God.  May their lives continue to be blessed so they can continue to be a blessing.  Nancy T.
Shores of Grace Ministries	131610		/users/profile/177181	Darlene C.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	My husband and I have a house church in Maryland and are so very honored to know the Billman family. They are sex trade abolishionists whose main desire is to set all captives free and display the true love of the Father!!! We love them so very much. Shores of Grace is a worship and missionary ministry currently headquartered in Curitiba Brazil, led by Nic and Rachael Billman soon to be joined by Luke and Allison Billman. Their main focus is setting those in prostitution/sex trade industry free and walking them through healing and restoration; taking the love of the Father to the poor,needy,wounded and the broken people and helping them see their true Identity and value, and equipping and serving the churches in Brazil. The goal of the ministry teams. I believe is to  reveal Father God in every aspect of what they are ministering. Sometimes its in the form of leading worship in a church or it could be walking the streets of Brazil and praying ofr people that they meet. The probably # goal besides rescuing the lost ,stolen,broken is that in everything they do... they want to reveal the Father. They take this calling that God has placed on their lives very,very seriously and they believe that it's a calling for the whole church, for every son and daughter of the living God.They are forerunners and they set the example well of living a life  of love, compassion and power where signs wonders, miracles and healing and most of all LOVE follow them everywhere they go, just as with King Jesus.They are amazing folks. We love them!!!

Shores of Grace Ministries	131488		/users/profile/177051	Advocate2	Advisor	5	10/30/2012	This nonprofit excels at loving the "least of these" on the streets of Brazil, as they help to rescue young girls from prostitution.  I know the Billman family personally and they break my heart in a good way for these abandoned kids, while bringing their own children to live among them.  They are sacrificing so much to bring the love of the Father to this place.  A great cause and a great nonprofit.  I can't believe how much they have accomplished with so little.  Please help if you can.
Shores of Grace Ministries	131068		/users/profile/176602	sergeantpreston	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	These people have given of their lives to help the people they are working with. What greater sacrifice could they give then to live in harm's with their children to help the people. What greater cause can there be to give of your life to save and help others. They are worthy of every support they can recieve.
Shores of Grace Ministries	130995		/users/profile/176525	Paulette R.	Client Served	5	10/30/2012	An amazing ministry that more people need to hear about.  The people they are reaching out to have no one one to show them God's love and grace.

Shores of Grace Ministries	130971		/users/profile/176491	Roberta Robbie Pack	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2012	As a short term missionaries, my husband and I are familiar with Nic and Rachael Billman and what it means to be sincere in their calling.  We've ministered with Nic. And have followed their ministry in Brazil with enthusiasm. Despite having our own ministry expenses, we've felt led to help them in their wonderfully sincere sharing of the heart of God to street walkers of all ages, throw away children, and everyone else God directs them to. They do so with such love and a touch of humor. And they see real results.

Shores of Grace Ministries	130801		/users/profile/176301	Tom_30	Donor	4	10/29/2012	The need for ministry to the street youth in Recife Brazil as well as many other villages there is profound and Shores of Grace outreach to these young adults will have a huge impact on countless affected kids.  The culture of youth prostitution and trafficking around the world has grown into a large problem that is really just gaining recognition.  The mission being undertaken by Luke and Alisan Billman with Shores of Grace ministries will hopefully spur growth of this effort across the country of Brazil and into other countries. Their message of unconditional love in the name of Jesus Christ is something many there have never heard and can be used to start building upon a new foundation for a future where there previously had been little or no foundation or support for any future.

Their ministry is one that I can give with the confidence that it is being used to make a huge difference in this world for the Best!

Shores of Grace Ministries	130203		/users/profile/175666	Patti M.	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2012	Nic and Rachael are truely annointed to God's work and have a commitment that goes beyond words.  They truely seek to let Go'ds Spirit guide them in ways which many of we Christians pass off as crazy ideas.  They were ministering in our church's praise team and as youth pastors at the time God called them to Brazil.  They had reached many people here in the US with their music and prayer ministry, but God's plans were bigger.  With great courage and trust in God, they went to battle prositution in a country where it is considered legal.  We cannot comprehend that here in the US....prositution legal.  The truely heart breaking part is the amount of children hurt by this practice.  Children orphaned by prositution are on the streets. Children sold into prositution by families. Shores of Grace is seeking to show children and prosititutes the way out....God's way....God's TRUE Shores of Grace with no condemnation, just love.
Shores of Grace Ministries	130198		/users/profile/175660	Sewilson	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2012	Shores of Grace Ministries is such an awesome project. So many issues are over looked in our world today, and this group of Missionaries are following God's instructions to help the least of these. The love that these people share with those in Brazil might only be for an hour or even just 5 minutes, but that love might be the only true love that individual has experienced in all or most of their life. Touching out to these individuals is such a life changing opportunity for them. I love supporting this group and I love everything they stand for!
Shores of Grace Ministries	130081		/users/profile/175529	sltalley65	Donor	5	10/26/2012	Nic and Rachel don't just talk the talk but truly walk the walk.

Because of the economy I cut back from charities  but when I prayed about Shores of Grace,  the Lord told me this is a work he wanted me to still give to. I know God is faithful and will suppy for this ministry,  as it is the Father's Heart.  Nic & Rachel and their family give so much of themselves to this ministry, that I feel it is an honor and privilege to help in the only way that I can. For any one who helps the least of these  God will surely bless.  This is one ministry where you will know you are walking in the will of God if you donate.

The clarity of their vision carries over to the clarity of their communication.  We trust them and they have been responsive with us over the years.  They periodically return to the United States and visit with the churches and people that support and pray for them.  They are accessible by email and that means a lot as well.  This a quality ministry!

They have given their lives to bring freedom to those who have no hope.  Their music stirs my heart - with a response of worship to Almighty God.  My daughter attended one of their meetings in a small town near us.  She was impressed with their heart of service and worship to God.  THese are ones who are actually doing something about the brokenness in our world.  It is an honor to be one of those supporting them in prayer.
Shores of Grace Ministries	129648		/users/profile/175028	ChrisI	Donor	5	10/26/2012	I have known the leaders, staff, and many volunteers of Shores of Grace for some time, and consider it an honor to get to partner with them financially, and just stand with them. Nic and Rachael Billman have the heart, the knowledge, and the passion to truly see an end to human trafficking on the streets of Recife, Brazil. It's rare to see such a combination, but I recognized it in them when I first heard about their vision for Brazil. It's a big one, but one they are going to see fulfilled. They are establishing practices now that will enable the vision to be sustainable, powerful, and easily duplicated all over the world. This isn't your ordinary non-profit; I give with confidence knowing my dollars aren't going to get tied up in red-tape, exorbitant salaries, and politics. You should, too.
Shores of Grace Ministries	129633		/users/profile/175013	vivianc	Donor	5	10/26/2012	I served in international children's ministry for 10 years through Aldersgate Renewal Ministries and Kids' Evangelism Explosion.  My heart breaks when I hear of children trapped into providing the selfish needs of adults (whether physical or financial) instead of living their lives as God's children. The members of Shores of Grace Ministries have boldly moved their families to Brazil to make a difference, to put a stop to this horrible sex trade and to bring the children "home" to safe havens where they can learn about TRUE LOVE through Jesus Christ. It is so easy to get caught up in the busyness of life and to ignore what's going on in the world, but we must get our heads out of the sand and go after this evil thru prayer and by supporting those like the Billmans who are called to serve in the midst of the storm of immorality.

They are reaching out to vulnerable and hurting people, offering love and hope and practical wisdom and resources to transform their lives. They are undaunted by short-term obstacles as they always keep the long view in mind. They are both seeking to lay a foundation for a long-term, large scale project in excellence, and they are willing to work with whatever they have in moment without complaining. 
Shores of Grace Ministries	129503		/users/profile/174868	Cathy37	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2012	This is an organization that I follow to see what they are doing.  I love the stories of individual people they are serving.  Many organizations are only interested in helping large groups.  While this organization does help many people, they do not object to stopping for the "one" person who they can make a difference for.  I really appreciate the simplicity and humbleness of heart that this attribute demonstrates.

Shores of Grace Ministries	129343		/users/profile/174712	82petersen	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	Shores of Grace is doing amazing work - they are loving the unlovable (those victimized by sex trafficking who are only used and not loved...) simply for love's sake. They are changing lives and not in a corporate, sweeping approach - they take the time to learn and appreciate each person for who they are. Shores of Grace is not looking for boxes to be checked, but they are spending as much time and love as is needed to bring healing and ministry to every individual and then they empower them to live a better life and pass on the love :)

Shores of Grace Ministries	129299		/users/profile/174669	aharvester	Donor	5	10/25/2012	Shores of Grace is great! I know Luke & Nick Billman and their families. They are doing what mist people would never consider doing. They have left everything comfortable and secure to rescue prostitutes and their children from lives of desperation and hopelessness in Brazil. They are loving on them and bringing the to the Living Water--to the lavish grace and forgiveness of Jesus Christ. Miracles abound as they follow the call of God and give selflessly of themselves to those who are valueless to most people, but of great worth to Father God.  They are truly God-called, and He opens the doors for them.

They make connections with 'the least these" and help them get out of the dark places so many are stuck. They are providing help and a way out of the sex trade.

Shores of Grace Ministries	129182		/users/profile/174542	Jessica79	Donor	5	10/25/2012	Nic, Rachel, and their family are on the front lines confronting a serious, global issue - human trafficing in the sex trade industry.  They are rescuing children and young adults from a lifetime of abuse, neglect, and hopelessness.  They are giving life to children again from where it was stolen.  They are making a huge impact!  Their mission is essential and should be modeled elsewhere around the world. Thank you Nic and Rachel!  Jessica, Albuquerque, NM. 
Shores of Grace Ministries	129143		/users/profile/174495	keeper425	Donor	5	10/25/2012	I was listening one day to worship music on internet radio and heard the song Shores of Grace. The anointing of God on the music could be felt as I wanted to stop what I was doing and worship God. It took me a while to discover them because I didn't know the name of the song or who sang it, but he that seeks will find. I ordered all of their music available at the time and was really impressed to find out that their heart is to bring people to Jesus and see them set free from a life in bondage; and this was even more important to them than the worship. I truly believe they are carriers of the anointing of God and are doing serious damage to the plans of the enemy. I pray for them often and support them financially. 
Shores of Grace Ministries	129098		/users/profile/174439	prescottrealty	Donor	5	10/25/2012	Shores of Grace is a wonderful ministry that is doing God's work saving children and young adults from sex slavery.  The hearts of the Billmans are totally committed to this cause.  They are driven by the Spirit and are doing His work on a daily basis.  I can't think of a better ministry to support because we are called to take care of the orphans and the widows...that is what they do.  Please support them as they begin the process of opening the first resuce home in the region for these children.

The goalfor this organization helps bring self confidence to young women caught in acts of violence , prostitution and illegal activity gives them hope.

Shores of Grace Ministries	129035	1	/users/profile/174356	MarkandSarah W.	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	I had never heard about Shores of Grace until some good friends of ours introduced us to it. My husband and I had just miscarried a baby right after these friends of ours moved out of state. A few weeks later we received in the mail a letter from them, letting us know that they'd made a donation to Shores of Grace Ministries in honor of our baby who is now in Heaven. It blessed us so much, not only that our dear friends cared so much about us, but also that they chose to honor the memory of our sweet child by donating money to an important cause. The fact that these friends of ours chose this specific ministry to donate to made an impact on me. I know that this ministry is incredibly important because of what they do, and I feel so blessed to have a small part in it. This ministry is absolutely vital and must be supported by prayer, financial means, and by serving.

What they have accomplished in their time in Brazil is amazing.  The annointing on Nic and Rachel, their family and their music is life changing.  I respect that they use their music to raise funds to support their missions work.  I have been blessed by their music and inspired by their testimonies.

They are one of the most beautiful examples of the love of Jesus I've ever known.  You discover their heart for these dear ones caught in the sex trade through their music.

Every time we hear of how a child or adult is taken out of the sex trade and has a new life in Christ we are super-charged with excitement and joy.  We rejoice with the Angles in heaven for the victory the Father has done through Shores of Grace.  The music is awesome, I feel it is the gateway to the throne of God.   They use the gift God has given them for music and reaching out to those who are in need.  They are relentless.    Thanks for that you do,  EB

In their area, they restore life and hope to prostitutes and  the broken and homeless  of any age group, etc.  Their sacrifice of life as we know it in America, is huge, as it brings life to multitudes who have lost quality of life.  The heart of this family through worship, ministry, etc. is immense and is making a huge impact world wide.

While many others simply talk about helping the poor, Nic and Rachel Billman are out on the streets in the wee hours of the night ministering and bringing food, clothing, hope, and healing to the prostitutes, drug addicts, street children, and many who are in dire straits.  Their love is infectious and their impact noticeable in the lives of those they care for.  I've known them for several years, and what they are doing in Brazil is inspiring.

I was so impressed with their anointed worship, I introduced myself to them and purchased their only CD at the time.  Since, I have learned of the effects their ministry is having on the sex trade and child trafficking around the world.  We have hosted their ministry and intend to continue hosting them as they visit America on tours.  I hope to go to Brazil and work along side of Shores of Grace as a missionary to their cause.  We so like their music, we not use it as our worship music of choice, but also play it as background music in our conferences and prayer meetings.  Of all ministries we support, Shores of Grace is among the top ten we feel is doing great impact worthy of our friendship and support.  John Reed, Founder of East Gate Glory, Lancaster, Ohio

While similar organizations focus on awareness, feeding programs, prevention or shelter, Shores of Grace encompasses all of these things with their approach of creating a loving family to change the lives of trafficked children and the homeless child population in the world. No matter what the kids are doing when they encounter them on the streets they meet them with loving arms and walk them through restoration in one of their rescue homes. They are truly world changing history makers!!

Creative Aging Memphis	233140		/users/profile/179208	Diana Stein	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/06/2014	Creative Aging is a wonderful organization that I've been privileged to work with for the past 10 years.It affords me the experience of working with diverse groups of seniors, and connecting with them in a very personal, even intimate, way.  The best shows are when I feel a deep connection being made between those listening and the music.  Sometimes they will sing, or just move with their own particular styling and it's rather thrilling to see it, feel it, and be a part of it.  I think the residents of these senior facilities are being provided a look at their past lives & loves & passions;  presenting music is a very real way of connecting these dots, as music is so reminiscent of earlier times, so nostalgic, and alsospiritual in its own way.  I'm thankful for these times of sharing, and I can only hope I am getting better at it as I age.  It's such fun to share with these folks.  They inspire me to nurture.

Creative Aging does marvelous things in providing different types of art experiences for older people.

I've seen firsthand how this makes a difference in the lives of people they serve. It also supports the artist community in the Memphis area. As Joe Birch would say about Creative Aging, it's a win/win for all involved.  
Creative Aging Memphis	231614		/users/profile/162531	cloud9	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I believe in non-profits. They do the work that everyone says needs to be done. Non-profits take the ideas, recruit the volunteers, roll-up sleeves and get down to business. Creative Aging Memphis is one of those non-profits.  The unique thing is they actually serve two diverse communities: seniors and artists. In what I think is a brilliant idea, Creative Aging figured out how to educate, entertain and involve seniors by hiring artists, including musicians, dancers, singers, potters, story-tellers, painters and more. The two groups need each other in order to grow, thrive and maybe even survive.  And Creative Aging puts them together. I am thrilled to work with, volunteer for, and support wholly, Creative Aging Memphis. I am proud that Memphis is a city full of seniors and artists, all of whom we need, and through Creative Aging, we also cherish.
Creative Aging Memphis	119534		/users/profile/162531	cloud9	Board Member	5	07/30/2012	We need so many things in life: food and shelter for the body, love and art for the soul.   We need them when we are young and it doesn't stop when we are old.  The wonderful thing is, no matter what the age, Creative Aging Memphis provides love and art for the soul and helps provide food and shelter for the body.  Our musicians and artists come in all sizes and ages.  Working for Creative Aging helps pay some of their bills.  Working with Creative Aging exposes them to a world of love and gratitude.  Then there are the seniors who get a chance to sing, dance, draw or just dream after a visit from these musicians and artists.  Their world becomes a little bigger and a whole lot brighter.  Creative Aging Memphis gives everyone, entertainers and seniors alike, a chance to live and live well, no matter what their age.

Bringing the arts to those who can no longer access those once enjoyed activities is what Creative Aging does best.  Blending the right mix of caring and compassion and orchestrating an event that transports senior adults back to a time that was perhaps more gracious to them brings joy to thousands every year.  Whether music artisans or storytellers, senior adults love to reconnect with memories.  And watching them  make this incredible connection, watching them come alive when they hear an old familiar tune or hear a story that they knew as a child, this wonderment is contagious.  I have seen this in action and I am always amazed!
Creative Aging Memphis	126018	1	/users/profile/153202	Lynn21	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	We never ever, no matter what age, lose the need for connecting with others.  When we struggle cognitively, this becomes more difficult.  To watch an older adult connect with others through music and art is unbelievably moving.  It is nothing short of a miracle for someone suffering with dementia.  When I watch a performance sponsored by Creative Aging and I see this kind of miracle, I am so proud.  This is when I know that our mission is being carried out every day!!
Creative Aging Memphis	112553		/users/profile/153202	Lynn21	Board Member	5	05/21/2012	We never stop loving the arts..no matter what age.  The great feeling that music, story telling, visual arts and other art mediums give us is priceless. Many Senior adults are limited with mobility issues, financial restraints and other issues that keep them from enjoying the above. That is where Creative Aging MidSouth steps in.  CAM bridges the gap by providing quality performances and demonstrations to Senior adults.  They never have to pay, make reservations or even leave their residence. CAM comes to them.  If you could only see their faces, the sparkle in their eyes, the humming along;  then you would see why CAM exists.

The flyers are always very informative. Also, I am a  member of a Senior Center that is fortunately connected with Creative Aging and is often entertained by the many artists provided through them.
Creative Aging Memphis	229028		/users/profile/292697	jrjohnson	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	Creative Aging is a non-profit organization that accomplishes two worthy goals.  First of all, it provides a wide variety of artistic programs and on-hands craft activities to a diverse population of seniors citizens.  The performances are given in senior communities throughout Shelby County.  Secondly, Creative Aging employs local artists who give hundreds of performances each year to thousands of senior citizens.  Thus, both local artists and senior citizens benefit from this unique organization.   
Creative Aging Memphis	227354		/users/profile/173225	Lbobal	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	At our community, our goal is for all activities to be meaningful and purposeful. Creative Aging helps us achieve that goal by offering wonderful performances that engage our seniors and fantastic workshops that bring out the creativity in each of our residents.  Never disappointed, the talent that Creative Aging brings to our residents is always professional while delighting our residents and engaging them in meaningful activities.  Other communities may say "we can hire performers ourselves" but Creative Aging is much, much more than performances.  They bring access to the arts that our residents would no have the opportunity to engage in otherwise. 
Creative Aging Memphis	128093	1	/users/profile/173225	Lbobal	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2012	I work in an Assisted Living for people with dementia and Alzheimer's.  My first encounter with Creative Aging was there - we had gathered all the residents together to enjoy the performance of one of the Creative Aging musicians.  I was suprised to see Ms. Mary there - I had never heard her speak a word, but her daughter was visiting and decided to bring her mom to enjoy the music.  The performer that Creative Aging had sent instantly connected with our residents.  He sang lots of old songs that our residents were familiar with.  He began singing an Elvis tune and walked right up to Ms. Mary and put the microphone to her mouth.  I thought, oh no, she can't even speak - this will not go so well.  Boy was I surprised when she grab the mic and starting singing along - she knew all the words!  I was in tears - happy tears to see her enjoying this so much.  You see, sometimes, we may think that the older generation isn't all there - but they are!  You just have to find the right way to connect.  Creative Aging does this so well - they connect through music, art, spoken word and more.  Creative Aging brings joy and smiles to thousands of elder citizens in our community and I highly commend them for the work they do.

Creative Aging Memphis	227216		/users/profile/171622	JHSeacat	Board Member	5	10/27/2014	Performing and visual arts groups continually talk about the importance of audience participation or audience engagement. If you were to visit a senior community where a performance or workshop by the Memphis-based Creative Aging was under way, youd experience the quintessential audience engagement.  Here, in a non-traditional setting, artists are up-close and personal  whether musicians, storytellers, painters or weavers. Their work evokes memories, feelings, movement and expressions of joy.   Such engagement of seniors offers a sense of pleasure and decreases stress, isolation, loneliness and promotes memory health. You couldnt find a more appreciative audience not to mention the dedication of the artists.

Many of these folks are generally disenfranchised, fragile and underserved as they live in nursing homes. Other seniors who benefit from over 600 arts performances and workshops a year are in day care centers, assisted living or attend senior centers. The most recent performance I attended was a storytelling performance by a professional storyteller. The audience responded by remembering their own most cherished stories and sharing them with each other. Is there a better way to enhance cognitive and social health? Go online to www.creativeagingmidsouth.org to see how you can support this great nonprofit. 
Creative Aging Memphis	60707		/users/profile/66097	barbsysak	Board Member	5	01/22/2011	Just moving to Memphis in June, I was seeking a not-for-profit board opportunity where my time would add value to the lives of the fragile and frail in society. Creative Aging of the MidSouth (CAM) does just that! CAM provides live art performances to about 40 different older adult facilities/centers including nursing homes, retirement communities, assisted living and daycare facilities in the Memphis area. Having attending one of these programs, I was amazed at how the performer was able to engage his elderly audience-- seeming to bring them alive as if they were teens again at a blues concerts! I knew this organization (CAM) was doing the right thing! And I wanted to help.
Creative Aging Memphis	155298		/users/profile/153338	Ronda2	Board Member	5	04/18/2013	I am very involved with Memphis-area non-profits, so when I met the folks from Creative Aging a couple of years ago I asked, "What can I do?" That's how I became a board member.  And I've done a lot since then, not because I am particularly wonderful, but because they are.  The concept of fostering creativity in our senior friends and neighbors is a must.  Staying vital, interested, informed and entertained is something we work for our entire lives...not just at 20-something.  Add to that the fact that by offering the arts to seniors, Creative Aging also supports the artistic community and you have a win-win.  I am humbled by the chance to do something meaningful and lasting...and fun!  My dream is for everyone to get to be a senior served by Creative Aging.  
Creative Aging Memphis	112654		/users/profile/153338	Ronda2	Board Member	5	05/22/2012	I love Memphis.  The things we do in Memphis, change the world. Look at self-serve grocery stores, FedEx, Auto Zone, rock n roll, STAX, College of Art...the list goes on and on.  Now you can add Creative Aging to the list. Music and art know no boundaries, no 'isms,' no age limits.  We have the talent, we have the need and with Creative Aging, we have a way to put them together, singing and dancing and living all the way!

The programs bring a lot of joy to the residents and it add tremendously to their  lives. I had the opportunity to play at an independent living facility and one woman told me that  live music gives them so much to look forward to. I always have a warm feeling when I leave a performance, whether I am the performer or a spectator because it is easy to see the difference in the residents when they have a great "Arts" experience. It's definitely food for their souls.

I thought that I could do  it on my own just like I had aways done without the assistance from Creative Aging Midsouth. But after working with Meryl and Barbara I have realized that I need this program. It helps with the cost especiallly with a small activity budget. It also has a long list of quality and diversed  entertainners to choose from. But best of all, Creative Aging MidSouth has saved my life more than once when some of the entertainners had an emergency at the last minute and could not honor their committment.  Barbara was very helpful in sending replacements. You can not get that kind of service any where else. Thank you so very much!  Tony Sovian
Creative Aging Memphis	152453		/users/profile/203445	Lynn D	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	The most rewarding part of being a Board Member is to watch the performances at Nursing Faiclities and see the absolute joy in in the eyes of older adults who are engaged in the performance.  Those with dementia whose remote memory is still intact seemd mezmorized.  Hearing something familiar and recalling memories of times past is both exciting and healing.  This transformation is truly amazing; at the last performance I had the honor of attending, one lady sang along with most every song.  As I watched her sing and clap her hands to the music, I had to believe that no matter what she is facing in the future, today held treasures beyond belief. Lynn Doyle
Creative Aging Memphis	127667		/users/profile/172756	RNethery	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/22/2012	I work with Creative Aging MidSouth as a musician and its has been a blessing for me in a thousand ways. I see firsthand the great work of this organization. Many of the residents of these facilities dont have a lot to look forward to in life so when I see a smile on a face with a mind so far from reality or a person with a physical disability move to the beat of a songI see a miracle. Music, songs and interaction with someone so far away is universal. It is Gods light shining thru and Im so humbled to be a small part of that. To bring a fond memory to a patient or resident of a Nursing home or retirement facility is worth more all the gold this world holds. Ive learned that youre working for something much bigger than yourself. It makes me so happy if I ever bring a smile to a person less fortunate than myself. To say its a privilege is an understatement. My simple words can never describe the joy it brings to my heart. Im truly blessed to be a part of Creative Aging. Growing older is not an exclusive club, its a party to which we are all invited and well attend someday. Ill do my best to help them enjoy the journey. Rick Nethery / Memphis Tn. 10/22/12

After seeing how much this meant to so many Seniors, I wanted to be part of such an organization that brought so much happiness. Shortly after my "Gama's" birthday, I was asked if I would be interested in being a Board Member of Creative Aging Memphis. I couldn't say "yes" fast enough and that was six years ago. In six years, I have seen Seniors move and grove to some of Memphis' most prominent musicians to reading stories written in creative writing workshops by Seniors who thought they would never be able to tell their story just to name a couple of ways the arts have not only touched but made the lives of Seniors. Creative Aging Memphis not only is providing arts to our Seniors, but Creative Aging Memphis also pays these artists for their performances and workshops putting dollars back in the arts.

Creative Aging stands out to me because the good they do is pure benevolence. No one benefits from CAM's fund raising, their programs or their outreach but the people in care facilities that they serve. Fueled almost exclusively by volunteer power, CAM puts real art in these facilities, engaging the residents in workshops and performances and letting them participate in the arts. I've had loved ones in care homes in other cities, without access to this type of enrichment, and the places they lived lacked the spice and spark of the facilities I've visited that benefit from CAM's programs.

At the time, I knew nothing about the organization but since my first Board meeting, which was an all day planning session, I was simply bowled over by the Power of the Organization. It is a worthy cause on all levels and brings a beautiful level of grace and charm to the Seniors who otherwise would have little or no experience with the Arts. I have played the violin since I was 6 and find that the spiritual nourishment that is provided through the arts is as important to the soul as food is to the body.

The physical and psychological effects of Creative Aging's events can be measured with smiles and happy stories their senior audience tells.

Creative Aging Memphis	60537		/users/profile/65869	pegelah	Board Member	4	01/20/2011	I became familiar with Creative Aging in the Spring of 2009.  With my fondness of Elders, I quickly paid attention and discovered that Creative Aging was creating such a "need" in our Community.   I became a Member of the Board in June 2009.  Quickly enough I learned even more about this organization and was so touched and happy whenever I experienced performances.  More importantly, watching the recipients was fabulous! Interestingly enough, I became employed at at the Ave Nursing Home in Bartlett, TN in June 2010.  I am the Activities Director of the Nursing Home.   Upon arrival, Creative Aging was already established with Ave Maria and acts were already booked.  I saw even more excitement from the Residents than I had ever seen as just a Board Member.  It was so much more "up close and personal" to my delight!  In fact, the other day at our January Resident birthday party, one of the Residents said, "the best performers we have always come from Creative Aging".  This Resident had no idea that I happened to be on the Board. I guess the point is, it's not just me loving what I hear, see, experience.  It is, if fact, the recipients.  The ones that matter. Peggy Lichterman

Creative Aging Memphis	60421		/users/profile/65692	Bobby F.	Donor	5	01/19/2011	My name is Bobby Frison, Activity Director @ Apple Grove assisted living here in Memphis, TN. We have been using Creative Aging services for10 months. My Alzheimer's patients absolutely adore the performers that creative aging hand picks. Every Friday here at Apple Grove my residents get the surprise of a life time with some of Memphis best talent. Creative Aging has performers from all walks of life and if we weren't able to use their services I don't know what I would be entertaining with... I guess it would have to be puppet shows every Friday...lol. I'm so glad that I get to express just how much we here at Apple Grove love Creative Aging and what they bring here to Memphis assisted living & nursing home facilities.... Thank you Soooooo Much.... Hugs&Kisses

When the performances ocurred they gather to have a good time, to sing along and sometimes even dance. My favorites are the birthday parties,  it's priceless to be there to sing and celebrate the lives of those that gave their work to the community and that now are retired but shouldn't be forgotten.I thank CAM so much for all their efforts to improve our seniors quality of life.
Creative Aging Memphis	60398		/users/profile/65663	Lee Cagle	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	Creative Aging Memphis provides much needed interactive programming for seniors in residential centers.  All of the programs from CAM allow residents to attend events that, depending on their mobilility, they may otherwise miss if required to attend "off-campus."   Even participants who have cognitive disabilities show signs of recognition during a musical performance.  I have personally witnessed reactions from residents that are nothing short of miraculous.  The family members that are sometimes with the seniors at those times become overjoyed to see reactions from their loved ones.
Creative Aging Memphis	60392		/users/profile/65653	madelyne	Board Member	5	01/19/2011	I have worked for several years  with Creative Aging as a Board Member and still am impressed with the work that we do.  Creative Aging provides musical entertainment and visual art workshops at senior centers, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes.  I have visited some of these facilities and observed the happiness, joy and memories that come from hearing the music and also how art has brought out creativity in our senior adults.  Periodically,  we  have musicians join MIFA volunteers when they deliver Meals on Wheels .  What a surprise the music along with theirdaily meal  has brought to the homebound.  
Creative Aging Memphis	60363		/users/profile/65616	Lea J.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/19/2011	Creative Aging Memphis is a wonderful organization that brings QUALITY entertainment to the senior citizen community.  Music is one of the most lasting, and emotionally driven important parts of life.  Music can relieve pain, stress, and bring healing to senior citizens in a nursing home community.  Music provides caregivers with an important boost to their efforts. Many activities directors, while they are grateful for volunteers who provide music, recognize that the quality isn't always the best.  Creative Aging allows them to bring in professionals at  a fraction of the cost. For performers, being able to support their craft financially allows more opportunities for them to give back to the community.

As a member of an ensemble who provides programs for our senior members of our community, my heart is warmed with the broad smiles and participation of our audience members.  As a resident of a retirement facility I know my community members look forward to the quality of the programs which are provided.  Creative Aging makes difference.
Elephant Sanctuary	319352	1	/users/profile/410793	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/22/2016	The Elephant Sanctuary is truly heaven on earth for these elephants.    Being given the opportunity to do tasks to support their care is amazing.    I was so sad when the day was over.   The staff is so great.    We had tasks to do that we could see would directly impact the girls which was so rewarding.    If you have the opportunity to volunteer, you will be blessed.   Seeing the girls was an added bonus and I will never forget it.    
Elephant Sanctuary	319306		/users/profile/410708	Fjordsabgone	Donor	5	11/21/2016	I fell in love at 6 years old with Alice, the first elephant I've ever met.  Since the Elephant Sanctuary opened, I discovered a way to have that connection again, later in my life, by supporting this organization that offers a life home to retired zoo and circus elephants.  The work and dedication the staff brings to enrich the lives and help "the girls" live out their days in rural Tennessee should be reconized and embraced for keeping the sanctuary a private place.  Their outreach via the website and social media helps one be part of the elephants world and contribute to their well being and care.  Support The Elephant Sanctuary today.
Elephant Sanctuary	313251		/users/profile/404622	Diane201	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	The Elephant Sanctuary of Tennessee is an absolutely amazing facility. The care and love for these beautiful creatures is evident in many ways from the 2700 kept acres they provide for these retired elephants to roam to the daily foot care routine. The elephants are free to be elephants again. They are no longer for the amusement of humans; therefore, there are no tours. As one of a few people chosen to volunteer for a day of work, I did see some of the elephants but from a distance and never for extended lengths of time. The staff does this to make sure that the elephants do not get anxious or feel they are on display again. It's a TRUE sanctuary run by people who most definitely understand, love, and care passionately for these once abused and ill treated beauties. They ensure that retirement is as blissful as possible. I wish more elephants were this lucky.
Elephant Sanctuary	312035		/users/profile/403390	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	I recently had the opportunity to participate in a volunteer day at The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee (TES).  On a beautiful October day my partner and I made our way to the Sanctuarys Elephant Discovery Center, where we met up with the other volunteers and the Sanctuarys Education Manager, Todd.  We followed him to the grounds of TES, where we spent a thoroughly enjoyable day assisting in various tasks (painting, clearing brush, etc.).  We had all been emailed in advance to notify us what activities we would be participating in and what items we needed to bring, so everyone was well prepared with water bottles, sunscreen, etc. Having done volunteer work for other groups, I found this experience to be one of the best organized and enjoyable endeavors I have undertaken.  Todd kept us well informed about the Sanctuary and its operation.  In addition, we learned a great deal about elephants and the problems they face in captivity as well as in the wild.  We had the opportunity to spend a gorgeous fall day in beautiful middle Tennessee and though we were warned there was no guarantee we would see elephants, we caught a glimpse or two of these majestic animals.  All in all this was a fantastic opportunity I hope presents itself again.  The Elephant Sanctuary is a very worthy cause that I was happy to volunteer for.
Elephant Sanctuary	305816	1	/users/profile/397088	jlh999	Volunteer	5	09/21/2016	It was an outstanding experience.  It was hard sweaty work, but so worth it.  The staff was so sincere about their commitment to the elephants.  They were also very helpful and informative.  I learned so much.  It was an uplifting and rewarding experience.
Elephant Sanctuary	305615	2	/users/profile/396869	DKMOM50	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	This is a private Sanctuary who allow visiting volunteers to participate in improving the property only 8 times a year.  You have to sign up for a lottery and hope to be drawn for opportunity to help.  My experience was everything that I hoped for.  It was made very special through the stories from Stephanie and Todd helped us understand through the day.  We would ask a million questions and it help to reveal the true love this staff has for their elephant family.  They know them all by name, history and behavior.  They are awe struck on their families' improvements as they get introduce on how to be a free elephant.  Some take moments, other take months, but the time does not matter, they all the time they need to be free.Please image for the first 30 - 40 years of your life, you were confined, poked, prodded, and chained.  You had to do things unnatural or get punished.   Then finally one glorious day you are given the chance to move to the Elephant Sanctuary.  You are still in disbelief.OH MY.... First you can't believe the unfamiliar freedom and positive reward the humans give you.  You have never felt this kind of love and friendship.  Then you get  to discover other female elephants who want to get to know you and be friends.  Really, others like me who want to be my friend?  I don't know how to act.Heaven on earth.  That is the best way to describe what might be going on inside the minds of the lucky ones who get to live the rest of their MANY years at the 2, 700 acre private sanctuary.  NEVER again on display or having to perform for humans.Just being an elephant.  Doing elephant things.  And having humans who care.Peace
Elephant Sanctuary	301581	2	/users/profile/392541	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/26/2016	We were able to volunteer for an afternoon and it was so amazing to be put to work for such a good cause.  Visiting the sanctuary is a unique experience and the volunteer experience makes me feel closer to this charity that is doing good for these elephants.  I would highly recommend this experience and donating your time (and money) to this charity.  It's a beautiful area and I feel lucky to have been able to go.
Elephant Sanctuary	301498	1	/users/profile/392432	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/25/2016	I volunteered at the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, TN the summer of 2016,  We traveled from Ohio and arrived ready to roll @ 8:00 am.  We painted the stall of an African elephant named Sukari...a beautiful girl with long white tusks.  We were informed she rubs her tusks on the bars frequently and therefore a paint job was needed.  While we were painting we sneaked peeks at the 4 African elephants in their yard.  They are magnificent animals!  What an absolute joy to be a part of their world for one day :)  After painting, we traveled to the Asian Barn and ate in a nice air conditioned lunchroom.  More staff dropped by to answer any and all questions we had about these elephants and elephants in general.  After lunch, we weeded grapevines growing into fencing.  When complete, we traveled to the "Q" barn.  Q for quarantine as some of the elephants have medical issues.  There we witnessed the vast area in which they live.  We saw 3 Asian elephants peacefully eating and sharing companionship with each other.  For the first time in their lives, they can decide what they want to do!  This is their retirement home.   It was a privilege and honor to give back to these elephants who for years were abused and forced to live in substandard conditions either in circuses or zoos.  It was an experience of a lifetime!  I hope to return again soon.   Judy Volkerding
Elephant Sanctuary	297250	1	/users/profile/388033	FortheElephants	Volunteer	5	07/19/2016	I was very excited to be selected for a volunteer day at the Elephant Sanctuary, even though it meant working outside in the July heat for most of the day!  I appreciated the opportunity to help in any way that I could (weeding and painting barn doors), and I thoroughly enjoyed my fellow volunteers.  It was amazing just how far most of them had travelled to be there.  Getting to see the Sanctuary in person was priceless for me.  It hit home just how much devotion and hard work it must have taken to grow this place into what it is, which is nothing short of astounding!  
Elephant Sanctuary	297114	1	/users/profile/387891	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/18/2016	I have been donating and volunteering at the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, TN for many years.  I have been privileged to participate on 4 separate occasions.  Each and every time I learn something new about the elephants that the Sanctuary cares for and come away with a deeper sense of urgency to make others aware of the plight of elephants who are still in zoos and circuses in the U.S. as well as the world.  The Elephant Sanctuary staff make us all feel special and a part of the mission to care for these elephants, whether we are pulling weeds, painting doors, clearing brush, etc.  It is all for the greater good of the elephants to be allowed to be free and interact with each other in their natural environment.  Kudos to the Elephant Sanctuary for 20 years of great work....here's to at least 20 more years.
Elephant Sanctuary	291583	2	/users/profile/382021	Writer	Donor	5	05/31/2016	I have been a supporter of The Elephant Sanctuary beginning the first year and have the honor of serving as a board member.  We receive regular updates from CEO which includes detailed reports from caregivers about the elephants.  These reports are profound evidence of the professional knowledge and respect and love the caregivers have for the elephants as individuals.  In a perfect universe there would be no captive animals.  In the world we inhabit my wish is that all captive animals would have an environment comparable to the sanctuary and would be respected and loved as the elephants at The Elephant Sanctuary.
Elephant Sanctuary	290650	2	/users/profile/381013	Writer	Board Member	5	05/23/2016	As a member of The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee Board of Directors, I am enormously proud to be a part of this outstanding organization!  TES is providing superb national leadership in the humane and scientifically sound care of captive elephants.  Every time I meet with the caregivers, veterinarians, office staff and fellow Board members, I am reminded of what an outstanding team is working collaboratively to enhance the care of the elephants at TES.TES is an extraordinarily challenging endeavor: acquiring the land, providing the strong protective fencing, building the barns, recruiting the care staff with both dedication and knowledge, creating the educational programs, developing relationships with the community and regulatory authorities, attracting skilled veterinarians and elephant husbandry leaders, among many others, as well as raising the funding to permit all this good work to happen.To all this, the commitment of the CEO and staff is both passionate and exemplary.  The "girls" thrive in this environment of dedicated caring and competence.  They arrive often unwanted, ill, aging and physically compromised.  They are renewed, have their medical needs attended to, are comfortable in their heated barns in inclement weather and find joy in exploring the forest and ponds when the sun shines - as it so often does in Hohenwald.All is done with gentle persuasion; the elephants live in a free-choice environment.  This takes great skill and understanding by the caregivers.  In all, TES represents the highest standard for captive elephant care in America.  This is a profound accomplishment.  The welcome mat is out for further elephants to join our happy girls.
Elephant Sanctuary	290646	2	/users/profile/381008	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/23/2016	It's an honor to write a review for The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee since I have been affiliated with them for over 20 years as a founding member.  What started as a small Mom and Pop operation with one elephant has evolved into a massive project with a 4.5 million dollar annual budget.  They've rescued 27 elephants and are making room for dozens more.The reason that this matters so much is that elephants are among the most profound creatures on earth.  Their history in captivity is not pretty and the poaching of their tusks is an indescribable crime.  Most people do not know of the intellectual wisdom of elephants.  Their elaborate brains contain, like humans, VENs (Von Economo Neurons) which are specialized cells that relate to higher notions like empathy, intuition, communication and self-awareness.  These neurons are unusual in the animal kingdom and help explain the complex and deeply sensitive nature of elephants. I am proud to say that TES is fulfilling its mission daily by protecting and housing these wonderful elephants and by teaching the world about their value to us all!
Elephant Sanctuary	290523		/users/profile/380872	rk01322	Volunteer	5	05/21/2016	Being a volunteer at the Tennessee Elephant Sanctuary was an enlightening experience that very few people get the chance to do. I learned so many things about each elephant and about animal rights. All the people I met during my time were so friendly and hard working. You could tell that every person had a passion to be there. I am thankful that I was able to have this educational experience and will tell others about the great things this sanctuary has to offer! Keep up the amazing work!
Elephant Sanctuary	290408	1	/users/profile/380732	tumminelloangel	Volunteer	5	05/19/2016	After spending my week at The Elephant Sanctuary as an Alternative Break volunteer, I was blown away. When applying for the trip, I had no idea where the location would be, nor that I would be able to see such magnificent creatures as elephants. I am a Biology major, so animal conservation is something near and dear to me. This caused me to approach the opportunity very critically. However the staff's professionalism and their desire to educate others were astounding. It was also extremely satisfying and peaceful to see the elephants left to enjoy themselves and live out the rest of their days in peace. It was such a meaningful experience to volunteer for a more-than-worthy cause, and I plan to continue supporting TES and the wonderful work that they do. 
Elephant Sanctuary	290073	3	/users/profile/380343	austinmay	Volunteer	5	05/16/2016	Let's talk about the elephant in the room: this organization is dazzling. Every person that works here is committed to the mission statement. It's hard to understand the magnitude of that, I know. But in a world where most people go to work, punch a clock, and collect a check without really LIKING what they're a part of, it was refreshing to be surrounded by a staff who pounded the pavement every day for these elephants. That being said, the experience was nothing short of remarkable. And I don't use that word lightly. In literal terms: remarkable means something worth making a "remark" about. And so here we are. It's hard to express in words how palpable the week was when I volunteered. Imagine this: earth, wind, and fire are mighty elements that can disrupt and change things. So too was the service, education, and reflection throughout the week. It was satisfying doing the work, but it without the education from the staff and the reflection at nights from my group it would've been just taxing labor. I've written 1  review in my entire life before this. It was for a book that really changed my way of thinking. I felt obligated to write it since it did so much for my self-growth. But I don't fling them out like newspaper. So know that me writing this is a testament to how revered I see this place - and how much I was impacted by it albeit during a week's stay. They're doing something profound out there in Hohenwald, Tennessee and slowly putting the whole world on notice. 
Elephant Sanctuary	290072	2	/users/profile/380342	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/16/2016	The Elephant Sanctuary has the elephants welfare truly at heart. The sanctuary is truly "a sanctuary" allowing elephants to roam freely for acres at their own desire. The staff never makes an elephant do something that she is not interested in. Other than the veterinary care, they operate using a very hands off approach, making the sanctuary the most natural habitat possible for an animal who has been in captivity. The caregivers do not want the elephants to feel that human interaction is necessary, as some elephants have been scarred by humans in their past lives in circuses or zoos. I commend the Elephant Sanctuary for their practices. They proceed with caution with every interaction and keep both the elephant and the caregivers' safety a top priority. The Elephant Sanctuary understands the needs of an elephant and works hard to meet those needs every day. I could not imagine a more perfect place for an elephant to retire.
Elephant Sanctuary	284935	2	/users/profile/374987	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	My group spent a week volunteering with the Elephant Sanctuary and it has been a pivotal experience in my life. With this extended amount of time and good weather we were able to see every single elephant on the property and had the pleasure of witnessing Sissy swimming! The volunteer work was not as direct as I had originally anticipated, but the tasks did vary which kept things interesting. Lastly, I most appreciate the staff of the Elephant Sanctuary taking time every morning to tell us more about the mission and the individual elephants. In this way we were educated about the elephant sanctuary and were able to start our days with some renewed passion to help the elephants in any way we could.
Elephant Sanctuary	273940		/users/profile/36022	faytwo	Volunteer	5	12/07/2015	Got a spot on the Elephant Sanctuary's group volunteer day in November 2015 and spent the day raking and bagging lots of fallen leaves for enrichment for the elephants.  The weather was (fortunately) cold and wet which made the elephants come close to the Asian elephant barn rather than roaming out in the 2,700 acres of the sanctuary where the general public is not allowed.   The barn has heated floors and special flooring to cushion their feet, as well as safe enclosures for each elephant.  We ate our brown-bag lunches in a viewing area near the barn and were able to see 5 of the Asian elephant population - but were also cautioned not to stay too long or take too many photos so as not to cause too much anxiety.  This for me is the most impressive part of the Elephant Sanctuary program and mission- they are so sensitive to the elephants' need for privacy and freedom (after a past of exploitation and often violent control methods or even abuse) that they restrict almost all public access to the elephants to remote video cams.  While they choose their volunteers (like me) from a pool of people who have supported the sanctuary via a volunteer lottery, they only allow up to 20 volunteers at the Sanctuary 1 day a month 10 months out of the year to work on group projects, while keeping the group closely supervised.   As a volunteer you are not guaranteed to see any of the elephants - as they are no longer on exhibit for our gratification but rather have a true sanctuary for their own gratification.  But the point is to make these elephants' lives a little better and understand the contrast between their relative freedom and more natural lifestyle compared to the plight of the many elephants still in inhumane captivity.   A total of 14 Asian and African elephants currently live on the sanctuary in a very secluded and well-hidden refuge.  (Through the years this organization has been able to rescue 27 elephants from zoos, circuses and other restrictive environments - and has also lead the way toward developing and teaching more humane methods of treating captive elephants).  The sanctuary has big build-out plans so that they can take in more and more elephants from inhumane situations as well as to enhance their public education programming.   This organization faces unique challenges - how to promote an animal sanctuary that is not open to the public in the usual way while attracting support from that same public for the expensive operations of caring for such large animals in compassionate ways - plus also advocating for a change in the way our society treats elephants in captivity.  They walk that fine line with creativity and passion.  Colleen McMullen
Elephant Sanctuary	265739	1	/users/profile/354483	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	Wonderful.Knowing I was doing something to benefits those majestic animals was humbling

Elephant Sanctuary	263522	1	/users/profile/272490	M. Eileen H.	Volunteer	5	10/13/2015	What The Elephant Sanctuary stands for and accomplishes is impressive to me. In addition to the wonderful work they do with their special elephants, they have an education center in Hohenwald, TN, minutes away from the Sanctuary. They also publish a newsletter that keeps all of us elephant supporters updated on each girl. Their web site is one of the best I have seen in that the history of each elephant can be easily found as well as all of the archived reports about what is going on there on a daily basis. The unique way that staff write about their charges and tell delightful stories about their every-day activities pulls people into their lives and makes them really care about the elephants and their Sanctuary.  Individuals with strong interests are invited to volunteer at the Sanctuary for one day each year. I did this last year, and it was one of the bigger thrills of my life. It was wonderful meeting Todd, the education director, and all of the other staff and volunteers working there that day. I have also been trained as an Ele-Ambassador to present programs in my  community. The Sanctuary has trained people from all over the country. to be Ele-ambassadors. I find it easy to donate to the Sanctuary for several reasons. First, because of their outstanding communications I feel that I know personally each of the elephants by name and  want to contribute to their well-being as well as participate in many of the fun celebrations that the Sanctuary promotes such as buying a candle for Shirley's 65th birthday or participating in a fun run for Billy.  The  Sanctuary continually strives to improve the environment for the "girls" and involve volunteers in the activities conducted there. Another reason I find donating easy is because of their low key approach to fund-raising. The appeals are always very positive and uplifting. And unlike other places to whom I have donated The Sanctuary does not start asking for more money immediately after I donate.    Another way The Sanctuary connects interested people to the elephants is through the cameras mounted around the Sanctuary. Viewers can watch the girls napping, pushing over a tree, swimming in the several ponds, and playing with and enjoying each others company.  The Sanctuary is a peaceful and authentic place that treats its charges with the utmost respect and care. Staff inform the interested about each elephant's activities on a daily basis. We are happy when progress is reported and so sad when we learn of losses.   The Elephant Sanctuary is the only charitable organization I have ever been associated with where I actually feel like part of a family.  
Elephant Sanctuary	209737		/users/profile/272490	M. Eileen H.	Volunteer	5	08/09/2014	I'm not sure how I first found The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee, but the day I found it on-line I was hooked. The website is so helpful with its easily accessible archives, photos, and elephant biographies that I visit it almost every day. The people who write the stories do so in such a tender and loving way that I feel that I personally know each of the Sanctuary residents--both current and past. Many of the stories have brought me to tears of both sadness and happiness. This Sanctuary is doing phenomenal work with old, sick, abused and/or needy elephants who have been cooped up  in zoos and circuses for their whole lives, often without  companionship or proper care. They have frequently been captured as babies and taken from their mothers and families to be shipped and sold many times over. The Sanctuary exists to provide a loving, nurturing retirement for these magnificent animals at the conclusion of their mainly sad and abusive working lives. The Sanctuary is doing educational outreach using eager and willing volunteers (Ele-Ambassadors) to talk to schools and organizations about the nature of elephants and how that nature is being honored and supported through the thousands of acres now owned by the Elephant Sanctuary and the ongoing building and medical care that is constantly required.  The Sanctuary solicits donations, but in a very genuine and non-aggressive way. It also provides the dedicated volunteers with opportunities to serve the elephants on a few days of the year by working at the Sanctuary (but not interacting with the elephants). As one of the new volunteers I understand that the elephants (or the "Girls" as they are called) will not be on display because those days are over for them. Their only responsibility is for themselves--to live with others of their kind, wander the hills and valleys and water features to their hearts' content. The staff keep track of them, bring them hay and snacks and toys and keep their barns clean and fresh. Just as important is that the staff treats the elephants with the deepest respect. They know the mostly sad life stories of the Girls and celebrate their new lives of freedom from chains and cages at every opportunity.    I believe that The Elephant Sanctuary is a most worthy charity. Anyone wishing to donate or volunteer can be assured that  their donations will find their way directly to those most deserving of them--the Girls and everything that they need to enjoy a peaceful, safe retirement.

Everyone that works at this sanctuary has their full heart and commitment. They truly care about the elephants and getting them as comfortable and as close to their natural life as possible. Such a magical place, and they are forever expanding their knowledge in ways that can help the elephants here and even elephants all over the world that are in need. 
Elephant Sanctuary	263490	1	/users/profile/352192	Writer	Donor	5	10/13/2015	The elephant sanctuary of Tennessee is a true sanctuary! The elephants have 2700 acres of space. Free will barns and freedom to choose what they do and where they are 24/7. No human contact aside from the caregivers. No bull hooks! No punishment! They are able to form new herds and friendships. It is literally heaven on earth for elephants! 
Elephant Sanctuary	263486	1	/users/profile/352188	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2015	I discovered this charity many years ago after reading an article about them.  I visited their website and was completely hooked!  After several years of keeping up to date and becoming more and more informed about the plight of captive elephants and the opportunity The Elephant Sanctuary offers to retired pachyderms, I offered to use my expertise as a public speaker to spread the word about TES.  For the last few years, I have spent numerous hours speaking to groups all over Massachusetts, sharing my knowledge of The Elephant Sanctuary's mission.  More recently, I became an official Ele-Ambassador for the non-profit.  One of the things that impressed me early-on about TES is that when I offered to speak on their behalf, I told them that I would not do it as part of a fundraising campaign.  My goal was only to educate the publice.  They were perfectly fine with that, which says a lot about an organization that depends on donations to survive.  Another impressive thing about TES is that they do not allow visitors to their actual Sanctuary site, as they believe that the elephants in their Sanctuary have done their time being on display and should be allowed to live out their lives in peace.  Without a doubt, allowing the public to visit the habitat would certainly give them the opportunity to collect additional donations, but they have always stayed true to their mission, which is certainly something that should be lauded.  
Elephant Sanctuary	263429	1	/users/profile/352133	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2015	I have been teaching my Kindergarten students about The Elephant Sanctuary for 14 years. When I first saw an interview on TV I was hooked. It was then I understood what circus and zoo elephants have to endure to show us a few minutes of tricks and live a life of confinement. I'm sure not one of these Majestic mammals would choose this life of incarceration instead of living with their family in the wild. We blew it and now The Elephant Sanctuary is giving them a life as close to the wild as possible. My students love to hear the stories of the girls, their favorite foods and who their best friend is but it saddens us to hear how tiny they were when many were taken from their Mothers. I show my students many of the playful You Tube videos but our favorite time is watching the live Webcam during our center time!  These 5 year olds have more empathy than some adults. They realize it's not about us, it's about how the elephants feel. It comes down to our #1 class rule "Be kind to others on the inside and outside".  This includes animals. The Sanctuary is not open to the public so the girls can truly live as an elephant should. I donate each month because it is my hope that in my lifetime we will no longer have any elephants in zoos or circuses. I tell anyone I can about TES and I hear so often "I just didn't know".  We need to treat these great emotional creatures to a better life, a sanctuary life.
Elephant Sanctuary	263360	1	/users/profile/352067	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	The Elephant Sanctuary is a very worthwhile charity. Not only do they have a solid Charity Navigator review, their cause is unique, being one of only two elephant sanctuaries in North America. My donations are always promptly acknowledged.  Their ancillary programs help educate the public on important conservation matters.  TES oversees a volunteer ambassador program, distance learning for schoolchildren, all in addition to the primary mission of elephant caretaking.  If you watch their webcams it's easy to see success in that most important area.  The "girls" are obviously happy as they splash around in the ponds, explore the 2700 acre habitat, and lay down to sleep while outside (something an e lephant only does when she feels safe and secure. It's a wonderful organization!
Elephant Sanctuary	263262	1	/users/profile/351963	Writer	Donor	5	10/12/2015	What can I say about this fabulous organization?!? The work they do is amazing! I love to log on and watch what the girls )as I think of them) are doing today. I have a very shy 9 year old and talking to people about the Elephant Sanctuary has really helped her come out of her shell. We did distance learning program it was fabulous!!  The kids learned all about elephants and the Elephant Sanctuary. It brings tears to my eyes to watch them be truly elephants as nature intended!!!!
Elephant Sanctuary	263197	1	/users/profile/351904	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee is the largest, most well thought out refuge in the country for our largest land mammal. Those fortunate enough to receive sanctuary here live out their days in the freedom, dignity,  and society they deserve. 
Elephant Sanctuary	263135	1	/users/profile/351845	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2015	These people are doing amazing things in Tennessee!  The care and compassion that is shown to these animals is truly unbelievable.  It warms my heart to know what a difference is being made in these majestic animals lives by these extraordinary people!
Elephant Sanctuary	263104	1	/users/profile/351816	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	I have volunteered with this organization for some time and have seen in person the dedication and care given to these elephants, the educational outreach and the support that is provided to the volunteers.  The entire Sanctuary is funded through donations.
Elephant Sanctuary	262914	1	/users/profile/351611	didih	Volunteer	5	10/11/2015	A beautiful place in South Central Tennessee where elephants can roam.  It's a great sanctuary where the girls (the elephants) get the best of everything, food, medical care and enrichment.  When I have volunteered there, the staff wad welcoming and knowledgeable. The girls health and safety is always the number one priority.
Elephant Sanctuary	262903	1	/users/profile/351602	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/11/2015	My friend Rosanne Sietins helps raise awareness and funding for this organization which is located here in Tennessee.  They take in old and sick elephants at the end of their days in the circus or zoos and give them a habitat where they can roam for miles as elephants do in the wild.  They also educate the public about keeping these huge sensitive beasts contained in small areas, and forcing them to perform with whips and chains in the circus is animal cruelty.  Elephants care deeply about each other and people who kindly take care of them and may revolt when mistreated.  The sanctuary provides a safe place for them to live out their days and treats their injuries and diseases.  
Elephant Sanctuary	262573	3	/users/profile/269269	Debra58	Donor	5	10/08/2015	Fabulous place for retired elephants to live. No detail is forgotten to ensure their lives are spent happy and healthy! TES is a forerunner in how a sanctuary should be.  I am proud to endorse this nonprofit as one of the very best sanctuaries in the US. 
Elephant Sanctuary	206795	5	/users/profile/269269	Debra58	Donor	5	07/21/2014	I discovered The Elephant Sanctuary after viewing the documentary 'Urban Elephant.' The story of Shirley and her long lost friend, Jenny. After further investigation I joined the supportive group, The Elefans, and the rest is history! This is one of two places in the US that offers true sanctuary for captive elephants. The elephants are free to roam, eat, sleep wherever and whenever they wish. They are not used for breeding or entertainment and there are no visitors allowed. This is a good thing as all of these elephants are the product of the cruelty of the circus and substandard zoos. I adore the Ele Cam which gives glimpses of these majestic beings living as they should: free of expectations of humans. I encourage everyone to give what they can as this place always needs the support. 
Elephant Sanctuary	262406	1	/users/profile/269940	SusanBC	Donor	5	10/08/2015	I have been a supporter of the Elephant Sanctuary in TN since 2003, with the retirement of a local elephant named Tina.  Until that moment in time, I had no idea of the cruelties associated with animals in captivity, in this instance, elephants.  I have learned so much about these majestic animals and while it is sad that they can never be back in the wild, having the Sanctuary give them space to roam and the ability to be an elephant again without having to perform for people or 'earn their keep' has made such an impact in their lives.  Very few of these dear souls arrive in perfect health, but with time and a lot of tlc, good food, fresh air and lots of room to stretch their legs, they are able to enjoy their lives to the fullest for the rest of their days.   Please take the time to browse through their website, visit the cam page and also their many youtube moments!
Elephant Sanctuary	207307	1	/users/profile/269940	SusanBC	General Member of the Public	5	07/26/2014	I learned of this wonderful organization in 2003, with the long awaited retirement from a local zoo, of a lone Asian elephant named Tina.  I was never comfortable at a zoo or circus in my younger days, but did not have a clue what kind of lives elephants faced everyday in captivity.  Internet was new to us then and what a world it opened up.  These elephants truly do live the life they were meant to live, short of being free, with acre upon acre of open space, spring fed ponds, natural vegetation and top quality care both in caregivers and vet staff .  The Sanctuary does have a volunteer program which fills up pretty quickly and what I like is that there is no access to the public for 'viewing'.  The elephants no longer have to perform for anyone or do silly tricks.   Being a long time 'fan', I have shared joy in each new arrival, each new milestone, as well a shed a lot of tears for those that have passed away.   Even in the sadness, I have been thankful that these gentle souls have lived the end of their lives in peace and in love in their own little Heaven on earth.  Thank you 'TES' for all you have done and all you will continue to do for the Elephants.
Elephant Sanctuary	260537	1	/users/profile/349114	Susan545	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	Spending a day at the sanctuary was an amazing opportunity!  I had no expectations of seeing any of the sanctuary elephants but Flora greeted us with a big wave of her ears as we were heading to the African barn to do some polishing and shining of what was already a very clean area.  The Elephant Sanctuary is a godsend for the elephants who were taken from their families as youngsters, chained most of their lives and forced to perform in circuses learning behaviors that are not natural elephant behaviors.  The sanctuary provides a safe haven where they can live the rest of their lives in freedom just being elephants!It was a joy to also see the caring and happiness of the staff when talking about or watching the elephants.  The sanctuary staff are outstanding advocates for all elephants but especially the "gang" entrusted to their care!  I am proud to have met and worked with Stephanie and Kelleyon my volunteer day!
Elephant Sanctuary	252655	1	/users/profile/340753	Notnat	Donor	5	08/11/2015	Im a donor who recently volunteered for a day. It was gratifying to be able to lend a hand at this special place, and fun to meet some of the staff and hear their stories. The employees are knowledgable and care deeply about the elephants.  The Elephant Sanctuary provides much-needed safe haven and care for elephants, enabling them to live out their remaining lives in comfort and with the companionship of other elephants. The elephants are free to roam the forests and fields and play in the ponds or stay in the heated barns when its chilly outside. This is a fantastic organization. I will continue to donate to The Elephant Sanctuary, and hope to have the opportunity to volunteer again.
Elephant Sanctuary	248956		/users/profile/336760	Heatherlynndonnelly	Volunteer	4	07/20/2015	 I have her twice at the sanctuary. Both times were wonderful experiences. The people that work there seem dedicated and genuine and their commitment to providing these wonderful elephants  with the high quality  of life that they so deserve.
Elephant Sanctuary	234864	2	/users/profile/305149	SQTremper	Donor	5	12/03/2014	The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee is like no other place on earth.  I know this and I've never even been there, and I probably will not ever go there -- but here's why:  This organization takes care of old, rescued, orphaned and sick elephants in as natural a habitat as can be given to these wonderful fellow beings.  The Elephant Sanctuary offers no human visitation (other than what is necessary for the elephants' health) because they want to give these elephants as much of a natural and happy life as they have left on this earth.  They want the elephants to live out their lives with each other.  To me, The Elephant Sanctuary represents the epitome of love and caring:  Giving without expecting anything in return.
Elephant Sanctuary	210388		/users/profile/273150	LJG4873	Donor	5	08/12/2014	I am not certain how I first found out about the Elephant Sanctuary, but am very happy I did. The work these people do is just wonderful. Not only do they rescue and care for these wonderful creatures, but there are also stray dogs who find a home. Great story about Tarra and Bella, although a sad ending. Love the elecams, it's like you are right there with them. Have been donating for 12 years and watched many changes occur, i.e. visitor's center. Hope to get there soon for my own visit!
Elephant Sanctuary	207155	1	/users/profile/269730	tmartin2	Client Served	5	07/24/2014	As an educator in a high poverty school in urban Indianapolis, IN we are constantly trying to get real-world connections for our students. During a unit on fiction vs. non-fiction, I had a group of 1st grade students who were reading the story of Tara & Bella. The teacher and I were really excited to learn that the sanctuary still existed from the book and we got in touch with them. They tailored a unit of study for our students to meet our needs and connected with us virtually. The connection truly impacted our students and they will remember it for years to come! 
Elephant Sanctuary	207042	1	/users/profile/269579	Carol-Duckworth	Donor	5	07/23/2014	Since I was a small child I have felt a connection to elephants. The article I recently read on the web about Raju, the 50 year old elephant who cried when he was being rescued brought me to tears. I decided that day to make some donation to organizations who are trying to help these wonderful creatures. I found The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee and read almost their entire website. I read all of the elephants bios, which I absolutely loved! I also read about how elephants suffer from PTSD which greatly impacted me. I made a donation that day to the ele girls in Tennessee and I will continue to do so over the years to come. I feel really grateful that these magnificient spirits are being cared for by such thoughtful and hard working people. I will do what I can to spread the word of the important work that is being done for these dear elephants in Tennesssee. One day I hope to go to Tennessee and volunteer for the girls. Until then I will make donations to help with their care.Thank you to everyone who donated and especially to everyone that takes the time to care for these special enities. Love to you and God bless.Carol Duckworth 
Elephant Sanctuary	206819	1	/users/profile/269297	Lori108	Volunteer	4	07/21/2014	The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee provides a safe haven where sick, old, and needy elephants can live out their lives in peace with each other.  An elephant sanctuary is a huge undertaking and expenses are enormous.  Since I am cautious by nature, I researched the charitable ratings for the Elephant Sanctuary before donating.  I was very pleased to see that Charity Navigator gave the sanctuary a four star rating (out of four) and provided a breakdown of where donations go.  The Better Business Bureau site (give.org) also accredited the sanctuary for meeting the twenty standards used by the BBB to rate charitable organizations.Until I read the book Behemoth I never gave much thought to captive elephants.  Elephants killed by poachers for their ivory tusks are, sadly, not a new phenomenon, but elephants in captivity were not in such danger.  It wasnt until I discovered the Elephant Sanctuary (through mention in Behemoth) that I realized how terrible the lives of these creatures have been.Be assured that your contributions are going to a very worthwhile endeavor.  The sanctuary must provide veterinary care, medications, food, and shelter on its 2,700 acres.  Please donate to help this worthy cause.  The elephants will never forget!
Elephant Sanctuary	206679	2	/users/profile/269135	cstretz	Donor	5	07/19/2014	Much damage has been done to our dear earth and her animals by mankind. The Elephant Sanctuary is one way to make things right. They are very passionate, professional, kind and effective in running this charity and I happily and proudly lend a financial hand when I can. I sorely wish I could do so much more. My motto is KINDNESS TO ALL LIVING THINGS and this certainly holds true with the staff and mission of The Elephant Sanctuary. I am very thankful for the second chance these elephants have to live the last years of their lifes in loving care and a natural environment. What the staff does takes courage, heart, determination and strength and I send many, many thanks to them. I always end my correspondence to them with "love to the staff and girls" (all but one of the elephants being female). I have written this review in the hopes their kindness and efforts will never go unnoticed.
Elephant Sanctuary	206633	1	/users/profile/269084	Sojourner1616	Donor	5	07/18/2014	I have been a proud supporter of The Elephant Sanctuary for several years now and fully intend on making it a lifelong commitment. Dear friends of mine, who love all four-legged creatures but especially elephants, first introduced me to the organization. I was impressed with the concept of offering sanctuary to these gentle giants, who give so much joy and have had so much taken from them. What was even more impressive, though, was how devoted the staff was to caring for the animals. The genuine love for the elephants came through in every newsletter and email that was forwarded and the elecams were a stroke of genius! Since we cannot actually visit Shirley, Misty, and the gang in their new home, watching their antics on camera are the next best thing. The most touching of all was the beautiful story of Tarra and Bella, whose death brought me to tears. The world could learn a thing or two from these amazing animals and I am grateful that The Elephant Sanctuary gives us such a forum. Blessings to all involved...
Elephant Sanctuary	206591	1	/users/profile/269035	swellgalmary	Donor	5	07/18/2014	I have loved elephants since I was a child and as I got older I began to understand that many of them are used in circuses and exhibits and are mistreated and lonely. One day I happened upon the Elephant Sanctuary and was astonished by the work they do and the elephants they serve. You can tell by their communication with the public that they love and RESPECT these great animals. They take in the ones that have been broken and downhearted for a long time and give them a chance to be an elephant for the first time in an environment where they can roam free and just be what God intended them to be. Their website is informative and fun to visit and the Elecams are great. You get a chance to see the girls having fun. One day I was lucky enough to see them having a great time in the rain. It made me smile for days. I also know it is teaching a new generation about elephants and how they should be treated. I wish there was no Elephant Sanctuary -- not because they don't do wonderful and necessary work -- but because I wish elephants were never put in situations that these girls have been put in. But since my wish is not true I am so thankful for the Elephant Sanctuary and will continue to be a supporter as long as I can.
Elephant Sanctuary	206552	1	/users/profile/268996	Annette21	Donor	5	07/18/2014	My sister introduced me to ES a few years ago.  I have been in ele love ever since.   We donate to a number of animal shelters throughout the US.  What makes ES different, aside from the fact that it is for elephants,  is that is a truly a sanctuary.  I watch the elecam almost every day.  I am always impressed by the fact that the "girls", as ES lovingly refers to them, can spend their days any way they want.  No one interferes with their daily agenda or forces them to do anything.  The reward is that the girls delight us with their amazing grace and often silly antics.  I have learned so much about eles from the Sanctuary -- that eles are extremely sensitive, even emotional.  I always heard they were intelligent, but from watching the elecam I see it first hand.  They are playful and have a sense of humor.  They are susceptible to TB and their feet need constant attention.   They are remarkably agile. Aside from the medical care, good nutrition and enrichment provided to these exquisite creatures, what impresses me most is the profound respect, compassion and tenderness the caregivers have for them.  I was so disappointed to hear that I could never actually meet the eles in person.  But then I realized that this is the point of the sanctuary!  These animals have been abused and neglected by humans for so long, they must dread the sight of most humans.  Who can blame them?  They deserve peace and a safe haven without human interference.   Kudos to The Elephant Sanctuary and caregivers for providing acres of land, care and love to these incredible, precious animals.  Love to All!
Elephant Sanctuary	206547	2	/users/profile/268990	Kim_144	Donor	5	07/18/2014	Dear Friends, There are countless, wonderful non-profit organizations that do so much.  It can sometimes be overwhelming, trying to help them all.  I have donated to many in my life.  When I came upon this one years ago, I was certain that their efforts and goals were straight from the heart, and hope was no longer lost for the elephants that are being "trained/beaten" for selfish human reasons.  Elephants are one of the smartest, sweetest, loyal creatures on earth, and for circuses, zoos, and traveling side shows to utilize them for their greedy money making shows is outrageous.  What they do to them is abhorrent.  I have picketed the circuses, and write countless letters to organizations and to the newspapers in hopes that it may educate even one person.  When I found this wonderful organization, that seeks elephants out and with great perseverance,  eventually rescues and adopts them from their nightmare of a life, my heart cried with joy, and gave my heart a ray of hope and sunshine. And the fact that the Elephant Sanctuary does not permit spectators, only the ele-cam, that just proves their utmost loyalty back to these beautiful creatures that deserve the peace and respect they finally are receiving.  I invite and encourage anyone to send even a small amount, $10, $20, $50 or place them in your will... to ensure these souls receive the special diet, medical attention and that the staff can continue tending to their paradise on earth....which is what God had intended in the beginning anyway.  Kudos to the Elephant Sanctuary!  I hope in my lifetime, with the help of the Elephant Sanctuary, all circuses and side shows who en-cage and chain these wonderful creatures will cease.  Most Sincerely, Kim Sedgwick, Macomb, IL
Elephant Sanctuary	206535	1	/users/profile/268977	Milena S.	Donor	5	07/18/2014	I love this Sanctuary ,what it represents and does.  I wanted to be a part of the girls (elephants) lives so I adopted Shirley, one of the many elephants that are living out the rest of their lives just the way they're meant to. FREE . Please go visit this amazing site and read all about how the dedicated volunteers make such a difference in the elephants (girls) lives.  They even have an elecam, that's right, there are camera's all over the sanctuary and you can view the girls in their natural habitat.  Sometimes doing nothing other times being silly or just hanging with their girlfriends.  Or better yet go and adopt one of the girls.I'm looking forward to many long and happy years of watching the ladies of The Elephant Sanctuary.Please take a moment and visit the girls at www.elephants.com .
Elephant Sanctuary	206529	1	/users/profile/268969	lindabray	Donor	5	07/18/2014	I've always loved elephants since I was 5 years old and my Mom would take us to the Zoo. The elephants were way in the back and I bugged to go there first. It was sad because the aroma was not the best and my Mom didn't do well with bad odors. It always stuck with me how sad the conditions were. Once I heard about the Sanctuary I decided this was the perfect place to get involved. Every year at Christmas what I would have spent to buy my brothers gift )(who pasted away in 1994) would go to the Sanctuary. I also found they had different gifts for friends and family. I have kept track on different issues and told a lot of others regarding this place. It is awesome and they do really great things for the elephants.
Elephant Sanctuary	203869	1	/users/profile/265881	miriampaisner	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	i help spread the world about this wonderful sanctuary for our greatest cousins circus cruelty is where most come from; the E.S. helps them live normal lives again 
Elephant Sanctuary	199632	1	/users/profile/260612	linda75755	General Member of the Public	5	05/05/2014	I have enjoyed the Elephant sanctuary for a few months now.  I work in a stressful field (police dispatch) and I find watching the elephants very relaxing and helps with my stress level.  I have donated to the sanctuary because I feel it meets a need that most people do not realize is out there. Recently I was able to go to the Welcome Center and was very impressed with the people.  It is very educational and worth sharing with others.  I have recommended the sanctuary to several friends and I know they have passed it along to others.  I hope the Elephant Sanctuary will be able to get the funds it needs to continue to inform and educate the public and take care of the retired and/or abused elephants that it needs to.
Elephant Sanctuary	198993	1	/users/profile/259831	jill.mats	Volunteer	5	04/26/2014	Wonderful day to work outside.  So nice to see how previous volunteers' work has helped with the upkeep on the sanctuary.  
Elephant Sanctuary	198978	1	/users/profile/259808	tashalayton	Volunteer	5	04/25/2014	The Elephant Sanctuary is such a special place and the staff are just as special. They genuinely care for the elephants and strive to make it a true sanctuary. I was honored to volunteer alongside them and would gladly serve again. 
Elephant Sanctuary	196188	1	/users/profile/256486	juanita.eisinger	Volunteer	5	03/22/2014	This is such a wonderful place that put their elephants first every day.  I have never met more caring group people who have devoted their time to care for elephants.  It is such a honor to volunteer for The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee.
Elephant Sanctuary	195779	2	/users/profile/256031	Dawna2	Volunteer	5	03/18/2014	I was taken back when I first read about The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. This is one organization that is 100%  on board helping the elephants that are in their care.  The organization is up front and accountable for everything they do.  Their web site explains, in detail, how the sanctuary came about to present day. Emphasis on educating the public about the  plight of Elephants in the wild, zoos and circuses is a major goal of theirs that I believe in.  I live , not far, from another Elephant sanctuary who's main goal is breeding. I was so disappointed to find out the conditions these Elephants are living in and  the misleading information available to the public for this "breeding farm" NOT SANCTUARY!Yes, I love Elephants and believe that The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee is the best in the United States. I live 11 hrs. away but have dedicated myself to help out in anyway that I can. Once you check out their web site, you will fall in love with them and form a special relationship and understanding with the Elephants.  The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee is the REAL thing. Check them out--you will not be disappointed. 
Elephant Sanctuary	195760	1	/users/profile/256005	Emily80	Volunteer	4	03/18/2014	I went into the trip expecting it to not be very fun but i was very pleasantly surprised. I left with a vastly improved knowledge of elephants and what we can do to help them. I really enjoyed working to help such a good cause and hearing all of the amazing stories of the elephants lives.
Elephant Sanctuary	195742	1	/users/profile/255967	dixonjr	Volunteer	5	03/17/2014	I thoroughly enjoyed my volunteering experience. I felt as though the Sanctuary staff were very friendly and knowledgable about the elephants and their role in their lives.
Elephant Sanctuary	195740	1	/users/profile/255965	Jana V.	Volunteer	5	03/17/2014	Volunteering at The Elephant Sanctuary was more than I could ask for. I came along as the staff person for an Alternative Spring Break trip through Appalachian State University.  I was told we would probably not event get to see elephants.  We saw a ton!  It was great seeing them so happy in their environment. During the volunteer week we were able to transplant bamboo for the Elephants, plant fruit bearing trees of Apples and Pears, and plant more grape vines that will be used as treats for the elephants. We also cleaned out a barn that had not been used for about 20 years. Now it can be updated and used for storage and a place for the Elephants to go during poor weather conditions. We also cleaned out a tool shed and raked leaves for the Elephants to eat. We even cut down tree limbs. We did so much more than this...Everything we did we got to see how it was used or it was explained to us how it was used. The orientation when we arrived was so helpful in learning the plight of elephants. The staff was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Everyone should be so lucky as to volunteer here. You could tell everyone there loved not just elephants, but all animals.  
Elephant Sanctuary	195668	1	/users/profile/255858	fredcat22	Donor	5	03/15/2014	I am proud to be a part of the support for The Elephant Sanctuarry. They do very important work providing a home for these amazing beings, I feel that my money is well spent, supporting their dedication and exhaustive efforts to make a good life of retirement in nature for our Elephant friends.
Elephant Sanctuary	195664	1	/users/profile/255846	Yvonne13	Donor	5	03/14/2014	I am passionate  that the time has come and gone in our society for animals, especially large and wild animals like elephants, big cats and orcas, to no longer be kept in captivity such as zoos, circuses, and sea shows and exploited for our so-called amusement.  While society is not there yet, The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, TN. has taken a sacred oath to see that captive elephants have a free and unfettered end to their lives in the company of other elephants and away from the eyes of the public.  Through the miracles of technology, we, the public, can watch these elephants on the elecam and through the Sanctuary's YouTube videos.  It's no longer acceptable to chain these beautiful creatures and make them perform for us.  To see them live out their lives with their best friends, other elephants, is magnificent.  I believe The Elephant Sanctuary is an amazing organization.
Elephant Sanctuary	187741	2	/users/profile/244812	hmccallister	Donor	4	11/04/2013	The folks slamming this nonprofit simply because the ED was ousted.... your pettiness only hurts the organization and the elephants. This is a great nonprofit.
Elephant Sanctuary	150429	5	/users/profile/200600	Delhi	Volunteer	1	03/03/2013	Since Carol Buckley was ousted in an ugly coup, the Sanctuary has tenuously maintained a facade of its old self but, in reality, it has been eviscerated. It's run by a board that knows and cares about money, not elephants. There is no one -- no one -- on staff with anything remotely approaching Carol's knowledge of, experience with and deep affinity for elephants. As to Marcella Smith's comments about Carol: A few years ago Marcella wanted to build a house on property she bought bordering the Sanctuary. To enter her property from the front to build the house would have required her to build a bridge across a stream, which she could not afford. Instead, Marcella wanted construction crews to be able to drive THROUGH part of the Sanctuary habitat to reach her property. Carol refused, given the disruption it would have caused to the elephants and their daily lives. Ms. Smith is obviously still angry. There are many people who idolized Carol Buckley but, since the coup, have demonized her. Their comments should be taken with a large grain of salt. And those who hold to their belief that nothing has changed at the Sanctuary show their lack of knowledge of the therapeutic process Carol developed there. I would advise potential donors to stay away from the Sanctuary until Carol Buckley returns. 
Elephant Sanctuary	150314	3	/users/profile/200448	ethologicac	Professional with expertise in this field	2	02/28/2013	I am no longer employed as Director of Husbandry at the Sanctuary. I left just a few months after Rob Atkinson, CEO, left. Janice Zeitlin is acting CEO. Susan Mikota is Director of Veterinary Services. [This website asks me to rate the Sanctuary: I do not wish to rate the Sanctuary so I have selected the middle rating in each category and the same number of stars it already had to satiate the demand of the site without meaning to imply any opinion about the sanctuary in my rating.]
Elephant Sanctuary	144778	2	/users/profile/98137	Cathy Larson	Donor	1	11/30/2012	Rob Atkinson has also left now and they are in search of another CEO.  The other co-founder left this year.  The ones that need to go are the board of directors. 
Elephant Sanctuary	95994	3	/users/profile/98137	Cathy Larson	Donor	1	08/18/2011	They have now rid themselves of the other co-founder Scott Blais.  The BOD have replaced his $35k salary with 3 new director positions at an unknown cost.  They never file their 990 until the last minute and then it is almost two years old.  
Elephant Sanctuary	87463	2	/users/profile/98137	Cathy Larson	Donor	1	04/27/2011	It just gets worse and worse for this once magnificent charity.  A second lawsuit by another employee has been filed against The Elephant Sanctuary.  Here is the link to the story.   http://lewisherald.atomicnewstools.com/pages/?p=2495
Elephant Sanctuary	119470	3	/users/profile/162440	Saunieindiego	Donor	5	07/29/2012	I write this review in memory of a dog named Bella. Who, without the Elephant Sanctuary, would have never known the love of an elephant named Tara. The Elephant sanctuary is a peaceful place for elephants to live out their years with plenty of room to be...elephants.
Elephant Sanctuary	102688	6	/users/profile/135156	mickey yurkevicz	General Member of the Public	5	12/28/2011	I think that supporters of Carol should be ashamed of themselves.  Have you read the legal response of TES to Carol's self-serving & grossly inaccurate lawsuit?  Sorry folks, your hero is a psychotic, & the BOD did not disclose the ugly details for the best of intentions.  Carol needs way more help than she is capable of giving.  Kudos to the BOD for handling such an unfortunate & miserable situation with tactfulness & concern for the mission.  My heartfelt condolences to the employees & interns who suffered Carol's abuse.
Elephant Sanctuary	102589	4	/users/profile/134262	Marcella Smith	Volunteer	5	12/22/2011	I am so very glad to be a donor of the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. I noticed that the sanctuary lost its five star rating when Ms. Buckley was still in power, she was not suppended until the end of 2009.   I also see she rejected the opportunity to visit Tarra.   I also see the TB situation with the care staff were during her reign.   I am very thankful that there is 3 people in the HUGE and overwhelming amount of work that was Scott's job, I look back and wish Ms. Buckley had done that sooner for Scott and the Girls.   I am very proud to be a donor for the sanctuary, because no matter what is going on in administration, the girls still need their food and I love the Girls!
Elephant Sanctuary	99228	3	/users/profile/118757	Mary23456789101112	Donor	1	10/12/2011	Why should I continue to donate to an organization whose Baord of Directors ousted the very insirational primary founder and CEO, but did not make that info public until months afterwards so they could continue to solicit donations in her name?  This charity does not file mandatory paperwork in a timely manner.  The last 990 covers 2009.  They were late in filing the proper paperwork to maintain their non-profit status in the state of Tennessee.  They do not publicly list their Board of Directors identities nor remuneration on their website.  This organization has not submitted to independent financial audit.  Their overall Charity Navigator rating has fallen to 3 stars.  There are just too many issues with this organization for me to maintain my desire to contribute.  There are other elephant welfare organizations that have transparent operations and I believe are more worthy of my hard earned money.
Elephant Sanctuary	97873	5	/users/profile/115543	JanetF	Donor	1	09/21/2011	I had been a donor for eleven years because of the excellence of the dream that Carol Buckley created for old, sick, and needy elephants. I kept in touch with what they did during all that time, through newsletters, web site, national news media, and special programs about animals that included The Elephant Sanctuary. All during this time, they did everything right! I contributed all I could and even set up a trust that was to go to them upon my passing. Now, however, that evil people, attracted by the money good people have donated to help the elephants, have descended into the Sanctuary, huge amounts of money are being given to spouses of board members and to contractors who have done no work. Worst of all, they have, in a coup that blindsided her, ousted Carol Buckley, the inspiration for The Elephant Sanctuary, without whom the Sanctuary never would have existed or have been the excellent refuge for beleaguered elephants that it was. They knew she would never stand for their evil acts -- in fact, she closed the bank account from which the spouse and contractor had been paid!! This is all described in the lawsuit Carol filed against the Sanctuary, referenced in a comment above.
Elephant Sanctuary	97406	4	/users/profile/114321	sommer	Donor	1	09/13/2011	I have supported The Elephant Sanctuary for years.  I even have my frontlicense plate from this organization.  I read "Water for Elephants" and can't help but want to help those beautiful creatures.  However, the newsletters have changed and I have become suspicious of the new organization.  Why is is possible for the "founders" to be fired.  My biggest concern right now is the elephants and their care.  I have noticed that more have died and fewer have found sanctuary since these changes have occured.  Shame on you.
Elephant Sanctuary	93563	7	/users/profile/107720	Michelle H	Donor	1	07/07/2011	I have donated to this charity for several years, but stopped in this last year when I had more questions than answers given.   Donor beware as this charity has lost its non-profit status with the State of Tennessee.
Elephant Sanctuary	92272	6	/users/profile/105770	BettyLu Bendeke	Donor	1	06/27/2011	Fifteen years ago, Carol Buckley had a dream for her personally owned elephant. That dream was The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennessee. She built this dream into a reality and became nationally known as one of the foremost authorities on the rehabilitation of sick and exploited zoo and circus elephants. She sacrificed her own personal comfort and wealth in order to build a place where elephants would be safe and put aside enough money to insure their well-being for years to come. One day, a hostile takeover from within the ranks, threw Carol out and The Elephant Sanctuary (TES) has been turned into a high dollar organization. High salaried CEOs have been hired, PR people, attorneys, and more "management staff" than Carol needed to run the entire sanctuary. My husband and I have not only stopped donating, since the very things that drew us to TES have all been removed and/or changed, and TES is NOT the sanctuary that it was first set up to be. We have also removed them from our Living Trust Endowment Fund. Until Carol Buckley is put back at the helm, we want nothing to do with this charity. They have never been truthful with the donors and have erased Carol from her own vision, dream and reality. They are taking credit for everything with the co-founder now claiming to be the founder. If you love elephants, do NOT donate to The Elephant Sanctuary. They are not disclosing all of the truth.
Elephant Sanctuary	90499	5	/users/profile/103235	Laura C.	Donor	1	06/11/2011	The sanctuary was founded in 1995 by two people, Carol Buckley and Scott Blais.  There is an error on the Guidestar profile of sanctuary People.  Mr. Scott Blais is listed as Founder which is incorrect.  When two people perpetuate an enterprise, they forever remain each a Co-founder.  To call one person Founder, is to steal the entire endeavor from the other.  However this occurred, it needs to be corrected immediately. The other Co-founder, Ms. Buckley, was removed by a vote.  Essentially, the vision, the elephant responsible for the vision, and it remains to be seen how much more, seem to have been taken from Ms. Buckley.  The reason for this thus far remains a secret.
Elephant Sanctuary	85471	3	/users/profile/95374	Brenda Marie	Donor	2	04/13/2011	So glad that I stopped donating to them just about the time that Carol was ousted.  Lots of fishy and malicious stuff seems to have been and continues to be going on.  Shame on them.  Review a lot of stuff here - http://www.carolbuckley.com/pdf/Lawsuit_Oct2010.pdf.  Thank you to the other reviewer B Ko for the info! : - )  There are two sides to every story - but wow!!! They seem to still help elephants (thank goodness) - but now you have to wonder how YOUR money is truly being used - payments to the Board's spouses - contractors that do not do any work, etc...
Elephant Sanctuary	83362	3	/users/profile/92317	B Ko	General Member of the Public	1	03/27/2011	Why is Carol Buckley still listed as an employee, when she was ousted awhile ago? In fact, she has sued the sanctuary (http://www.carolbuckley.com/pdf/Lawsuit_Oct2010.pdf). Something seems odd here.

I have always loved horses & yet a city slicker, never had the opportunity to work with them.  This organization is so dedicated to helping these precious animals that were bestowed upon us.  They truly know what is best for them.  Volunteering for this org is the best part of my new life in retirement!
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	298569		/users/profile/389448	doda1230	Volunteer	5	07/29/2016	I lost my horse in 2006, after 20 wonderful years together.  I just couldn't even think of getting another, but one evening I was watching the news and saw a story about a large confiscation of some horses in Cannon County.  I could not ignore the pull at my heart to go to the stations website and put my name on the list to help out, any way I could.  That was in 2009.  Next thing I know, I am adopting One Eye'd Jack.  I started volunteering in 2010 so that I could give back to Horse Haven for the joy they had given me with the adoption of Jack.  I have served as team lead, on the adoption committee, and volunteer coordinator.  I am still a team lead and a proud parent of 4 rescues from Horse Haven.  I learn and grow so much more about horses every time I set foot there.  It is an amazing place to help the horses heal, but I think the most important part is how the horses help heal us.
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	298520		/users/profile/389386	KellieBCSPCA	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/29/2016	Horse Haven of Tennessee is the most professional, dependable, trustworthy and team oriented Equine non-profit that we have had the honor of working with. They are fearless in their pursuits and rapid in their response. Horse Haven of Tennessee has been essential to the Blount County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in all of our equine cases by offering their knowledge, expertise, and facility to aid in our Equine prosecutions. They are an organization that is aware of the value of their service and the specialty of the care they offer to all equines in our state. They are definitely an asset that we the community must support and assist in their mission statement or the Equines of Tennessee will greatly suffer without them.

They were being kept on 4-5 acres, standing in mud and feces above their ankles and extremely thin.  When asked for help Horse Haven stepped in and took 28 of the horses and helped them back to health and into new homes.  There is no words to describe this wonderful, caring group.

I called horse haven when I saw Sleepy's  picture. I was told that he was available but would I also consider adopting his stall mate, Doc as they had bonded. I said yes!  We went to meet them and fell in love with both ponies!  Shortly there after the ponies were home! Stephanie at Horse Haven answered all our questions and helped us get our property ready for our boys! I recommend them to anyone I know looking to adopt  a horse, pony or mule!  I saw what all they do to help the horses who come to be in thier care!  Everyone at Horse Haven needs kudos with all they do!  Our horses are healthy and happy and a joy to have!
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	298065		/users/profile/388902	Marsha P.	General Member of the Public	5	07/25/2016	Our horse Prince contracted EPM and lost his sight.  At the time he was very friendly with a little pony named Socks at the barn where we kept him.  Because of Prince needing daily medicatios and care we moved him to our property so we could care for him better.  Unfortunately Socks had to stay.  We searched for another companion for Prince and Horse Haven had a little pony named Poet  who was in need of a home.  They bonded instantly and have been inseparable.  Prince is a Clydesdale Hackney cross so it's quite a sight seeing them together. We have cameras in their stall so we can check on them regularly.   Poet sleeps with his head against Prince's leg at night so if Prince moves he'll know.  We cannot thank Horse Haven enough for putting Poet into our lives.  He is a very happy pony today and rarely will you see the two apart.
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	298047		/users/profile/388881	Rachael19	Volunteer	5	07/25/2016	I worked as a volunteer in 2009 for a few months helping to rehab an empty barn and rehabilitate some very badly mistreated horses that had been surrendered. Horse Haven takes is role very seriously as a nonprofit that takes animals from near death, facilitating the legal system in bringing their abusive owners to justice, and finding loving forever homes for the animals whenever possible. They continue to check on the horses after placement and bring them back to the shelter if necessary for their wellbeing, which happened to a pair of horses while I was there. They are also sure to train staff to avoid injuries and care properly for the animals while they are at the shelter. It was hard work being a volunteer but incredibly rewarding and a great learning experience. 
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	298026		/users/profile/388857	Princeton99	Client Served	5	07/25/2016	We at our family farm LOVE Horse Haven. We have adopted 3 horses from this facility and they have been nothing but helpful and encouraging the hole way through. They take lots of caution on who they adopt out to in order to make sure each animal has a perfect home. We have also brought out horses to a few charity shows that they do which are a great opportunity to have fun but also they have their adoptable horses roaming around to get noticed. Everything that they do at Horse Haven of Tennessee makes me proud to say I got my horses from them.

Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	280501	1	/users/profile/370391	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	02/18/2016	This is nothing more than a boarding barn with clients ordered to pay for their board through the court. They have an endless supply of unwilling boarders with court orders to pay. A great business model if you ask me. With a full barn(which is free) staffed with volunteers to do the work and charging people more than retail for board they should have no problem turning a profit on their own.

Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	277976	2	/users/profile/367840	Writer	Client Served	5	01/25/2016	Horse Haven of TN helped me with their "Studs to Buds" program.  We bought a couple of mares at a horse sale (1st time ever at one) and one of them was with foal unbeknownst to us.  We weren't prepared for 3 horses let alone a baby.  When the colt was born and was weaned we rehomed his mother due to lack of pasture.  The colt then developed an attitude and was trying to bite constantly and was getting closer to 2 years old and I was afraid he would start developing his male tendencies towards my other mare.  I called around for prices on gelding at different vets in the area and they were all out of my budget.  I was on HHT's webpage and read about their "Studs to Buds" program, filled out an application and was approved.  They contacted me and set up a surgery date.  The Vet Service came to my pasture and gelded him and did a coggins test all for little cost to me.  They were a life saver because if he'd have gotten anymore aggressive I don't know what I would've done.  The fence would not have withstood a stud horse with a mare in season on the other side.Now I try to help HHT by donating horse related items to their Tack Shack for resale to raise money for the horses and other ways when possible. Thanks to HHT I have a nicer gelding and no worries about foals.
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	277974	2	/users/profile/367838	Ash_	Volunteer	5	01/25/2016	When I volunteered for Horse Haven in Winter 2012/2013, I was impressed by how willing the Barn Manager was to teach me what I needed to know to be a volunteer. She stoked a fire in me for animal rescue. Horse Haven works tirelessly to save horses from abandonment, starvation and abuse. They assist law enforcement in bringing perpetrators to meet their much deserved justice, making sure those who would harm a equine pay the price for the cruelty. Without them, many of these animals would never see justice. Without Horse Haven, many of these horses would have died. Horse Haven provides a safe and loving refuge for these stricken animals, allowing them to heal both physically and emotionally  from the ravages of their abusers. In short, Horse Haven of Knoxville is a godsend for equines all over Tennessee. 
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	277128	3	/users/profile/181934	Ms Mag Man	Client Served	5	01/19/2016	People who put a negative review on here have probably had their animals taken away from them because they didn't take the necessary care the animals required. Horse Haven is about getting animals out of abusive and deplorable conditions and finding homes for them with someone who will take proper care of the animal. They don't make a profit from anything. The adoption fee doesn't even come close to compensating what they expend on an animal while in their care. That's not what it all about. They have to work with authorities who follow the law. Animals are not removed from a home unwarranted. There is just cause. Cases go to court and the animals are given the care they need while they are waiting for their case to be resolved and be released to find their forever home. Horse Haven has cases that continue on for several years sometimes and the animals are well taken care of including any medical needs they may have, which can get quite costly. We have adopted our horses from Horse Haven and have been volunteers at Horse Haven and we have seen first hand what these horses look like when they first arrive and it breaks my heart. The sob story is real. If someone doesn't question why a human being would neglect an animal to the point of starvation, they have no business owning animals. 
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	136027	4	/users/profile/181934	Ms Mag Man	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	I received a Horse Haven Newsletter in the mail by mistake one day (thank you postal carrier!) I read the newsletter and discovered they needed volunteers. I signed up on their website and my husband said he would volunteer too. I grew up with horses in my life and horses have always had a special place in my heart. One day I will have a place to have another horse but in the meantime, I get my horse fix by volunteering at Horse Haven. My eyes were opened one day not long after we became official volunteers about the condition these horses arrive in. It was the saddest thing I've ever seen in my life; 30 horses arrived at a temporary holding facility. Some were just skin and bones, two horses ultimately didn't survive. These horses literally made their water buckets muddy because all they had to drink was mud and as they drank clean water, the mud in their mouth washed out into their buckets. They had been standing in a foot deep of mud. My husband and I cried as we worked around these horses when they first arrived to the holding facility. We couldn't believe people would treat another living being so inhumanly. Luckily, they had been removed from those horrible conditions and offered a better life. Now I understood why the job of Horse Haven was so important. We love volunteering here and feel we are serving a greater purpose.

By doing business this way the a) have no investment in the horses that they sell (adopt out for a fee) b) Can use the courts to force the owners of the animals to pay them, regardless of their guilt, and then c) create a sob story to tug at peoples heart strings to get them to donate money. Typical Animal Activist playbook.

Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	266173	2	/users/profile/284926	Teyla E.	Volunteer	5	10/21/2015	Horse Haven of TN not only works with local law enforcement agencies to rescue equines from abuse and neglect, but it allows the equines (horses, donkeys, mules) to rehabilitate in a calm, safe environment.  Then,  when they are back up to weight and ready, the equines are adopted out (at a very low price, considering the vet care, hoof trimmings, and feed they receive while in HHT care). Potential adopters must pass a facility check, plus sign a contract with HHT showing they will be responsible for the animal's care.This is a well-run nonprofit organization. Every employee and volunteer at HHT works "for the good of the horses"!
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	221221	4	/users/profile/284926	Teyla E.

What this non-profit has accomplished in its 15 years of service is truly commendable.  Horses that otherwise would have died agonizing deaths because of neglect and starvation are now in wonderful, loving homes due to the efforts of HHT.  Every equine taken in is given  hope.  And, with proper food, water, and care, these abused animals turn from sadness and become the glorious, full-of-life creatures they were made to be!Their transformations are, without a doubt, the most wonderful events for the dedicated Horse Haven of Tennessee volunteers & staff.

Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	258398		/users/profile/346890	Laura257	Donor	5	09/19/2015	Horse Haven has been extremely helpful and instrumental in rescuing and protecting starving and abused horses not only in our immediate area, but also in other parts of the state where large numbers of horses were confiscated by the authorities on the acts of court orders.  Horse Haven provided the badly needed space, expertise and care on emergency basis many times.  They always respond to the call of duty!

Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	255963	1	/users/profile/344349	RaVo	Client Served	5	09/10/2015	I've been associated with Horse Haven for over two years.  They love and care for all the horses, mules, donkeys, and other animals that came through their gates.  They rely primarily on a hard-working group of volunteers, and it is a testament to the organization that many volunteers have been around for years and years (and have no plans on leaving any time soon).  Horse Haven also has  a small group of employees who are jacks-of-all-trades who tirelessly work to end animal abuse.  
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	233127	3	/users/profile/296805	J D V.	Volunteer	5	11/06/2014	We were volunteers for almost 4 years at Horse Haven.  And if we hadn't moved we would have been there forever, or as long as we physically could be.  The organization is top-notch from the leaders down through the volunteers.  Horse Haven has been the voice and conscience of the horse rescue community in Tennessee for over 15 years and it shows in the many ways they deal with abused and neglected horses.  Almost any rescue organization can care for these beautiful creatures medically and physically but it's the human touch that sets Horse Haven apart from other rescues.  We learned so much at Horse Haven and would never have been able to own horses without all that we were taught by amazing staff and more knowledgeable volunteers.  We now volunteer at another horse rescue but it's just not the same.  
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	226529	3	/users/profile/222437	Janet73	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I have been a volunteer with this wonderful organization since 2008 and I can say it has done way more for my soul than I have been able to give back.   The people from the top to the new volunteers are warm, loving and caring.   People who don't know about rescue always ask me " How do you manage to see all the horrible things that people do to these animals, and most of our cases are starvation.  My answer is I don't really see them as they come in, in my mind I see them as I know they will become in several months with the love, care and attention each one gets, then on to their forever home.  We educate the public, have programs that help with population control and the humane ending of a loved horses life.   Programs that help feed those who are having trouble buying hay and feed.   We are a family.  A family that cares deeply about each other and the horses and donkeys that come into our barn to get healthy and learn to trust again.
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	167572	1	/users/profile/222437	Janet73	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I joined this organization to help abused and starved horses in the state of Tennessee.  What I found by being around these wonderful horses of all shapes and breeds is that the look in their eyes change almost from the minute they are rescued.  They seem to know that help is on the way.  We have had horses almost drag themselves into the trailer as well as those that had to be led in by the smell of grain, most of which had not had anything to eat in months.   The work we do is not only good for our horse population but heals the human soul.    I have helped in all kinds of ways from actual rescue in the field and barn to mucking stalls,  I have had my heart broken  and cried over those who put  forth such a nobel effort but just could not overcome the starvation that they endured but rest assured they lived their last days knowing love and attention from the wonderful staff and  volunteers at this organization.     I have given alot to Horse Haven of Tennessee but its only a drop in the bucket of what Horse Haven has given me.
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	226237	2	/users/profile/289975	AshleySiferd	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I've happily been with Horse Haven of Tennessee since 2007 as a volunteer. It truly makes a difference in the lives of all equine who come through our barn doors. The HHT horses have also made an impact in my life, and I truly believe that they have all made me a better human being. One thing I love the most about HHT is that we provide a safe place for our horses to be rehabilitated and nourished back to health. Even better than that is finding each and every one of them a forever home. Therein lies the true joy, matching horses, ponies, and donkeys with their loving human families. HHT is a wonderfully run organization with goals to not just rehabilitate equine but to also educate the community about equine issues through a variety of programs and outreach initiatives. It is a worthwhile organization to donate to, whether it is your time and labor or your money. 
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	226192	2	/users/profile/289932	biotchr	Donor	5	10/24/2014	We have donated money to Horse Haven (HHT) for several years and they are named as a beneficiary in our wills.  I never worry about our money being put to good use when it goes to HHT because I know it will be.  The people associated with HHT work tirelessly to rescue and take care of horses that would otherwise die horrific deaths.  Once the rescued horses are released to their custody they spend countless hours rehabbing and training them so they can be adopted and have a forever (we hope) home.  There are not enough superlatives to describe the work done by HHT and the folks associated with it.
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	223889	1	/users/profile/287641	Leesa7391	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	Horse Haven of Tennessee is a wonderful organization that works tirelessly with local law enforcement in the rescue of abused and/or neglected horses.  They work diligently to give each and every equine that comes through their gate the food and medical treatment that is needed.  Beyond the "necessities" provided to our equine friends, the organization as a whole has the number one priority of loving all of the equine that we come across.  As a volunteer, is it very rewarding to the sickest equine come in, but be brought back to health and adopted out to their forever homes.  Thank you Horse Haven for having the drive and determination to carry out this much needed service!

Horse Haven is one of the hardest working groups I can say I have ever had the honor of being with.  They care not only for the horses that we bring in that need that extra love and care to bring back to health but they care about the volunteers as well.  Horse Haven takes that extra step to make sure we are there for the right reasons.  It's all about the horses at our barn and what we do for them.

The care, rehabilitation & welfare of horses is their greatest priority.  Horses that come in starved & abused are transformed into healthy, trusting, usable animals in the course of 6 months or so. Their eyes reveal their gratefulness for food, water,  vet care & love.  And Horse Haven is an excellent steward of donors' money with just 3 modestly paid employees & some 70 volunteers taking barn duty shifts. Everyone's care of the horses is a labor of love. A truly altruistic nonprofit that I'm honored to be a donor for. 
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	204167	1	/users/profile/266189	scwiek	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	This is a wonderful and caring organization.  Not only do they care for and rehabilitate abused and neglected equine, they also go the extra step and have education classes for their volunteers so that we can go out and assist our own communities, so we can all identify and report abuse and better care for our own animals in our own neighborhoods.  A pay it forward for our animal friends.

The volunteers rescue abused and neglected horses that would otherwise die a long and horrible death.  And they don't stop there.  They rehab them, get their weight up, check their behavior and then seek seek seek out the most suitable, loving homes for them.   One horse adopted means one more can be rescued.  And so it goes horse by horse by horse.   a former volunteer  
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	134472	1	/users/profile/180311	Waters	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I've loved horses my whole life, but growing up in a city limited my exposure to them.  Volunteering at Horse Haven has given me the privlege of caring for them, loving them 1 on 1.  This organization is so well run by just a few individuals and a ton of volunteers.  The rescued horses (mules, minis etc) never go hungry at Horse Haven, someone is pounding the pavement and phones always procuring food and hay for these grateful and deserving animals.  They stretch a donated buck further than anyone can.  Horse Haven is the best example of how volunteerism should work !

Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	175270	2	/users/profile/231606	Lisa289	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	Horse Haven of Tennessee is an amazing place that provides a safe place for abused or neglected horses throughout the state.  Through proper feeding programs, exercise, turn out and gentle hands giving loving attention, the horses are taught to live and to love again.  There is nothing more satisfying than seeing a once starved horse become fat and healthy and find their forever home!  I love working here as a volunteer!
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	175247	1	/users/profile/231582	Sickscent	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	Horse Haven is an incredible organization dedicated to rescuing abused and neglected equine in the state of Tennessee.  That being said, their efforts go far beyond what one might expect from a horse rescue.  Not only do they work tirelessly to save and care for these animals, they are on the ground day after day working with lawmakers and investigative agencies to ensure that these animals have rights and that the penalties for the abuse and neglect are enforced.  Where the penalties aren't strong enough - these wonderful souls are pushing for harsher penalties.  While not every rescue has a happy ending and being a volunteer can be heartbreaking at times, the rewards that come from working with Horse Haven far exceed any sadness.  There is nothing like watching a scared, emaciated horse come into the care of this organization and with love, care and patience thrive and find a loving forever home.   The daily positive changes in these animals give us all hope and I'm so thankful for Horse Haven!

Since I found Horse Haven of Tennessee, I am confident they are the organization that utilizes every penny to the fullest. The team at HHT rates an A+ in always communicating to their members. We are always updated on projects, rescues, education and everything else they do 24/7.  This group deserves recognition for their dedication to our equines friends.

Many people think only of dogs and cats need rescuing, but horses need help, too.  There are not a lot of rescues that are able to help these big, beautiful animals. Very happy we have such a wonderful group of people saving these horses here in East Tennessee!

Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	135541	1	/users/profile/181416	Sue_35	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/08/2012	I am a certified equine massage therapist.  I contacted HHT in 2007 to offer my services for free.  Other than massage, I had no horse background, yet from the minute I walked in, I felt completely among friends.  I gradually became more involved, especially when I noticed there were days when the executive director fed, watered, and mucked out all the stalls in the barn by herself.  (I can't think of another executive director willing to personally clean urine and feces in an animal rescue for 10 years, while refusing a paycheck, "because the horses need the money more.")  I eventually took over her Thursday morning and evening shifts (the latter with my 13 yr old daughter), trained other shift workers, sold crafts and provided beverages on monthly Adoption Days, held some fundraising meals, and taught massage classes.  This year, I joined the Board of Directors and the Adoption Committee, where my law degree came in handy drafting a new adoption contract.  This expanding organization needs and challenges every kind of skill imaginable - just what this stay-at-home mom wanted!   Working with horses, photography, office skills, writing, baking, organizing events, scrapbooking, meet-and-greet functions - whatever your talents, they are welcome at HHT.
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	135339	1	/users/profile/181201	therips	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I originally started volunteering with HHT with my two daughters to introduce them to the concept of giving back and doing for others.  It started our family on a journey and we're all so much better for it.  We've been given the opportunity to not only help the horses but to learn so much about them and to help educate others about their needs and how to care for them.  We also adopted from HHT and our horses are part of our family.  I encourage everyone to get involved whether through volunteering, adopting or donating.  What an amazing group of people and what beautiful equines who deserve a good home.

We interviewed and were assigned the information table. Since then I have attended every Adoption Day with the exception of two.  For us it has been a great way to support a cause that we believe in and meet a lot of really cool people! Its remarkable for us to see frightened abused animals become happy healthy creatures able to join new families. Hannah Rose is quite the animal activist and we are proud of how HHT supports not only the individual animals but is active in the laws and policies such as those dealing with horse slaughter and stricter laws to protect these magnificent beasts.

Horse Haven and ALL the people associated with it, are a true blessing.  It warms my heart to know that these horses get a chance to know a good life.  Even for the ones that don't make it, at least their last days are spent in the loving hands of Horse Haven volunteers.  I recently adopted two horses from Horse Haven and I am thankful everyday that I have been blessed with these two wonderful animals.  Both had been neglected and were severely emaciated when Horse Haven rescued them.  They now are healthy, happy and beautiful horses.

Sadly there's a need for a non-profit to take on mistreated, starved, & otherwise neglected equines, but thankfully Horse Haven's compassionate director and volunteers step in where cruel humans have failed these magnificent animals.  The horses seem to know that they are in a safe place once they arrive at Horse Haven.  We see their transformations from scared, wary, shy horses to trusting, inquisitive, playful horses almost instantly.  To see positive changes in a horse on a weekly basis is so uplifting. I am happy to call myself a Horse Haven volunteer.

After roughly three years of volunteering at HHT I have seen animals with broken bodies and spirits be renewed through volunteer patience and dedication so that they may go on to win competitions, become welcomed  members of many families,  and just simply live in comfort and peace.  HHT has changed the lives of equines and it has enabled me to grow as a leader, as a  lover and advocate for all animals, and as a friend to the volunteers who do so much for our cause.  My family has both adopted and fostered HHT horses and we could not be more blessed or grateful for the opportunity to share our love for such brave animals through the unending efforts of HHT volunteers and staff.  
Horse Haven of Tennessee Inc	134521	1	/users/profile/180362	Curtis Dush	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	Horse Haven of Tennessee is an amazing place. The horses come in with hearts full of sadness and pain. Often little more than skin and bones, they arrive with looks of mistrust and uncertainty. But love and caring and hope for a better tomorrow is what they find when they arrive at Horse Haven. Kind voices and loving hands care for them day in and day out. Volunteers who arrive like clockwork, in the heat of summer and cold of winter, help these battered souls realize that they are in a safe place, help them learn to trust again. It is such a wonder to watch these horse bloom again, tossing their heads and running with the joy they once had lost. I am humbled by their healing, and grateful that such a place as Horse Haven exists. I hope some day, places like Horse Haven are no longer needed, but until then I am thankful it is here.

I had missed a recent adoption event, but called and made an appointment to go searching for a 'husband horse'. I had some specific qualities I wanted to have, but I was open to suggestions. I was introduced to 'August' (now known as Lance) and as they say the rest is history. The staff at HHT helped me find my dream trail horse. Although he was intended for my husband, I couldn't resist keeping him for myself. Later in the year, HHT took on a large number of rescues and housed them at the World's Fair Park in Knoxville. I couldn't donate or afford to adopt another, so I volunteered my time cleaning stalls and feeding horses. The regular volunteers on duty were friendly and very personable. If I could volunteer on a regular basis, this is the group that I would want to work with. Whenever I'm ready to adopt another, I won't hesitate to start my search at HHT.

It gives me the time to forget about my outside problems and just lets me focus on the horses needs and just helping them. I've had horses all my life well recently I had to put my horse down that I had for 9 years it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Volunteering at Horse Haven gave me the chance to just build bonds with the horses and help me get through the hard part of putting mine down. 4 months later I fell in love with one of the horses there and ended up adopting him. He is the most important thing to me now and if it wasn't for horse Haven I wouldn't have got that chance. I can't thank Horse Haven enough for accepting me as a volunteer and letting me adopt a horse. Every time its my day to volunteer it just makes me excited and makes that day so much greater I love Horse Haven!

Today, he's a beautiful healthy horse.  I give thanks every day for the dedicated folks at Horse Haven who take care of hundreds of horses in need.

His HHT name was Black Jack and we renamed him Valentino. Vali became such a great therapeutic riding horse that in 2011 he was named the Path International (Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship) Equine of the Year. This prestigious honor is rarely given to such a young horse (Vali was nine at the time) and as far as I know he is the only horse trained specifically for therapeutic activities to receive this award. As a TR instructor, Vali is my horse of choice and I consider myself privileged to be part of his story. Everyone at HHT was amazing through the adoption process and beyond. I highly recommend them and hope people who can send them much needed funding and supplies. They are the best!

The staff and volunteers are a wonderful, caring group of people who definitely work hard for the care and comfort of all the horses, donkeys and mules that arrive at the facility.  One mare in particular arrived with a major injury to one of her rear legs.  Although the wound was horrendous, she has responded incredibly well to treatment and knows that she is loved by all who are involved with her care.  Someone even put an angel on her stall door to watch over her.  I believe that her recovery has been aided by all the love she receives from the volunteers.  All of the horses have their own personality and quirks, but they are all very deserving of our love and care.  The best days are adoption days when one of these beautiful creatures goes to their forever home.  There are smiles all around on those days.

Specifically, Ive been honored to watch their accomplished and passionate staff  work to improve the lives of children and their families through in-home family counseling, in-patient treatment for children, adoption, foster care, and transition services for kids aging out of foster care.  There is a tremendous need for all of these services, and Youth Villages is a leader in its field in providing them.In short, Youth Villages is an amazing organization doing incredible work, and I highly encourage others to consider supporting their mission.
Youth Villages	310815		/users/profile/402156	Serenity411	Client Served	5	10/14/2016	My son had made some poor life choices in his early teens. He chose the wrong friends, chose the wrong extracurricular activities, and had become hopelessly lost in drug abuse. He was sent to the Youth Villages facility in 2014. I personally had little hope, but was greatly encouraged after speaking with those who worked there...those same people gave, also, of their free time volunteering as mentors for these children. I recall a conversation with one of these "saints in skin". He told me that the percentage of failure seemed, from his experience, to depend greatly on parent participation. He was very encouraging, sharing that even the small percent that made it was well worth his time and effort. The percentage he gave me was somewhat sad, but, too, was the percentage of these kids whose parents had also, in MY opinion, had completely given up and just left these kids "alone". I made that effort this man had talked about, even though it was many many miles from home...and in time, surprisingly, I started seeing improvements in my son. He got clean, and realizing there were others who truly seemed to care about him, he started caring, as well. He is a healthy young adult now. He's learned the hard way what not to do, and thanks to the "tools" this program gave, not only him, but me, as well, he has accomplished things I couldn't even fathom when he was first enrolled in this program!
Youth Villages	310465	1	/users/profile/401816	K88B	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/13/2016	I have been an employee for Youth Villages Intercept program for nearly 3 years. Youth Villages is a professionally ran agency with clear and reasonable standards for it's employees. The Intercept program is an intensive in-home program that requires commitment on the part of employees and offers amazing growth and progress for it's clients. Upon discharge from the program, it is easy to see the strides that families have made with the help of their Family Intervention Specialists and Clinical Care Liaisons. Leadership is always available to staff for assistance or to listen when needed. Leadership goes above and beyond to help solve issues faced by staff as well as client families. Salaries for non-profit agencies is never as much as we would like it to be but we go into this field aware of that fact. Youth Villages offers it's staff competitive salaries as well as mileage reimbursement and opportunities for team builders, annual conference attendance and stresses self-care for it's employees. I have also experienced great support in obtaining my master's degree while in employ with Youth Villages even as far as being allowed to do my practicum with our Regional Supervisor. I am happy to work for Youth Villages Intercept program in Indiana. 
Youth Villages	310403		/users/profile/401757	HeatherO	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2016	I started with Youth Villages over 16 years ago! When I started I had recently received my bachelors degree and I was trying to find my own professional niche. A friend worked for Youth Villages and recruited me over by saying that Youth Villages is "supportive of staff and you actually make a difference through clinical work". I was so proud when I was hired and I haven't looked back since! Youth Villages has provided me with educational opportunities, leadership prospects, and growth goals. You can work anywhere to work with youth but I prefer to work with an evidence based organization impacting youth by doing what we say we're going to do.  
Youth Villages	310029	1	/users/profile/401380	Lrvici01	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/12/2016	Lyndsay and Greg with Youth Villages are absolutely amazing. They have the biggest hearts and work so hard to help the children and families in the Youth Villages program to better their quality of life. I have worked with both of them on multiple events including a recycled rides giveaway, multiple charity golf tournaments, and a couple of career fairs. Every time we have worked together it has been fantastic. Thank you Lyndsay and Greg! 
Youth Villages	309861		/users/profile/401215	emmlibe	Client Served	5	10/11/2016	2 years ago I was a troubled teen. Struggling with school, my life at home, depression, and alcohol. When I first arrived to YV Inner Harbour, I was crying because I did not want to be there. I thought I was ok and that it was everyone around me that needed help. However, after a couple of weeks in treatment, I started opening up and becoming aware of the problems I had. The program I went through really helped me and changed my life drastically. I now am doing well in school, my life at home is fine, I now have my depression under control, and I no longer use alcohol. Throughout my life I had been to several treatment centers. Youth Villages is what saved me. 
Youth Villages	309846	1	/users/profile/401198	Writer	Donor	5	10/11/2016	Very impressed with the approach Youth Villages uses to help children and families stay together.  The metrics speak for themselves!
Youth Villages	309449	1	/users/profile/400814	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/10/2016	I work for Mattress Firm here in Nashville and we are proud to be partnered up with this great organization.  The folks at Youth Villages provide a safe and welcoming environment for the youth in middle Tennessee.  My team and I have had the opportunity to spend days hanging out with the great people at each campus around Nashville.  This non profit is an invaluable asset to our state.  Thank you for all that you do!    Not everyone can be a foster parent, But anyone can help a foster child. 
Youth Villages	309126		/users/profile/400482	Grace44	Client Served	5	10/08/2016	I can't express how wonderful this place was to my daughter. Our daughter had been to many places prior to Youth Villages in Bartlett, and this place is by far the BEST! They do such a good job making each child feel at home. We just got back home in AR with my daughter, who was there for a little over 3 months. I've unpacked countless gifts; from stuffed animals, to tennis shoes, lotions, decorative pillows, shampoos and soaps, shirts, candies, steel water bottles, etc... On the way home, I heard many stories of peer trips skating, to the movies, new friends, meeting Miss TN (who did the girls make-up) park trips, pizza nights, picnics, movie days/nights, mentor trips to dinners and shopping, etc... From the counselors, staff, nurses, teachers, and the head director, I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart, for taking such wonderful care of my daughter, and making a huge difference in her life. We still have a long road to go, and a lot of work left to do, but Youth Villages made sure my daughter had the recommended therapies set in place, back in our home town, to continue with her progress. I also want to thank Youth Villages for providing our family a nice hotel to stay in while we'd visit. There was only one staff that I'd complain about and warn other parents of teen daughters about; Mrs. Dockery. She was mean and hateful to the girls, calling them names, and cursing at them. However, when around parents, she acts very sweet and kind. I surprised her one evening as I walked into the school, and I caught her screaming and cursing at the teen girls. As soon as she saw me, she changed her attitude real quick, but it was too late, I had already heard how terrible she verbally abused the girls.
Youth Villages	308838	1	/users/profile/400217	Writer	Board Member	5	10/07/2016	Youth Villages goes above and beyond. I am always amazed each time I attend a meeting at the work that is being done. Truly honored to be involved with such a great organization. 
Youth Villages	308688	1	/users/profile/400063	Writer	Board Member	5	10/07/2016	Youth Villages is doing incredible work for youth - their staff is selfless and looks to the best interests of every child that comes through their care.  One way the organization does this is they coordinate a "Backpack heroes" project every year at the start of the school year where volunteers can put together backpacks so the students have what they need at school.  This is just one of the MANY ways that Youth Villages supports their youth.
Youth Villages	308681	2	/users/profile/400055	Dan_92	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	Youth Villages is an amazing organization that does incredible things to support the youth in our markets. We've had the wonderful opportunity to do some volunteer activity with them over the past couple of years and witnessed first hand the positive impact they're having on the lives of Youth at risk.  We are proud to call them one of our favorite non-profit partners and look forward to a long and lasting partnership!
Youth Villages	308671	1	/users/profile/400045	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	The staff of Youth Villages is committed to the mission of the organization in a way that is contagious.

Youth Villages	308353	1	/users/profile/294049	Kellye S.	Board Member	5	10/06/2016	I was looking to get involved with a charity when  I stumbled upon Youth Villages.  I could not be more impressed with the staff. They show a true commitment to serving the needs of at risk youth in our communities.  Their programs are measurable and get results.  I was so impressed with the staff that I now serve on the community advisory board.  Highly recommend! Kellye Stuart
Youth Villages	230414	1	/users/profile/294049	Kellye S.	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I've volunteered with numerous charitable organizations over the years but found my true favorite when I discovered Youth Villages.  The Transitional Living Program stands out to me as a beacon of what can be achieved when we all work together to help at risk youth achieve their potential.  There is no reason for any child to be discarded and left to fend for themselves just because they turn 18.   The TL Program helps these at risk teens find a path to a productive and  successful future which benefits society in general.  I cannot say enough good things about the leadership and genuine caring attitude  I a see among the staff at Youth Villages.  In my experience, this organization stands above the rest. Sucess can be measured and it is seen in the life changing statistics achieved by the TL Program. Kellye StuartVolunteer, Community Advisory Board to Youth Villages, Middle Tennessee 
Youth Villages	308319	1	/users/profile/399708	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I have worked on multiple projects with Youth Villages over the past 5 years.  As a volunteer, the Youth Villages staff is always organized and grateful for the support volunteers provide.  They are set and ready whenever we arrive and makes donating our time and energy as easy as possible...maybe this is why we continue to come back!!   As an organization, they always put the needs and protection of the children and families first.  This is something I admire most about the organization.  They go above and beyond to make children/families in unfortunate situations feel protected, heard and supported.  
Youth Villages	308316	1	/users/profile/399706	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I have worked with Youth Villages for a number of years, and the staff and the experience is truly amazing.I have worked with many of the group homes in Nashville.

Youth Villages	235060	6	/users/profile/312056	Jamie75	Client Served	1	12/07/2014	Oregon- first thing I notice is that its filthy. Then I find out even though my son is licked up 24/7 he only receives 1 - hour of therapy a week. I went every week for family therapy which dies not exist. Most unprofessional therapists I've ever met. No communication,they don't listen to the parent or child they do as they please on a power trip. Do not place your children here.
Youth Villages	232904	1	/users/profile/296540	Renee55	Board Member	5	11/05/2014	I can't say enough about Youth Villages and the work they do to help young people have quality lives.   As we all know, children are our future and that investment made with each child is extremely important.   Youth Villages, partnered with volunteers from the community and various businesses, provides a great level of support that wouldn't otherwise be there for these children.   Youth Villages should be in every city and state in the nation.   Children need this "benefit" and support.  
Youth Villages	232763	1	/users/profile/296358	Blaine L.	Advisor	5	11/03/2014	I used to think I understood what made Youth Villages great. My family has long been involved with their cause, helping to raise money through an annual 5K run. Through Youth Villages, my mother mentored a girl whose family had abandoned her. But it wasn't until I worked with Youth Villages recently, as an adult, that I understood the scope of what they do. There are a lot of nonprofits who help children. Even some that help with the kinds of issues that troubled children face. But no group I've ever worked with changes lives the WAY that Youth Villages does. By choosing to serve "the kids that no one else will take on", CEO Pat Lawler immediately distinguished himself and his organization as one that that believes, wholeheartedly, that no child is a lost cause.  But to then go even further and rigorously test the outcomes of their kids even 2 years after helping them is astounding. This pioneering commitment to data-driven research in this field is evident in every single employee I encountered at Youth Villages. They truly believe in the idea that "whatever it takes... is the only thing that really works." You see it in the way their caseworkers truly care about these children and their families. You see it in the countless hours they work. You see it in the faces of kids who have never had someone in their life that cares about them as much as Youth Villages' people do. Working with Youth Villages as an advisor taught me so much about them, but it also taught me even more about myself. It's easy to be cynical. It's much harder to believe in the potential of a kid who has been through more trauma and abuse than most adults could ever imagine. But Youth Villages does. And when you see their work in action - when you visit the homes of families in turmoil and see up close what their methods can accomplish - you come away changed. For the better. I've always been happy with my career. But I've never been as proud of my job as I was when Youth Villages was my client. I will forever be an ardent supporter of this organization, its people and most importantly - the kids and families they help everyday.
Youth Villages	232471	1	/users/profile/296009	luluma	Board Member	5	11/01/2014	Youth Villages is focused on our most vulnerable children, ones with behavioral and social issues that prevent them from succeeding in school and in life.  This evidenced-base intervention partners with families to keep children out of foster home and in the home.  It has changed lives of children across the nation and now it is changing lives in Massachusetts.

These children not only need love but need  to know God and how He wants them to live when they get back out in the world. I have seen many changes in these girls that I have worked with for a long time and they are good changes. Thank God for a place like Youth Villages

Youth Villages	231512		/users/profile/295095	iowatotenn	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I work with Youth Villages specifically with their Holiday Heroes and Backpack programs.  I specifically admire how they meet the needs of so many children of all ages.  They don't stop when the young person reaches the age of 18.  Youth Villages successfully helps young people further their education which allows these young people to  go and lead successful and independent lives.   
Youth Villages	231472		/users/profile/295062	Chris174	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	What a great organization! I specifically love their Transitional Living Program. They have had tremendous success helping young adults prepare for the future.

That is how I found Youth Villages. I was actually able to shop and provide a Christmas for a child who would not have had a Christmas, were it not for our contributions. The following year, we were able to provide Christmas for the entire family! I am  not sure who the winner is. We felt so honored to be able to provide for everyone! During the year, a need will arise for some of the children, and we can help provide for that specific need. I absolutely LOVE Youth Villages and I feel honored to be a part of all that they do.

The staff and volunteers are making a significant, positive difference in the lives of the families they serve, and their work is so important.  My company became involved with Youth Villages through their (awesome) Backpack Heroes program to provide school supplies for local children who couldn't otherwise afford them.  The program  really struck a chord with our employees, and we had one of the best responses ever to a community service project, and we have regularly participated in that program and their (also awesome) Holiday Heroes program ever since. We love knowing that, through Youth Villages, we're helping local families.

Miss Della and Miss Hilda have been a godsend and very supportive of my efforts with the boys. It's great and praiseworthy that a secular organization like YV allows me and others to share the gospel, the Word of God, with our young brothers and sisters.  The staff at Brooks have also been supportive of my efforts to spiritually feed and nurture my boys. It's also cool that YV loves on and takes in kids who have no place to go, have gotten into trouble and/or have had a rough going in their life. Their contribution to society is sorely needed and probably not given enough recognition and praise. It's a difficult service to provide but YV does it and will continue to do it.
Youth Villages	230964		/users/profile/294575	creativespirit76	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I came to youth villages in search of a place I could believe in and help make a difference. This organization is amazing support to children and their families. They strive to promote families staying together and when that is not possible continue to support the child and family even when seperated. Oftenn children age out of programs not prepared for adulthood but youth villages has a transitional living program. This program has a high success rate for these children becoming productive members of society! They really do give hope to our communities and change lives one child at a time.

Glad to be able to help this organization when I can.   
Youth Villages	230762		/users/profile/294384	sugartreebelle	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	Youth Villages offers so many services to the youth in Tennessee and other states, it would be hard to mention them all.  Just briefly, I want to tout the success of the Transitional Living Services (TLC) program.  For any young person in the state of Tennessee, who for some reason is homeless at the age of 18 (at first designed for young people aging out of foster care) and who agree to sign up for the program and to comply with its guidelines.  They receive assistance with continuing their education, budgeting, writing a resume and developing interviewing skills, setting up an apartment, etc.,, while at they are also being empowered to act on their own with guidance as needed.  Each participant in the TLC has a case manager available 24-hours a day. The success stories are too numerous to mention.  Along with the TLC, I would give all services provided by Youth Villages five stars! My husband and I contribute financially to this program and we volunteer whenever possible for special events and fund-raiser.  Right now, we are looking forward to buying Christmas presents for several of their young adults and to gift wrapping as many presents as we can. I was an advocate for Youth Villages long before I became a member of the Middle Tennessee Advisory Board.  I can think of no way that any of the agency's programs could be improved.  The staff, foster parents, etc. are well-trained and quite professional. There is enormous support for Youth Village by community leaders, corporations and numerous volunteers.  Plus their data analysis on performance measures show that the agency provides excellent care and services.

Youth Villages	230644		/users/profile/294272	PamelaCMinor	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	This nonprofit organization is outstanding.  Helping our youths in this era is very important, helpful and needful at this present time. Their experience and knowledge is well needed and wanted as they seek out and get more information on how to help our youths to become useful and advance in their community so they can become productive citizens. These youths are getting the best help mentally,emotionally and spiritually in the surrounding area. Great job!
Youth Villages	230642		/users/profile/294270	gemster	Donor	5	10/30/2014	This charity is outstanding in the efforts and difference they make in the lives of youth's in our communities.  They are brilliant champions for these children and make use of every resource and avenue to integrate them as contributing members to society.  In many cases these children haven't had much in the way of role models or life experiences to build on.  Youth Villages offers this without any strings or pre-judgments attached.

I enjoy supporting the Transitional Living program for these young adults.  Youth Villages not only helps meet their living needs, but also instructs in basic skills like budgeting and how to apply for a job - skills that most of us take for granted.  Excellent caring staff that work with these people. 
Youth Villages	230415		/users/profile/294050	Kat-TN	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	One of the areas where this charity truly exceeds is by having the agility to provide immediate assistance to families with urgent needs.  The "hand up" is also very individualized on a case by case basis; what is needed for one family or child may not be right for another. Youth Villages also has a wonderful annual back-to-school program that provides back packs and school supplies to children that would not otherwise have them;  giving them a step in the right direction towards success in school. 
Youth Villages	230376		/users/profile/294011	Duglas1	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Several people in my department here at work volunteer at Youth Villages and speak of all the good things they do to positively impact the lives of those so much less fortunate than a lot of us. So I got on their email request list and when they are in need of items to help our city's youth, I do what I can to help via donation of items like clothing, housewares, etc. Its the least I can do!!

My friend and I have been birthday Heroes at one of the girls cottages for almost two years. In both situations we have watch the children start out withdrawn,sad or angry. These children come from very tough situations.  Over time, they become more confident, start to smile or look you in the eyes. These amazing transformations happen because of the dedicated staff, therapists, mentors, volunteers, organized programs- I could go on and on.  The thought and effort put into healing the broken spirits of these children  is truly amazing! We feel blessed and honored to  be able to volunteer at Youth Villages.
Youth Villages	230356		/users/profile/293995	MediaPaige	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Volunteers have the opportunity to connect with individual staff members, who present a wide range of volunteering opportunities. From helping families with specific, emergency needs to annual programs like stuffing back-to-school backpacks for children needing school supplies, Youth Villages helps volunteers connect to children and their families in meaningful ways.
Youth Villages	230353		/users/profile/293994	wilsonka	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Our company has participated in a number of various activities with Youth Villages and the impact that they have on their clients and the community in general is incredible.

Youth Villages	230350		/users/profile/293991	Seyboo	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	I am a supporter of this great organization and have seen firsthand how effective their services are to children and their families.  Their holistic approach to address all factors of a child's life truly separates them from similar nonprofits. 
Youth Villages	230334		/users/profile/293976	Grneyz	Volunteer	4	10/30/2014	Youth Villages goes above and beyond in their care and concern for the youths in their program.  They are professional, yet approachable, so any oppportunity to lend my time and/or monies to Youth Villages, I do without giving it a second thought.
Youth Villages	230333		/users/profile/293975	Henryboyd	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	About 15 years ago we changed the beneficiary of our fund raiser to Youth Villages after researching the percentages of money raised  that went into their  programs and the results they achieved. Both were found to be high and have continued to rise. The last six years I have  volunteered twice a week at one of the residential campuses and have seen first hand the quality of services they provide the children in their care. Youth Villages is a model for what children's services should be.
Youth Villages	230325		/users/profile/293967	tdnashville	Donor	5	10/30/2014	This organization does so much to help the youth of Nashville.  They help children grow into productive members of society even though they might be struggling at home and at school or even have out-aged the foster care system.
Youth Villages	230317		/users/profile/293959	Karen309	Donor	5	10/30/2014	I have been involved with Youth Villages' Holiday Heroes program for the last 15 years.  They excel in providing the community's underprivledged children a chance to have a nice holiday.
Youth Villages	230311		/users/profile/293954	kathie6	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Very kind and helpful staff. Working for the best outcome for children and their families.  I am familiar with their work first aa a mental health professional and now as a supporter and volunteer. They are outstanding in every way. 
Youth Villages	230307		/users/profile/293949	LynnMT	Donor	5	10/30/2014	The Youth Villages location in Nashville TN works hard to meet the needs of their clients and by doing so gives community members like myself the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of children and young adults by contributing.  I love their Holiday Heros program and have been an active participant for over five years.  
Youth Villages	230301		/users/profile/293944	Anita34	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Youth Villages is an amazing organization, where the sole purpose is helping families. I am honored to have the privillage of working with them. 
Youth Villages	228736		/users/profile/292415	DaphneLarge	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Youth Villages truly changes children and their families lives in a positive way!     Youth Villages has spent 25 years pioneering an approach that is measurably better for children and their families and provides a remarkably better return on investment for those who fund these services (both public and private).   It's not just about actions, it's about results - long term results.   Whether it's through their residential, adoption, foster, intensive in-home treatment, transitional living or specialized crisis services they are just the right answer at just the right time to positively impact lives.   Nothing is more important than our youth for they are our future!   Won't you consider supporting Youth Villages today and helping them be the difference?   
Youth Villages	227086		/users/profile/290818	edgerton74	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have worked with Youth Villages for over 5 years.  The last several years I have sponsored a village with a couple co-workers through their Holiday Heros program.  The kids are incredibly grateful and the staff is always on the ball.  In all my experiences with Youth Villages I have found every employee to be 100% dedicated to the mission.  Youth Villages is making a difference in how we as a society work with at risk youth for the betterment of our community and country.  I look forward to continuing to support YV as they work to help our youth and improve the lives of all.
Youth Villages	172040		/users/profile/227742	LCummings	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	I have lead a group of volunteers supporting Youth Villages for the past eight years.  We have adopted a cottage for an entire year coordinating monthly activities and mentoring with the kids along with celebrating birthdays and Holidays.  I can honestly say this is one of best run non-profit organizations I've been associated with.  All the Counselors are well trained, caring individuals who are stern but respected by the kids.  Youth Villages is truely making a difference, changing the path of some, helping dysfunctional families learn new life skills and teaching the kids there are rules in life that must be followed. The staff at Youth Villages are to be commended for the great work they do.  I hope my post will peak the interest of others to learn more about the work that is going on at Youth Villages for there is no other local organization that is doing what you're doing to help kids in our area who have been abandoned, abused or gotten into trouble like Youth Villages does..Our kids are our future, Youth Villages needs your donations and your time.  Thank you Youth Villages for what you do.....You Rock!
Youth Villages	163361		/users/profile/216868	sgaither	Volunteer	5	07/23/2013	Youth Villages is an amazing organization, and I am thankful I have had the opportunity to volunteer over the past year.  I helped build the Kaboom playground at the Bartlett campus, and volunteered for the Christmas Party for the Foster Care program.  Both experiences far exceeded my expectations.  I would urge anyone looking to get involved with a non-profit organization to choose Youth Villages.  Each time I visit the campuses, I can feel the love and support of the staff and other volunteers.  Youth Villages is EXTRAORIDINARY!
Youth Villages	162639		/users/profile/215858	ljolly	Volunteer	5	07/15/2013	I have had the opportunity to volunteer at Youth Villages. Youth Villages get's it. They understand the needs of the children and that is very inspiring. I have been able to participate in the Kaboom build, Christmas & Valentines day parties. The staff is wonderful and very professional. We need more Youth Villages because they are doing everything right.
Youth Villages	162356		/users/profile/215483	lhiggins	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	I have had the opportunity to work as a volunteer at Youth Villages for the past 2 years on multiple events such as the Kaboom playground build, Christmas party, Valentines Day party, and the Easter egg hunt.  Youth Villages is such a great organization and it means the world to me that I was able  to take part in these events. What really touched me the most, was the interaction between the staff and the children. The staff is amazing with the children and you can tell that the children really enjoy being a part of such a wonderful establishment.
Youth Villages	161850		/users/profile/214668	lmills	Volunteer	5	07/01/2013	I have worked as a volunteer at Youth Villages for 15 years.  What a wonderful, professional and well ran operation.  The staff is very well structured to handle the complexed operations, events and fund raising.  What is truly more intriguing is to see the interaction with the staff and youths under their care.  I have never seen any disruptions, anything out of control, no confusion or disorder.  Youths are well attended to and the staff displays caring about what most would expect.  I get frequent updates and messages outling what is going on at the campuses, marketing and special events.  I can't imagine missing out on giving back and serving this organization.  My heart goes out to the staff, upper management and especially the youths.  
Youth Villages	161722		/users/profile/214509	Amanda85	Volunteer	5	06/28/2013	Youth Villages is wonderful! I have served as a committee member on several events. The entire organization and every event is truly dedicated to improving the life of children and keeping their families together. They do so much good on so many different levels and I am happy to be a volunteer for the organization!
Youth Villages	161703		/users/profile/214488	bethn	Volunteer	5	06/28/2013	I'm at Youth Villages once a month leading a project for a group of boys.  It is absolutely remarkable the things they can do with children.  Since I'm there so regularly, but with some time between visits it's like seeing time-lapse pictures of the transformation of the children.  And the changes are amazing.  I'm honored to be able to be a very small piece of a truly fantastic organization.  I can't say enough good things about this organization.
Youth Villages	161693		/users/profile/214477	Ty__2	Volunteer	5	06/28/2013	I have personally worked with Youth Villages on several different events. As a media sponsor, (Radio) working along side Youth Villages and Aaron Keegan has been a huge eye opening experience and a blessing to give back on a local level! It's more than just writing a check and feeling good about yourself it's about getting in and seeing results helping our youth live better lives no matter their circumstances. 
Youth Villages	161690		/users/profile/214475	DTL88	Volunteer	5	06/28/2013	I have personally worked with Youth Villages for the past 9 years as a consultant and volunteer at multiple events.  My own kids have volunteered and said it was personally satisfying.  Since 1986 Youth Villages has been successful at helping children with emotional or behavior trouble.  They current help over 20,000 children and families each year from more than 20 states and Washington, DC.There employees are very dedicated, always friendly and a pleasure to help.  It was amazing to hear that Youth Villages employees gave back 1.3 Million Dollars to the company.  WOW.Working with the children has always been such a blessing.  Knowing that Youth Villages has a 86%+ success rate in helping kids and there family succeed in life makes anything I do worth the sacrifice.  I would love to see more businesses join forces to donate to Youth Villages so we can insure more kids have the opportunity to live a life free of emotional stress or behavior issues.   
Youth Villages	161681		/users/profile/214468	dkirby	Donor	5	06/28/2013	I have been invovled with Youth Villages for several years as a donor and a volunteer. To see the impact that they have on the young adults that they transition into adulthood is amazing. All of the teachers and counselors at all of their locations really care about these kids. Nobody is their for a job.  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80431		/users/profile/87800	lori cogan	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	I live on State Street in Bristol VA, having just moved here last July. As a member of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce, I helped the Rhythm and Roots Reunion executive director, Leah Ross, prepare a PowerPoint presentation about the festival to show to at the chamber membership breakfast. After that project, I bought tickets and couldn't wait to attend. Putting the presentation together with Leah taught me how people come, and from all over - including several foreign nations - to listen to music and enjoy this festival. I also learned how the community deeply supports the event - with many corporate supporters, volunteers, in-kind service donors and musicians all chipping in to make the magic happen. When BRR threw out the welcome mat, my husband and I were there within the first hours, and we were blown away. BRRR is part block party, part hoe-down, part gospel revival, and ALL Americana roots music all the time. So many people crowded downtown, yet everyone was having a fun time. I saw no issues. That kind of success takes strong leadership and a core group of volunteers who share a clear vision. I cannot wait to get more involved this year and enjoy it all over again. 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80268		/users/profile/87632	Kristin S.	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	Last year was our first experience with BRRR and our experience with the event was excellent. We live out of town so we don't have access to the traditional media in the area but the organization has done a great job of keeping us informed. We are so pleased to see the positive effects that the September event and the other year round events are bringing to a wonderful downtown area that really needs a boost. We especially love how BRRR celebrates the pioneers who started Country Music with the Bristol Sessions yet really embraces music as self-expression that can take many forms. One of the best things about BRRR is how hard they have worked to make the festival accessible by keeping ticket prices low. It was such a pleasure to see so many generations enjoying the traditional and new music side-by side. 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80264		/users/profile/87627	Priscilla	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	From the professionalism of the staff, to the friendliness of the volunteers, this event could not be better run. The choices of the artists is outstanding, all of them being so accessible to the general public. I discovered the festival in 2006, the year I moved to Bristol and have been going ever since. I, of course, have my favorites, but it is great to discover new talent. The weekend pass is a steal, some artists you can't even get a ticket for that price.  Other festivals charge that much for one day. I hope this festival becomes number one in the country.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80233		/users/profile/87596	TerryK	Client Served	5	02/28/2011	This year will be our 6th Bristol Rhythm and Roots. There is no doubt that we will attend, come hell or high water!We love this festival for so many reasons. The many venues, indoor and out, offer the opportunity to see big name bands and smaller lesser known acts. That's often the best part, going home with new favorites that we have discovered for ourselves at BRR. Weather is never a problem-if it's rainy, there are any number of places to duck into and still hear great music.The vendors are great, we look forward to the food almost as much as the music! Fabulous barbecue for my meat eating husband and lots of vegetarian options for me. It's fun, too to see the musicians at each others' shows. It really is a reunion for them and has gotten to be one for us when we meet friends we have seen year after year at BRR.We go to the big expensive festival in N Wilkesboro every year, too and Bristol has just as much to offer as far as talent and non stop music-at a fraction of the price. But we would go to BRR at any price, it's just a great festival.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80202		/users/profile/87563	mom2jst1	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	This festival and it's beyond-belief talented band line-up will BLOW YOUR MIND!  The first time I went, it was with a 'sure, why not?' attitude.  Now, I wouldn't miss it!  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80154		/users/profile/87514	vkatwt	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	Bristol Rhythm and Roots is one of the most family friendly music festivals around.  What other festival has a place for families to stop in and rest for a while before heading off to the next venue!  The Baby Comfort Station, hosted by La Leche League of the Mountain Empire, is such a fantastic place for families to stop in to nurse, change, or simply rock and rest while enjoying the amazing musical offerings at RRR.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80146		/users/profile/87505	Jon Lohman	Advisor	5	02/28/2011	I have worked closely with Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion for the past two years, producing the "Virginia Folklife Stage."  I work with about 10-15 festivals per year.  This is clearly one of the very best.  It showcases a wonderful creative and diverse array of musical styles, and succeeds in reaching a broad audience.  The programming at the festival is consistently top notch, and there is a real, concerted and thoughtful effort to compliment the music with educational initiatives, providing a truly intimate experience for the visitors.  To me, though, the greatest thing about this festival is the way it engages the entire business community, with stages in practically every restaurant, coffee shop, storefront, and tavern.  It truly is a festival for and by the community!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80145		/users/profile/87502	Whit M.	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	Rhythm and Roots is one of our favorite weekends in Bristol!  The talent is always tremendous.  The vendors are fantastic.  We always show up first thing Saturday morning and have more than once closed it down after midnight!  Even my kids enjoy the long day!  If you have never attended the Rhythm and Roots Reunion, do yoursef a favor and plan to show up this year.  You will not be sorry!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80138		/users/profile/87497	mervdog	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	The Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion continues to exceed my expectations and the expectations of all in attendance. Each year provides the best in Roots and Americana music with a focus on local, regional and national performers. The multi-venue scheme is a non-stop entertainment weekend with a surprise around every corner.If you have not been to Rhythm and Roots you are missing the perfect opportunity to experience small town America at it's best in the official birthplace of country music.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	80122		/users/profile/87482	debra	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	i live in bristol,tn. and have attended this event ,it is a great time for all..
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	78063		/users/profile/85331	Bobby W.	Volunteer	5	02/26/2011	Since the festival began, I have only missed 2 years of the most incredible music and adventure I could have had those years. Rhythm and Roots has brought to light a generation of singer/songwriters that very well could have been looked over. The venue is set up in expertise, with everything happening on one main strip of the downtown Bristol area. The rustic antiquity of the stores and corner pubs being exploited in the utmost fashion, the feeling is always bright and enjoyable. Rhythm and Roots always brings the best of talents to the table, such as Del McCoury, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Ricky Skaggs, and the list goes on. Also to be mentioned, the increpurest piedible one-of-a-kind food, arts and crafts, and microbrewery vendors. This festival puts a spotlight on the history and existence of Appalachian culture and heritage, but also brings a variety of rock-a-billy, southern rock, and other types of great music to the lineup. Also, if you get just plain tired, you can visit one of the many businesses and bars that not only serve you food and drink, but hold entertainment all day long. I have personally discovered many new artists here that I may have never heard, and many fond and dear memories that I never would have had. If you are up for gettin' down on a piece of America's finest land, then Rhythm and Roots is the place for you. I hope to see you there in September.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	76891		/users/profile/84097	Barbara W.	General Member of the Public	5	02/26/2011	The BEST music festival we have attended!  In addition to the main stages there are different varieties of Traditional, Bluegrass, and Progressive music in the main street businesses.  Local talent and world-known talent all for your listening pleasure, located right in the heart and soul of where this music first evolved, "The Crooked Road, Virginia's Musical Heritage Trail".  The Roots! Got to go to the Reunion at Bristol!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	75577		/users/profile/82553	Jack S.	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2011	This is an awesome music event.Attending since the third year. The reunion has music fo everybody(at least I think so) always open it up on Friday evening ,close it down Sunday.Can't imagine not being there.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	75549		/users/profile/82527	Shanna S.	Client Served	4	02/25/2011	I attended Bristol R&R back in 2005.  It was great.  The musicians really mingle with those in attendance.  Old Crow Medicine Show was there that year and they really rocked out the place.  It is a nice family atmosphere as well.  The street vendors are neat too.  I highly recommend it.  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	75537		/users/profile/82516	Dano	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2011	What a fantastic place to meet some of the most talented musicians in the world! Where else could you walk up to someone like Darrell Scott, have a conversation with him, shake his hand and then him go on stage and put on a performance that will bring tears to your eyes?
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	75532		/users/profile/82511	Buckster13	Client Served	5	02/25/2011	Hands down this is the best music festival you will find in the Southeastern United States, possibly even the entire country (though I can't speak from personal experience on that.)  The tickets are entirely affordable and the variety of the venues offers something for every type of individual and mood.  Since the inception of the festival, organizers have consistently offered a lineup featuring the absolute best in Americana and Roots music (with up and comers and legends alike.)  I would recommend this festival to any music lover and have actually done so in a review of last year's festival on my blog: redeyedrooster.com/tenthannualrhythmrootsfestival/
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	75499		/users/profile/82462	Angie M.	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2011	One of my favorite festivals. There are so many things I love about this festival...the variety of music, venues, and people to start. Cozy pubs, beautiful old auditoriums, and open air concerts attended by people of all ages. Impressive main attractions, with many returning  favorites (Holy Ghost Tent Revival, oh yeah!). Best of all...it's a great atmosphere for meeting new friends, and looking forward to those reunions.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	74895		/users/profile/81821	Kate	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2011	Since I live in Bristol, I've been to every Rhythm and Roots Reunion from the beginning.  Every year, this festival invents new and exciting things for us 'old timers' to see and hear.  This past year we got to hear Joe Diffie and Ricky Skaggs and The Boxcars!!...(could be my new favorite group).  The vendors and volunteers are great. (last year, one of the vendors came running over to tell me there were bees hovering around my lemonade glass while I set up my chairs..to be careful)  The food stalls are wonderful. The crafters bring new and innovative products and there is music literally on nearly every corner and sometimes between street corners at the Busker Stops.  For 3 days and nights, you can plan out your route to catch your favorites and hear new groups you've just heard about from friends. (won't ever miss another 'Sythian' appearance).  If you've never been to Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion, you've missed the best of the best.  Also...you'll never find another music festival that keeps it's ticket prices so reasonable that the whole family can attend.  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	74494		/users/profile/81397	Stuart V.	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2011	After friends in the US had given the Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion the highest praise I began to take a lot of interest in this event. They recommended that, if I could make the trip from the UK, I would enjoy myself.  I began reading more about the history of Bristol and the history behind the BR&RR festival and the city itself - and was 'sold' on attending the 2010 festival. The city of Bristol is a fine place and to be able to walk down the streets were AP Carter, Jimmy Rodgers and so many more trod to make history was a marvellous experience. I made a trip out to Poor Valley and visited the Mt Vernon Church and, during this trip, not only remembered those that made the journey into Bristol in 1926 but also how difficult that journey would have been and how our musical heritage would have been the poorer without their determination. Seeing State Street closed off and filled with vendors, musicians and so many smiling and welcoming faces was just incredible; and to see the streets names after the famous participants on the 1926 sessions was a thrill. The festival has so many venues, from the beautifully restored Paramount Theater to the large State Street and Piedmont Stages and many smaler, more intimate venues where great music can be heard while supporting local businesses. The quality and range of music on offer is outstanding; from 'top-line' bands to lesser known but hugely talented artists - not forgetting the folks who just stop in State Street and jam (some of whom you might just see on a stage somewhere during the weekend) Camping facilities around Bristol are excellent with shuttle buses taking the strain of getting into and out of Bristol. In short, to hear such great music in a city (that feels like a village for the weekend) steeped in the musical past and present makes Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion a 'definite' for a return in 2011.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	74054		/users/profile/80919	CRMB	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion is a wonderful event for Bristol and the Tri-Cities at large!  The festival brought in over 45,000 people this year to the heart of our community, many of those from out of town, that's more people than the population of our 2 cities together.  Bristol is known for the Bristol Motor Speedway and now we are making known our heritage as The Birthplace of Country Muisc!  Thanks BRRR for promoting our culture and giving us great memories and awesome music to enjoy not only in September but year arround.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	73933		/users/profile/80797	penny4yourthoughts	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	I look forward to Rhythm and Roots every year!  The festival has truly transformed our city and offers great fun for locals as well as visitors.  Good music, good food, and fun activities for children and adults make it a 'must do' every year.  The coordination of the event is exceptional as are the hundreds of volunteers that help make it happen!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	73911		/users/profile/80775	Martrob2	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	Hands down my favorite time of year. My whole family comes in for the reunion. Along with their friends. It is nice to see many familiar names of bands coming back every year. It is, however, more exciting to find the new groups that come and make you fall in love with their style of music. The saddest part is when you come out of one of the last concerts and people are taking down the vending tents, stages and cleaning up. It just makes me ready for the next year. Everyone should experience Bristol Rhythm and Roots at least once.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	73675		/users/profile/80509	Susie	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	I love the Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion.  The diversity of the music is wonderful.  So many great bands to choose from.  As a mother of three young children the festival is very family friendly.  I feel very comfortable having my children with me and have no reservations about  the things they are exposed to at this festival.    
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	71271		/users/profile/77929	Todd G.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/19/2011	The best part of the Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion is their ability to give local musicians and less well known musicians exposure to a large audience. This helps sustain our music tradition and encourages musicians to continue playing. Just ask Ed Snodderly, Frank Newsome, Michelle Malone or Junior League. Or Scotty Melton, Annie Robinette, The Drunk Uncles, Carson Peters & the Rockhouse Stringband, Kelley & the Cowboys.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70883		/users/profile/77490	willie3	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	I am a native of Bristol and have attended Rhythm and Roots Reunion for three years now, and it gets better every year. The variety of the music, the people you meet and the atmosphere cannot be beat. The only thing I would change is expand the festival beyond main street. I have already got my tickets for this year and cannot wait.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70763		/users/profile/77350	Lisa A.	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	I've been attending BRRR for several years, the last 3 as a volunteer.  The music is wonderful, the atmosphere festive, and the whole experience is a highlight of my year.  BRRR has something for everyone, from families with young children to singles in search of a good time.  The music also is eclectic, with something for nearly every taste.  I can't wait for September to roll around!!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70760		/users/profile/77347	hockey101	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion Festival is so important to my musical education for several reasons. First, I always experience a type of music there that I am not familiar with. Second, the legends and professionals that fill the schedule are important contributors to music history. Third, discovery of the unknown is always the most valuable part of my festival experience every year. 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70756		/users/profile/77343	kimh	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	I am a native of Bristol and have attended Rhythm and Roots Reunion every year.  The festival continues to improve every year.  The cost of the three day pass is beyond affordable considering the number of acts presented.  I have compared to other festivals of this calibur and none can compare.  I plan my schedule around RRR weekend!  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70673		/users/profile/70257	robinpiney	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	I've been attending the Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion for 7 years, the last 5 as a volunteer. It has provided me with many great memorable experiences. I've reconnected with old friends I grew up with here in my home town and met and made new friends literally from around the world down on State Street these last few September long weekends. In addition I've enjoyed being a BR&RR Volunteer who helps with the Bristol Motor Speedway's annual Speedway In Lights through the Christmas holiday season. It's rewarding to be a part of this charity event which benefits 84 children's agencies in our region. More than just a music event (which I enjoy immensely!), BR&RR has built a cameraderie among its volunteers which drives us to give our best for those days in September, the organization and the town. It's been a crucial element in the renewal of downtown Bristol, Virginia-Tennessee, as well as bringing relevant contemporary musical artists and musical industry recognition to The Birthplace of Country Music.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70450		/users/profile/77009	slong116	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	We've lived all over the world during a 25 year military career and have not had a better experience at a festival anywhere than we had at Bristol's Rhythm and Roots Reunion!  This event is a winner in every sense.  Where can you find a music/food/history/art entertainment event that is equally friendly to families with small children, teenagers, and young adults?  The value is amazing also...for one low ticket price you can take in an infinite variety of shows.  The variety of music is astounding...this is NOT just your father's Bluegrass!  The venues are also amazing from the art deco Paramount Center to the huge Farmer's Market which accomodates over 1000 people (there seemed like at least 5000 there during the Ricky Skaggs night concert!).  We discovered beautiful music from acts that we had never heard of before like Red Molly (bought 3 of their CD's).  In short, this is an awesome event that needs to be on everyone's bucket list.  Warning:  this festival is addictive....come once, and you will want to come back each year!  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70101		/users/profile/76615	Bob B.	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	Our family has been attending Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion for the past five years and we love it.  My wife is a native Bristolian and every year she sees old friends she has not seen in years.  The bands are outstanding.  We already have our tickets for this years event.  We usually go to the event with several other couples and have our performers we want to see made out in advance.  It is a weekend event, Friday through Sunday.  The entertanment keeps betting bigger and better each year.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70057		/users/profile/76571	Patty	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	We love Rhythm and Roots - already have my tickets for this years festival!  Great bands- great music - fun for the whole family.  We live in Bristol and we spend the entire weekend downtown enjoying the food, friends and great music.  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	70039		/users/profile/76548	Melissa H.	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	This is such an incredible festival.  I spend about a week prior to the event going through the line-up trying to figure out how I am going to be able to see everyone that I want to.  The number of stages provides an opportunity to experience so many different styles of music and they are all outstanding.  Ticket prices are such a bargain for the caliber of talent that they are able to attract year after year.

Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	66679		/users/profile/72880	touchpoll	Advisor	5	02/11/2011	We have never been to a better run, more efficient, and clean music festival than the Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion. Every single person we met in the organization was EXTREMELY courteous and helpful in every way. There was absolutely no garbage that wasn't picked up and the clientele acted in a genteel manner throughout the show.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	66001		/users/profile/72147	Lissa H.	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	This is a great family experience and a tremendous opportunity to see close up and personal many of the performers who have shaped and are shaping American music. It's clean and well organized, and the rowdiness is restricted and generally confined to  spontaneous responses to the music. Although it gets more crowded every year, the organizers are very receptive to feedback from people who attend and make obvious efforts to improve the experience. It's all round not to be missed; I don't intend to. 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65857		/users/profile/71987	singer1219	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	This year will make our 4th year attending BRRR. I can't tell you what an awesome experience it is. Each time my son and I leave, we can't wait till the following year. This past year we took my 6yr old grandson, who absolutely fell in love with the performers. There is quite a diverse collection of musicians, that everyone will be able to find a group or soloist they love. Even my grandson had a favorite and actually got to have his pic taken with them. Kuddos to the staff, board members and everyone who has a hand in making BRRR the best 3 days of music in one place. We have met people from all over the country that attend each and every year. It truly is for the whole family and along with the performers, you get some fantastic food also. I guarantee you will leave after 3 days, uplifted and motivated to tell and invite more and more folks to join you the next time. I can hardly wait for September. Thank you BRRR!!!!!!!

The variety of music guarentees a little something for everyone.  Bristol puts on a wholesome event that's great for the entire family.  So bring the kids, the dog and a chair and get ready to enjoy the experience.  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65372		/users/profile/71457	Bob E.	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	Bristol RRR has done as much to improve quality of life in the cities of Bristol as anything in my memory.  It showcases our unique interstate downtown district,  our place in the history of popular music in the United States,  and the warm hospitality of our local populace.   A stage hand during three Reunions,  and a dedicated attendee since,  I can't imagine being anywhere else for the third weekend in September. I've been told by one popular band that BRRR is there favorite festival,  despite attending 40-50 each year.  According to them,  they are just as interested in attending the festival,  seeing old friends,  and catching other performers' acts as they are performing themselves.  The festival has an inside-out quality that gives everyone a backstage pass.  Performers wander the festival from gig to gig on the same streets as the audiences.  They drop in on performances all over the festival,  because they are fans as well as artists.   Perhaps the best indicator of quality of the event is that nearly everyone is having a wonderful time.  Smiles dominate.  Neighborliness,  good will and human kindness shine.  People come once and are hooked.   Bristol's downtown has been undergoing a noticeable and remarkable resurgence over the past decade,  and it's my opinion that the Rhythm and Roots Reunion has been the engine of that revival.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65340		/users/profile/71425	Jen O.	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	The Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion is one of the best music festivals in the United States for several reasons.  The organizers recruit both established and up & coming artists, they keep the ticket prices extremely reasonable, and they manage the festival very well.  There are plenty of options for dining, since restaurants in downtown Bristol are open during the festival.  I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed having a local festival like this.  I look forward to attending again this year.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65314		/users/profile/71395	Robin J.	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	Very rewarding experience to be able to give back to my community. Excellent vendors.....food....and the most amazing and eclectic gathering of music in our area....Thank you BR&RR for the opportunity and experience!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65302		/users/profile/71381	AllunsMom	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	The Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion is my hands down, favorite music festival of all that I have attended.  I can't even begin to tell of the wonderful memories of family sharing and amazing music! When I lived in the Tri-cities, it was one of the events I scheduled my vacation time around.  In 2005 I moved to New Jersey to live with my husband, and we were able to schedule 3 of the 5 years while there, for weekend passes at R&R.  That's a 10 hour drive but it was worth it! My three grown children lived in the Tri-cities also, and music is one of the most important things in our lives.  One of the highlights of my oldest son, Allun's life, was being able to perform with his band at the last two R&R Festivals.  Some of my most precious memories of him are of him and FSR rocking the rafters at Omainnins, stomping to Chinatown on the Piedmont Stage, sitting beneath the speakers at the Mural Stage while Allun told me every Gillian Welch song she would sing next, and seeing his eyes shine as he sang the words and the fiddle player of OCMS played his fiddle with so much passion that the bow just peeled off.  He was so happy and excited while he lived in Bristol,  that so many of the bands playing the Festival went back to his apt to hang out and jam all night in between shows.  I am so thankful for the joy that Bristol gave to him those few months while he lived there and especially for the R&R.  It has always meant so much to our family and this next R&R will be difficult without Allun there.  His great love for the music and the Festival were so important to him and I know he would want us to be there and hope that his daughter will be able to experience that incredible gathering of musicians and artists on the streets where her daddy sang and listened also as she grows up and dances her own dance.  Thank you Bristol R&R!!!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65258		/users/profile/71330	suzi hoo-boo	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	I don't think I've ever missed a Rhythm & Roots and for good reason! This is one of the greatest festivals I've ever attended. RRR truly celebrates the musical heritage that is Bristol. I'm always amazed by the talent that is represented, both established and new. I discovered some of my favorite bands at Rhythm & Roots. I appreciate the diversity of genres and also appreciate the committee's efforts to keep ticket prices as low as possible.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65168		/users/profile/71234	mcspiros	Donor	5	02/08/2011	In ten years of steady growth, Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion has become the model of a successful small town event. Three days of music on more than a dozen stages all contined in a compact downtown location, with styles running the gamut from traditional old-time gospel and bluegrass to new-grass, jazz, folk, and rockabilly and hard to describe acts. A rock-bottom price that allows nearly anyone to enjoy the entire weekend, and opportunities to volunteer to work for half a day in exchange for one day's admission for those who can't afford the admission. As a donor, the opportunity to support the festival and the community also for a low price is uniquely appealing. I've sponsored a stage for the last few years as an small business owner and feel great in being part of this labor of love. The word is out, the festival keeps growing. Until you experience it, you have no idea what a music festival can be.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	65114		/users/profile/71175	vwalling	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	This festival continues to amaze me. For less than 14 cents per act, this festival delivers some of the best music you can find anywhere. From the up and coming to the legacies of the music world, you will not be disappointed. There is everything from rock to bluegrass to country to blues to jazz. The worst thing about the weekend is that I know that there is no way to see all of the acts I want to see...not a real problem. This past year was my first year to volunteer for BRRR and the team behind the scenes is tireless with one mission: provide high caliber music for a very affordable price to anyone who wants to come to town to visit. The festival is wonderful because the people behind it are wonderful and work harder than any group of people I have ever known.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64693		/users/profile/70735	rlburns585	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	Bristol Rhythm & Roots is SUCH a fun festival that truly has every type of music from rock, to bluegrass, to country, to jazz.  It's a fun event for people of all ages! BRRR also showcases what a beautiful area northeast TN is and helps our local economy flourish! 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64630		/users/profile/70669	Amanda H.	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	My sister and I attended BRRR for the first time last fall. That weekend will stand out in my mind for a long time because of all the great memories we made. The festival seemed very well managed, for the number of people packed onto State St. for three days. I was always impressed with the cleanliness of the festival area and the level of courtesy and kindness displayed by volunteer staff. Though there are many stages, it is very easy to navigate from one place to the next. My only complaint about this type of festival is that it can force you to make some tough decisions about prioritizing one group over another if two of your bands end up playing around the same time on different ends of State Street.  Though, if that's the worst thing that happens, I think its a pretty good problem to have. :-) 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64624		/users/profile/70665	Bill S.	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	Brystol Rhythm and Roots Reunion is by far one of the best music festivals I have been to over the past 40 years. The talent is some of the best in the nation from national acts to local talent. Listening to the music both on outside stages and also in Brystol's indoor  theatre's makes this festival stand out from all others.  The admission is ther lowest I've ever paid recently for a music festival . The restaurants keep their prices very reasonable too.I'll certainly drive the 900 miles to be at this festival this coming year.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64621		/users/profile/70661	freeaf	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion Festival is a fantastic weekend experience at an affordable price. The festival provides a lot of musical diversity with roots in acoustic music. Bristor TN/VA is often called the birthplace of country music, and is especially known for its role in bringing the music of the Carter Family into the public domain. BRR&R, however, is not just about old-time, country, and bluegrass music. While those styles are represented, many bands are in the acoustic rock or "folk core" genre. Very upbeat, driving rhythm, and highly dancable. You can also find blues and reggae, and much more. As with many festivals, there is plenty of festival food and festival crafts, and many local restaurants offer draft or bottled beer for your festival enjoyment. Many craft breweries are represented. All in all, it's just a great festival!

Keep it coming Bristol, looking forward to this years line up.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64615		/users/profile/70654	Sean R.	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion is by far my favorite event of the year. I attended my first festival 3 years ago, and I have been every year since then. The festival provides more bang for your buck than any other festival in the country. Each year I look forward to seeing my old favorite bands, and opening my eyes (and ears) to new ones, and they never disappoint. The line up each year is always spectacular.  The fiestival is marked on my calendar each year. #rd weekend is September is always set aside for Bristol Rythma nd Rots.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64612		/users/profile/70651	Dixie	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	BRRR is a fantastic music festival.

A full weekend with over 100 bands within easy walking distance. We have enjoyed famous-name groups as well as lesser-known gems. Everything is fun and upbeat. We love it. A bargain for a weekend of entertainment!

Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	Where else would you be able to catch hundreds of bands, all within walking distance, for no more than 40 bucks for the entire weekend? You can't! The people of Bristol Rhythm & Roots Reunion are truly doing this for the fans! It's not for profit, it's purely for people who love music, especially the kind of music that can trace it's roots, right to Bristol. IT's easy to navigate, you have plenty of options of food and many places to take in a cold drink! I've become a fan of hundreds of new people simply by placing myself downtown during that weekend in September. There is never chaos, plenty of people to guide you and really a great team working extremely hard to put on a such a GREAT event! Great music, great venue, great time!!!!! 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64151		/users/profile/70126	dsflagg	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	This festival is just simply amazing!

Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64142		/users/profile/70115	Sister	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/07/2011	My experience with Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion has been nothing but great!  I have both attended, and worked with the staff through our office.  BR&RR is the most exciting music event we have in our area, and provides a wide-ranging selection of bands...something for everyone.  The only "problem" I see is that I have trouble deciding which stage to go to because I want to see and hear all of the bands/performers, and I can't be in two places at once.  This festival should be on everyone's "must attend" list!  This festival is a true service to the music community, and lovers of music alike.  And it's located in the Birth Place of Country Music to boot.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64135		/users/profile/70105	Steve Galyean	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/07/2011	I had the pleasure of attending the 2010 Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion.  It was extremely well run, with activities for a varied audience.  The "logistics" of the event were first rate.   The entertainment was top notch. The most impressive aspect was how the BRRR team has engaged the City of Bristol.  Throughout the City you would see "welcome" messages.  And, the downtown business within the area of the event, we all participating through extended business hours, special storefront displays, and overall friendliness to the folks attending the event.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64133		/users/profile/70103	dam5p	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2011	This is a great organisation.  I am from Roanoke, a comparbale city to Bristol located two hours away, and I would love to have a similar non-profit in my area.  They do things the right way.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	64035		/users/profile/70002	Sarah Williams	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	2010 was the best Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion event in my experience, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys acoustic, Bluegrass, folk, gospel, or country music. The impressive list of performers from 2010 is available at http://www.bristolrhythm.com/artist.php. Acts range from hughly popular to hometown favorites to brand new performers, and venues range from small and intimate to large, with both indoor and outdoor performances. During the festival Bristol closes a section of the main street -- State Street --  to provide outdoor performance stages. Restaurants host performers inside, and some set up outdoor food service areas close to outdoor stages. The wide proscenium stage at the restored Paramount Theater remains busy. We caught several acts at the Paramount, which is elegant and large enough for popular acts like the Carolina Chocolate Drops. In addition to the wonderful music, there are street vendors and a general atmosphere of celebration on State Street as people take a break to walk among the vendors' booths, chat with friends and strangers, and rush from one event to the other. Since Bristol is also home to the Bristol Motor Speedway and accustomed to large crowds on race day, there are plenty of accommodations reasonably priced, and Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion is an event well worth the money it costs to attend. The  event begins on Friday evening and continues all day on Saturday and Sunday. There is a children's event on Saturday morning which does not require tickets. You can purchase a ticket for a single day or a ticket for the entire event.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63944		/users/profile/69902	vatechvkd	Board Member	5	02/06/2011	Approximately 12 years ago, a group of volunteers from the Bristol area came together with a vision of sharing with others the opportunity to promote Bristol's musical heritage since we were named, by Congress, as the Birthplace of Country Music. It is amazing that after 10 festivals, we are still able to meet that mission!! I can remember that first year we had approximately 5000 people. Then the 2010 festival hosted approx. 45,000 people!!! It has been a privilege to be a part of such a wonderful three day event.  Our festival is family oriented, economically priced, and with the support of our community and financial sponsors, we open our arms to welcome all of our attendee's.  The two cities of Bristol's support is unmeasurable.  We are working hard on the 2011 festival and don't forget it is the third weekend in September!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63873		/users/profile/69824	Catherine Brillhart	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	Bristol Rhythm & Roots celebrated their 10th anniversary in 2010.  This festival has grown by leaps & bounds in just a short period of time.  It had an estimated crowd of over 40,000 people last year. Individuals from all over the United States, and even some from other countries, enjoy attending this event every year.  Ticket prices are very inexpensive, since you can purchase a weekend pass for less than one concert ticket for see most bands.  My husband and I have enjoyed volunteering our entire weekend for the past two years for this great event.  This is a DON"T MISS! 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63679		/users/profile/69621	callmereet	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	We can't wait for this to roll around each year.

Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63675		/users/profile/69616	Billie A.	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	This 3rd week in September each year in Bristol is the HIGHLIGHT of the year.  This coming year will be the 11th and each one gets better than the last one.  Bristol is a friendly city and I guess country music justs makes you that way.  Young talent is discovered each year and established singers always want to come back!

Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63460		/users/profile/69383	Instantreplaylp	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion was one of the most wonderful experiences my wife and I have ever shared.  We listened to incredible music for three days in a beautiful, friendly, charming environment.  We were introduced to music and performers who are now vital parts of our music life.   We enjoyed the ways in which the BRRR staff made the festival accessible and comfortable and freed us to just have fun.  I can assure you that we'll make our strongest effort to be sure we never miss  this outstanding event.  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63448		/users/profile/69371	Mark	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	This by far is the most authentic music experience in the United States today. This festival captures such a wide range of American roots music set in the epicenter of the music's origins. Bristol has to be experienced. The whole festival has been steeped by the city's rich musical heritage and that history continues to influence.
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63415		/users/profile/69334	Kate	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	I have had experience at this festival as both a performer and as an audience member, and I have attended since 2005. It has a family feel, with old and new friends meeting each other in the streets and venues of downtown Bristol and enjoying music from acts they've followed for years as well as new performers. The organizers do an excellent job of choosing local, regional, and national talent that attendees love, as well as giving up and coming artists a chance to be heard, which truly honors the spirit of Bristol as the Birthplace of Country Music. The festival introduced us to The Everybodyfields, Old Crow Medicine Show, Sarah Jarosz, and the Carolina Chocolate Drops--Grammy-caliber artists whose performances we saw close to home and inexpensively, something the festival made possible for many people who would not have the opportunity otherwise. 
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63388		/users/profile/69304	treash30	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	Bristol Rhythm and Roots is one of the few remaining festivals on the circuit that has continued to grow, yet remain true to the roots of what the event was founded on. The diversity of musicprovided by the festival serves up a product that music fans of all types can feast on. BRR has the unique ability to find artists right before their popularity skyrockets, thus allowing fans a sneak peak to the next generation of big bands to come (i.e. The Avett Brothers, Old Crowe Medicine Show). To top it off, the price of a ticket is a steal. For under $50 you get 3 days of music in a beautiful part of the world. There's nothing like watching State Street in downtown Bristol fill with music as fans do their best to chase it down. Warning: Bristol Rhythm and Roots can and will be addictive!
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63366		/users/profile/69281	Chef Dave	Client Served	5	02/04/2011	Bristo Rhythm & Roots Reunion is a staple on my calendar each year.  I began attending BRRR four years ago and am now bringing a group of over twenty people to the festival.  As a volunteer dj at the Guilford College radio station, WQFS, BRRR offers me the chance to hear and interact with a tremendous number of artists.  The mix of talent and venues is unique.  The staff and volunteers are always courteous and helpful.  The only negative that I can think of is that there is too much great entertainment to see all of the acts that I would like to see.  However, with the scheduling of multiple sets by many artists it is easier to catch more performances if you do your homework.  We at WQFS promote BRRR and have have a large number of listeners and friends who have also made it a regular event on their calendars.  
Bristol Rhythm And Roots Reunion	63358		/users/profile/69272	jksnyder1187	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	My experience with Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion has never been short of amazing. Being a college student, this organization has given me the ability to enjoy a musical experience on a yearly basis that is second to none. The Rhythm and Roots Reunion is so much fun and without this organizations efforts the festival would be nonexistent. So thank you Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion for providing a continually improving musical experience year after year!

I could not believe that there would be  homeless goldens anywhere.  I liked the  concept of nurturing these dogs until they found a home that suited them. After this I was smitten by the idea and  impressed with so many people who wanted to work with the rescue group. Have been honored and proud to have been able to work with this wonderful group. Thank You Pauline and all the MANY helpers through all the years.  You are awesome, Pauline! 
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	227321	2	/users/profile/291050	Jan_56	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	Have been a volunteer with this amazing group for 10 years. Have fostered, adopted and been to several events This is absolutely one of the most responsible and caring rescue groups ANYWHERE! The adoption committee is set on seeing the dog get a home that is a good match for the family and the family for the dog. Until adoption, dogs are well cared for, heathy and most have had some basic training. If there are medical or behavior issues, the prospective adopters are made aware of this PRIOR to adoption. A group I have been proud to be a part of and proud to recommend.

The  volunteers, the professionals, the dogs, and especially Pauline Stevens who do the hours and hours of work that needs to get done so people like myself can come home at the end of the day to a wonderful rescue dog. Pauline matches people and dogs so beautifully you can't go wrong. This June we came home to VT. with our third rescue dog. Why did we drive over 2 days to get a dog? Because we would get the best dog for us and to see a good friend again, Pauline.

Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	54696		/users/profile/56444	Lynn D.	Volunteer	5	10/12/2010	I adopted my first Golden through Heartland approximately 8 years ago and I have adopted 3 additional Goldens since.  It was because of my great respect for the work they do with such a small group of volunteers  that I decided to get more involved and became a volunteer.  Although I am many states away from its home base, I do what I can, assisting with fundraisers, making Heartland and its mission known to co-workers and others here in my home state, making phone calls and even assisted with a transport of a golden to his new home.   Heartland takes its work very seriously, trying to ensure that each dog is placed in the proper home and always has the dog's best interest in mind.  Although many times they don't know where the next dollar will come from to continue their work, they always seem to make it work.  As they say, "it's a balancing act to make room for one more"...but they always do.  I applaud Heartland, from the viewpoint first of an interested party, adopter four times over, and now volunteer.
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	306397		/users/profile/397656	rbrady01	Client Served	5	09/24/2016	We have adopted four absolutely wonderful Golden Retrievers from HGRR. They are a very caring and loving group of folks who work very hard down in TN to place Goldens in their forever home. They are amazingly good at finding the "right fit" for the dog and the new forever home. They work endlessly trying to have activities to earn money to care for the medical needs and care of their Goldens until they can find good homes. Everyone of the four dogs we adopted unseen. (they fit in perfectly with our multi dog household) They were driven up from the south via a tag team who drove them in private vehicles so the dogs weren't put in a crate on a huge truck and brought up here. That, indeed, would be traumatic for the dogs who are already feeling homeless and unloved. We encourage everyone to support HGRR however you can they are struggling to survive in this world and we sure hope they do survive as they so deserve to have help continuing their wonderful mission of serving homeless Goldens. Coby and Rich Brady, East Hampton, CT

She was my first experience going through a rescue and I was very impressed with how carefully they vetted me to be sure Katie was coming to a good home.  The information given to me about Katie was accurate and as they learned more, that too, was given to me even though I would have had a chance to say No to adopting a golden with seizures.  I had seen her picture and instantly knew she was mine forever, seizures and all.Heartland arranged for Katie to come to me in New Hampshire all the way from Knoxville, TN!!  Pauline was helpful even after the adoption to help with further information on Katie's medical issues.   I am grateful that she was the person who was able to rescue Katie and I cannot praise highly enough the wonderful Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue that gave Katie and me the chance to be together.

She is the love of our life and we couldn't be more pleased.  One of the important things that Heartland does before allowing a dog to be adopted is to carefully screen the dogs for medical and behavioral issues.  That way you know if your adopted dog will be okay with cats, other dogs, children, etc., if they have any ongoing medical needs or may need obedience training.   Being on Heartland's primary (Tennessee) and New England email distribution lists, we are always impressed with the lengths they will go to get a dog picked up or delivered, and get a new dog the medical help they may need.   The fact that there are so many wonderful, dedicated volunteers in this organization is testimony to the sincere, caring, and tireless work they do.

Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	72251	1	/users/profile/78997	Oakwoode	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/21/2011	Heartland GRR is a wonderful rescue organization dedicated to saving and re-homing Golden Retrievers in Tennessee.

They work very hard to find responsible, loving homes for Goldens in need, often taking Goldens who have health problems and are "not perfect".  
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	69917	1	/users/profile/76421	rvinson307	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	I have adopted three Golden Retrievers from Heartland over the past 15 years.  They are a wonderful dog-loving organization made up solely of volunteers.  They primarily work on a shoestring budget as they have no large corporate sponsors.  Their funding comes from donations and fundraisers like garage sales, etc.  What I really like about Heartland is that they have a "heart" for the old dogs.  They will often take an older Golden or one that is very sick and rehabilitate it and find it a home.  Many rescues just turn "their head the other way" and won't deal with "the old, the tired,  the blind, etc."  Heartland finds homes for many of these dogs.  We personally adopted a blind dog who was 10 years old from Heartland.  He was a wonderful dog and lived very happily until he was almost 14 years old.

We were amazed such a small rescue group with very limited resources could do so much with so little.  It was very obvious their mission was truly "all about the dogs" and NOT the peripherals that tend to feed egos or self-righteousness.  I can't imagine the heartache of having to walk away from a dog in need because resources are not available. This rescue is one of the few that will take in older dogs and dogs with less desireable attributes.  They have chosen their niche to be one less traveled and perhaps harder to accomplish.

I have rehabilitated many that were unfortunetly abused and/or neglected.  Pauline had told me about a male dog, Hunter who had been wearing an e-collar most of his life.  He had a horrible case of mange.  I spoke with Dr. Brad on several occasions about Hunters care.  Dr Brad was so supportive!  He always had time to talk to me about Hunters care.   Hunter was so used to living with an e-collar I didn't know how he would react when I removed it.  Thankfully Hunter was happy to have it off.  I continued his mange treatment and he grew all of his hair back and was so gorgeous.The plan was to adopt him out.  Well after having him for a year of so and knowing that he was very happy here we decided that I would just keep him,.He had his morning routine of walking his usual path around the farm.Hunter was a pleasure to share my life with and I thank Heartland for the opportunity to help him.

HEARTLAND FINDS THE RIGHT MATCH OF DOGS AND FAMILIES AND SEEMS TO TRULY WORK HARD AT MAKING PLACEMENTS WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE, ALWAYS WITH THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE DOG BEING THE PRIMARY CONCERN.  IN A WORLD WHERE SO MANY SEEM TO ONLY WANT TO "CHALK UP THE NUMBERS", HEARTLAND DOES WHAT IS BEST FOR THE DOGS AND FOR THE FAMILIES SEEKING THEM.
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	69395		/users/profile/75831	swsteps	Donor	5	02/16/2011	I am a donor as well as a parent of one of the great golden retrievers  that Heartland works so hard to rescue and place in loving homes.  We adopted Logan a few years ago after one of our golden retrievers died of cancer.   I was very impressed with the very thorough home visit and adoption process but the process was still very smooth and stress free.  I have also been involved in picking up goldens in my area and transporting them to a half way point for Heartland to pick up so they can begin the evaluation and placement of the dog.  I recognize the dedication and true love this organization has for animals and I am excited to help whenever I am called upon.

I think Pauline and those that help her do a fabulous job helping Golden Retrievers in need.  We have adopted 2 goldens from Heartland over the past 4-1/2 years.  The first girl came from an abusive, neglectful home.  She will be 13 years old this year.  She acts like a puppy now - so full of love and devotion.  She loves to play and go for walks and snowshoeing with me.  After my surgery 3 weeks ago, she stuck closely to my side.  We lost the second one to cancer only 4 weeks ago.  She was 9-1/2.  She was the sweetest, most playful and beautiful dog in the world.  Though our hearts broke, we would do it all over again just to be with her.  I would never hesitate to adopt or donate to this rescue.  Pauline does a fabulous job that takes an incredible amount of work.  She rescues dogs that others would not.
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	66458		/users/profile/72640	johnab666	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2011	I am an attorney in private practice, and I represent several nonprofit charitable corporations involved in companion animal rescue and humane activities, including several bree-specific rescue groups, a county Humane Society, and a statwide S.P.C.A..  I am also a long-time volunteer in several non-attorney capacities for several rescue groups, and have adopted and fostered numerous companion animals.  Many of these groups have fine standards and practices, but in all of that experience, I have not found a finer or higher quality group than Heartland. I have adopted a lot of Goldens, but I would not adopt from anyone else.
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	66441		/users/profile/72624	mattie	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	I first became aware of Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue about 10 years ago through mutual friends involved in rescue.  I was so fortunate to adopt through them  about 7 years ago, and have a beautiful Southern Belle who I call Sandy, aka Heartland's Tracking Sand.  Since adopting Sandy, I have fostered about five times, and currently have a nine-year old named Rocket whom we're hoping will get placed into a much-deserved forever home.  Sandy was easy to place; she was a healthy seven-month old puppy when she came into the Heartland program.  But where Heartland shines is the in-take and placement of the more/most difficult to place cases -- those that other rescues shy away from.  Run totally with volunteers and with limited funds, Heartland does an outstanding job saving and placing the wonderful breed we love so much -- golden retrievers.
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	66147		/users/profile/72309	kgroomer	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	I adopted two dogs from Heartland eventhough I run the Montana's Precious Gold, Golden Retriever Rescue.  This came about because we were living in the New England area for a few years.   Getting Miss Shelley and Higgins was an easy process for us  since Pauline and I are friends through rescue and running a program also, I knew all the rules and regulations.   Like our rescue, Heartland is "all about the dogs"  and that is what is stressed.  I had tried other groups and many I did not get an answer back or the dogs listed were not available anymore.   That is when I tried Heartland and we ended up both times meeting a volunteer and bringing not only our adopted dogs up to the NE area but also four other dogs each time.Thanks Pauline for my stubborn old gal Miss Shelley (now at the bridge) and Professor Higgins who is now loving Montana.

I had just put down an Australian Catlle dog 3 months prior as she was very old and failing.  It was suggested that we get a Golden.  Melba has been one of the sweetest  dogs I have ever owned.  I love her to death.  She is sweet, dedicated, and as of recently, we are seeing that she can also be a watch dog.  She is great with my girls, especially my youngest who can be rough with her.  She takes everything with ease.  If I could get another one like her today, I would take it in a heartbeat.  I now LOVE Goldens!  Pauline, Suzy, Jan and Susanne all should be commended on the work that they do ..... it's wonderful!  I'm sure there are many others that I have not had the pleasure of dealing with, however, when I am looking for another dog, I will definitely go back!!
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	66088		/users/profile/72248	Shauna	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	After wanting a dog for my entire life I finally convinced my husband to let us get one.  A friend suggested breed specific rescue as a great avenue to get a dog.  My husband suggested Golden Retreivers but at first I didn't want a 'white bread' dog that everyone had, boy was I wrong!  Enter Heartland Golden Retreiver Rescue and Jada, my first dog and our first Golden.  Pauline, the founder of Heartland, and the volunteers did such a wonderful job matching Jada to our family that we subsequently agreed to foster a senior Golden, Missy.  Missy wasn't with us for long before we decided to keep her, we failed as fosters (a common story with Heartland)!  Hhaving Jada and MIssy join our family was such a wonderful experience that I decided to volunteer with Heartland in order to help other families find such joy with a Golden as we have.  Through conducting home visits for prospective adopters and transporting dogs to their family after they have been matched I have such fun helping the Goldens who really are actually helping the humans more than they know!
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	66030		/users/profile/72180	Angel	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	We adopted our first senior golden from HGRR many years ago.  Lizzie was the best girl to walk through our doors in a long time.  She came in and smiled at us as only she could.  Pauline was the best person to work with.  She found us the perfect dog for our family.  Unfortunately Lizzie only graced us with her presence for a short time, but she was loved and safe for the time she did spend with us.  The next year we traveled to TN and picked up Sage, what a goof ball!  Again Pauline picked the very best dog to fit in with our menagerie of critters.  A male ALPHA dog, an Australian shepard  and a bunch of cats were all there to welcome Sage home.  She fit in perfectly.  After we adopted Lizzie we became volunteers with Heartland and help in every way possible.  We love all that Pauline does for these dogs.  She finds forever homes for dogs that would otherwise be PTS.  Regardless of age, disability, Pauline will find them a home.  Thank You Pauline for everything you do for these loving fur butts!

Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue is one of the few rescues that is willing to take on these very special dogs who need only to find a home to make what ever time they have left in life full of love and kindness. From our very first girl that was sexually abused by her owner and never played a day in her life to our last one we just picked up the ashes of today whose owners couldn't be bothered paying for surgery to save him as they were leaving on vacation, Heartland has always been there for these dogs. Under Paulines leadership Heartland GR Rescue has saved so many dogs that otherwise would have fallen thru the cracks. We can't thank them enough for bringing these special dogs into our lives. Heartland is a first class rescue organization.

Fortunately for Golden's in NY, there weren't any waiting for adoption. I scoured the internet every day looking at Golden's waiting for homes. There were hundreds ogf Golden's in eastern US Rescue Org's waiting  for forever homes. Many Golden Rescue Org's would not place their Golden's outside a specific geography. I treidn my best to negotiate wiht a few of them. They woud not budge from their strict placement policy. I was heartbroken. Then I found HGRR!!! They would place a Golden in W NY! HGRR obtained my background information from the Rescue Org's I had appllied to and the wheels of motion began turning. My new baby Betsy, was named by HGRR after her foster mom. She is a Southern Belle from TN and with no suprose LOVES the NY snow!!! She has completed Level I & II Dog Obedience and will work on obtaining her Good Canine Certificate in the spring. Betsy is  a dream come true in my life!  Her name is beffitting: Diminutive of Elisabeth or Elizabeth, from Elisheba, meaning either God's completion, or God is satisfaction. Betsy is not the only HGRR Golden living in my area. I was contacted shortly after her placement by someone who also has a Golden from HGRR!! A doggie play date is in our future. Lives changed forever; fur & furless. No words can express the gratitud.

Sully helped to fill the biggest hole in our hearts and continues to be the Lassie to the rest of his four legged family members. I feel, all the joy he has brought into our lives would not have been posible without the diligence, conscious effort of this great Rescue organization.

I remember the day I visited a home with a 3 legged golden tied to a tree on a muddy hillside.  She had had a litter recently.  The pups were gone, but no one wanted her.......but Heartland did! Pauline found this girl a wonderful loving home she so deserved. I have been fortunate over the years to have known many goldens who received second chances through the relentless efforts of Heartland. Thank you Heartland for all you do for these gold dogs!

We are  a grass roots group with a small core group of volunteers and operate on a shoestring.  Formed in 1998, we are based in Knoxville TN but help homeless and displaced Goldens not only from Tennessee, but also  SW Virginia, SE Kentucky, NE Alabama relocate to permanent loving homes all over the country.   We have a great group of supporters in New England.  We do not have a revolving door policy and on intake all our dogs remain under vet care for at least 10 days and are fully evaluated not only for health problems but for temperament as well.  All our Goldens are spayed or neutered if necessary, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested and treated if positive; micro-chipped if not already chipped.
Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue	54759		/users/profile/56502	Coby H.	Volunteer	5	10/14/2010	My husband and I have adopted four Golden Retrievers from Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue. We have also adopted from other Golden Rescue groups so we can honestly say that we have found Heartland to be the very best Golden Rescue group to adopt from. They have matched us with perfect Goldens that fit into our family which includes right now five rescue Golden Retrievers. Pauline works so hard to find the right dog for the applicant. They provide private vehicle transport up to the Northeast by volunteers and often it's Pauline, the head of Heartland who drives up half the way to meet volunteers from the north. (most other rescue groups send their dogs up in a big truck or large van so they don't get the personalized care that the Heartland dogs get in private vehicles with dedicated volunteers. She is dedicated to her Goldens and  puts endless hours and energy into running her rescue. I suggest Heartland to all who ask me and we have Heartland magnets on our cars which draws a lot of attention and questions. We have also done volunteering for Heartland and recently did a home visit and highly recommended Heartland to them. I can't say enough about our high regard for Pauline and Heartland Golden Retriever Rescue.

Two years ago I adopted Mooney and the adoption was do quick my head was spinning.  PAWS is the only place I know when you begin the adoption process you pick the dog you want upfront.

PAWS New England	274362	6	/users/profile/363753	Writer	Client Served	1	12/14/2015	I adopted a dog last year through PAWS New England. I had detailed conversations with her foster mom, her trainer, and the adoption coordinator before bringing her home. When I did bring her home I was shocked to realize that the organization had definitely concealed an important piece of information on this dog that would be important to any adopter; that she was highly aggressive towards humans (which I had clearly stated to them when I was choosing a dog to adopt that I would not tolerate aggression). Looking back on all of the conversations I had, it seemed that the people working in this organization were very eager to get this dog out of their care. Unfortunately this caused an upsetting situation for both the dog and I. I ultimately decided that the dog had to be relinquished back to PAWS and when i contacted people in the organization they immediately put the blame on me. I reached out to the founder of the organization because it was so important to me that this dog find the right home but she was completely combative and unprofessional. Overall, this organization may mean well but their adoption efforts are disorganized and overall quite shady. You're better off going to your local shelter!

I fostered, and a couple dogs later decided I couldn't let one go, and adopted her. I can't foster anymore, so I help with other tasks that come up.  One thing I love about this rescue is you are told when fostering to be COMPLETELY honest when adopting your dog out, and to tell a prospective adopter the good, and the bad about the dog.

PAWS New England	263960	1	/users/profile/352665	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/14/2015	My husband and I are both "Client Served" and Volunteers with this great organization.  We have the utmost respect for other rescues but this is the one we have chosen to dedicate most of our time and energy with. Two of our fosters through PAWS came to us with  injuries of unknown origin and stayed permanently with us, becoming happy, active members of our pack of four. Both required costly surgeries and follow up care but PAW never considered not making it available to these two  little "mutts."  Another foster arrived at the TN shelter with her eye dangling out of her socket. She's living large with a loving New England family who adores her. Like so many rescues and non profits PAWS needs to spend a lot of time and energy raising money to pay for vetting and injuries. Ghandi said  the greatness of a nation and its moral progress could be judged by the way it treats its animals. Wouldn't it be nice if all our voiceless beings were treated with unfailing kindness and compassion and homeless animals (and humans of course!) become a thing of our past and not our future?

The folks who run it are kind, well organized, and care so much for every animal they rescue. I got one of my three dogs from PAWS seven years ago. When PAWS rescued him, the shelter said he was so sick and underweight that "he's not worth saving."  The amazing people at PAWS took him in anyway and after his health improved, PAWS adopted him out to me.  He is the most amazing animal!  He's been a therapy dog since 2009,  has "modeled" for the local humane society training brochure, helps give out Hallowen candy at our town's downtown kids party and even marches in the town's 4th of July parade (wearing an Uncle Sam hat, of course.). He has the happiest, most loving personality and I cannot imagine that this is a dog who wouldn't be here without the committed people at PAWS.

PAWS New England	263722		/users/profile/352430	Writer	Client Served	5	10/13/2015	We adopted our dog from PAWS in 2012, when she was about four months old. A few days before we expected to pick her up from transport, we received a call from our coordinator stating that our puppy, Juliette, had been diagnosed with both giardia (stomach bug causing diarrhea) and demodex mange at her last health check before travel. The coordinator said they would hold her until the giardia had cleared and she was okay to travel, which impressed me in and of itself; they already had our adoption fee and could have easily put a sick dog on the transport, claiming ignorance when she got sick along the way. They also gave us the option of either waiting until the mange had cleared (which could take months) or taking her with their support to treat it.  We of course opted to get our pup as soon as we could, and PAWS more than held up their end of the deal. They not only covered all the cost of all the mange treatments, they were in constant contact to track her progress, offer suggestions, and even recommended a specialist when the mange didn't clear up, the cost of which they also covered. Having heard tales from others who have adopted from other rescues and unknowingly ended up with dogs who have heartworm and other illnesses, I know that PAWS went above and beyond what is typical. They want the best for their dogs, and their adopters, and they go the extra mile to make sure it happens.
PAWS New England	263660		/users/profile/352367	Writer	Client Served	5	10/13/2015	I began my search for my partner in crime about a year after unexpectedly loosing my dad. I came accross paws through an adoptable pet website. I loved the rescue from the first interaction I had with one of their volunteers.  I originally put in for 2 pups that had already began the pre adoptive process. I could have easily moved on and continued with the large pet adoption site; however I decided to wait it out and hope that a purfect for me pup would become available through PAWS. Two months into the constant "adoptable  dog" page checking miss Gracie appeared. It was love at first sight and within a month she was running off the transportation truck into my arms wiggling like crazy. The volunteers with PAWS are hands down angels from above. Devotiong so much personal time even after their long days of work and children let alone furbabies. I have always recommend PAWS to family, friends, coworkers and even complete strangers when I hear them speak of wanting a dog. The unbelievable support PAWS gives to families of their adopted senior dogs has brought a tear to my eye on many occasions. Awesome job all!!!! I could not recommend PAWS enough.

PAWS New England	260680		/users/profile/349263	tclk170	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I adopted my puppy Archie from Paws New England in 2010.  He was located in Tennessee and they arranged for him to be transported to me.  It was a very smooth process to adopt from this organization.  The volunteers were  very friendly and informative.  I was able to speak to my dogs foster mom and get all the information I needed prior to adoption.  Before his transport my puppy has a very small health issue, he was treated at the veterinarians and Paws New England  immediately informed me regarding this issue.  I was very impressed how forthcoming they were.  It is now 2015 and I just began fostering for Paws New England and still I am impressed on how they really care and put the dogs best interest first.  Paws New England does a great job  saving as many dogs as they can.  With out this organization may dogs would not be saved, nor would not get the medical treatment and love they deserve and would perish.Thank you Paws New England for what you do!

PAWS New England	229667	2	/users/profile/293315	nandomayer	Client Served	2	10/29/2014	I adopted a dog from PAWS in April, and I love her to bits - but her temperament is VERY different from what was described. This was the second dog I had applied for through this rescue.  After going through an interview, and having all of my references checked, I was not chosen to adopt the first dog.  This was after some confusion where I was lead to believe that I was going to be able to adopt no problem (the foster arranged a time for me to come meet and pick-up the dog!).  This was very upsetting, but I figured they were just trying to do their best to arrange the very best home for the dog.    Several months later I applied for a different dog.  I spoke with the foster and the dog seemed to meet all of my criteria (good with all people and kids, great with dogs, would be ok living with a pet rabbit).  Again I went through the interview process, they contacted my references again, and this time I was approved to adopt.  PAWS does not allow you to meet the dog until you have been approved to adopt, and this dog was being fostered 4 hours from our home.  So we basically had to take her home with no idea what her temperament was really like.  But based on the fact that they didn't think the first dog was a good fit, I figured they were doing their best to make sure that this dog would fit perfectly into our home.   We quickly found out she was very different than what we had expected and prepared for. She is very skittish around new people, and extremely dog reactive.  She also has an insanely high prey drive - not conducive to living in harmony with a pet rabbit.  These are all behaviors that I noticed in the first week of her being at our home, so I would assume it is something the foster should have noticed.  I contacted the foster several weeks after having the dog at home to see if she had noticed any of these behaviors and how she dealt with them, and she just said that she didn't notice any of those things and that the dog just needs to settle into our home.  It has now been 6 months, and I have spent over $1000 on private training and special reactivity classes.  The dog trainer that we use has a lot of experience with reactive dogs and is now suggesting that the only way to calm her down would be to medicate.   I am just baffled on how they could have been so far off the mark with just general personality traits.  I partly blame myself for not insisting we meet the dog before bringing her home.  I guess I have learned my lesson!
PAWS New England	220099	4	/users/profile/283724	DMNelson	General Member of the Public	2	10/05/2014	The dog we wanted to adopt had tested heart worm positive.  We were told that she needed to have treatment before we could adopt, but since the vaccinations are over a period of a couple of weeks, maybe we could take her early and they'd provide transportation to the vet. They wanted to use a vet in Connecticut who was much less expensive - as in $300.00.  I called our vet (suburb of Boston) and his price for antibiotics, first vaccination, and follow up vaccination was nearly $1,500.00.  That set up red flags. Why/how could this vet do it correctly for a third the price. Plus our vet said after the treatment the dog had to be kept very quiet for three months - only on leash for bathroom breaks.  The concern is that exercise causes the heart to pound and any residual worms could pass to the lungs. PAWS said - "don't worry about that - I've had dogs treated and they're perfectly okay to run and play." More and final red flags.  I am questioning the proliferation of these animal rescue organizations and how or if they are regulated. There is a significant amount of money flowing in. Cutting costs for treatment should not be necessary.

The adoption coordinator let our adoption application drop for over a week after the phone interview before we had to scramble to get everything done for the puppy's arrival.  The woman who came to do the home visit was unfriendly and rather rude.  Then, after three weeks of being given the run-around, they called us and told us we had two hours to confirm that we wanted the dog!  Since we were in the hospital with our grandmother at the time, we missed this ridiculous deadline.  After all that work we had lost the puppy that we had started to think of as ours- very frustrating for me and disappointing for my children.
PAWS New England	159853	4	/users/profile/212035	kerryanne44	Client Served	2	06/06/2013	Although I believe their hearts are in the right place, there were a lot of problems with my adoption.  I love my dog more than anything and wouldn't trade her for the world, but she ended up having a very serious heart problem that easily could have been discovered before adopting her out, but was not.  Also, the day I brought her home she went into heat, even though she had supposedly been spayed.  Obviously not.  She was in heat for a month.  After that, the organization offered to have her spayed, but I would have had to bring her to a vet quite a distance away who worked at a dog track.  I was absolutely not going to do that, especially since I now knew that she had a very bad heart and would not get the care she needed.  So I spent a lot of money to have her spayed at Angell Memorial in Boston, and PAWS only refunded me what the dog track vet would have charged.  I also have spent a lot of money and worry on my dog's heart condition.  After initially being diagnosed, PAWS offered to take her back and put her in a permanent foster, but there was no way I was going to do that.   Oh, and she also had two tick-borne diseases that had to be treated, and mammary tumors that had to be removed.  This was immediately after I adopted her, so these conditions also should have been discovered and I should not have had to pay for them. I again want to say that I love my dog more than anything, and I do believe that the PAWS volunteers really care.  But my experience was very difficult, and I think there were things about my dog that should have been known and disclosed.  I still donate to PAWS, though, because I want to help the dogs and I believe they do too.

But I was especially amazed by how PAWS always puts the dog FIRST. It's not your looks, your money, your tantrums or your level of education what gets you accepted as a PAWS adoptive parent. It's your ability to put the dog first too, even if that means that you cannot adopt the dog that you want, or you have to return the dog because it is no longer working, or you cannot pick up the dog on the day you planned. The pups come first. Period.

He had been a very sickly puppy on death row when volunteers from PAWS pulled him from a high-kill shelter in TN.  Because he was so sick, the volunteer was told that he was "not worth saving".  Well, luckily for everyone, the folks at PAWS were persistent and saved Ozzie, even in his dire state -- he had distemper.  PAWS got him treated then had to wait a few weeks before putting him on petfinder.com, to make sure he was healthy enough to be adopted.  As soon as I saw him on petfinder.com, I knew he was the puppy for me.  I adopted him and he was the best puppy I've ever come across.  Now, a few years later, Ozzie is the happiest, healthiest, friendliest dog.  He's a certified therapy dog and we volunteer at a psychiatric facility several times a month where he brings residents as much happiness as he brings me.

PAWS New England	71155	9	/users/profile/77784	dawgs	Volunteer	1	02/18/2011	I was a Paws foster for a beautiful young dog who had some emotional problems.   Paws does a great job at rescuing many dogs from a high kill shelter in Tennessee.  There were many lovely people I dealt with during my first foster attempt.I do have some concerns, as I called up to foster and no one even came for a house visit. Moreover, the dog they gave me was aggressive towards my dog and, though she was lovely in so many ways, her aggressive actions towards my dog and my fiance' had caused us some anxieties.In the end, she went to live with a wonderful man and I'm thrilled to say that he was able to give her a great deal of training and one on one attention. This little dog is now actively involved in being a pet therapist.The problem that I have is this:  one of the founders of this organization wrote me a scathing letter.  She had asked me to take in a puppy after my first foster was adopted out. I told her that I couldn't do it straight away as I need to make a trip to Michigan to visit a dying aunt.  A number of e-mails were exchanged and, overall, she refused to see my point of view. It got nasty, she actually got downright cruel and intimated that I had made a big mountain out of a molehill with the first dog I had fostered. I actually had felt bad at the time.. Very bad. Now, I realize that this woman was way way way out of line.  My first foster had tremendous issues and, though she was a lovely dog, someone should have been there to help me more.  Moreover, if I was such a bad foster WHY THE HELL DID SHE WANT ME TO TAKE IN A PUPPY? Insane.  Truly crazy stuff.  I am still in touch with the man who adopted my first foster and have gone on to work on fostering others. There has been no problem.SO..I commend PAWS for rescuing dogs.  One of the heads, Kelly Parker, is quite wonderful. Another is ...well, let's just say she does not have the skills to deal with people and could be hurting this organization immensely. I just felt an obligation to write an honest review.  The majority of people involved at PAWS are great. But they have a very volatile head person who did not, at least in this case, treat a volunteer very fairly. This was my first time and she was brutal and unfeeling. Thank God I went on to work with other organizations. Please know, it is the dogs that matter and some  'dog people' are not very nice to other human beings.

This organization works tirelessly to rescue animals that are abused, or otherwise viable loving pets that have met unfortunate circumstance and would likely end up needlessly euthanized if not for PAWS efforts. Abandoned animals are at an all time high and fundraising for non profits like PAWS has been challenging in these economic times - but the lives of these animals are worth a donation, no matter how small. I would encourage anyone to read the success stories on the PAWS website and you will be in awe.
PAWS New England	70583		/users/profile/77153	virginia	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	Two years ago we adopted Count Chocula, a miniature poodle with a birth defect of an absent left hind paw.  He will be 5 y/o in April.  He is a wonderful dog, well trained and housebroken and crate trained from the first day of our adoption.  The missing paw doesn't slow him a bit and he even walks on the stump on the carpets and if he is "stalking" in the yard.  PAWS helped us with timing to our schedule.  As the saying goes "Don't shop, adopt"  and especially with PAWS New England
PAWS New England	70579		/users/profile/77148	drsushi	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	I have had the pleasure of dealing with Paws New England for the past 4+ years.  Since my first encounter with that organization, we have adopted 3 rescue dogs, the third will arrive next week.  Their charter of finding home for available rescue dogs is fantastic.  They have generated a process that works great, and interface with other pet organizations to optimize their efforts.  Their pet finding service is quite personal, and they continue to treat each client like a family member.  They provide a complete history and information packet on their adoptable animals, and also provide follow through after the adoption.  They always tell the truth about their animals and don't hold any punches; this is extremely valuable to minimize any "surprizes" at the client level. The service and personal; attention they provide is beyond description.  The only other organization I have dealt with in this category, on a national level, is Best Friends in Utah.  I would never go to any other place the rest of my life to adopt a dog; why mess with extreme success !!!
PAWS New England	70575		/users/profile/77144	tgal62	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	I work at John Gagnon's Pet Resort and through work came in contact with Paws NE.  Paws NE sends us dogs to work with that may have had a rough start. We help evaluate/socialize each dog, then we help Paws find homes for the dogs.  This organization is on top of all their dogs. They have excellent communication between potential adopters and the Pet Resort.  Anytime there has been any question about the dog regardless if it is medical issue or the status of progress we are making, they respond immediately.  They genuinely care about the dog, the dogs history and the potential home the dog may go to.  That said, they do care about family's that may have to give their dog up and the sadness that brings.  They want all potential adopters to get exactly the kind of dog that fits their lifestyle.  Because they are so wonderful, I have jumped in to fostering for them which has been a wonderful experience. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!
PAWS New England	70574		/users/profile/77142	juliemarsello	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	PAWS New England is such a great organization!  My husband and I were looking for a dog who needed a good home. We found "Chevy" on the website & immediatly fell in love with his Beagle features. I put in an application, and now, a year later, we couldn't be happier with the new 4-legged member of our family. What sets PAWS New England apart is their dedicated care to "Chevy" before he came into our arms. He was transported to CT from a high-kill shelter in Tennessee, and put into a foster home with "Aunt Marie". We still refer to her as "Aunt Marie" because she took such amazing care of "Chevy" (now "Captain). He was surrounded by love, toys, other playful dogs, and even his own sweater! Aunt Marie was a god-sent who spent her money and time taking impeccable care of a dog that she knew was transient (while having a couple of her own too).  We can't say enough good things about the services that PAWS New England provides. 
PAWS New England	70554		/users/profile/77123	Chrissymsurf	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	We adopted Keiko (formerly Hudson), a mixed breed, from PAWS of New England Oct of 2009.   He was from Tennesse and we live in Boston.  Normally the transportation would be on a truck with other dogs, but one of the great volunteers was coming up to New England already so she took Keiko with her with another adopted dog.  They were so helpful during the entire adoption process especially with him being so far away.   Great communication, lots of questions for the adopters which makes me feel good knowing they don't send dogs to just anyone.  The right fit has to be there.  PAWS is a great organization and we thank them so much for everything they do for these animals!! 
PAWS New England	70553		/users/profile/77122	lmmclean	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	Incredible service!  We literally wrote a five page Doggie Dissertation, describing exactly what we wanted in a new addition to the family and PAWS went out and found us exactly what we were hoping for.  This is an organization run by people who are clearly passionate about animals and passionate about the mission of PAWS.  I'm impressed with every interaction with this organization.  Thank you PAWS!
PAWS New England	70550		/users/profile/77119	Ashley M.	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	My husband and I adopted our dog from Paws a few years ago and he is the light of our lives.  We have since started fostering and have found the experience to be both rewarding and fulfilling.  The people who we work with are dedicated to saving dogs of all breeds, ages and backgrounds.  I personally feel that I have found a cause I was meant to be involved with and I owe everything to Paws New England for helping me find purpose in my life.  
PAWS New England	70549		/users/profile/77118	jsbusiek	Donor	5	02/18/2011	I love this animal rescue and all that they do for the dogs down in the south who are abandoned, abused or neglected. Every year they save hundreds of dogs from a life of abuse or from being put to sleep in the overcrowded shelters. These dogs get a second chance as they are transported to New England to be adopted.I believe in their unbelievable work and the tireless efforts of all of PAWS' volunteers. I wish I could donate so much more to help them continue their efforts.

You couldn't ask for better people to guide you; I can't wait to do something else to help with this awesome place! The work they are doing in Cambodia is life- changing. I'm so happy I got to witness that.
People For Care & Learning	226061		/users/profile/289809	Daryl M.	Donor	5	10/24/2014	Quite simply PFCL is changing lives.  Whether you are talking about their orphanages, city training centers, innovative farms, or housing projects, the chains of poverty and ignorance are being broken and men, women and children are being set free.  Don't take my word for it.  Go visit Phenom Penn or Siem Reap  with PFCL and see first hand what they are doing.  You will leave a part of your heart in Cambodia, and you will be forever changed!

I've been on a couple of trips and sponsor one of the children in one of their orphanages. I  have witnessed people from PCL who really want to make a difference in peoples lives. To train people for better jobs, to teach people how to farm and raise food for their families and for small business, and to raise children without families in a clean and loving atmosphere. They are really changing lives for the good.  
People For Care & Learning	117957		/users/profile/160427	Phillip T.	Donor	5	07/10/2012	What an amazing organization. My trip was life changing. The work that Dr. Fred and PCL is doing is changing southeast Asia. Thousands of people are blessed every day by this group. I've seen first hand the orphanages, schools, farms, cities that are touched by PCL. To look into someone's eyes and see their reaction to the understanding that they can go to school, raise food to feed thier family, and be self supporting is amazing. Please contibute and support this organization, it is a great investment. You will be blessed as you see others being blessed.

This is an excellent organization with excellent leadership. 
People For Care & Learning	119074		/users/profile/161903	thompsonnc	Volunteer	5	07/23/2012	PCL does an amazing job of educating and empowering people to provide a better way of life for themselves.  I am a donor and a volunteer and have seen that funds are spent wisely in their orphanages and in their organization.  The children are loved, cared for and provided for and that makes an incredible impact on the lives of those children.  I look forward to returning to Asia and volunteering again.

We trust People for Care and Learning and know that our money is used with integrity toward the education and physical needs of the child we sponsor. We also have sponsored 2 houses in the Build a City project. PCL has earned our trust by their commitment to  excellence and integrity. We are thankful to be able to be a part of the great things they are accomplishing in other parts of the world. My husband and son were able to travel to Cambodia in January and saw first hand the projects PCL is involved with while they were there. They were also able to meet the precious child we sponsor. It was such a blessing to see our prayers and small donations  making a huge impact in other people's lives. We are thankful for all the good work People for Care and Learning is accomplishing.

Southeast Asia has been the focus point with Cambodia as the initial starting point. I have been involved with PCL from its beginning. PCL has invested resources, prayers, and people to change the lives of Cambodians by assisting them with job opportunities, training, medical assistance, and better housing. The future looks bright as Cambodians discover and release their talents to make life better for one another.      Douglas LeRoy 
People For Care & Learning	224356		/users/profile/288111	Matthew43	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2014	PCL is changing lives in Cambodia.  The myriad of programs that are in place to provide food and shelter for orphans, educate children and adults, teach farming techniques to rural communities and provide housing for displaced families are remarkable.   The leadership of PCL employees inspires volunteers and continues to grow the PCL vision. 
People For Care & Learning	161118		/users/profile/213626	smroberts860	Donor	5	06/20/2013	I have sponsored orphans at People for Care & Learning's orphanages in Cambodia for three years.  Their work there is improving the lives of these young people to a degree few if any other organizations are accomplishing.  Their philosophy of not only offering support but teaching life and job skills is providing each child with a future and not just a roof over their head until they become an adult.  The fact that all of the support I provide goes directly to the children is important to me when so many charities today have huge administrative costs taken out of the sponsorship funds they receive. Their other programs from providing safe drinking water to households by giving water filters to their vision of building an entire city complete with all infrastructure to give the residents a quality of life many of them never would have thought possible demonstrates that they are truly dedicated to improving the lives of as many people as they can reach.  They do not seem limited by lack of ideas or lack of dedicated associates but only limited by funds.  I am happy I can help in a small way with their work.

People For Care & Learning	160162		/users/profile/212408	onthemove	Volunteer	5	06/10/2013	My husband and I had the opportunity to go to Cambodia with PCL and it was an experience that changed our lives. It will open your eyes! We visited the dump where families literally live and dig through roughage daily just trying to survive and PCL are creating housing provisions, we saw homes that they are  literally building for $1000 per family.  My husband and I acted as dental assistants to a dentist that was traveling with PCL where upon we provided care for orphans, children and adults and some had never been to a dentist before. We went to the river where poverty was unbelievable and handed out water purification systems provided by PCL and educated the families about water filtration and parasites, it was beautiful to drive away and to see all of the water filtration systems sitting in from of the homes that were in devastating condition or only planks of wood. This is one organization that is genuine to the core and are changing lives with every touch.

However, after having heard the vision of PCL and experienced the mission first hand in Phnom Penh, I have no reservations giving to or recommending PCL  to anyone. The donations made to PCL are truly impacting individual lives and transforming communities. PCL is efficient, effective, relevant, and organized. I know our donation is making a difference in the lives of children in Cambodia that truly need it

Whether it is in the lives of the children in the orphanages, the villagers around the Farm at Tacom, or the excitement of the people as they watch the Build- A-City project at Andong spring up around them, it is inspiring. My family will continue to support this wonderful ministry.

People For Care & Learning	152316		/users/profile/173859	wtgeorge	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	Returned to the U.S. from Cambodia last week more convinced than ever of the worth of this great organization. While we were there, the Cambodian government presented Distinguished Humanitarian Service medals to key players involved with the poverty-reduction program underway near Phomn Penh. The poverty cycle can be interrupted at several critical junctures---housing, health, water, jobs, education, food---and I was impressed to see that PCL is attacking on all these fronts. The newest development is an arrangement for a U.S. manufacturer to locate a plant near the village where PCL is building 1,500 homes, a school, market, clinic, community center, and park. Now that I'm back in town, I've learned that a group of students at the local university are engaged in a 50-hour effort they hope will raise a significant amount of money for People for Care and Learning. People know it's worth the investment ... me included!
People For Care & Learning	128667		/users/profile/173859	wtgeorge	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	People for Care and Learning is the real deal. This organization does more with a dollar than any group I know. From their audacious project in Cambodia of building a whole town for several thousand residents, including its total basic infrastructure, to the down-in-the-dirt task of developing a model gardening-farming operation to move people toward self-sustainability, they do it all  and with transparency and accountability. 
People For Care & Learning	129263		/users/profile/174633	Pam_26	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	In the latter part of last year, my daughter made a big decision to move to Cambodia to teach school.  The fear that gripped mine and her dad's heart can't really be described.  Then we met the folks from People for Care and Learning.  As we attended a cookout and heard stories of people who were serving with this organization in the states and Cambodia, we realized that she would not be alone.  We left for Cambodia in January of 2012 to get her established in her new home.  When we landed there, I was overwhelmed with the fear of being in a strange place and knowing that in 10 short days, I would have to leave her there.  On the first full day in Cambodia, I walked into Common Grounds, a coffee shop established by PCL.  It became my oasis!  The staff there adopted me and my daughter immediately.  Their compassion, attention, friendship, comforting words, great food let me know that God had definitely gone before us to assure a peaceful transition.  It was life-saving then and still provides comfort to us when we skype or facetime with our daughter or know that she is there getting a great meal.  There are so many other ways this organization has touched our lives.  PCL, thank you!

Those are the driving forces behind the effectiveness of what PCL does. They care for those they encounter by building homes or providing fresh water, and they provide learning experiences through such activities as language education and business training. Their ministry is a shining example to all benevolent agencies.

Their vision with the latest project "build a city" far exceeds my expectations of excellence. What surprises me most about this non-profit is the amount of programs they run on a daily basis at such a high standard. It's remarkable how many people's lives have been changed for the better!

They have gone above and beyond the call of service for those in need locally, and are currently building a city in Cambodia. Their mission is simple: to give the poor a working chance. They genuinely care about people, and it shows through the selfless acts that they perform. I have been fortunate enough to work with PCL and I am excited to see what they continue to do in the future!

I like that they work in cooperation with the Cambodian Govt. They provide good food, shelter, and education for the Khmer people as well as provide a children's home for those without a family. They have proven to be trustworthy and are giving us a better future with many learning opportunities. This NGO works very well with the Cambodian people.

People For Care & Learning	118158		/users/profile/160696	ilutz000	Volunteer	5	07/11/2012	People For Care and Learning is an excellent non-profit that is focused on giving people a better quality of life and chance to succeed. They believe in a long term, hand up rather than hand out strategy, that continues to be beneficial to the poor in Cambodia. PCL has a very impressive staff that are both dedicated and competent, and they work for long term sustainable solutions. As someone that has worked for and volunteered with multiple non profits, I have been very impressed with People For Care And Learning, and would strongly reccomend them to donors and volunteers that are interested in making a significant and long term impact in the lives of the poor.

People For Care & Learning	118150		/users/profile/160685	Matt28	Volunteer	5	07/11/2012	People for Care & Learning is successfully impacting lives in Cambodia through education, job training, and meeting the basic human needs of clean water, food, and shelter.  As a volunteer, PCL has shown they are focused on long term results in peoples' lives.  PCL is not interested in a simple fix, but is willing to look at a problem through different sets of eyes and develop an action plan to solve the real problems behind poverty.  PCL builds leaders in Cambodia, and will continue to produce well educated and trained Cambodians to lead their country into the future.  
People For Care & Learning	118105		/users/profile/160631	Tammy21	General Member of the Public	5	07/11/2012	I had the opportunity to see the work that People for Care and Learning does in Cambodia. They are providing clean water for the people of Tonle Sap Lake, They provide a home for children that wouldn't otherwise have one. They are meeting needs while educating those living in poverty and they do a great job at what they do.
People For Care & Learning	118055		/users/profile/160566	dthompson	Volunteer	5	07/10/2012	People for Care and Learning (PCL) is one of the finest non profit organizations meeting the needs of the poor.  PCL does this work with heart, passion, compassion, and excellence.  I traveled with them and witnessed the work first hand visiting the orphanage, Common Grounds Coffee Shop, educational facility, housing developments, and the incredible work on the Tonle Sap Lake.  PCL is true to its mission meeting the needs of the poor while encouraging them and empowering the poor toward a working chance.  Each person is recognized for their value and treated with dignity.  I applaud PCL for meeting the basic needs of the Cambodian people by caring for the orphans, feeding the hungry, providing housing for the homeless, and educating to the unlearned.
People For Care & Learning	117973		/users/profile/160453	kbunch	General Member of the Public	5	07/10/2012	People for Care and Learning is an amazing not for profit with vision for their neighborhood, as well as, neighborhoods around the world.  As we have seen them work to build a play ground in our hometown or a city in Camodia, our family has had the opportunity to see them gather and inspire people of all ages and abilities share their time, experiences, and talents.  Our boys have helped on a local level and our friends, across the world, everything we have seen them do has been with excellence, integrity,true stewardship,and passion for others.  
People For Care & Learning	117972		/users/profile/160450	ldemps00	Volunteer	5	07/10/2012	People for Care and Learning is an incredible organization that encompasses a vast number of projects. PCL is the most well-rounded humanitarian organization that I have seen. They are truly doing great things and are changing many lives while they do so. PCL uses the necessary assets from the Western world, while maintaining the Cambodian culture and way of life. Their coffee shop, Common Grounds has proved itself to be a great business and is making visitors from around the world aware of what they are doing. PCL is made up of staff members who unconditionally love the people of Cambodia. I have great respect for PCL and its staff. 
People For Care & Learning	117958		/users/profile/160429	Sarah68	Donor	5	07/10/2012	I love and respect People for Care and learning because they are caring, creative and logical in the way  they run their ministry.  In the children's homes they support and provide for children and widows.  The children are given a home for as long as needed,  even through college.  The widows are given a job, a place to live and an opportunity to learn to provide for themselves.  When they have  a way to support themselves, they can move on.  Then other widows can help at the children's homes.  People for Care and Learning are caring for widows and orphans just as God's Word expects.  This creative, caring and logical way of meeting the needs of others is also used in their other ministries.  I am so blessed to see what this ministry does daily in the lives of those who need them.
People For Care & Learning	117956		/users/profile/160423	Bill28	Board Member	5	07/10/2012	I am always amazed at how much People for Care and Learning is impacting SE Asia with the limited resources that they have. I believe the reason for this is that the workers and their many volunteers are so dedicated and talented and conduct themselves with the upmost integrity. The people of Cambodia and other countries in the region are being impacted every day is a positive and uplifting way because of all the efforts of PCL!
People For Care & Learning	117946		/users/profile/160409	fredtoke	Board Member	5	07/09/2012	I have been to many countries with many humanitarian organizations but i never had one that is as well organized as People for Care & Learning. I am impressed in the ways they managed the activities on the ground and also how motivated the staff were. My 2 thumbs up!
People For Care & Learning	117908		/users/profile/160351	Teddie B.	Volunteer	5	07/09/2012	I traveled to Cambodia during the early days of People for Care and Learning and have been amazed at what they have been able to accomplish in such a short few years. PCL is working with the people and helping to provide clean water, education, and hope for a better life. I've watched a lot of non-profits work, but I have never seen an organization that gets so much done with the resources they are given. They are trustworthy. Also they work in conjunction with the local authorities and government. This is not an ordinary non-profit! PCL is getting the job done! I wholeheartedly recommend this organization! 
People For Care & Learning	117899		/users/profile/160335	Taylor J.	Volunteer	5	07/09/2012	I traveled to Southeast Asia with People for Care & Learning in October of 2011 - I was absolutely blown away by the wholeness and integrity of their operations. Seeing first-hand their work with education, breaking the poverty cycle, caring for and training orphans and widows, and sustainable development projects, I was challenged by their team who works tirelessly to improve the lives of all Cambodians. I would DEFINITELY volunteer for them, and have contributed to their efforts consistently after my visit.
People For Care & Learning	117890		/users/profile/160323	Mike1956	Donor	5	07/08/2012	I have donated to several non profit organizations in the past and the thing that always concerned me was how much of the organization's income went to administration expenses rather than the need it was raising funds for. People for Care and Learning first caught my attention because all donations went directly to the need rather than administration.  I have been on several trips to Cambodia with this group and am blown away at the impact they are having there helping the poor.  I am convinced that no other non profit organization gets more results from their donations.  I always recommend them to anybody wanting to make a difference by helping the poor.

I currently retired and had a job lined up that ended up just being an internship that is non-paying.  With no income coming in yet from me and only my wives income we hit a wall real fast.  OSC has helped relieve some stress with helping us out with are rent.  They have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help us out as well as everyone else they help.  Please help get them noticed so they can keep providing support.

She recommended that I read Nancy Alcorns book "Echoes of Mercy".  So I read it & thought about applying. I ended up applying like in February or March & got accepted to go in on April 16th. This program is a great program for all the girls who are struggling. I got saved while in the program, now I'm doing good. I have had my struggles & achievements. Ups & downs. But I know God has helped me through it all. This program is amazingly helpful to those who need Gods's comfort, peace, & the freedom to live a captive free life. I definitely recomend it! 
Mercy Multiplied	300424		/users/profile/391273	caristianos	Client Served	5	08/13/2016	From the minute I walked through the doors of Mercy, I felt Love and Acceptance from strangers that I hadnt even bought or earned. I still struggled to believe I had a need legitimate enough to get help from Mercy. Honestly, my pride was so strong that I felt like I could handle being a staff member. Day after day, minute after minute, staff had to correct me. At first, I felt angry and mistreated. But eventually, I came to realize that I had more problems than just an eating disorder; I had serious issues with legalism, control and pride.Throughout the counseling model, I couldnt understand how the LORD could be pleased with me not doing anything for HIS Kingdom. In the beginning of counseling, I remember Meredith asking me to stop and take time resting with the LORD and listening to His voice. I had no idea what that even meant and thought of it as a waste of time. But gradually I came to realize the incredible power behind being in the LORDs presence. In choosing to forgive, I found how He desires for me to give up my right for getting repayment for the areas where I was wronged and leave that in His hands. The most significant shift in my thinking began as I identified lies I believed for so long about my identity and worth. I am still learning about the significance and depth of Gods grace. Crystal worked with me to create truth statements that I daily use to renew my mind. Now I can begin to see life from a new perspective according to what God sees, not the false ways I interpreted God from experiences at church or Bible. Instead of minimizing my emotions, Im learning to be aware of them and continue to bring hurts to Him for His healing touch. The LORD is teaching  me how to share emotions and connect in a healthy way with others. The enemy has so deceptively twisted the Truth. Through the past experiences of my family in the occult, I learned how he even twists belonging to the family of God, taking communion, and signing the book of Life. The blood of Jesus has become an even more significant, life-changing atonement for evil in my life. Because I have authority in the name of Jesus, I can be free from the enslavement to sin that has held me down. As Mercy helped me trace habits of sin in past generations, I became more aware of areas that need to be monitored in my own life to break them off and keep them from being passed to the next generation. After Mercy, I plan to move back to Hot Springs, Arkansas and attend Christian Ministries Church. At first, I hope to work as a teachers aide or daycare worker. Jane Hamon said in my prophecy, you would have been doing the right things for all the wrong reasons and it would have really undermined your ability to do it for the long run and the LORD says, daughter, Im wiring you now for the long run. She also said, The LORD says, Ive begun to fill your mind now and fill your heart with dreams of influence and dreams of being able to help others and having an ability to be able to carry out whats happened with you into other peoples lives My prayer is that these things continue to take place and the LORD will use me just as He said He would. From the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you for allowing me to experience the presence of God day in and day out in such an intimate, personal way. My life will never be the same! Mercy has helped my family break generational patterns so that they stop with me! I have a new perspective on who my Savior is and what His intentions are for my life.  By staying in the program, I have gotten to truly experience life in the Kingdom that Jesus died to bring to me.
Mercy Multiplied	299784	1	/users/profile/390604	Sophia14	Volunteer	5	08/08/2016	I came to Mercy for an internship at the corporate office in Nashville, and I loved it! I spent most of my time with the corporate staff, but I also got the opportunity to hang out with the residents in the home. To me, this was the most rewarding time! When I walked in the doors of Mercy for the first time, I saw God's presence everywhere I went. I have never experienced a group of people so committed to following the Word of God. This is Kingdom work!
Mercy Multiplied	299604		/users/profile/390526	ltdean4	Client Served	5	08/08/2016	I was desperate for help, and turned to Mercy Multiplied because I couldn't afford any additional treatment and it was free of charge. Little did I know that this place would be what would help to change my life for the better. I learned things that I could apply to my life outside of Mercy that I was unable to find throughout my 5+ years of treatment in other treatment centers. It was scary going to a place I knew little about and was also away from my hometown, but I wouldn't change my experience for anything.  There was so much support and everyone was so helpful throughout my journey of finding myself and a desire/want to live again.  Can't thank this place and everyone's support enough!
Mercy Multiplied	298889		/users/profile/389774	krygoo	Client Served	5	08/02/2016	I don't even know where to start... I found Mercy by searching for affordable treatment options because I didn't know what else to do. I thought I was crazy for applying to some random program I found online. For all I knew it could have been a scam, but it was a risk I had to take. After all, I didn't have anything to lose, so I gave it a shot. I entered the program in March of 2015. I was broken and hopeless. I had severe ptsd and hatred towards myself. During the program, I received unconditional love from the staff. I immediately felt like God had put me in the right place. I learned that God loves me and that he wants me to love myself. I spent a year at Mercy Multiplied and worked through some of my hardest traumas. I broke the covenant I had made with death and gained the ability to walk in freedom no matter what was going on in my life. Life isn't perfect and I still face issues related to PTSD, but now I know that God is greater than the trauma I experienced and I am not the result of what happened. I am a child of God. I can honestly say that I probably would not be here now if I had not gone to Mercy! I have no way to thanks the people who made my transformation possible.

Mercy Multiplied	298835		/users/profile/389723	courtney_garner_benjamin	Client Served	5	08/01/2016	I went into Mercy Multiplied having experenced one of the most tragic acquisitions. I was robbed. I had experenced identity theft. Not financially, but emotionally and spiritually. I felt like I had lost everything. I was left with no hope, no joy, no self-control, and I lacked the ability to love and be loved. Satan robbed me, locked me up, and the only thing he fed me was lies. I was held captive for years, starving for truth, and everytime I tried to escape I had no sense of direction. I was out of options. Mercy Multiplied, though. They re-connected me with the One I thought would never want anything to do with me. His name, His sweet name, is Jesus. The first thing Jesus did was make sure that I knew that He still loved me. Deeply, too. After everything I had done, He still loved me deeply. I suffered with self-harm and anorexia for a long time. I bowed down to the lies for a long time. I felt helpless and I was shameful. But I spent a lot of time with Jesus while I was at Mercy Multiplied, and He became my best friend. Now, I am walking in freedom, I am married to the man of my dreams, and I am falling more and more in love with Jesus every single day. I strongly feel like in order to walk in the freedom Christ offers, you have to go through a (3 seasons) process:1.) The first season is realizing that you aren't free, and that was a heartbreaking season for me. Building up the courage to drop your pride, and the bravery to seek help. Not as easy as it sounds.2.) The second season is the hardest though, which is choosing freedom. The enemy and the flesh scream loud, which sometimes make it really hard to choose what pleases Jesus. But, everytime you say no to sin, it gets a little easier the next time. It's like a muscle. It's a refining process. It's really uncomfortable sometimes. But the beauty in it is that God is molding your character and strenghening you to fight the good fight.3.) The third season is WALKING IN the FREEDOM you fought for. You've chose Jesus enough times now that it is molded into your character. It's who you are. You are a servant of Christ. A warrior. An overcomes. Not that it's always the easiest thing, but you know now that it is always possible. I'm in season number three. I'm waking in freedom. I would never change my decision to seek help and I cherish my experience at Mercy Multiplied. Mercy Multiplied is changing lives. It changed mine. 
Mercy Multiplied	298830	1	/users/profile/389718	Ali_16	Client Served	5	08/01/2016	I won't lie to you. This program is tough. But if you're truly ready to get freedom from your issues (everything from sex trafficking and eating disorders, to self-harm and other life-controlling issues), then Mercy Multiplied is for you. This program is a free-of-charge, Christ-based and one of the best out there. Prior to going to Mercy, my life was destroyed. Most of the destruction was self-imposed. I felt hopeless and beyond hope. I didn't care if I lived or died. Going through the program was hard. Facino your issues is hard. But the freedom is so worth it. I graduated in 2009, and my life is so better than it used to be. I have peace, hope, and a future. At this time, I am in Nursing school. This has been a dream since I was a little girl. I had stopped dreaming while I was struggling because I figured I'd never see my dreams come to pass. If you're looking for a program where you will be challenged, encouraged, loved and freed from your issues, this program is for you.

I am a 2013 graduate and when I walked through the doors of Mercy, I know its cliche, but I really didn't have any hope. I didn't believe God was good, and I was incapable of functioning in this life because of my struggles with PTSD, self-harm, and drug and alcohol abuse. At Mercy I didn't just find a religion, I found a relationship with God who is good. I also received tools that I use to this day to get me through the adversity and trials that continue to happen even on this side of Mercy.Mere words cannot express how giving and life changing Mercy is for those lucky enough to be a resident there. 
Mercy Multiplied	281192	3	/users/profile/371225	Writer	Client Served	5	02/29/2016	Mercy Ministries (now Mercy Multiplied) is an absolutely amazing place! I spent six months at the California home in 2013, due to a long battle with an eating disorder. It was here that I was shown the path to true freedom,  and I learned that it was a choice that I could make! God worked in my life in so many ways through Mercy, and showed me that HIS truth is what sets free the captive! The staff is absolutely amazing and the program is adjusted to your specific needs. I strongly recommend Mercy!!! It definetly equips you with the tools to overcome the struggles you are facing and walk out true freedom in your life, with the strength of Christ!  I know it is scary to take the step and apply, but I promise it is so worth it!!!
Mercy Multiplied	276319	4	/users/profile/366061	Writer	Client Served	5	01/12/2016	My life was completely transformed because of my time at Mercy Multiplied.  Prior to Mercy I spent years in and out of psychiatric hospitals, rehabs, and treatment centers.  Nothing brought me any lasting change.  Mercy was the only place that helped me get to the root of my issues instead of just addressing my behaviors.  Mercy provided me with a safe and loving home environment where I could really heal.  Since being at Mercy I've lived the last 6.5 years free from the pain of sexual & physical abuse, depression, suicidal ideation, anorexia, bulimia, cutting, alcohol & drug addiction.
Mercy Multiplied	274750	4	/users/profile/364223	Writer	Client Served	5	12/20/2015	God used Mercy Multplied to literally save my life. From the age of five I lived in fear because of sexual and verbal abuse, and by the age of eleven I became actively suicidal. I was depressed and anxious, and to cope with family dysfunction and extremely low self esteem and worth, I turned to anorexia and self harm. After deciding to become a Christian, I was surprised that my issues didn't just go away. I lived my adult years trying to be perfect and good enough in everyone's eyes. I hated who I thought I was, which pushed me further into suicide and depression, and I felt I needed to hide the depth of my darkness from other Christians, because if they saw how dead I was inside they would tell me I wasn't good enough. In the months before applying for Mercy, I did anything to numb the pain I was in- the eating disorder, pills, alcohol, and promiscuity. I had no hope and I was just waiting for the time when the suicide plan would actually work. When I applied for Mercy, I knew getting there was truly life or death for me. Being at Mercy was one of the hardest things I have ever done, and there were several times that I wanted to give up, but in my time there the staff loved me in ways I needed, as well as in ways I didn't understand we're loving at first. But the biggest thing in my time there is that God showed up in my life there. God can show up anywhere, but my life felt so overwhelmingly dark and hopeless, and not only did I need to come to the end of myself to see I needed God, that I couldn't be enough apart from Him, but He also had to bring me to a safe and loving environment where I could work through and let go of past hurts, and to believe that He really has life and an amazing future for me. I am so thankful for my 8 months at Mercy, my life is forever changed and I have a hope that cannot be taken from me. Hard days have come and gone since then, but I don't lose hope because my hope is not in my feelings or circumstances, my hope is in the powerful and loving God that not only saved my life, but gave me a desire to live and has made my life into something beautiful! If you are struggling with any life controlling issue and need help, God will show up for you at this place! I have seen so many lives transformed and saved because of Mercy, but the reason why I know God's power is all over this organization is because I have experienced it in my own life!
Mercy Multiplied	274066	3	/users/profile/363420	Writer	Client Served	5	12/09/2015	Mercy Multiplied changed my life forever. In 2009, I left my small town and traveled across the country in search of freedom from my struggles of having an eating disorder, self-harm, and addiction. Mercy met me where I was, and loved me unconditionally. In fact, I had a set back over Christmas break and I spoke daily with a staff member who was on her own break! They really showed me Christ's love, which eventually led to the best decision on my life, surrendering my life to Jesus. Was it easy and fun? Heck no! It was hard. I had to be ready to fight. I would not encourage anyone to go if they are not ready to fight and be quite uncomfortable. It hurt, but growth comes from trials. I am eternally grateful for Mercy Multiplied for being the vessel God used to lead me to my Savior. 
Mercy Multiplied	273627	5	/users/profile/362887	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	12/02/2015	I had a horrible experience at Mercy ministries. I was there for 8 months BC they kept giving me the run around abt graduating and eventually kicked me out 3 days before I was to graduate. The first counseling session I told the councler that the biggest thing for me was that I needed to get the help at Mercy but I know I'll need aftercare and to not go straight back into the environment Ieft. She promised they had an after care plan and help set everything up. Well since I got kicked out alllll my aftercare plans fell through and I was right back where I was to begin with literally no aftercare accountability. But did they care? Hell no! Onfact my councler ignored menafter onwas told inwas beimg kicked out for saying the F word. Mind you I did the entire program and was there 2 months longer then the average girl. And you want to know what the director, had to say? "I should've kicked you out a long time ago. I know you're going to be right back where you left off". I felt so much rejection there and didn't find !much healing. I felt like if your story wasn't traumatic enough for them to publicize, then you weren't important. I gained 25lbs while there BC they force you to eat large meals. They basically forced God down your throat. The weekend staff was a joke that so obviously hated their jobs and would go on power trips. My mom went into a coma and I wanted to call my dad and they said no.. Why? BC they can. They had no sympathy or compassion. I was so incredibility miserable and lonely while I was there. I guess it just wasn't the right place for me but it did get me sober and back on the right path. Shortly after being kicked out I moved to Texas to start over and I met my husband and we have a beautiful daughter :) I've been clean and living right for over 2 years now. Which is complete opposite of what the staff memebers said would happen.Everyones experience is different and its definitely helped a lot of ppl but if you aren't that damaged and have a strong will.. I suggest finding something less intense lol

They taught me how to choose Him over any other addiction or negative coping mechanism. Mercy showed me how to have an abundant life. Sure, it was tough work: physically, emotionally, and spiritually. However, it was worth it. Through Mercy, I gained endurance, strength, power of choice, and a voice I didn't know I had. Mercy is a vessel for God to show young women their true identity in Christ. They showed me how to make the choice to make Jesus the Lord of my life instead of my life controlling issues.
Mercy Multiplied	272607	2	/users/profile/361687	Christina117	Client Served	1	11/20/2015	There wasn't any love at Mercy Ministries, staff and the director were rude. I was kicked out within a month and a half. They were rude staff and qite frankly mean. I tried to call the treatment center and as soon as I would call the call would end within a minute of me talking to thwm. They don't care about the girls they serve at least I don't think so. I came home worse than I was. I became angry cuz of the way I was treated. I ended up locking myself in my room and for nearly two years I did that. I am barely getting my life back together. I don't reccomend this place and I don't feel it deserves any stars.

The counselors there I believe don't have adequate experience to work with people with eating disorders. I was overweight. I had to exercise while everyone was doing fun stuff. They don't have registered dietitians they took me off a prescribed meal plan from one. They tried to make my BMI my worth but thankfully after leaving Mercy God helped me to see past one belief system and see who he really was and that I was his child no matter what I looked like a person. They make it harder there for girls with eating disorders. If someone overweight it's even harder. It's not worth it to go to find out.
Mercy Multiplied	243493	5	/users/profile/330258	Tryingtofindsomewhere	General Member of the Public	3	05/24/2015	Hi,I am looking into treatment options. I researched this organization because I wanted reviews that would be honest, truthful and aid in my making a wise choice in choosing Mercy. However, I see conflicting reviews. Some people state that they had wonderful experiences and that Mercy was a great place while others give rather drastic accounts. Most of the reviews on here are from donors and not actual clients that are able to shed light on whether this is a sound organization. I will keep searching...I want to go to a place that will help me with issues and not make them worse/create new issues. I am also perplexed as to why there are not reviews in the 3-4 star range. It seems that people that have posted here have either hated the program or loved it so much that they cannot even fathom any idea of disliking any aspect: this is concerning because it shows that there is some discrepancy somewhere that needs to be figured out. Just my thoughts. If anyone would like to clarify things for me, that would be great.
Mercy Multiplied	228099	11	/users/profile/291800	AshRoberts	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	It was nine years ago, October 25th 2005, that I entered the doors of  Mercy Ministries.  I was scared, nervous, and desperate for help.  For years I had struggled with an eating disorder and depression, but I found myself near death one year into my marriage.  I was afraid that my husband would wake up one morning only to find that I had quit breathing.  I knew I needed help, but in all the years that I struggled hospitalization, medication, and therapy proved ineffective.  When  I was presented with the idea of Mercy I thought it sounded too good to be true, but I felt God nudging me to pursue the application.  I did and before I knew it I was leaving my husband and beginning my journey to recovery.  What I didn't realize, however, is that I would also be starting a new relationship, with God that is.  While I was at Mercy I not only received healing from an eating disorder, but I also discovered what it meant to have an intimate relationship with our amazing God.  The staff at Mercy prayed over me, guided me, supported me, and listened to me.  I was not merely a "patient," rather I was a sister in Christ.  I can't say enough about how wonderful Mercy Ministries is.  I will forever be grateful for all the that God has done, blessed me with and for guiding me to Mercy.  On an end note, when doctors told me I would not have children as a result of so many years of bodily harm, I rested on what I learned while I was Mercy.  That is, with God ALL things are possible!!!  I am so excited to share that as of today my husband and I have been blessed with two beautiful, healthy children.  Joshua is three and Faith will one this month.  God is good, all the time!!!  Thank you God, Mercy and Nancy Alcorn!!!

I was sexually abused as a child by all of the men in my life that were supposed to protect me. As a young teenager I started looking for love in guys and in attention. But I knew that I needed a change I just had no idea where to get it from. I came across Mercy through my social worker and I applied the next day. When I came to Mercy I was ready for a change and I was thankful for the program that was specialized just for young girls that were all looking for the same change. I made some of the greatest friends and became a stronger woman in Christ. I am thankful for the time that I had to spend there.
Mercy Multiplied	226226	6	/users/profile/289962	Jay_domain91	Donor	5	10/24/2014	Roughly 6 Years Ago, I Graduated From Mercy Ministries!  I Was Extremely Deceitful, I Had Built Up Anger Issues, I Was Very Insecure, Depressed, I Kept Myself Isolated From Everyone &  Engaged Myself In Unhealthy Relationships. I Turned To Drugs For Comfort And Was Just Living Life Like A Zombie, Without A Care In The World, I Was Okay With Just Being "Average".. To Some People, You May Think, Oh That's All? That's Life BUT When It Ruins You And Your Family All In One, It's A Big Deal, It's Time For An Intervention. My Parents Were So Feed Up That It Was Time For A Change. Not Because They Didn't Love Me But Because They Saw Something In Justice That She Didn't See In Herself!! 6 Years Later, She's Working 2 Jobs, Paying Her Owns Bills, Has Her Own Car, Single, No Kids, Very Secure In The Person She Is &  The Person She's Becoming. I'm Only Human, Not A Perfect Person, So Yes I Still Fight Many Battles &  I Do Still Have Weaknesses But At The End Of The Day My Only Mission Is To Become More Like God. Jeremiah 29:11,  I Know God Has A Plan And A Purpose For Me And I'll Do What It Takes To Get There! #MercyMinistries #TransformedLives #Love #Hope #LivesRestored

I went into mercy a scared little girl but came out a completely new person. Seeking freedom can be tough but the staff and other girls are so encouraging! If you welcoming for a place to seek healing and freedom, Mercy is an amazing place! I met my best friends there and I am now living a new person who is whole and happy and healed! I love Mercy and am beyond grateful to be a graduate of the program. 
Mercy Multiplied	225907	6	/users/profile/289657	hannahf	Client Served	5	10/23/2014	My name is Hannah, and I am the Founder/Editor in Chief of UnleashedBeautya Christian based fashion magazine. I am also a Mercy Ministries graduate. Going into the Mercy home, I struggled with an eating disorder, self-harm, depression, anxiety, and had been sexually and physically abused on multiple occasions. But I walked out of Mercys doors a completely different person: whole, free and like I was myself again. Since graduating from Mercy, I married an amazing man who not only supports me and my career but also Mercy Ministries. He is currently designing a Mercy app that will enable former residents to submit prayer requests to and receive encouragement from Mercy donors. At the end of the day, I am so thankful for Nancy Alcorn listening to Gods calling on her life, because God changed my life through Mercy. I want to give back as much as I can, because of them my life became a ripple effect helping others who had similar struggles as I faced. Thank you Mercy Ministries!  -Hannah

And now I'm not! The staff at Mercy spent countless hours pouring into me and speaking life over me.  While I  was at Mercy I learned who I am in Christ. That my name is His word for "delight." He showed me where He was during all of the painful times in my life, and during all of my time of running He was crying, "Come to me! " He showed me that those things weren't His will for me. God didn't make a mistake when He made me. He's not angry. He has such a happy heart. He ravished my heart with His love for me. Because of Mercy I am walking in complete freedom. My worst day now is a thousand times better than my best day before Mercy. Thank you!!!!!

The graduates I've met have such amazing stories of how their lives were turned around. Changed lives are hard to argue with. Also, from my observation, Mercy Ministries is a responsible steward of the support they raise, and they run their organization with excellence.

Nancy Alcorn has held steadfast to the vision of helping girls find life transformation.  The hundreds and hundreds of stories of "Mercy Girls" often bring me to tears.  I know without a shadow a doubt my financial gifts are going to make a difference and bring freedom to hurting girls.  I have met several girls directly impacted by the program, and have been able to rejoice in the freedom and transformation they have found.

Mercy Multiplied	151145	5	/users/profile/201689	brokenheartedfather	Client Served	1	03/15/2013	Mercy Ministries is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Its techniques and ideology are an affront to Christianity.  The ministry steals donors money by contriving results and even manufacturing "patients".  My daughter was the product of a loving home.  Against her parents' wishes she entered MM for "treatment".  They convinced her to renounce her family, cutting off all communication ties (for two years and counting).  She has likely been convinced that her parents' abused her through repressed memory techniques.  The pain to her family, including her many siblings, has been immense.  MM falsely advertises a desire to utilize family therapy, and convinces adolescent girls that their families are the problem, not the cure.  Vulnerable girls who have not been abused or victimized are convinced that they have been.  Donating to MM is donating to the devil.

I was spiritually and emotionally abused while there. I'm glad that I was aware enough to see what was going on and not give in to their manipulative tactics or mind control. Medical treatment was also withheld as they said that if I just "trusted in God" or had "more faith" it would get better. They even went as far as to say that I was blocking God's ability to work in me.

They are not personal experiences! I have a daughter who went to this place and she was brainwashed into believing all her problems were her parents fault- oh so common among young girls today- blame it on the parents!!! Consequently our daughter has not spoken to us going on three years! She still has her same problems and worse, only now she will not let us help her. This review will probably be removed because the ones that stay here are the lies! Basically this organization is a CULT!
Mercy Multiplied	149353	9	/users/profile/199044	CarolineL	Client Served	1	02/13/2013	I graduated from Mercy Ministries in 2006.The main reason why I do not and never will financially support Mercy Ministries is that they are completely unqualified to address mental illness, particularly eating disorders. My counselor was not trained in eating disorder treatment. I came to Mercy with an eating disorder. I was not treated for my eating disorder. It was lumped in with all of my other mental illnesses. They "monitored" my eating, and by monitor, I mean that untrained , unhealthy staff would look at our plates and decide if it looked good. We had a nutritionist during the day, but she would merely do plate checks - not meet with us, one on one, regarding healthy eating practices. If our nutritionist was trained in eating disorder treatment, she certainly did not practice it. I never met with her regarding my eating disorder. I entered with anorexia/bulimia, and left with an unhealthy BMI and no ability to consciously choose a healthy nutritional lifestyle. I did experience 'exorcism' as part of the counseling program, though I heard they did away with that counseling program due to negative feedback. It is extremely disconcerting to me that they do not use clinically tested counseling practices.Essentially, they believe that demons and the devil are the cause of all negativity and illness. So, they believe, it is not necessary to address the illness, one must simply address the devil. This is very harmful to many women who go through the program. The approach has NO medical foundation (which is actually something they seemed proud of, because they would tout the fact that God heals, not doctors. In actuality, God uses doctors to heal - but there is a reason doctors go to medical school and complete residency). Most unsettling is that Mercy practiced "healing" for lesbian women while I was there. I was young at the time, and naive, so I did not fully understand the weight of this. Now, the thought of praying the gay away makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could apologize for ever graduating from such an institution for this sole reason. I am currently a graduate student, and have worked to come to a place of true mental and physical health after graduating Mercy. I am not an erratic, confused, or hateful Mercy graduate; however, I am concerned about the future of the program and I am ashamed to have "graduated" from Mercy.

But when I didn't respond, they dismissed me, with no aftercare and suicidal. I wasn't going to make them any money when I graduated still sick. I have severe PTSD and they encouraged me off all my medications. They're a dirty organization who mistakenly makes girls believe the world of them. 
Mercy Multiplied	128299	1	/users/profile/39810	danibeth	Client Served	5	10/24/2012	Mercy Ministries is a ministry that saves lives. I was 16 when I choose to go there. I was in a place of despair and had nowhere else to turn. I was told that I wouldn't be normal anymore. The doctors I had been going to had given up on me and sent to psych ward after psysch ward. Money was running tight because of all the medical bills and then one day my parents mental health insurance ran out. I had heard of Mercy but never felt like I needed it. I was diagnosed Bi-Polar, extreme bi-polar. I was behind in High School because of all my mental institution stays and was on 16 different medications when I went to Mercy. I attempted suicide at least once a month and never actually succeeded. Mercy saved me. I went to Mercy without any money because my parents spent their savings on mental wards. That didn't matter to Mercy, they bring in girls free of charge due to the donations they receieve. I was given a new life. I was at Mercy for a year and when I left I was a new person. I was a new person in Christ. I was on only my ADHD medication. Mercy showed me a love of Christ that I had never seen before. They took me for who I was and who I still am today. What the doctors said about me not being able to lead a normal life I have proved wrong. I was told by one of my psychologists that first diagnosed me bipolar that a miracle must of happened, because they didn't see any signs of bi-polar inside me. I know who created that miracle, and Mercy showed me the love of Christ. Christ is the one miracle maker who healed me from all my depression, my suicidal thoughts, and my diagnosis of bi-polar. Mercy Ministries was the one place that didn't label me, they showed that I was a new creation in Christ. I was told I could never lead a normal life. 12 years after leaving Mercy, I am not on any mediciations, I was in the military for 8 years and ranked up, I have a beautiful daughter, and am now a full time student getting my nursing degree with all A's and B's. Mercy took me in free of charge and I left there with more hope than ever before. Mercy Ministries is the most amazing ministry, who truely does what they say they are going to do. This would be on my number one list for non-profit organizations. I now do whatever I can do to raise money so that other girls like me can also get a life-changing experience. 
Mercy Multiplied	38890	7	/users/profile/39810	danibeth	Client Served	5	05/14/2010	I was a 15 year old girl on over 20 different antiphyschotic medications. I went from dr to dr with the diagnosis of bi-polar. Then it changed to PMDD. Then it was we have no idea whats wrong with her. I became a ward of the state and was told to go to a home. I chose Mercy Minsitries because I just got done touring it, and was amazed at how much the girls loved it. They were so happy. I wanted to be that happy. I grew up in a Christain home, but did not always get it. I came to Mercy broken, misunderstood, and alone. I came home from Mercy whole, understood, and with a whole new family. I grew up in the year that I was there and learned that when no one else is around. There is a God who is there at all times. Since being there I went over to Iraq and got injured. I learned that I had a brain tumor (after which the doctors say probably caused the problems I had as a teenager (who knew)) I have been through 3 brain surgeries and 3 months of serious radiation treatments. I still have the tumor there, but it has shrunk considerably. I will probably always have a brain tumor, yet at the same time. I was strong because of my faith. I had my strong faith because of Mercy. I was optimistic because of Mercy. I fought because I had Jesus Christ on my side. I live by Ephesisans 6:10 "Be Strong in the Lord and in the POWER of his Might." Mercy Ministries not only gave me the faith, but the family that still surrounds me today. After 10 years of leaving Mercy, I still keep in touch with many of the girls. Without Mercy Ministries (which helped me get off ALL medication and showed me that I COULD be normal and live a normal life even after dr's told me no) I would probably still be going from Dr to Dr and feeling lost and alone. Mercy Minsitries saved my life!
Mercy Multiplied	109583	1	/users/profile/149317	Samantha Beck	Client Served	5	04/11/2012	I was only 17 and was already in adolocent mental institutions for suicide attempts, cutting, an eating disorder, and substance abuse. My home life was awful. I was physically abused by a member of my family constantly. I felt like I had no hope left in me, no drive to keep living. I just wanted to end it all. I would do anything at all to mask the pain, to cover it up. Whether It was cutting to try to relieve the pain I felt inside. Or using alcohol and drugs to mask it. I learned about Mercy from my church. I had applied and was at the Nashville home within a few months. I believe with all of my heart I would not be here today if it wasnt for Mercy and God. All of the other places I had been only medicated me or tryed to teach me new coping skills. Mercy went way beyond that. They showed me the Love and mercy of God. The staff were absolutely amazing. They were very educated and knew what they were doing. Every single day, they went beyond their job title, by showing us the love and grace of God. They were the most loving people I have ever been around. At Mercy, It wasnt an Institution, or a hospital. It was a Home. An inviting, modern, and comfortable home. My time at Mercy was the most amazing 6 months of my life. I was able to develop a true relationship with Christ and surrender all of me to him. I learned I am perfect exactly the way I am. I Graduated from Mercy Ministries in October of 2008, a completely new and free woman. My past no longer defines who I am, Christ does. If you are trying to find a charity to donate to, Mercy Ministries is the perfect one. They change girls lifes every single day. They not only help girls who are hurting and desperate, They transform and restore precious lives. 
Mercy Multiplied	38885	7	/users/profile/39804	yvonne4	Volunteer	5	05/13/2010	It always amazes me the power of God's word.  I never dreamed of how God could use the things which were not God. Mercy Ministries really is about the Love of God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit. I never dreamed that my mentors would tell my story to help others but that is the God we serve.  So thankful they use God's word to address every feeling, emotion, issue with God's word. So thankful they never give up regardless of the situation they still quote God's word.  Its the only thing that sets a person free.  Always amazed at how the God I serve takes something that was meant for evil but God used it for His glory.  Mercy represents Godhead.  So thankful just to sit at their feet.  It really is God that makes the difference.  The world has nothing on them.  So thankful for the teaching has to line up with Gods word.  I never get tired of hearing or reading the stories for it really is the power of Gods word.   Many come to Jesus.  Upon graduation so many answer a call of God from becoming a Missionary, Seminary, Counseling but by addressing everything with using God's Word. I'm still amazed because God really doesn't waste anything. The other volunteers/interns and those on Staff are my just some of my heros.  My other heros are the girls the ones in the program and those on the waiting list.  For their voise cries out "You say I didn't have to live like this you said there is more to life and they learn that there really is a life.  My favorite story is when the girls say that is in the Old Testament I want something from the New Testament or vice versa.  One of my mentors who is on Staff @ Mercy told me while touring the home if its not in the Bible than we don't have an answer.

When I started a new business Jan.2009, I was too excited to sleep SO I stayed up ALL night and read Mercy's Founder, Nancy Alcorn's book, Echoes of Mercy. I was convicted to run my business the way Nancy runs Mercy Ministries; to do what GOD has called me to do and trust HIM with the results! Mercy's results are LIVES RESTORED, that's a GOD THING!
Mercy Multiplied	38811	6	/users/profile/39714	jenny8	Client Served	5	05/13/2010	This is a very short version of my testimony, a story I can now tell because of how God changed my life through this program.My birth mother left me and my younger brother when I was 2 years old. One of my family members became controlling and abusive and would often punish me by making me spend hours on my knees against the wall and would often beat me. The physical abuse became worse as I got older. Other family members molested me and this abuse eventually escalated to rape. The emotional pain led to cutting and a long battle with self-harm and bulimia. I became very confused about my sexual identity and got involved in relationships with other girls. Because of my rebellion, I was kicked me out of my home and fled to a Christian friend. When I thought I was controlling all of my issues, I realized that they were actually controlling me. A Mercy graduate who attends my church shared her testimony one Sunday morning, and I decided to seek lasting change for myself. During my time at Mercy, I learned that God already knew all of my past and my mistakes but He still accepts me just as I am. All I have to do is be willing to surrender everything and lay all my burdens down at His feet. I experienced the overwhelming love of Christ when I finally put on my crown of forgiveness and gave Him all of the ashes of my life. I am so thankful that God took my past and turned it into something that would ultimately make me turn to Him and fall in love with Him.

She had spent 6 weeks at a private clinic which cost $1500 a day with no lasting improvement. She spent 6 months at Mercy, which is free, and it saved her life and transformed her. We have had many Mercy girls come back to visit the St Louis home and stay with us while they're here.  They all are thankful for Mercy and how it changed their lives. Now I amy privileged to give back to Mercy by helping on fund raising and more recently working directly with the girls on an art healing project.

Mercy Multiplied	38206	7	/users/profile/39090	melamab77	Former Volunteer	5	05/06/2010	Mercy Ministries is one of the premier programs to help girls and young women who are struggling with life's issues. Whether it's an eating disorder, an emotional issue, self harm or anything else, Mercy successfully addresses the issue as well as the spiritual implications which are often overlooked. I actually have a cousin who is at Mercy now and she is receiving a level of care, counseling and support that she never received at the other programs she tried. I would recommend Mercy to any girl in need of help!
Mercy Multiplied	38105	7	/users/profile/38952	lauren11	Board Member	5	05/06/2010	Mercy is an outreach ministry not just to the girls in the program, but also in the community. There are numerous resources in the main website, as well as blogs with inspirational messages to help motivate a generation of girls literally fighting for their lives! I personally struggled with an eating disorder and found out about Mercy after I was well into the healing process; I made a decision to give my resources to meet the needs of girls like myself, and after making this decision, I realized not only was I helping others, I was truly sowing seed into my own healing. This ministry is all about the individual; they do not get caught up in raising money for the sake of raising money; it is always with the motive and fierce passion to save one more life (whether that means physically, spiritually, or both) from the pressures and temptations of this world. My experience with staff members I've had the priveledge to work with has been nothing but positive experiences; they are extremely hard workers, and they do their job with passion and love. I am honored and proud to serve in such an organization. To me, there is no other organization like them, based on their approach to healing and the grace and literal 'mercy' they show these girls.
Mercy Multiplied	38099	8	/users/profile/38946	scott653	Board Member	5	05/06/2010	Every time I leave a Mercy function, I am reminded of why I love helping this great organization.  At the last Mercy Friends luncheon, I made a few remarks about why my wife and I are involved.  After the luncheon, a lady came up to me.  She is the mother of one of the graduating Mercy girls that week.  Her tears of happiness that her daughter's life had been change and hope restored prevented her from saying very much to me, she could only say thank you.  I was not expecting it, but I know why God has connected my wife and I to this organization.
Mercy Multiplied	38077	5	/users/profile/38915	michele5	Donor	5	05/05/2010	I first learned about Mercy over a decade ago after hearing Nancy tell her story at a women's conference. After reading Nancy's book, I really identified with her heart to help girls and the principles by which she was guided to do it, particularly offering them help free of charge so they would know they were cared for and valued and not just viewed as a profit center. It's been incredible to see how God has blessed this ministry, expanded their reach and their homes, and the testimonies of the girls' changed lives are the greatest evidence of their success. I believe Nancy's heart to do things with excellence reflects the heart of God in how He views the broken women who come to Mercy for help and restoration. I love that girls who are written off by their families, society and all sorts of medical and psychological personnel graduate Mercy and go on to become doctors, missionaries, wives, Fulbright scholars... What further evidence do we need that a great God, a dedicated staff and an effective ministry can indeed redeem and transform lives? I invest money for a living and am even more judicious with my personal giving, and can honestly say that an investment in Mercy yields a great return every time.
Mercy Multiplied	38072	7	/users/profile/38908	carpenter	Board Member	5	05/05/2010	I first heard of Mercy Ministries about five years ago when I saw Nancy Alcorn on Joyce Meyer's daily broadcast.  My heart was instantly knitted with this ministry.  Since that time, I learned more about Mercy and along the way, as my family and I moved to a different church, we discovered that our church was directly involved with Mercy!  I have had the amazing opportunity to visit the corporate offices in Nashville, as part of a missions trip to help serve them and the Nashville home.  To date, I currently serve on the Community Board for the upcoming Charlotte, NC home!  I am so extremely amazed, having witnessed first hand, at the level of integrity and excellence that this ministry operates by, even down to the smallest details, and the staff of Mercy Ministries are by far some of the best I have ever seen and had opportunity to get to know.  This is a ministry completely worthy of consideration as an outreach to support!

Mercy Multiplied	37978	6	/users/profile/38771	emilywagoner	Client Served	5	05/04/2010	I spent eleven years in the mental health system receiving treatment in various hospitals and facilities for Abuse, Depression, PTSD, Dissociation, self-harm, suicidality, and anorexia. At the end of my rope, I found Mercy Ministries. I did not know what to expect. I found a loving home where I was safe to sort out the traumas of my past, receive great counsel and guidance, and most importantly, I was given the opportunity to find a real relationship with God. The home was beautiful, modern, clean, and non-institutional. The staff were compassionate and loving, well educated, and dedicated to their work. I was challenged physically, spiritually, and emotionally, but  when I graduated from Mercy Ministries after approximately six months, I knew the Truth about myself and God. I was and still am free from depression, self-harm, eating disorders, and PTSD symptoms. Life is an ongoing learning adventure, but Mercy was instrumental in setting me on the right course with the One who changes everything. I have hope for a future outside of what happened to me in the past, and I'm so grateful.

Growing up, I didn't have many positive influences in my life but, when I started the Bethlehem Center all that changed. The Bethlehem center is a great place for kids and teenagers. Going to the Bethlehem Center is life changing experience. The best thing about the Bethlehem Center is that JESUS IS FIRST . I wouldn't change anything about the Bethlehem Center because in my eyes and in my heart I truly feel that the Bethlehem Center is perfect.

Its given me a different overview on our community because I look at our community today and I see all of this misguidance and lack of love or family. I feel like with me working at the Beth, I can make a direct change in our community dealing with the next and upcoming generations. I can be a positive role model for them and show the right from wrong. Everyday I think to myself, what can I do to make a difference? How can I make a change? This is my opportunity.

United Methodist Neighborhood Centers, Inc.	156409		/users/profile/207477	Gloria D.	Volunteer	5	04/26/2013	I love the work the Bethlehem Center is doing in the community. I recently started volunteering with them and have been fortunate to witness first hand the work that they are doing in the community, but also the outreach it is inspiring in others. Recently they have been interviewing talented high schoolers from all backgrounds to serve their community this summer. It was uplifting to see these kids strive to help their community but also actively think about the gifts they have that would help. They want to do more, and that's not something I see on a daily basis. I think the Bethlehem Center has helped them realize however that there is a forum to do more, and by encouraging these kids to go to college, they show them that helping is not just confided to that building. I look forward to seeing the Bethlehem Center grow in support and resources to continue to help raise these bright, future leaders.
United Methodist Neighborhood Centers, Inc.	156168		/users/profile/207202	Lori62	General Member of the Public	5	04/25/2013	The Bethlehem Center serves as a safe haven for the children and the community of Chattanooga. Our children in the community needs a place that is filled with people who will encourage them, believe in them and show them that there is always a better way and the Bethlehem Center provides all of that. Chattanooga is so fortunate to have such a center that will help children become stronger students, future leaders and carriers of the message of Christ that they have learned at the Beth. The Beth is filled with people who know how to lift these children up and show them what can be accomplished through hard work and determination. Chattanooga is privileged to  have such a place as the Bethlehem Center in our community and I am so grateful for all that they do on a daily basis!

United Methodist Neighborhood Centers, Inc.	117058		/users/profile/159246	Ellen M. Moore	Board Member	5	06/28/2012	 Over the past five years, it has been my privilege to serve on the Bethlehem Center Board. The Beth is a light for the inter-city youth and adults of Chattanooga, TN. Each summer there is a literacy academy to help the students in grades K-8 to improve in the areas of math, reading, the arts, physical  and  spiritual development. This summer the academy is called "Read to Lead." The goal is that the students will gain the skills needed to become  leaders in the community. Gang prevention is another goal. The Beth provides Christian opportunities for youth. The excellent leadership at the Beth makes this all possible. 
United Methodist Neighborhood Centers, Inc.	116968		/users/profile/159154	willb	Volunteer	5	06/28/2012	The Bethlehem Center is a rare, gleaming star that shines bright in our struggling world. It offers more than just a place for kids to hangout, but it keeps the young boys and girls in the Chattanooga community off of the streets which could lead them down a slippery slope. Instead of getting caught up in activity that could be detrimental for the remainder of their lives, the young people at The Beth work very hard to not be another statitistical number. From the conversations I have had with the young people here, there is nothing but goals and inspiration to be the best they can be. Like previously stated before, it is not just a place for these kids to hang out but a place for them to learn and to enhance their skills. The boys and girls at The Beth are constantly in classes to further their reading and math skills as well as learning about qualities that make a good human being. This all starts from the people leading the way at The Beth, from Coach Jennings to the people who work at the Beth Bistro, they are all inspiring  individuals whose goal is to better the lives of the young people they lead. For alot of the kids who attend The Beth, it is a home away from home with leaders who represent family to so many youngsters. After spending a little time here, you will figure out how important the Bethlehem Center is to so many people in the Chattanooga community.

The Bethlehem Center has been giving some of the kids what they need for years; love, faith, hope and the knowledge of a different life.  Its too bad that is not available for every child.

I started donating to the Beth because I was convinced of the good works done by Pastor Jennings and all the other hard workers and volunteers.  Then I became a volunteer at the Beth and eventually became a Board member.  I still donate and volunteer at the Beth as I continue to believe in its mission.  It truly serves as a safe, Christian haven for children and youth in the neighborhood.  The documented strides made by the Beth in literacy are amazing and its literacy program has been adopted by other organizations and churches and endorsed by our local educators.  I only wish the services offered for children and adults in the Alton Park neighborhood had been available to me when I was growing up and feeling very alone and unloved in a very dysfunctional family.   Keep up the great work!!!

I really love that the kids have the opportunity to earn money throughout the program, and at the end are given a lesson in budgeting when they are paired with adults to spend their earnings.

It's wholesome community service I have found unparalleled with similar institutions. The staff I have found to manifest a consistent patient and self-sacrificing disposition that is rarely seen in this busy age we live in.  The BETH is more than a community center, it is a city of refuge within a city. A place where young and old alike can find direction and encouragement. The programs they offer for the community do not merely sustain and provide wholesome entertainment. In addition to this, the staff are dedicated to educating, inspiring, and ministering to the needs of the family and the individual heart. Past history and the  present day testifies to the truth of this fact. What a different America it would be if every community had their own Bethlehem Center!

Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	163554	1	/users/profile/217189	WBGraham	Board Member	5	07/25/2013	After spending five years working for the federal government then retiring from the Army after 25 years of service as Lieutenant Colonel, continuing to serve was high on my list of things to do when I retired 10 years ago in 2003.  I found out about Operation Stand Down Nashville while volunteering at one of the Annual Events with Women Veterans of America Chapter 20 and after learning about the mission of serving honorably discharged veterans especially homeless veterans, I was ready to give more of my time, talent, and treasure to such a worthy organization.  I've been on the board for over four years and I am the one being blessed by my association with an organization filled with dedicated veteran employees, staff, and board members providing a hand-up to our most deserving in our community.  I serve on two other boards of directors and their work is very important, too but the difference we make in the lives of veterans at Operation Stand Down, Nashville is exceptional.  Serving those who have already given their all to our nation is truly an honor.  Our Executive Director, Bill Burleigh and our Deputy Director, Mary Ross are the most dedicated individuals I have had the privilege of serving with as a member of the board.  They always but the mission and goals of OSDN first which is taking care of our veterans.  This is absolutely the best non-profit anywhere working to help our veterans

Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	141068	1	/users/profile/187293	xvietnam	General Member of the Public	5	11/18/2012	In this day and age of so many veteran charities out there and with most of those being a cover to enrich the officers of the charity, we must be beware of who we give to.  I can personally vouch for the honesty of this organization.  I am not a member of this organization, but have assisted them in the past.  I also have been the State Commander of the Military Order of the Purple Heart (a veteran's organization composed of only Purple Heart Veterans) for the state of Tennessee 4 times and I raised funds for them and even assisted in improving some of their homes for the homeless veterans, both male and females.  I, myself rate them as the best veteran charity in Tennessee and would even place them above the known national veteran's charities to receive any donation and assistance that a person/organization has or can do.

Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	137162		/users/profile/183119	Teresa17	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	Today has been set aside as a Day to Honor Our Veterans.  The article below is about our Homeless Veterans. Tom & I spent a day at Operation Stand Down.  The Veterans stories were very touching and filled with Hope!   Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc (OSDN) is the primary nonprofit resource for veterans in Middle Tennessee providing life changing social services including transitional housing, or referrals, employment readiness training and placement assistance, and coordination of the activities of other agencies in the delivery of such services. During the week of October 12, 2012, I had the opportunity to volunteer with this three day event for veterans who are homeless. I was able to meet, talk with and photograph several of the veterans taking advantage of the services offered by a coalition of over 50 Nashville organizations.  Coalition members represent over 25 community services agencies, over 25 veteran service organizations, and many local businesses.  The event provides outreach, information, and a variety of social services. The event has been held annually each fall for the past 20 years.   I quickly learned that being homeless, or at risk for homelessness, can be one of the most difficult things a person can face.  There are many circumstances that can lead to homelessness. Some Veterans become homeless due to a combination of housing shortages and high unemployment. Other Veterans may be dealing with painful memories or health issues and have little access to health care or support from family and friends. This may lead them to feel as though they have nowhere else to go but the streets. In some cases, what seemed like a temporary lack of a place to stay becomes permanent.   While interviewing the Veterans one theme was the same; they were proud of their service to their country.  When I asked a Vietnam veteran to describe to me his service with one word, his answer was Joyful.  Some veterans battle drug and alcohol addictions for many years.  OSDN and similar facilities like Pennroyal Vet Center the newest facility in southern Kentucky, offered Joe a drug and alcohol free facility where he can get the help he needs to get his life together.  He received help to get his drivers license.  He has not had them since 1984.  Doug has aspirations of being a cook.Sitting down with Bill, a Korean War Veteran from Knoxville, I heard firsthand how his temporary circumstance lead him to be homeless, but knowing all of Bills story makes you want to reach out and help him to help himself.  OSDN helped him to move to Nashville from Knoxville so he could be close to his son.  OSDN gave him a safe place to stay and access to computers where he was able to apply and land a job.  Bill now has a job and the self confidence for his future. Help our Veterans, who have sacrificed so much for us!!! Our Freedom!

After volunteering at one of thenStand Down Events, I was hooked. I volunteered for years with OSDN, and served on the Board of Directors for about 5 years.  After 10 years working in the corporate world, I took a significant cut in pay to work for this organization. It was the best decision I made since leaving the Army.  Miracles happen every day. 
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	133321		/users/profile/179032	Larry17	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	I was present at their first event in 1992. It was designed to help veterans who would not go to the VA. Physical and mental health issues were addressed at that event as well as assistance with clothing, food, shelter, job placement, legal issues and more. Over the years this veteran outreach has grown to include a permanent home, paid professional staff, its own thrift store and expanded services at the annual Operation Base Camp event. This one organization provides more direct assistance to local veterans than all the other veteran service organizations combine. They are worthy of the highest rating which can be given.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	133071		/users/profile/34980	vjdj	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	I've witnessed homeless veterans being given clothes, shoes, coats, health check-ups, dental check-ups, shower facilities, beds.  It has been my pleasure to help serve dinners to over 400 veterans, to sit with many, to listen to them, to encourage them, to give them a smile.  Operation Stand Down Nashville is a very caring and organized operation, and has been for more years than I've been a volunteer.  
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132640		/users/profile/178289	Dave35	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/02/2012	There are many organizations that claim to assist Veterans in their time of need, and most do a good job.  But Operation Stand Down Nashville goes way above and beyond that standard.  Partnering with many other agencies in the Nashville area, including the VA Hospital, the VA Regional Office and other local charities and non-profits, the Veteran who comes in for service at OSDN is referred to whatever agency or agencies are suited to help the person the best.  The most important and unique thing is that once the process starts, OSDN tracks the progress, following up throughout the process. They give the Veteran positive motivation to continue forward and that helps to ensure the greatest chance of being successful.  The staff at OSDN are mostly Veterans, so it's Veterans assisting Veterans.  It never ceases to amaze me how the staff performs their duties and how much they really do care for the Veterans they serve.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132607		/users/profile/178255	john106	Advisor	5	11/02/2012	OSDN is a great organization that gives back to the veteran community in so many ways.  They don't give "hand outs" but rather "hands up" to help veterans get back on their feet!
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132595		/users/profile/178244	ggarrett	Volunteer	5	11/02/2012	I work with Operation Stand Down every year that I can for the three day event.  I serve meals to the Vets.  That is the most rewarding weekend of the year for me.  It is well staffedand  well organized.  If you ever get the chance to come to the event please do.  It is so awesome.  Come see the volunteers in action.  The hair cut tent was the most fun.  It is lively and this year had music playing.  It was awesome.  Many professionals give their time and I know it has to be rewarding and heart warming.  I look forward to many more years feeding the Vererans!  Keep up the good work! 
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132460		/users/profile/178098	Jc__2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2012	Last I heard, Operation Stand Down Nashville spent $.90 of every dollar donated to the Veteran they serve. I don't know of many other non-profits, locally or nationally that is as efficient. The 20th Annual Stand Down Event was a model for Stand Downs in any city, hopefully to be copied by other missions to assist all populations in need of services.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132432		/users/profile/178069	Jim_40	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	I assisted in the registration of Homeless Veterans at the annual Operation Stand Down event in 2011 and was impressed with the care and assistance provided to needy Veterans during this event.

Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132422	1	/users/profile/178060	RogerGH	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2012	I am with the Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs in Nashville, TN.  I work closely with Bill and his staff and applaud the good work they do for our veterans who are down on their luck.  I have worked with them for years during their big OSD usually in October.  They make every effort to assist veterans with anything they need to help get them back on their feet.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132358		/users/profile/177992	Clay Phillips	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	OSDN is one of the most well-run organizations I have ever had the privilege of working with. I have spent the last 6 years involved with OSDN providing volunteer mediator/legal-related services to their constituents. Bill Burleigh, his managers and staff are second-to-none in their commitment to making an immediate difference in the lives of each Veteran they meet. As a member of other VSO's I can confidently assert that OSDN makes a big difference in many Veterans' lives each day of the week. OSDN is worthy of any and all support available to them.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132356		/users/profile/33216	richard-aberdeen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2012	Operation Stand Down is the best organization I am aware of for helping homeless veterans and other veterans in need.  This organization consistently year after year continues to do excellent work in the greater Nashville area.  As I have also done previously, Operation Stand Down has my highest recommendation.   --Richard Aberdeen; Freedom Tracks Records, Nashville, Tennessee 
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32398	8	/users/profile/33216	richard-aberdeen	Donor	5	03/03/2010	Bill Burleigh of Operation Stand Down Nashville was more than willing to give me a personal tour of the facilities.  Having lived in Nashville approximately six years now, it has been my consistent experience that Operation Stand Down Nashville is one of the best non-profits in the area.  They make every effort to help homeless and impoverished veterans in need and I consider this organization to be a great blessing for the general Nashville area and community.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132340		/users/profile/177971	CCR2012	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	Operation Stand Down is a wonderful organization that helps so many on a limited budget.  Last year, 90% of every dollar was spent on direct services for veterans so you can be sure your donations are well spent.  You can very obviously tell that the people that work and volunteer there care for the veterans they serve.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132337		/users/profile/177967	Amy_58	Donor	5	11/01/2012	OSD is a very well run organization that positively impacts the lives of hundreds of veterans in our community. The staff is professional and hard working to ensure all donations are put to good use. The services offered by OSD provide opportunities to veterans that lead to substantial progress in re-entering the workforce or regaining the ability to live independently. Bill Burleigh and his staff have developed an outstanding nonprofit for the Middle Tennessee region.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132329		/users/profile/177957	Chuck9	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2012	OSDN is the only organization in Middle Tennessee creating the kind of environment and success rate necessary for our veterans. As a veteran myself I volunteer when I can, but these folk put their heart and soul into it everyday. From the smiling faces that greet you at the office and thrift store to the counselors that help with employment and training this is an outstanding group of human beings. Their financial numbers speak volumes about how a non-profit should and can be run. I don't know what the community would do without OSDN.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	132323		/users/profile/177951	Jford3	Donor	5	11/01/2012	I have had the opportunity to visit, donate and talk with volunteers, participants, and Colonel Bill Burleigh of Operation Stand Down Nashville, Tennessee. As a retired Marine, anything I can donate goes to OSDN because I know it will go to someone who can genuinely use it. The staff and leadership of OSDN is not only competenet and compassionate about what they do, but they are also always going to do the right thing. I believe we owe our veterans a debt and to ensure they receive what they deserve and any opportunity we can convey to them. OSDN ensures that happens and that the veterans they serve are well taken care of. Semper-Fi.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	34118	9	/users/profile/34915	laurel2	Volunteer	5	03/29/2010	It's difficult to find words that would truly reflect the impact that OSDN has had on the Volunteers and the witnessing of lives changed by the Veterans who came to the annual event. I Volunteered as a Nurse for OSDN last year and it was an experience I will not forget. To be in the presence of so many Veterans was an honor. Col. Bill Burleigh is a man of excellent character and he has accomplished what some may think impossible. He and his crew are dedicated to helping Veterans and deserve the highest level of respect. I remember one gentleman standing in the hallway saying in the hallway "Thank you...I don't believe this, thank you." he wasn't talking to anyone in particular but you could tell he received something that took years of hardship off his face. I'm ready to do this anytime when called upon and remain a supporter of this organization's honorable work.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	33179	7	/users/profile/34001	colonel-819	Client Served	5	03/14/2010	I was first referred to Operation Stand Down by my V.A. Rep. in Lawrenceburg,TN after my business was wiped out by 911 and I found myself back in the job market after over thirty years of business; much had changed and I had to return to school to catch up on technology.After thirty credit hours, I qualified for a co-op education program, which gave school credits for returning to work, I had been unempoloyed for two years and I had no income.I had to relocate to Nashville about 100 miles away. I called and spoke with a OSD counsoler and he called back in two days and said that he had located a place for me to stay, that would give me time to find work, and get my school grant.When I arrived, OSD helped me find employment, and when I qualified for a State Internship, OSD was my third reference.When the engine in my car blew, driving to school, OSD helped me with bus passes for work and school all the way through my last simester.Now, due to all the assistance that I received from OSD, I have a degree in Computer Technology Management, with a minor in Business Adminstration and have several honors and awards as well as job referrences from the State Senate and House of Representatives and am a proud volunteer for Operation Stand Down.Sincerely, Garry L. Thomas
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32958	7	/users/profile/33787	uncle-d	General Member of the Public	5	03/11/2010	I have an indirect link to a story about this group. I was the Patroit Guard Riders ride captain for a Vietnam Vet's funeral in Jackson TN. One of their clients was our honoree that day. Michael had been homeless for many years. months prior to his death, he had been working with OSDN and had found employnment a home and more important, reconciled with his family. Had it not been for Operation Stand Down NASHVILLE- Michael most likely would have spent his last days in a vacant lot tent city too weak to fend off the predatory efforts of others. Instead, he was in a hospital and the woman who loved him at his side. His family felt like things had turned for him and he had made ammends never knowing he was going to be sick and die when he did. Michael is not the only story of success, but the only one I have first hand knowledge of. I am proud to be PGR and that PGR has partnered with this organization on a state wide level. I wish we could get one started here in Jackson TN and Memphis regions! I would surely take an active role!
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32825	5	/users/profile/33657	stlcard	Volunteer	5	03/09/2010	Operation Stand Down Nashville's annual weekend event helps homeless veteran secure full time permenent employment, solve legal issues, connect with the VA, provide mail box address, and work with substance abuse issues for hundreds of veterans who are homeless. The Stand Down event is a one time assist to these veterans each year, however they assist veterans in all of these same areas all year.  They have an outstanding success rate in moving veterans off the street and to become a productive citizen again.

Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32688	2	/users/profile/33511	gabby2	Volunteer	5	03/08/2010	I have nothing but GOOD things to say about this organization. It warms my heart to see veterans helping veterans,but also those who didnt serve,giving there time for those in need.I have been involved for several years now,and every year has been rewarding.When I retire,I WILL voluteer to work full time.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32558	4	/users/profile/33375	steven4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/05/2010	An incredible organization made up primarily of veterans who work daily to improve the lives of homeless and at risk veterans in and around Nashville, Tennessee.  If you know of a veteran in need, do not hesitate to refer him/her to Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32458	4	/users/profile/33275	twinmaples	Volunteer	5	03/04/2010	I have been involved with Operation Stand Down Nashville for three years.  I have worked both at the annual event and volunteered for the daily office support.I can think of no better organization to identify as a leader in nonprofit service providers.  They consistently lead in service percentages based on donations.  The diversity of services that they provide to the veterans in almost unbelievable.  The number of sucesses exceeds all superlatives I know.  They do not give up on people but continue to encourage, support and welcome individuals to make the changes necessary to achieve selfsustainabilty.

Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32448	7	/users/profile/33265	rogeraudit	Volunteer	5	03/04/2010	I know of no other organization that does more for the homeless American Vet, our American Hero's, than Operation Stand Down Nashville!
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32418	9	/users/profile/33240	flosser	Volunteer	5	03/04/2010	I have been involved in the annual Operation Stand Down for Homeless Veterans since the time. The VA Dental Clinic does oral cancer screenings and dental health education.  We tried to steer the vets who were most likely not eligible for VA Dental Care to private sources who might could help them with their needs.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32411	8	/users/profile/33232	moorewr	Former staff	5	03/04/2010	StandDown, Nashville began when several caring individuals gathered at the Maxwell House Hotel on 8th Ave N, to hear a presentation about other like type organizations in the US, especially in CA. It has grown from that meeting and its first 3 day event, which by the way, cost less than $5000 in donated money to the outstanding organization it is today.  Its strength has always been the Nashville VA Hospital, Tennessee Department of Veterans Affairs, State Employment Security, Metro Nashville Govt Agencies and employees, the various Veterans Organizations, Bell South Volunteers, Tennessee National Guard, (Army and Air) and all of the volunteers who have come out each year.  It is wonderful to see the mission of Stand Down grow and assist in many ways never envisioned.  I am very proud to have been a part of this truly outstanding accomplishment.

Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32406	10	/users/profile/33226	lynn4	Volunteer	5	03/04/2010	Through my personal volunteer experience with the OSDN Staff and its' fellow volunteers, I have witnessed true, compassionate caring for our veterans.  The Staff excels in their work and the new facility is conducive to better serving their clients.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32403	8	/users/profile/33222	robin-barry	Volunteer	5	03/03/2010	Every member of the OSDN team is 100% committed to serving Veterans.  Each person I met was enthusiastic about OSDN's mission.  I was surprised by my experience as a first-time volunteer. I had no idea how much FUN it would be!
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32378	12	/users/profile/33193	jaredpurcell	Donor	5	03/03/2010	Operation Stand Down is a non profit that truly has the Veterans on their minds at all times.  They are expertly run, and the operation is efficient and safe.  They do an excellent job of including all Veterans and their staff is friendly and helpful.  I am proud to have donated time and funds to their cause, and I only wish more non profits ran as well as Operation Stand Down Nashville.  I highly recommend them!
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32377	9	/users/profile/33191	melloydy	Volunteer	5	03/03/2010	I had the privilege and the honor to sing for the weekend Retreat for Operation Standdown for our soldiers.  The soldiers were counseled, clothed, fed and given hope.  They shared their stories with me and led me to tears. I sang my songs to them and led them to tears as well.I could not have found a more worthy organization to support and look forward to working with them again very soon!
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32362	3	/users/profile/33166	afbiii	Client Served	5	03/03/2010	I am one of several Vietnam veterans that have attended Thursday night meetings at Operation STand Down for as long as thtey hve been an organization. We actually stearted about 20 years ago with another organization, but the folks at OSD welcomed us with open arms. We meet every Thursday night and share supper and help each other by listening and giving teh same we did in 'Nam - our lives. We are as close as we were with our battlefield companions from so long ago and are the epitomy of brothers in arms. We'd fight and die for each other the same as in our combat days; thankfully, that is no longer required! They charge us nothing, and gain only an occasional left-over brownie and the satisfaction of knowing they are helping us. We are known at VA as the Thursday night PTSD group, and though not sanctioned by them, we have helped about 50 veterans receive disabilities and get thier lives back on a livable track. We march every year with the OSDN group in the Veteran's Day parade and give back our personal services when we can. If there is a better organization serving veterans in the middle Tennessee area, I don't know of it. We appreciate their confidence and friendship and they rank first in our hearts.
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32360	3	/users/profile/33163	pearl1	Volunteer	5	03/03/2010	I am a community volunteer and my time, as is everyone's, a precious commodity. When asked to work with this organization, I did not hesitate because its mission is at this time in US history and because the leaders of OSDN know how to operate a not-for-profit and how to use volunteers' time well!
Operation Stand Down Nashville, Inc.	32359	3	/users/profile/33164	robert6	Volunteer	5	03/03/2010	After working with OSD for several months, I continue to discover new depths of caring, and giving to the homeless veteran community in middle Tennessee. This is truly a passionate, caring group of individuals who work tirelessly to get these deserving men, and women back on their feet. I have done a lot of volunteer work in the past, but nowhere have I found an organization with the heart, and soul to equal Operation Stand Down.
Soles4Souls	272003	1	/users/profile/360936	Margie P.	Volunteer	5	11/13/2015	AMAZING team!  Can't wait to he's to Haiti in April! 
Soles4Souls	271982	3	/users/profile/360910	Whitney J.	Volunteer	5	11/13/2015	Traveled to Guatemala with S4S in 2013. The need there was incredible. We gave shoes to children who usually walked barefoot to school. They had cuts, bruises, and calluses on their feet. One little girl cried as I washed her feet. All she could say was "thank you." We also visited a dump where people live. They go through the trash to find food, clothes, and things to make their homes. They don't get the luxury of new things. I will never forget the looks on their faces when we handed out shoes. I've never felt so needed. It's humbling. You don't realize how lucky you are until you see people in real need. And I got to help them. This organization is amazing. S4S takes the simple act of giving out shoes to a whole new level. What this organization does is give people hope. Give them peace and joy. Traveling with S4S changed my life. 
Soles4Souls	271981	2	/users/profile/360909	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/13/2015	A group of friends and I have partnered with Soles4Souls for the past 2  years and are in the process of working with them again in 2016.  We have collect 2,000 shoes in honor of a dear friend who lost her battle with Cervical Cancer in 2013.  This is a wonderful organization that is making a HUGE impact on the world through something as simple as shoes.  We feel very blessed to be able to have such an amazing partnership with them!  Give HOPE. Give SHOES. 
Soles4Souls	271652		/users/profile/360519	GoodGirl	General Member of the Public	5	11/09/2015	I just came across this charity and think they are doing an awesome job of providing shoes for those in need!
Soles4Souls	194349	1	/users/profile/253953	Maggi T.	Volunteer	5	02/15/2014	Soles4Souls commitment to "Wearing out Poverty" is outstanding. They are organized, personable with genuine staff members who put 100% in to everything they work on.  I have never been happier working with a charity and love the simpleness of giving shoes to give someone a chance in life. 
Soles4Souls	155870	1	/users/profile/206855	Sr. Christina	Client Served	4	04/24/2013	I am so glad and thankful that there is an organization that helps children in needs .  Reviewing the good causes that the volunteers and donors have done to these children made my heart melt of overwhelmed joy and gives me the relief feeling of justice that was given to these children and that is why i am so proud of Pusong Pinoy.  Not only that, Pusong Pinoy is definitely a transparent non-profit organization. I myself have experienced that this organization really ensures all the donations will surely reach the intended beneficiaries. This organization has helped the students of our Society.   We are grateful to you for all the helps and blessings we have received from you. With Love and prayers,Sr. Christina SKDGeneral of Society of Kristudasis.
Soles4Souls	155857	2	/users/profile/206824	Kandi M.	Volunteer	5	04/24/2013	I have went on two Travel4Souls trips and had an amazing time! I also went with my church on a mission trip and we distributed shoes via Soles4Souls as well this past month.  Kelly H is an amazing leader and has a heart of gold. I visited both Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Haiti over the past year and have helped give over 1000 pairs of new shoes to children, as well as, used shoes to many others. I believe in continuing to engage my friends and neighbors throughout my community in shoe drives and hopefully encouraging them to also be a part of Travel4Souls one day! I highly recommend signing up for a trip. It'll change your life!-Kandi M.
Soles4Souls	155469	1	/users/profile/206390	Jodi10	Volunteer	5	04/20/2013	Soles4souls was a wonderful experience and would highly recommend it to anyone! I enjoyed the people, culture of Tanzania and the beauty of the country! I never realized ALL I would personally take away from such a great trip! I thought about all I would have to do and give to make this trip possible, but the return on your time and expense is PRICELESS  :) My advise to anyone thinking about joining Soles4souls, is this "just do it". Find a country you would like to visit and sign up, everything else will fall into place and it will be a trip you will remember for a life time! Jodi SampsonTanzania Trip 2013
Soles4Souls	155406	1	/users/profile/206311	Kiersten B.	Volunteer	5	04/19/2013	I went to Costa Rica with Sole4Souls and experienced so much. Not only do they help connect us with the children who we passed out shoes to but we got to see some of the city and did some touring as well.  Everything was well organized, and we were cared for very well and the coordinator made sure we felt at home the entire time. 
Soles4Souls	155311	1	/users/profile/206204	Jaye S.	Volunteer	5	04/18/2013	My 16 year old son and I went on the trip to Honduras with S4S.  It was an amazing & humbling experience.  We went to an Orphanage called Emmanuel and put shoes on 100+ kids feet and had the opportunity to stay at the orphanage and play with the children.  Our fearless leader Kelly was amazing and we felt very safe at all times.  I would highly recommend this trip.  We are planning another trip for next year.  Muchas Gracias
Soles4Souls	155234		/users/profile/206110	marynell0421	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	My school collected shoes for Soles4Souls and the entire community got behind this wonderful organization. I cannot say enough good things about Soles4Souls. They were eager to accept our 2500 pairs of shoes. Then I traveled with Soles4Souls to Costa Rica to help give shoes to needy children. What a rewarding and life changing experience. They do so much more than giving away shoes. Their partners in other countries reach out to find the individuals that are the most in need. The Soles4Souls coordinator that traveled with us to Costa Rica went the extra mile to make sure we had a memorable experience. Back in the United States I even met the CEO of Soles4Souls and he too showed how each person associated with them have the passion and dedication to making a difference in the world. I have volunteered in the community for over 30 years and I can say I have never experienced an organization of this caliber that truly makes a difference in not only the United States but in the world. 
Soles4Souls	155216		/users/profile/206093	janellerjones	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	My husband and I went on a trip to Haiti with Soles4Souls and were impressed not only with the quality and character of the leaders but with their commitment and passion to making a positive and sustainable difference where it is so desperately needed. To see the impact up close and personal, and to be given the opportunity to be a part of it, was nothing less than life-changing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Soles4Souls	155172		/users/profile/206049	chris N	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	Wow... I sit on the Board of two other nonprofits and Soles4soles blows me away.  There's a huge difference between an organization that will sit around a fancy boardroom once a month talking about getting things done and my experience with Soles4Soles.    Soles4Souls...they don't just talk....they" just do it...."  Kelly, you are a great leader .   God Bless all those children in the Orphanage Emmanuel  in Honduras.    So far....my absolute favorite trip with Soles4souls!!!!    See you next time!   Chris N.  (PS, swear I'm taking a spanish class..)
Soles4Souls	155142		/users/profile/206011	Kate48	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	I went on a trip with my college as a humanitarian and global outreach project. This was a ground breaking trip for my small Methodist college and I believe this was the perfect organization to use. They were very organized and transparent.
Soles4Souls	155140		/users/profile/206010	mrs.hershey	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	The process of collecting, sorting, boxing and shipping off shoes to a country in need, was an interesting process. However, the experience became real when we actually handed out the shoes to the children in Costa Rica.  Seeing the living conditions and hearing stories of abuse, neglect, and filth in the squatter villages made me want to cry.  However, seeing the children dancing and singing gave me hope. Again, it made me realize how fortunate we really are.We are so fortunate to not have to worry about clothes or shoes.We wake up every morning with the LUXURY of CHOICE and DECISIONwhat outfit or WHICH shoes should I wear today.  Even though we did not speak the same language, the smile on their faces and the twinkle in their eyes when a new pair of shoes were put on their feet said it all. 
Soles4Souls	155054		/users/profile/205914	krilynmoo	Volunteer	5	04/16/2013	Shoes and clothing are collected to take to Haiti. A high school friend is leading a shoe drive in the Middle TN area to take the love to Haiti. She has engaged so many to help, that it has been an inspiration to everyone involved. LOVE this nonprofit and everyone involved in making it a success!!!
Soles4Souls	153617		/users/profile/204440	Anna46	General Member of the Public	5	04/08/2013	I was an Army Medic assigned to one of the biggest Infantry divisions in the U.S. One of the major problems the foot soldier faced were foot diseases. They can be as mild as athletes foot to as traumatic as gangrene from an open sore in unsanitary conditions; which can lead to amputation and sometimes even death. Most people do not realize how a pair of shoes in a poor area can not only save lives; but increase the children's state of health. I applaud Soles4Souls for seeing and trying to remedy this issue. It is also extremely difficult for a child to engage in healthy play; while barefoot. And if you don't believe me; take your shoes off and try kicking a ball effectively! In fact I challenge anyone who reads this to; on their next day off; engage in your normal daily activities; while barefoot! And then do it again this winter. I am confident that after accepting my challenge; you will see how important Soles4Souls mission really is.
Soles4Souls	153560		/users/profile/204367	jbofabulous	Donor	5	04/08/2013	There are no words to express how truly wonderful of an experience working with Soles4Souls is! Truly LIFE CHANGING! 3 years ago, I teamed up our small school and small community with Soles4Souls, and successfully collected nearly 10,000 shoes in 2 months! We now are home to one of their largest warehouses and are Ohio's Regional Collection Site, thanks to Keller Trucking! Last year we collected 41,500 books for Hope4Souls, and this year, we have a goal of 50,000 shirts for Clothes4Souls. The staff is amazing and very hands on! I have personally visited their world headquarters in Nashville, and was amazed at their open door policy. We personally met everyone that was at work that day! This organization has changed not only my life, but the life of our school, and our community! Hands down, the best organization EVER!

Soles4Souls	153461		/users/profile/204262	Sara74	General Member of the Public	5	04/08/2013	This non-profit is committed to social and economic justice, from the ground-up... literally.  Souls4Souls is an inspiration to all of us who wish to connect with people in a real and meaningful way!  A great organization!
Soles4Souls	153436		/users/profile/204238	mjhurley	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	This is a phenomenal organization! I have been fortunate enough to travel with S4S four times in two years and have cherished my experiences. I never would have had the resources, courage or organization to travel to a third world country without their support.  The execution of each trip I have taken has been excellent and all of the staff I have ever interacted with are passionate, organized, interesting and genuinely fun, kind people!  The trips allow you to do necessary service, interact with recipients of the shoes, experience the country's culture and feel safe, supported and protected.
Soles4Souls	145921		/users/profile/192529	Pam_37	Volunteer	5	12/04/2012	An AMAZING organization...altruistic....when you give...it will go.....exactly how you desired!  We have been involved with S4S for nearly 3 years, had the wonderful fortune to travel to Haiti and learn about these beautifully ambitious people....This non-profit will be in OUR lives for a long, long time!  
Soles4Souls	133696		/users/profile/179445	Annabelle Havlicek	Donor	4	11/05/2012	Our Director of Field Sales & Marketing (functioning as President of Women in Cable & Television President) got us active along with competing Cable Companies to donate shoes for Soles4Souls. When all was said in done we donated over 80 pairs of shoes. I was responsible for collecting them from Wisconsin Time Warner, packing them and getting them shipped. I received wonderful thank you notes from WICT, Soles4Souls and even Village Northwest Unlimited who received some of the shoes for their clients. It is a most worthwhile charity to donate shoes to. 
Soles4Souls	132701	1	/users/profile/178355	N'kee S.	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2012	I know them from Facebook and am an avid follower of their good deeds.  They inspire me to do more and to always remember those in need. I am so grateful for what they do and want to pull together friends to help in their venture to help people in need one shoe at a time. Thumbs up to them and the get the 'Like' buttonfrom me all day every day!
Soles4Souls	132211	1	/users/profile/177824	Lindsey16	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	One of the best part about S4S is the multiple levels of opportunity to get involved; you can donate a pair of shoes, you can host a shoe drive,  you can travel with them to deliver collected shoes to those in need, or you can do all three! S4S is one of the few organizations that I know of that gives everyone a chance to get involved, by donating unused shoes in their closet. Additionally, I don't know of too many organizations who allow you to travel with them to experience firsthand the work done by the organization. As someone who has volunteered through their travel program, I have to praise the staff I worked with. They truly do care about changing lives, both of the volunteers they are with and those of the community they are serving. Additionally, because of their strong partnerships with organizations in countries abroad, resources are used efficiently and successfully. 
Soles4Souls	132176		/users/profile/177788	tyhasty	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2012	My experience with S4S has been awesome.  They have been a terrific partner with our work in Honduras.  We have worked together on both the donation and micro-economic side and have been succesful with both.  i have found the staff to be compassionate, smart, quick to respond and they do what they say they will do.  I cannot say this about all the non-profits I have dealt with.
Soles4Souls	132050		/users/profile/177645	K'Zaynab G.	Donor	4	11/01/2012	As part of a large national walking event, I first learned about Soles4Souls in 2009 when we began recycling shoes post-event to be donated to them.  I gained interest in S4S and continued to follow their doings in various ways, mostly online.  I can see the difference they are making in the lives of thousands of impoverished peoples.  This is an easy and accessible way to make a difference and the results are plain to see in the smiles on recipients' faces as they wear their new shoes with joy.  
Soles4Souls	131934		/users/profile/177534	Amy_57	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	If you are looking for a non profit to do work with S4S is the one!!!  I am a 2 time volunteer with the Travel4Souls division of Soles4Souls.  My trips were to Haiti, it was my first journey to a third world country. I knew it was going to be an experience of a lifetime, but I did not realize that my life would be forever changed.  Thanks to S4S I have now found a true purpose in life. To continue to do good work in Haiti. The leadership both here in the states as well as in Haiti is top notch. Professionals who have a compassion for doing good work in the states and around the world. Thank You again Soles4Souls for changing my life and helping me understand what purpose really means.......

Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2012	The work that we have been able to do for the past 4 years with Soles4Souls has been incredible. They way that they are able to connect with the community of Los Angeles and then connect them to us has been a true blessing. Many lives have been touched by the more than 20 000 pairs of shoes that they have donated which includes those who are homeless to the Hollywood elite. Soles4Souls is truly a life changing company.
Soles4Souls	131857		/users/profile/177449	kellyben	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2012	it's easy to give to this charity - simply clean out your closet!!! 
Soles4Souls	131855	1	/users/profile/177447	smayock	Client Served	5	10/31/2012	Soles 4 Souls is a wonderful organization. Over the past few year, they have donated hundreds and hundreds of shoes to the deserving students in After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles programs; which serves inner-city kids from low-income neighborhoods.  Soles 4 Soles is generous, ambitious and sincere in the help the offer the community. Any individual would be proud to work with them or be affiliated with their efforts. 
Soles4Souls	131852		/users/profile/177443	Runner Girl	Client Served	5	10/31/2012	What an amazing group!  I love what this charity represents and all the good it has done for our athletes and people in need around the world.  Thank you Soles4Souls!
Soles4Souls	131831		/users/profile/177420	Danielle21	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Travel4Souls / Souls4Soles offers a unique opportunity to do hands on volunteer work with direct interaction with the people you are serving with no experience, simply the desire to improve the lives of others and change the world through a simple, yet important, gift of shoes. I love that the distribution trips are not only about giving out shoes, but interacting and spending time with & showing love to the people we meet. It's a great catalyst to see the world and return home with a changed perspective and desire to do more in your own community. 
Soles4Souls	131826		/users/profile/177414	Tammy27	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	I helped by proudly being the platform in  promoting and providing a voice to this organization by posting their story in the Village Connector community newspaper.  This newspaper is a good news newspaper no crime, politics or controversy....so good news in its community and only on line.  We share this touching organization and all they do with so many in Maryland and other States too.  Many readers have commented as to the warmheartedness of this organization truly the heart and soul of giving.  http://villageconnector.com/howardcountymd/2010/11/everyone-wants-a-lift/

The shipping process was also a breeze!  I really want to sign up to go on one of the "giving" trips....I hope that I can work that out soon!
Soles4Souls	131820		/users/profile/177408	Ken_14	Donor	5	10/31/2012	Soles4Souls not only does great work, but they do it well, and with integrity. Their organization is filled with people who truly care about those they serve.

Soles4Souls	100344	7	/users/profile/99509	dclaudew	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/06/2011	A agree with the other posters that the accounting seems very odd. 1.  To its benefit, contributions are incredible, doubling every year.  Any NPO would be proud of S4S' record. 2.  In Part VIII, cash contributions (line 1c) and fundraising expenses not including line 1c (line 8a) are exactly the same amount, $1,145,217.  What is the chance of that being accurate?  Zero, if you believe Schedule G, which gives a different accounting of fundraising activities. 3.  Some of the noncash contributions must be monetized.  Cash contributions in Part VIII are $1.1m yet Part IX salaries are over $2m and legal is $214k.  There doesn't seem to be enough cashflow to pay the expenses unless some of the donated item are being sold to pay salaries and expenses.  Plus, net assets in Part X grew by more than $9m, so clearly all the donations are not flowing to the poor and needy.For example, the noncash contributions from the rich are said to be $71.7m while grants to the needy were just $60.6m (still a very impressive number, even if substantially less than the contributions). 4.  Part VII lists no independent contractors making more than $100k.  This is only possible if all the work is purposefully divided among many contractors to conceal names.  Legal expenses are $214k, advertising $810k, occupancy $181k, distribution $413k, and direct mail $267k, yet, again, we are told that none of these large categories had more than $100k to a single vendor. 5.  Schedule O says the Directors reviewed the Form 990.  There are enough reporting and math mistakes on this Form 990 to make that statement unlikely.  At a minimum, the Directors should wonder where is the attached request for an extension, since this Form 990 is late.
Soles4Souls	100297	4	/users/profile/121964	savaha	Donor	1	11/04/2011	I was informed by people who have been to the Domican Republic  that all the shoes and clothing items sent over there are taken by the local citizens and sold on the street corners in Haiti.  There was also a show on tv explaining all the scams going on involving donations by good hearted caring citizens of the US.  They even showed a rapper singing his song about how the citizens of the US are so stupied and that's with a captial "S".  They laugh in our faces and brag about how rich they get off of our good intentions.  Why do we keep falling for all these sick scams.  Leave me out of this one.
Soles4Souls	88770	6	/users/profile/100204	botty	Professional with expertise in this field	2	05/16/2011	A lot of folks are very positive about S 4 S's work, but I find it troubling that the CEO is earning over $400,000 a year--for the past several years. I and others in this line of work try to align our own living standard with those we serve--although as Rich World residents, we never really get there.  I just think it says something about the priorities of an org if they're saying they're concerned about the poor, but find a way to enrich themselves as they serve the needy. 
Soles4Souls	85036	2	/users/profile/94530	Lynne H.	Volunteer	4	04/08/2011	I traveled to Haiti with S4S in March 2011.  An amazing experience.  S4S covers all the arrangements from the US to the country of work and back.  We spent 5 days in Haiti and it was one of the best trips I have ever been fortunate to take.  We led two shoe distributions - new shoes donated to S4S.  We sat individually with each recipient - washed their feet, fitted their shoes and touched their lives, if only for a few moments.  It is beautiful and simple - yet very meaningful.  Shoes are critical to avoiding disease and mites that come in through cracked feet walking in the dirt.  You will see and experience the country like no other trip.  Katie Lentile and John our guide were incredible.   Pick a country and go!
Soles4Souls	49060	1	/users/profile/50309	carmichael73	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/02/2010	Soles4Souls is an amazing organization that is changing the thinking of the entire footwear industry and creating a donation channel where footwear companies, retail stores, schools, civic groups and individuals come together to donate shoes, clothing, housing or sponsor micro-enterprise opportunities for people in need.  Since 2005, Founder Wayne Elsey has single-handedly changed the way footwear companies can make a difference, both across the street and around the world.  Soles4Souls has donated over 10 million pairs of new and gently worn shoes to people in 126 countries and is currently engaged in an ambitious program in Haiti to create footwear-related jobs, sustainable housing, schools and more.
Soles4Souls	48729	4	/users/profile/49909	alvin3	General Member of the Public	1	07/26/2010	I was looking for a charity to help Haiti and came across these guys.  As I do with all charities I looked at their 990 long form from 2007.  In it there is an extraordinary expense for $2,600,000+ (2.6 million dollars plus) for "Concert Expense").  The question is ... how can that be ? Wouldn't that money be better spent in Haiti ? And it brings into question the rest of their activities.That said, apparently they do collect a lot of used shoes.  They must sell them to get the millions of dollars they have on their balance sheet.  Something smells fishy here.
Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	80913		/users/profile/88346	kimela	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2011	The Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation is very important to Tennessee's future, as it is interwoven in Tennessee's historic and proud past. As a former Alvin C. York VAMC employee, I didn't know who Alvin C. York was. One day when roaming the halls of the Murfreesboro Campus, I was told by a veteran that I needed to watch the movie. When I did, it not only made me be proud to be an American, but proud to be from Tennessee. I have recently gone from the ranks of the unemployed to the employed, and plan on taking my grandchildren to Jamestown in the spring to tour the building and homeplace. There are so many places in the United States that have an important history and a legacy for Americans that are not being preserved. I think Sergeant York would be honored knowing that his legacy lives on. Not because of who he was, but because of what he was. A soldier who served his country with honor and courage.

The Sgt. York Patriotic Foundation's goal is to inform people about Stg. Alvin C.

Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	78320		/users/profile/85596	annao	Donor	4	02/27/2011	Reading about Sgt. Alvin York as a youngster made me proud of our American heritage.  I met Claudia Johnson Nichols some time before she became involved with the Sgt. York Foundation.  She was researching a Civil War burial and was very thorough in her work.  This quality of her character will carry over into her work for the foundation.   Sgt. York's later life exemplified his wish to make life better for others.  This foundation will carry forward his wishes.
Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	78140		/users/profile/85410	tnhurricane	Board Member	5	02/26/2011	I have been involved in the effort to rehabilitate the historic York Institute building since the beginning. As one involved in cultural resources management and historic preservation, I view the preservation of this structure as a continuation of Sergeant York's legacy concerning rural education in Tennessee. The Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation (SYPF) has worked diligently, often against great odds, to save the historic York Institute building from demolition. The SYPF is dedicated to preserving the material and cultural legacy of Sergeant York. The building is only a component of this overall effort, but if rehabilitated according to preservation standards, it can stand as a permanent reminder of Sergeant York's core beliefs concerning the education of Tennessee's children, and an example of what can be accomplished by an organization dedicated to its ideals and guiding principles.
Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	78050		/users/profile/85318	kf4gup	Volunteer	5	02/26/2011	Sgt. York has was America's most decorated war hero of World War 1. What he did during battle was an amazing feat that was nothing short of miraculous. However to me his most impressive contribution came when he returned to his home in the 3 Forks of the Wolf in Pall Mall, Tn. He saw that the children in these mountains needed to have a better education and it was his goal to see that this was accomplished. The spirit of Sgt. York and what he stood for still thrives in Tennessee and America....we must continue to keep his legacy alive!

Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	77475		/users/profile/84723	Rebecca	Volunteer	5	02/26/2011	The Sergeant York Institute is an essential component of in-depth study of the American legacy of heroes born of war.   Due in large part to his patriotism and sense of community, Sergeant York provides a real life example of overcoming adversity and championing for what he believe to be right.  The Institute keeps his legacy alive and reminds us that we can be better citizens.  My sincere fear is that, in a day of the "American idol", our youth is losing sight of what has made this country so strong, great and enduring.  We only need look at our past to secure our future - The Sergeant York Institute provides us such an opportunity.    
Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	74084		/users/profile/80949	Angela	Board Member	5	02/23/2011	The Sgt York Patriotic Foundation has been working so very hard to preserve the legacy of Sgt York.  We have been able to obtain and stabilize the original York Institute building which Sgt York founded.  This was his dream - to bring education to the folks in this rural community.    We want to restore the original building and continue his dream.    This building is near and dear to me in many ways.  I graduated from York Institute and attended school in this building.  I have lots of wonderful memories of this building and hope that others will be able to enjoy it in the near future.  It has lots of character.

Alvin C. York. Since then, I have become a member of the Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation and enjoy its valuable help in remembering this man whom many have never known about. It is sad that our schools teach about many cultural heroes, while neglecting true American heroes. We need the SYPF to continue to carry on the legacy of a man about whom we should all know and admire.

The story of his life portrayed in the 1941 film influences countless millions every year portraying the true strength of character and morals he embodied.

He was a country boy who learned from his exposure to people and ideas from places he had never even heard of that the key to success was education and to that end he brought to the mountain people of Tennessee everything they needed to be able to get an education. He built schools, yes, but also the roads to access those schools, churches to guide the morals of the people of the community and yet he remained a honest, sincere man who thought of others before himself.

I am currently the Vice President of the Fentress Co. Historical Society. I helped develop the Scott County Museum. I attended York Institute for 4 years. I am very interested in Sgt York History. I am very proud of his accomplishments during and after WWI. I think the restoration of the original building at York Institute will be an asset to the community and school and especially to the students as a historical building for educational, historical, and community service. It would be a shame to let a historical opportunity like this pass us by.   Sarah Patton Copley

My wife is on the board of directors.  This dynamic group of individuals give so much of themselves to do the things they do.  They should be commended.

Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	66810		/users/profile/73019	Janice	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	In a world full of less than admirable roll models for today's youth (and adults), it is refreshing to see a group of volunteers take on such a huge project for the benefit of those in the community.   The groups' service to the community should be admired.   The building they are working to restore has served well for several generations.  My dad was one of the early students that benefited from the better education provided through his efforts.  I recall many fond memories shared by my dad of his years in high school at York Institute.  Those that were in attendance during my time in high school also appreciated the opportunities offered.  The original building stands in part as a memorial to the efforts of generations past and the determined parents and grandparents that helped make Sgt. York's dream come true.  Bringing a better education to an area that had so little available.  For that reason maybe I'm a little sentimental.  Sometimes, people forget what is important unless they have something they can see and feel to remind them of where others have been.  Our lives don't just count for today.  Most (for better or worse) make an imprint on this world that lasts far beyond our years.  Sometimes we are known for them, sometimes we are anonymous.  The good needs to outshine the bad, giving hope to lives today and beyond.  Providing a positive example.

We are striving to keep the works and dreams of Sgt. Alvin C. York moving forward in this ever changing world we live in.  His efforts to better the lives of the people of this remote area and carry forward the values he held dear are something that we should all be proud of: faith, family and love.  Education for the people of the area was also very important to Sgt. York.  When he went away to war, it became painfully clear to him how a better education would have served him well.  He wanted to give others that same opportunity.   He made this one of his missions when he returned home.  The local institution that proudly bears his name is in great need of restoration.  Much has been done to move the project forward, but more is needed.  The Foundation is actively striving to meet the challenges faced by this task.  You can learn more at www.sgtyork.org.

Our wars have produced a multitude of heroes, but Alvin York stands out even among these select.  This patriotic foundation's vision is to keep his military heroism and civilian spiritual ideals ever visible.

Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	64978		/users/profile/71040	todd jarrell	Volunteer	4	02/08/2011	Awarded the highest military honors of the United States, France, and Italy, Alvin C. York was shy and painfully aware of his very limited education. Believing profit from his heroic yet violent exploits to be immoral, York repeatedly rejected fortunes offered for his commercial product endorsements. Instead, he elected to educate the children of his remote part of Appalachia, offering access to the wider world he had witnessed.  Thus began a decades-long personal, political and financial struggle as York struggled to build, fund and operate his institution for learning in the backwoods of Tennessee. More than once York mortgaged his farm to provide teachers salary, buses and band instruments for the young students of York Agricultural Institute. Hollywood secured Yorks American iconic status. Businesses, state parks, and postage stamps bear Yorks name. But Alvin York is truly significant beyond nostalgia alone, an example of a man who never lost sight of the importance of education and who shunned fortune to further his community.  America needs its heroes, and in the halls of York Institute we find heroes within every graduating class of students who have, for 85 years, owed no small degree of thanks to the man who impoverished his family to bring them the education that so many Americans could simply take for granted. The York school building is his legacya monument to his unselfish visionand a far more accurate indication of the mans loyalty and bravery in the face of adversity than the medals awarded him for his heroic actions under fire.
Sergeant York Patriotic Foundation	64780		/users/profile/70825	Will Beaty	Donor	4	02/08/2011	The legacy of Sgt Alvin C. York is so much more than his brief moment of heroic activity in World War I. That legacy was fueled by his own realization when he was thrust out into a very different world that education and cultural opportunities was the key to any individual's success in life. It was this realization, formed within the context of a new-found Christian faith,  that changed Alvin York's life and gave him a determination to do something about it. Almighty God used the experiences of a terrible war to provide York a platform from which to launch his one-man effort to improve the poor educational conditions in his native county and provide a quality high school education to students who otherwise would simply quit learning once they completed their meager educational opportunities afforded by the neighborhood elementary schools in the area. He worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, inadequate funding and even opposition from the reigning educational system to provide more choices and better opportunities for the youth in Fentress County.  York was also acutely aware that poor roads in his remote county was a contributing factor to improving not only the educational opportunities of youth, but to attracting business and industry, thus providing adults with job opportunities and a better quality of life.  Sgt York believed that everyone should be able to put food on the table and provide for the needs of his family. He never failed to respond to a need of one of his neighbors - providing groceries, transportation, work or a personal loan if necessary to whoever had need. It is this legacy that still needs to be told and it is his inspiration and commitment to these ideals that needs to be caught through his story. The Sgt York Patriotic Foundation is dedicated to sharing this story - to educating youth and adults about the greater purposes for which Alvin C. York gave his life. That's why I support and encourage others to support the Sgt York Patriotic Foundation.

The school and what it represents is as much a part of our heritage as is the Washington Monument or the Lincoln Memorial.  Its preservation is imperative in preserving our culture and the unselfish acts of those who fought both home and abroad to promote and improve those things we hold dear. Sergeant York's school is but one small but greatly significant part of America that must stand forever as a testament to those who need to know the past so that they can be encouraged to seek the correct path to the future.  This is why I have personally chosen to donate significant time and financial resources to this cause.  I encourage others to join me in this effort.  If you need further background and facts to understand the significance of Seargeant York's contributions and sacrifices, just put his name in any search line on your computer.  You will be impressed, as I am.

Sadly, the social upheavals that occurred as a result of our country's involvement in World War One remain a nearly forgotten episode . Sgt. Alvin York personified the ideal of an American.

Enter the Sgt York Patriotic Foundation. They are attempting through  links with direct descendants,the community and many volunteers to correct this national memory loss.

Alvin C. York's post-war life was spent furthering the education of the children in the Pall Mall area, and his efforts still live today throughout the region.  His school still survives, as do his home and many landmarks surrounding his home. His story is a fine example of America at its best, and the Sgt.

York Patriotic Foundation) is committed to furthering the legacy of WWI's greatest American hero, Sgt. Alvin C. York. Part of the mission of this organization is to utilize the school building built by Sgt. York in the 1920's to serve as a multi-use facility serving the greater Upper Cumberland area of Tennessee. Proposed uses are to present an opportunity for other learning institutions in the area to have a large facility available wherein specialized coursework might be taught, to house a museum and learning center in relation to WWI, maintain a facility wherein special exhibits may be displayed for the benefit of the public, and to offer a venue for other events and festivals that honor and promote the legacy of Sgt. Alvin C. York. The school building located in Jamestown, Fentress County, Tennessee is currently in a state of stabilization. The SYPF operates solely upon the donations of interested parties who share the same vision and who assist in saving such an historic landmark as the York Agriculture Institute building. To accomplish this mission will require considerable funds and is not practical to accomplish through private donations alone. To carry out the mission will require several million dollars and every single dollar contributed, donated, or obtained in any manner goes 100% toward the restoration process. The SYPF is to be commended for their efforts to save and preserve a vital piece of American history and to return such a building back to use in serving the public the way it was originally intended. Sgt. York built this school out of an understanding for the need for education for both the children and adults of the Tennessee Upper Cumberland region. His life's mission became not only to build such a school offering such an educational opportunity, but to maintain and perpetuate it for generations to follow. The building currently sits vacant but its future can be secured by those who can also share in the vision of continued educational opportunities such a building can offer. Helping the SYPF and Sgt. York carry on this legacy of educational opportunity would certainly be a worthwhile endeavor.

How wonderful to learn about the effects of homelessness when you are so young.  These youngsters are the future of our society.  What a wonderful way to become aware of others needs.

Additionally, Family Promise provides transportation, parenting classes, financial classes, and the tools for finding jobs as well as sustainable housing.  I am a volunteer at one of the host churches.  So for one week, about 3 times per year, I am able to interact with the families and see their appreciation for the program and hear about the success stories when the next family moves into more permanent housing.  Family Promise provides that life-line and is desparately needed in this community.

The reason this nonprofit is so impactful is because it's focused on relationships.  Family Promise walks beside families, offering them mentoring.  Family Promise also brings together faith communties to host the families so congregants from faith communities can make a difference and also get a different face related to homelessness.  I have served meals with Family Promise and served as an overnight host, and I must say the experiences have given me a different perspective on homelessness and hope that we can make a difference.

FP provides an effective support system that addresses all needs to ensure a successful path to self-sufficiency. The program focuses on giving families a hand up, rather that just a hand out, which enables families not only to succeed in supporting themselves, but also to become contributing members of society.

We have had great support from FP Knoxville during host weeks, and have had the satisfaction of seeing most of the struggling families get back onto their feet, and into housing.  The program is rewarding-our congregation has an almost 50% volunteer rate, with volunteers choosing tasks aligned with their abilities and interests.  It takes a lot of energy to support families getting a hand up in the program, but it is well organized, and FP Knoxville successfully brings in families that will work hard to make permanent changes and stabilize their lives.  I have been privileged to work with Knox Family Promise and to offer the volunteer opportunities to so many people in our congregation.
Family Promise of Knoxville	128034		/users/profile/173161	cbtindell	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	I previously served on the Board of Directors of Family Promise of Knoxville (FPK).  I now work as a volunteer through my church.  FPK serves a unique need in our community.  When people hear "homeless" they think of the guy downtown on the street.  But, homeless means much more to families with children.  It means families being split up when seeking emergency housing.  It means children have trouble getting to and staying in school.  With the help of loving congregations of all denominations, FPK answers that need.  Churches and volunteers offer up unused Sunday School rooms for bedrooms and meeting rooms for meals and homework.  Children get transportation to school.  Most parents work and are able to get to and from work, with the help of a day center for children and parents if needed.  Families are able to stay together.  And, FPK offers daily help to obtain permanent housing.  FLK serves homeless children and their families and helps them get back on their feet.  I help coordinate our church's work, 4 weeks a year.  I have stayed the night with families as a 'host'.  I have enjoyed meals with the families and games with the children.  With FPK, "homeless" to these children and families means having people who don't know them reach out and lift them up.  That's what makes FPK a GREAT non-profit.  
Family Promise of Knoxville	128025		/users/profile/173151	Onward and Upward	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	Family Promise of Knoxville is an inspiring organization that lends a helping hand to families.  It is a joint effort of guests helping themselves, volunteers providing meals and volunteer hours of service, religious organizations and other organizations providing support and shelter, and a dedicated staff -  all working together to provide a stable and safe temporary haven for families who find themselves homeless.  Life can throw boulders in our paths; this program assists families to cope and plan and overcome the adversities they face.  As a volunteer and previous coordinator for a support church, I have observed former guests in the program become volunteers themselves.  I have seen guests grow in confidence and self respect as they faced and solved problems and met their goals of independance.  Time and donations in support of Family Promise of Knoxville are truly well spent!  
Family Promise of Knoxville	128020		/users/profile/173147	MatthewT.	Board Member	5	10/23/2012	I am a recent addition to the Family Promise Board, though I have been aware of their great work for many years.  Family Promise is a fantastic organization led by dedicated social workers and professionals who are driven to empower families and achieve positive and permanent changes.  
Family Promise of Knoxville	128014		/users/profile/173141	Chloie A.	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	Our church has been involved since the start of Family Promise here in Knoxville & we love being a part of this wonderful. The families I have met are incredible!!!!
Family Promise of Knoxville	127980		/users/profile/173106	aoconnor1309	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	I have been part of Family Promise since it was only an idea in Knoxville! As part of the original board of directors, we researched the need in this area and the services that were being provided by other nonprofits. This organization is so different - it serves families that are just going through a hard time - and Family Promise provides a safety net for a few months - until they can get back on their feet.  I have been on the board as well as well as the coordinator at a host site - and the rewards I get from working with the families and kids have been life-changing for me. I always love to see  the relief on the faces of the parents when they realize that they and their children will be safe, when they realize that they will have food and shelter and people surrounding them who love them - and this gives them the time and courage to keep going and solve the problem of housing, employment and transportation. I used to give to lots of nonprofits - but now I like to give to Family Promise because I know what they do and that the money goes directly to services for the families. 
Family Promise of Knoxville	123682		/users/profile/168382	lqualls3	Volunteer	5	09/28/2012	I am a volunteer with Family Promise, and I truly love this organization.  It is rare that a family who needs shelter would be allowed to stay together, since usually shelters are either male or female only.  But at Family Promise a Father can stay with his children and their mother.   The program helps families get back on their feet,  and I believe this is one of the most rewarding aspects of the program.  To see the transformation that happens in some families, from their entry into the program until they move into their own housing.  Family Promise is a program where the family comes first and every action taken is to strengthen those bonds.
Family Promise of Knoxville	123544		/users/profile/168218	Corky C.	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	My wife and I are Family Promise Coordinators for our church.  Family Promise is a belief based non-denominational partnership supported by nearly 30 churches here in Knoxville. This is an amazing program, and I am seeing it work with my own eyes.  I am so prowd to be a part of it.  This program is a helping hand of support for families in despair.  These families have lost any support system they may have had.  They are out there with their children.  Struggling to feed them and with no place to live.  It is desperate situations, and these families are hurting.  Family Promise helps ease the pain by lifting and supporting these families by providing a safe place to stay, food, support, and encouragement.  This is not long term homeless support, but it is a program that helps families to get back on their feet.   My church's involvement is one of support.  We are teamed with an area church  to help support their needs for one week every 3 months as they house families in their church.   The way this works is that an area church houses families for one week at a time Sunday through Saturday.  Family Promise provides beds to the host church, and provides transportation for our guest.  During the day the children go to their schools and the parents go to work or go to the Family Promise Day Center and receive help getting jobs, or other support.  Our guests are then delivered back to the church at 5:30 each evening, and we provide dinner.   After dinner there are activities for the children, homework, movies or any number of things, to be done just like in mine and your homes.  The parents attend financial budgeting and other classes each week.  The support church along with the host church provides the meals and activities for these families.  When our week comes to an end the families are moved to another church, and so on. There are many ways you can help with Family Promise.  From cooking meals, helping with activities, preparing snacks, or breakfast, movies, or other forms of entertainment, reading books to children, helping with homework, or helping financially with needs such as school supplies, diapers, or other needs.  We are desperately trying to raise money for a much needed new day center to support the growing needs. This is a great program.  It has been instrumental in helping so many families rise from the depths of despair.  I ask you to get involved by volunteering or by supporting this ministry financially.  
Family Promise of Knoxville	123449		/users/profile/168108	Andrew N.	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	I served as an intern for Family Promise of Knoxville for about nine months.  During that time I had many great experiences but my favorite experiences were always moving day.  Often I would help the people load and unload on moving day and it was great feeling to see the looks on the faces of the families.  For you and me home is something we to often take for granted.  In reality it is essential for our identity and having a place you can call home means the world to the former guest of Family Promise of Knoxville. 
Family Promise of Knoxville	123218		/users/profile/167839	Gail E	Volunteer	5	09/26/2012	Our church has been a co-host for about 2 years.  We partner with a host church and provide an overnight host, an evening meal and help with Sat. morning breakfast.  I have been impressed with the overall organization of the program. These families have daily access to a social worker and the director of the program. They have weekly meetings that teach them about budgeting, nutrition and parenting. Being a part of a program that has volunteers from many different religions working together has been a real blessing. I look forward to helping for years to come.
Family Promise of Knoxville	122760		/users/profile/167204	bodavis	Volunteer	5	09/21/2012	The Ministry that lies deep within the heart of family promise is a true gift from God. Not only to the family's engaged in the program but to all who serve the community in order to make this program possible. The fellowship that is shared within the true body of Christ is a wonderful thing.  Thanks be to God 
Family Promise of Knoxville	122683		/users/profile/167101	Jonathan12	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/20/2012	I am happy to be a Pastor of a church who hosts families of Family Promise.  It is a joy to be part of this life changing organization.  I had a chance to see a family, a single mother with two young children, move into an apartment after staying in Family Promise for several months.  They were so excited to get back on their feet with some tools (weekly seminars from professionals in the community), furniture to furnish the place, and a new scooter.
Family Promise of Knoxville	122666		/users/profile/167082	Linda108	Volunteer	5	09/20/2012	I have been volunteering for Family Promise since our church began the service about two years ago.  What an organized group!  They have every "I" dotted and every "T" crossed.  They do not push me to do more than I am able and are always so appreciative of my time spent with the families.  This group doesn't just "go through the motions."  They live and breathe Family Promise.  It is just a part of them, and the families are always so grateful for the help.
Family Promise of Knoxville	122616		/users/profile/167009	hshoudy	Volunteer	5	09/19/2012	I am a Volunteer who spends time at our Church when Family Promise's families spend nights during our week where we have the families housed overnight in our Sunday School rooms.   I usually stay one night  and in the morning make breakfast for the families.  Without the support of Host congregations these homeless families would probably be spending every night in their cars (if they have one).  Family Promise tries to take in these families and have them into housing within 60 days.  The families spend the day time at the Day Center where they use computers to find jobs, housing, support, etc (after training by Family Promise Social Workers) so they can move out of the program.  Without Family Promise these Homeless Families would be still homeless and in very stressful situations.  They have a large list of additional families that need their help but due to not having a larger Day Center Family Promise cannot help these additional families.  Family Promise of Knoxville does a very good job of helping Homeless Families in the Knoxville area.
Family Promise of Knoxville	122520		/users/profile/166862	Donnie M.	Volunteer	5	09/18/2012	What a life saving organization this is.  Our church is one of the home churches who houses these lucky clients.  The families are so very grateful to Family Promise... otherwise, they would be living in their cars or on the street with their little children.  Family Promise gives them a chance to get back on their feet and regain their pride and lives.  I just wish it were a bigger organization as I know there is a waiting list of needy families.... how heart breaking for the people at Family Promise to have to turn people away who are so in need.   They are truly life savors!

Layman Lessons Church Ministries	311343	1	/users/profile/353453	philandjulie	Volunteer	5	10/17/2016	Layman Lessons Church Ministries is ALL about helping those who need it the most. At the helm is Louie who has given all he has to help the homeless people find hope and be fed and clothed.  His mission is single-focused: to glorify Jesus with his life by helping those that others choose not to see.

I highly recommend this ministry to anyone looking for volunteer opportunities to help provide food, clothing, rescue blankets, etc. to those in need.  Come and share the blessings of being the hands and feet of Jesus...serving Him by serving others!
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	261407	3	/users/profile/350016	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/03/2015	I have been a volunteer with this ministry for over 4 years and am so blessed to be a part of what God calls us to do to feed the hungry, clothe the naked and give that cup of cold water in Jesus name. Layman Lessons coordinates with other agencies to provide food, clothing, bottled water and rescue blankets to the homeless and needy.  This ministry provides a wonderful opportunity for you to serve God by serving others.  I highly recommend it!
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	306686	2	/users/profile/397974	JimmyJoe	Volunteer	5	09/27/2016	 I have worked with Layman Lessons for approximately 12  years as a volunteer/board member on projects such as Campus for Human Development, creating boxes of love, feeding homeless on the streets of Nashville, and serving Thanksgiving dinners for the homeless.  Louie Johnston does an outstanding job with limited resources to offer a compassionate hand to many of the down trodden people in the Nashville community.
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	306334	2	/users/profile/279096	DCDC	Donor	5	09/23/2016	I have worked alongside Louie Johnston and Layman Lessons since 2008 and have seen the tremendous impact on the lives of the poor and needy in Middle Tennessee.  The organization has no paid staff and depends on volunteers so the dollars donated truly go to those in need.
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	215660	3	/users/profile/279096	DCDC	Donor	5	09/18/2014	My wife and I  have been supporters of Layman Lesson's both through financial donations as well as volunteering our time since 2006.  Louie Johnston and the army of Layman Lessons volunteers work tirelessly on behalf of the homeless and those less fortunate.  Whether it is a desperate plea for shelter, organizing food donations, or providing skills necessary to find a job, Louie Johnston is ALWAYS willing to assist.  I wholeheartedly endorse the work of Layman Lessons and in particular the servant leadership of Louie Johnston.  
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	306327	2	/users/profile/397585	bettyburnsed	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2016	Layman Lessons feeds the hungry with NO PAID STAFF.  100% of donations goes to feed hungry bellies and clothe cold bodies.  I highly recommend this ministry!
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	305793	2	/users/profile/397069	sstrange	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	I've watched Louie Johnston, Jr.  of Laymen Lessons work tirelessly over the ten + years that I've known him to make sure the homeless have food, shelter, warm blankets and spiritual healing.  I've attended dinners where we serve the homeless, charitable events to raise money to carry on the work of Laymen Lessons.  I've been particularly impressed that there are no paid staff members or federal funds supporting this charity.  Of all the charities I've worked with out there, there's not one that accomplishes the magnitude of support for the homeless as Layman Lessons under the leadership of Louie Johnston, Jr.
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	305781	2	/users/profile/331790	Freida W.	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	I came to Layman's Lessons as a volunteer. In 2014. All I did was help to serve the homeless for Thanksgiving as well as Christmas. The grateful glow in our homeless guests eyes and the humble humility they expressed as we served them still touches my heart today. My simple smile and God Bless you for every guest I served just seemed to warm these people. The founder and CEO of Layman's lessons, Louie Johnston gave up his personal Fortune entirely in order to give back to the people on the street as well as and including homeless veterans. In 2015 Louie Johnston asked me to join Layman's lessons in the women's ministry. I have been blessed to be able to give counsel to homeless women facing many heart rending challenges. I interview these women to determine how best to assist them  and their children by gathering facts about their lives including job skills, what they like to do and how they got where they are and what they are willing to do to prevent being in the situation again.  Sometimes I have to be pretty frank and upfront but we always begin and end with prayer. All of the candidates are advised Layman's Lessons is a Christian organization and if the applicant is willing to follow biblical procedures; we will do everything we can to help with food, clothing, shelter and even rehabilitation though we will not guide them to a detox facility because detox is a quick fix with only a 15% success rate. There are those who believe that is harsh but Layman's Lessons is a hands up organization. Not a hand out organization. We provide food, water, clothing and cold weather survival gear for the lost souls on the street. I will continue to help Laymans lessons in any way that I can. The other Ministry that I was a part of turned out to be a false Ministry. There was personal gain and profit for many of the people who were on staff. Volunteers were ill treated and contracts and promises were broken with little regard to the volunteers.  However; Layman's Lessons is strictly volunteer labor with no pay or compensation to any of the members including Louie Johnston the founder and CEO of laymans lessons. Louie gave up his personal fortune in order to give back to the people on the street.  I love working with Louie and his other volunteers. I will do so as long as I am needed. Louie gave up millions, won't you help by giving a little of your time or money? God Bless you all, Freida Warren

I was blown away by the Christian love given to those who might not otherwise have a hand up.  Since then I've joined the Women's Ministry Team and am a voting board member. I'm proud to share my time and talents to help lead these lost souls to Jesus and hopefully lend a hand up so they can turn their lives around. We feed the poor,  shelter the homeless and clothe the naked. Just as we are directed to do and I'm the better for it.

Layman's Lessons is 100% about helping the down and out.  Few ministries achieve as much for zero compensation. Faith walk from A to Z. The need is out there. This nonprofit is getting the job done. Day in and day out providing food to the homeless and hurting.

It's amazing how faithful this team and it's helpers have been week after week, rain or shine.They provide a spiritual connection for men and women who don't always get the opportunity to connect with God with others.The leadership welcomes new volunteers at any time and is determined that each person sees how integral their part was to the whole work.I don't know many organizations led by someone who actually sold their earthly possessions to go help the poor. This is one.I'm thankful they are part of our community.
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	57086	1	/users/profile/59949	Lynne	Donor	5	11/16/2010	Layman Lessons, Inc. is led by one of the most in-tune, in-touch and informed individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Louie Johnston's personal crusade has evolved into a thriving outreach which ministers to Music City's homeless in a myriad of pivotal ways.  Through Layman Lessons and Louie's many friends and crucial sponsors, 100s of the streets' homeless and hopeless have been clothed, fed hot meals and received much-needed encouragement and Christian counsel.  The homeless who are touched by the Layman Lessons experience, consistently witness, and have the opportunity to receive, the love of Jesus Christ through Louie and the many  mentors, volunteers and donors who ensure Layman Lessons' Saturday services are a weekly reality.

As a volunteer I worked with Louie Johnston on Saturday's as his group ministered to the homeless or street people.  They were fed, clothed and ministered to no matter what their circumstances with no questions asked and nothing required except to be respectful of those around them during the service.  Louie has a passion for the work and a love for his fellow man as he serves with tireless energy everyday to make their life a little better than he found it.

Layman Lessons Church Ministries	56601	1	/users/profile/59200	Kristie U.	Volunteer	5	11/09/2010	 A few years ago, I went with the church I was attending and we took bottles of water and shoes to Layman Lessons Ministries. I  never thought that helping the homeless would be what I would enjoy doing. I thought that  I was going to be blessing these people.  Before my time was even over serving that morning, I realized I was the one being blessed, it was my life being changed. Now, I go as often as I can and this ministry is simply beautiful. Not only are they given a cold cup of water, a hot cup of coffee and a hot meal.. but  a sack lunch to go, clothes from the clothing bus, the word of God and the feeling of knowing that they matter to someone!Mr. Louie Johnston has put his everything into this ministry for almost the last eight years.  The ministry has been ran solely on donations, which are scare.  Rain, shine, snow... Louie is operating this mobile homeless ministry on Saturday mornings and every other day of the week he is training men to become  self sufficient. The ones that stay with the program are learning living skills, and holding jobs.  It has been such an honor to volunteer with this ministry. 
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	56574	1	/users/profile/59162	Kaybee968	Board Member	5	11/09/2010	I have had the privilege of being involved with Laymen Lessons, Inc. since 2003.  I serve on the board and for 4 years was involved in the day to day ministry with the homeless in the streets of Nashville.  Louie Johnston and his team of tireless volunteers give of themselves physically, spiritually and financially to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the homeless of Nashville.  From feeding them a hot meal,   providing clothing and sharing the free gift of salvation every Saturday morning year round whether blazing hot or freezing cold,  sack lunches to get them through another hungry night,  bottled water to quench their physical thirst, to providing a home for those who choose to start a new life with job training, life skills and learning to live as a contributing member of society, Laymen Lessons provides all this and more.  Noone, including the director are paid workers.  All contributions are turned right around and used to feed, clothe and shelter the homeless.  Giving to this ministry could help save a life!  If you are in the Nashville area, I encourage you to stop down at the parking lot some Saturday morning and see Christianity in action.  Your life will be changed!  I watched my 12 year old daughter take off her shoes and give them to a lady who could barely walk because her feet were so swollen and infected from walking because she had no shoes.  What an incredible moment to see my little girl be Jesus in the life of someone else.  
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	56569	2	/users/profile/59155	Jack O.	Volunteer	4	11/09/2010	Layman Lessons is a ministry that helps to feed and clothe the poor right here in Nashville Tennessee. I have been involved with the ministry over the past year and really believe what they are doing. By feeding the poor and homeless six days a week and distributing clothing they have made life a little bit easier for those less fortunate.
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	56566	2	/users/profile/59148	Chuck	Volunteer	5	11/09/2010	Layman Lessons of Nashville has  been a blessing to 1000s of homeless men and women over the 9 years they have operated in Nashville.  I have volunteered each Saturday for 3 years to work with this ministry to serve the homeless.  We provide them a wonderful hot meal, clothing and message of hope through the Gospel each Saturday.I have had the men and women come to me after we are done and thank me for a wonderful meal and church service.  I have counseled men who responded to the church message and watched them express concerns and hopes for the future.  The message they give me usually revolves around wanting to re-unite with family; stop an addiction; or find a job.  We pray together and then sit them down so we can serve them a hot meal.  It is important to understand that during the 3 hours they are with us we serve them, they stay seated, enjoy the music or mediate and we bring them water, coffee and their meal, they do not wait in line, we want to show them respect and appreciation for them being with us.  
Layman Lessons Church Ministries	56564	2	/users/profile/59142	acfrizzell	Volunteer	4	11/09/2010	I became a volunteer for Laymen Lessons back in Nov of 2009.

The Restoration House of East Tennessee	242143	1	/users/profile/328894	Erica51	Donor	5	05/05/2015	The Restoration House is an amazing nonprofit.  I have met some of their single mothers and they are truly an inspiration.  Daniel and Mandy are the most selfless people I know.  What they are doing to change family trees is indescribable.  Daniel and Mandy are helping single mothers break the cycle of hopelessness and poverty by providing resources and counseling all in the name of Christ in their daily mission at The Restoration House.  I have been honored to be involved with The Restoration House and am excited to see what the future holds for The Restoration House. Acts 20:35-In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.

The Restoration House of East Tennessee	179324		/users/profile/235967	Vicki A.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	 I have been involved with TRH in a few different ways since it first began. Since July of this year I have been able to take a more active role by working directly with the staff in the TRH offices and have been able to see things on a much deeper level. TRH gives the single moms and their children an opportunity to truly change the coarse of their lives. The help and support they offer to these ladies has helped many of them obtain a dream they never thought would be possible. TRH along with the family mentor teams have been able to show not only the moms but their children as well that they are loved and should never give up hope on the endless possibilities that are within their reach. I was a single my mom myself many years ago and can tell you from experience the difference this program would have made in my life. I pray that God will continue to bless TRH to his fullest.
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	173796		/users/profile/229945	tregen	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I began volunteering for TRH at the beginning of this year after attending their annual fundraising luncheon. Not only do I volunteer but I am a donor as well because I believe in the mission of TRH and the love and direction guiding Daniel and Mandy Watson as they work towards "restoring single mothers back to God's good intent for their lives".  They do not just pay lip service to this mission, they walk these mothers and their children through all aspects of life whether it is education, financial, parenting, job search, spiritually or whatever it is going to take to get these mothers to a place in their lives that they are going to be able to care and provide for their themselves and their children, independent of TRH.Volunteers for TRH are highly appreciated and Daniel and Mandy are so easy yet professional to work with. I have thoroughly enjoyed and am honored to serve in a small part of  this growing non-profit.

They do things the right way and provide such a fantastic opportunity for personal growth and professional development so that these young women can not only provide for their families but also so they can excel at life.  I continue to be impressed with their vision and the plan for growth to be able to help more people.

The Restoration House of East Tennessee	160602	1	/users/profile/212941	Jessica118	Client Served	5	06/13/2013	My Name is Jessica. My son, Zander, was born when I was 19 years old. I worked 60hr+ a week to maintain a house, bills, & being a single mother. I lost my job due to "down sizing". My car broke down, I quickly lost my apartment, & to top it off I couldn't find another job so I had to move in with my mother... after a nervous breakdown one night I googled "help for single mothers in TN" & The Restoration House website was the first one I saw. Being the skeptic I am, I continued to search but nothing offered the "holistic care" as TRH did. So I called... The meeting was set up the next day, & I made plans for a ride to Knoxville (I lived 6 hrs west of there) After interviews & a ton of questions TRH accepted my son & I, not only into the program, but into their family. My mentors were more helpful & inspiring than I ever imagined & the staff made the transition a breeze. I learned so much about myself, my son, my role as a parent, & that good selfless people really do exist. I was able to attend a CNA class, get my CNA license, & find a job that made me realize how much i LOVE nursing while being a Single Mother of TRH! After a year at TRH, I was accepted into a Nursing program near my hometown. Graduating TRH was bitter sweet. Bitter because we had to leave our friends & family in Knoxville, but sweet because that was what they had encouraged me to work so hard for.  April 19th of this year I walked down the isle & received my first ever college diploma! I will take the State test for my LPN licence very soon!! My TRH family may not have been able to make in person that night, but their cheers & praise still rang threw my head as if they were in the front row. The experiences I had during my time at TRH are like no other, I met celebrities, went on a Florida vacation, got to be on TV for goodness sakes... but out of every new adventure I had at The Restoration House, the most rewarding part had to have been meeting the staff, my mentors, & the other mothers. I think about them daily & love every chance we get to catch up! I cant wait until I am able to give back to them & to the single mothers of TRH's future! This Non Profit changed my life, as well as my sons... & WE LOVE THEM ALLL! 
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	113410		/users/profile/154332	Jeanne12	Donor	5	05/31/2012	I became involved in The Restoration House as a donor (since I live 8 hours away) when I heard and read about the GREAT things they do for single moms trying to get back on their feet to make a better life for their children.  I give as often as I can -- and have been the recipient of donations in my name.  They fulfill dreams -- with God's help.
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	113406		/users/profile/154326	kevin.reeve	Donor	5	05/31/2012	I am a donor and a former volunteer mentor for the Restoration House of East Tennessee (TRH).  My family is passionate about TRH and its work because it fills a vital and much needed role in the Knoxville area in helping low-income single mothers and their families.  They do this through providing housing, practical life-skills training, mentoring, and encouragement.  Since its inception, we have seen lives dramatically changed through TRH's work, both on the recipient side as families have been empowered and transformed, as well as on the donor/volunteer side.  It is a tremendous privilege and blessing to be able to support this organization.  Daniel and Mandy Watson are peerless in their commitment to helping this important segment of our community, and TRH's staff, volunteer mentors and providers, board members and community partnerships together create a powerful support web that is truly making positive, life-altering differences in East Tennessee.
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	113401		/users/profile/154319	Eva P.	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/31/2012	It has been my pleasure to work with Daniel and Mandy Watson and The Restoration House since they first began laying the ground work for their ministry. I was impressed from the start because they were intentional about assessing the work of effective ministries already in the area. This was an effort to not duplicate services but to fill gaps. Their philosophy of walking alongside single moms and their children over the long-term to give them time to make positive, permanent changes meshes well the that of my own. 
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	112537	1	/users/profile/40136	carolreeve	Board Member	5	05/21/2012	I have been intimately involved with The Restoration House in many ways -- as a strategic planner who assisted in its initial formation, then later as a mentor, donor and board member. I have worked with more than 60 nonprofit organizations in my career, and this one stands out among them all... for the humble brilliance of its Executive Director, the research supporting the need for and effectiveness of its programming model and the commitment of its board, mentors, partners and surrounding community. The Restoration House does more than support low-income single mothers at a critical time; TRH helps stop the negative cycles that got them there... providing a brighter future for these moms and their children. The organization is a blessing to each individual who touches it..
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	39186	4	/users/profile/40136	carolreeve	Volunteer	5	05/17/2010	The Restoration House of East Tennessee is a remarkable organization that strives to break the negative cycles that lead a woman down the path to becoming a low-income single mom. TRH doesn't just meet physical needs; the program includes a team of mentors to help encourage, build self-esteem and provide direction to these young women. The result is a true life change for these mothers and their children. TRH is tackling this chronic issue the only way it can be effectively addressed with lasting impact... one family at a time.
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	112479	1	/users/profile/153089	sby2012	Volunteer	5	05/20/2012	After serving as a volunteer and a mentor, I would like to compliment this ministry in their endeavors to serve single mothers.  I feel that they are meeting a much needed gap in services to these moms and are doing so in a God centered environment.  They are assisting these moms in learning to become self-sufficient rather than encouraging them to rely on others for their needs. 
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	112212	1	/users/profile/152677	Valerie R.	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	I am a mentor to a young single Mom with a 3 year old son. I basically am available as her friend, and for help when she needs. We have gone on outings to the Smokey Mountain National Park, boating on the lake, gone shopping, and have had dinner at my house with my family and other friends. She has needed to attend school in the evenings, and has to work on some weekends. One of my roles as mentor was that I was in charge of coordinating babysitting for her during these times. I truly enjoyed taking care of her son, but if I wasn't able to, I had a list of other mentors that were able to help when needed. 
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	112200	1	/users/profile/152663	Robin L.	Volunteer	5	05/16/2012	Being a mentor for Restoration House has been one of the most rewarding experiences I have had.  I was very impressed early in the interviewing process with the "hand up" approach Restoration House takes.  The single moms that are accepted into the program must be willing to follow the rules and guidelines set up by the program, such as having a part time job, working toward their education, going to classes on managing finances etc..  They must buy into the concept of the program.  Restoration House is not a "hand out".  It is an opportunity for a single mom to actively engage in seeking a better life for she and her children.  Once I was accepted as a mentor, and met my single mom and her little boy, the whole experience became totally personal!  I was able to witness the strenght  and determination of a 21 year old mom to make a new start for her family.  She was able to get a job, enroll her son in day care and  begin night classes in nursing.  Even when juvenile diabetes was discovered in her 2 year old, she persevered!  After one year, she is now out of the program and in LPN school.  As a mentor, I was able to be there for her by taking them to the pediatric doctors, and being that extra set of eyes and ears when hearing about the diagnosis and treatment of Juvenile Diabetes.  I also helped her with decorating her apartment and turning it into a "home".  We searched flea markets and yard sales and made  a little go a long way!  Lots of times we would just meet for lunch and talk about how things were going, and what she saw in the future.  Baby sitting the 2 year old was always fun.  It gave me my "baby time" and much needed time off for the mom, or time to go to night class.  I can not say enough about Restoration House!  It essentially gives a struggling mom the support that allows her to be the best that she can be, for herself and for her children!  I have been very blessed to be able to be a small part of this program.

While we joined this organization to assist where we could, we have been richly blessed. This wonderful organization is not a handout, but rather a helpful program that helps mothers with useful tools, training and skills to be a success story and not just a statistic.  With God, all things are possible. 
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	112087	2	/users/profile/152515	sailmaker	Board Member	5	05/15/2012	Mentoring at it's finest!!  The single family mothers and their children have multiple mentors that coach in the areas of spiritual needs, finance, organizing the home, support for the children, etc.  The success for the families is the commitment to stay in the program for two years.  This instills lifetime habits that help the mothers into the future.  A truly mission driven organization!!  
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	112046	2	/users/profile/152465	Jody G.	Board Member	5	05/14/2012	I started helping out, donating a little time and money, then got to see what TRH was all about. The difficulty in dealing with single moms in tough circumsatnces was incredible to watch.  It's a dirty ministry, lots of tough love, difficult decisions, and rewarding results. It's great to see the impact TRH has in our community. One of the most effective organizations I've ever been a part of. 
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	41137	3	/users/profile/42021	jacob-emily	Volunteer	5	05/27/2010	TRH is such a blessing to everyone who gets involved. From the clients to the volunteers to the public everyone is touched by this ministry. TRH is a place where single parent families can come to learn and grow in a way that helps them reach their full potential. They are surrounded by a network of support that allows them to take control of their future and the future of their family. As a young Mom myself, I can understand the deep need for support and encouragement at a time when everything is on your shoulders. TRH provides this and so much more! I am proud to be a volunteer whenever they need me!
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	41043	1	/users/profile/41944	nicole9	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/27/2010	I have had experience with TRH through its connection with many members of my faith community who volunteer and participate in TRH's many programs.  I have also known a young mother who was referred to the program and who is currently in the intake process.What I have observed is that TRH provides a transformational experience for single mothers and their children. By providing not only housing, but job training, mentorship, support, love, and care for up to 2 years,  TRH succeeds in its mission of supporting single moms to go beyond surviving to thriving. TRH is an open, honest, and heartfelt operation.  They truly love and care for single mothers, but also have clear boundaries, expectations, and goals for their work with single mothers. The result is that they are very effective in helping those who desire to be helped with an efficient use of resources, resulting in amazing transformation for single mothers in a way that few other organizations achieve.As a Clinical Psychologist, this is the type of intervention I support and find effective for the population that TRH serves.  I so strongly believe in their mission and their ability to achieve it that I donate my own money to their mission.
The Restoration House of East Tennessee	39502	4	/users/profile/40455	ccovert	Board Member	5	05/19/2010	Our family's direct and continuing  involvement with young mothers and their children led us to see the need for broader, deeper, more holistic long-term solutions rather than quick and temporary pseudo-fixes. TRH is filling an important gap well, and there is much more to accomplish.

The Restoration House of East Tennessee	1958	4	/users/profile/3108	Fludder	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2008	I am currently in the infant stage of learning about The Restoration House, however; my experiences so far have lead me to believe that God just might have a purpose for me here.  I had heard about The Restoration House through Mandy and Daniel Watson at church a few times and thought it sounded like a wonderful idea.  It wasn't until I came to the fundraiser breakfast earlier this week that I realized the magnitude of what this place is doing for our future.  The staggering statistics of the affects of single-mother homes on children literally ripped my heart out.  Even when these mothers are doing their best, without the support of others, these mothers and, especially these children, are suffering - and most of them don't even know it.I am so excited to be able to be a part of this wonderful program that God has placed in my path.
Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	202817		/users/profile/158758	johnhc	Volunteer	5	06/13/2014	We have came along ways in four years. Our family assistance program has gained more and more popularity. We get referrals for all of the major children's hospitals throughout Tennessee. We also continue to provide funding to families that have been referred to us by The American Cancer Society. We have provided our testicular awareness program to over 5000 students. We do numerous fund raiser throughout the year to raise funds to support our mission. We are in the process of getting our name out in hopes we can become a nationally recognized charity. I am also proud of the fact that we have accomplished everything that we have done with an all volunteer staff. We have no paid employees so 100% of every dollar raised is put to work helping others. All of our staff work extremely hard and I want to commend each and every one of them.
Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	116627	3	/users/profile/158758	johnhc	Board Member	5	06/26/2012	This foundation has made a tremendous difference to many different families who have called upon us for help. We have funded travel and lodging expenses as they seek treatments for their child. We have eased the pain of worrying about how they were going to get the money they needed to travel and a place to stay. We have two families that are traveling to MD Anderson in Houston Texas from Tennessee. And have been told by one of them that they would not know what they would have done if it hadn't been for us. We are making a difference and will continue to do so as long as we are able. We also have developed an educational program that has been placed in 125 schools. This program stresses the importance of self exam for testicular cancer. Early detection is the key to survival. We provide these program free of charge. We are also proud of the fact that all of our Board Members, Officers and Staff Volunteer their time so all proceeds raised goes directly toward doing to foundations work.

I am a Social Worker at a Major Children's Hospital. I have referred several families to this foundation. They go above and beyond to make sure these families get the help they need. Mr. and Mrs. Coleman know first hand the hardships of dealing with a child that has been diagnosed with cancer. The financial burden that these families experience is overwhelming. I don't know of another organization that offer the services that they provide.

Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	175195	2	/users/profile/159355	Nikki Peek	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	The Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation has been helping kids all over Tennessee for three years now. They never turn any child away that is battling cancer. They know what it is like to have a child in the hospital and be very low on funds and really just scared on what the next day will bring! As a volunteer for the BCCF I get very passionate about these kids and what we are trying to achieve as a whole. We want to help families in need! To ease their burden as much as possible. By sending them money monthly they know that they will have the money to take their children to the hospital for treatments or whatever it is that they need most! This year our church hosted our first 5K Run, Missionary Grove Presents, Run For The Kids for the Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation. It was so awesome seeing so many people come out to support this great cause and knowing 100 % of all money raised went directly to all these families with children battling cancer! I personally am so thankful for The Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation. Even though we did lose Brad, a part of him will live on through this foundation and helping these children! God Bless!

He had a heart of pure gold, and went above and beyond to help anyone who needed his help! This Foundation is doing the same thing. The Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation is helping so many children and their families right now, by knowing first hand the struggles families face while battling Cancer. The Trips to the Doctors, Hospital stays, and Food? It gets so expensive. This Foundation CARES! It KNOWs what these Kids and their Families are going through! It strives to put the word out there  and Educate people on Testicular Cancer Awareness! God Bless each and every member of the Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation!!! They are doing an amazing Job!

Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	127844	1	/users/profile/172957	LinnieB.	Donor	5	10/23/2012	It amazes me how so many big named non-profits accepts millions on dollars of donations each year in the name of cancer. Yet when a family calls them for help they get referred to the Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation. This foundation receives only a drop in the bucket of donations compared to the big named non-profits, but they have never turned a family away thats need help. This is what sets this foundation apart from all the rest 100% of every dime raised is put to work by helping others not paying the salaries of the ones that work there. They have no paid employees. Currently they have nine different families that they are helping on a monthly basis. Five of which were referred by larger non-profits. Something is wrong with this picture. I give my charity donations to this foundation because I know fist hand what they are about and I have seen their work in action.
Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	118487	1	/users/profile/161147	Santana S.	Volunteer	5	07/16/2012	This foundation is a inspiration to those in need. As a family member of Brads, I seen the struggle that Aunt Sheila and Uncle John went through to make sure Brad got the treatment he needed. Unfortunately, we didn't get the outcome we had hoped and prayed for. But through this foundation, they can help ease the stress and financial struggles the families go through. They also are helping get the light shone on the type of cancer it self. So much research and light has been shined on other kinds of cancer but this one type you never hear about. And personally i think its great that as a small town foundation, its getting the attention that it deserves.
Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	118126	5	/users/profile/160657	SusanB.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/11/2012	In my profession as a Social Worker I see the need every day that the families of children with cancer have. The uncertainty of the outcome of the treatments the child is receiving. The financial burden that is imposed on the parents as they seek these treatments. Travel and lodging expenses are a huge problem. This foundation has been instrumental to the families that have been referred to them. Their response has been swift and in one case that I am aware of it was in the same day. This is almost unheard of and I commend them for the work they do, the passion they show to each and every family they support, and their willingness to provide the much needed assistance that gives these families some peace of mind in an already upsetting situation
Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	117390	4	/users/profile/159619	Dr.A	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/30/2012	The role in the community that this foundation provides is essential to the families of children that have been diagnosed with cancer. The support that they provide is much needed. Most of the support and donations given in the name of cancer goes mostly toward research and to hospitals like St Jude's and Monroe Carroll Children's hospitals. It seems that the cancer patients and their families have all been forgotten in the process. One thing that we have to remember when we are donating is that in order to use the new treatments that have been developed through the money donated to research is we have to get these patents to the facilities to receive the treatments. This is where this foundation steps in and provides the funds that no one else does. From what I've seen and read about this foundation they get these children to and from the treatment facilities so they can utilize the most advance treatments available. I recommend that everyone think about the money they donate and not just automatically give it to research and to Hospitals and think about giving a portion of your donations to foundations like this one.
Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	117367	2	/users/profile/159595	cfradio	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/30/2012	Most of the time on Cancer Free Radio, the cancer prevention dialogue focuses on breast cancer and how women can take preemptive measures to improve survival due to early detection. I think, as a gender, women tend to be more likely to investigate health concerns and to seek guidance from other women and health advisors. Thats why I definitely wanted to highlight this resource. Sadly, the creation of this foundation was prompted by the loss of teenager, Brad Coleman, to testicular cancer. My guess is that few families sit their young sons down and explain to them that they need to check their parts with scrutiny on a regular basis, as a normal personal health check. This foundation helps to make this life saving early detection message one that can be delivered and heeded by young men.      - Julie Joyce, Exec. Producer & Host, Cancer Free Radio

Brad Coleman Cancer Foundation	114179	1	/users/profile/155367	RTurner	Board Member	5	06/07/2012	This foundation is about helping sick children and their families. The idea for it came from a mother and father that experienced the trials of battling childhood cancer with their son. After losing their son, they began to realize how much they had learned that they hadn't known. They realized that much of the needed information was not readily available.They knew how challenging the battle becomes both financially and emotionally. This foundation is about offering that little bit of help that can help ease the financial and emotional stress. Its about educating children so they recognize warning signs. Its about supplying that one piece of information that is so desperately needed.

I have seen many people helped by the tireless effort of its director and found Carol Conduff.  I have been involved with non-profit organizations most of my career.  This by far, is the best I have ever seen.  Helping people with severe back pain and debilitating illnesses related to spine health is the Founder and Board members highest priority.  This foundation provides help and hope to those that cannot afford the high level care needed and who have lost all hope.  This non-profit organization saves lives!!!!

I also serve on two other medically related boards. The SHF is directed by Carol Conduff who founded the organization after experiencing severe back problems herself. She does so with compassion, transparency, and skill which has been noticed and abetted by many in the medical community as well civic leaders. SHF's use of resources is the most efficient I have seen with virtually all of the raised funds directed toward patient care. SHF should indeed be rated in the top tier of non-profit organizations.

The Spine Health Foundation, Inc.	309742	1	/users/profile/401096	Susan506	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2016	The Spine Health Foundation, founded by Carol Conduff, is an organization that specifically helps people with spine issues.  This is a nonprofit dedicated to helping disadvantaged individuals who suffer with untreated spinal injuries or disorders gain access to specialized spine care.  The organization was founded in 2010 by Carol Conduff because of her own spinal issues and personal painful experiences.  Spine Health is the number one cause of disability worldwide.  People who become disabled are 71% more likely to become poverty stricken.  The Spine Health Foundation helps everyone by providing awareness and education about the spine.  So far, the Spine Health Foundation has provided help and funds for at least 700 medically related resources and 28 spine surgeries.  The Spine Health Foundation can be found on Facebook, Twitter, and its official website.  Derby Days is a fundraiser that Spine Health Foundation has every year if you are interested in helping this organization.  The organization is primarily in the Tri-Cities region (Kingsport, Bristol, and Johnson City, Tennessee) and serves this region well by helping with insurance problems and funding for spine injuries.  This nonprofit far exceeds expectations for its ethical purpose, goals, objectives, and tactics in this region of Tennessee.

I had the pleasure of speaking with founder Carol Conduff and learning more about the organization. Their commitment to helping individuals with spinal cord injuries and disorders, especially those who cannot afford or do not have access to the latest medical treatment is driven by a passion that only those who have walked in similar shoes can have. Presented with the opportunity to raise awareness about spinal health, as well as funds to support the organization's work, Ms. Conduff did not hesitate. She wrote a thoughtful and compelling article on the financial and emotional costs of chronic back pain to share during Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month.  I look forward to working with this organization in the future, as they provide encouragement and practical help to individuals who often feel unheard and alond.

I feel so amazing and I wouldnt be like this if it wasnt for the foundation. I especially want to thank Carol  for everything she has done to help me. She is so compassionate and I could tell she earnestly cared about me and finding a way for me not to hurt any longer. She has such a sweet heart and personality. I believe that God brought her into my life and I know He did because within the first month or so I got the surgery that I had needed all along. She had all of the right connections and loving heart to do so. Thank you so much Carol! I would also like to thank Dr. Lorio for doing my surgery and taking the time out to talk to me and get things in line such as the disc itself and my surgery. He didnt have to do any of it but he did and that means the world to me. He really cares about his patients and especially made me feel comfortable the first time that my mother and I met him. He is a very honest, straight forward, and welcoming person and he did a wonderful job with my surgery. I feel like a new person. It means so much to me that you did this Dr. Lorio. Thank you! None of this would have been possible if it wasnt for the Spine Health Foundation. My life is now back to what it once was and I am very appreciative of what you ALL have done for me.

If it wasn't for Carol and the Spine Health Foundation as well as Dr. Ken Smith I don't know what I would have done. I am still recovering and have some pain but not at the level I was prior to surgery.

She offered to assist in making appointments with a specialist and in only two days  we had an appointment that would usually take weeks to get, and even got the cost lowered so that we could afford to go. Had it not been for Carol and the work she does with the Spine Health Foundation, we would still be putting off appointments because of being unable to pay, and unsure that we were making the right decisions. To those of you who already support this wonderful cause Bless You and Thank You, You will never know the difference it makes knowing there is someone there to turn to  and that it is a blessing, to those who are considering becoming part of the Foundation Family.  Please understand that your time and financial support will not be wasted.    We are so thankful of the Faith,Love and Support we have received from The Spine Health foundation.

Her passion to help those with spinal injuries that otherwise could not afford medical services is heartwarming and inspiring. At the most recent Derby Day fundraiser for Spine Health Foundation, we heard a testimony from the wife of a patient who would soon be receiving surgery through the foundation. The story brought tears to my eyes as she recounted the difficult journey she and her husband had been through and the blessing they received by meeting Carol. It is an honor to be involved with this organization and Carol.
The Spine Health Foundation, Inc.	248472	1	/users/profile/336194	OTinTN	Client Served	5	07/14/2015	Being an OT when I got injured was useful because I knew the medical terminology to describe my symptoms and pain as well as the inside track on how things were done with the insurance and billing, etc. But there were many days when I was at the end of my rope and did not have the strength to tie the knot, when Carol Conduff, with The Spine Health Foundation, would care enough to pick up the phone and give me a call, or pop in for a visit, or go to bats on my behalf, that made all the difference as I went through my 3 C spine surgeries. I believe God puts people in our path for a reason, a season, or for a life time. I know Carole was put in my path by God. I know The Spine Health Foundation is on the horizon of bigger and better things.  I thank God for Carol, who spreads herself way too thin for everyone she comes in contact with and to keep The Spine Health Foundation going. Carol definitely has the gift of giving of herself when others need it most. Her up beat attitude is contagious and has helped me through a rough day more than once in the past year and a half of my journey. Unfortunately, my journey is far from over but as a friend said recently "I still have my smile even through the pain." Therapeutic use of self was important to me as an OT and although I will never practice as a therapist again, there are countless ways one can be useful to others.
The Spine Health Foundation, Inc.	247802	1	/users/profile/335429	JD_Madill	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/08/2015	This is a phenomenal Non-Profit organization that I am happy to support and be a provider for when the need arises. The founder's personal story is one many can relate to. The lack of information for chronic pain sufferers results in a less than ideal outcome and Carol experienced some of that. The formation of this non-profit helps those with chronic pain get accurate information and access to a range of competent health professionals.
The Spine Health Foundation, Inc.	233248	1	/users/profile/296964	yrsanders	Board Member	5	11/09/2014	I am honored that my life crossed paths with the Carol Conduff, Founder of Spine Health Foundation(SHF), Inc.  From the very first day I met Carol, and learned of the her personal struggles with chronic back pain  and her journey to get her life back, I knew I had to be involved.  I have witnessed firsthand the helpless feeling of watching family members live with chronic back pain, depression, and desperation.  Desperation that often leads to overuse of prescription pain medication and eventually spirals into uncontroled and destructive abuse.  Spine Health Foundation provides the much needed encouragement and medical resources people deserve to get their lives back.  Not only for themselves but for their families.  I believe in the mission of the SHF because Carol started this Foundation with a servant heart.  The SHF is a beacon in our community and makes a difference in the lives of others everyday.

After failing non-operative treatment, we were able to get his neck surgery accomplished before his insurance ran out. Unfortunately, he suffered a common complication during the healing process and needed another surgery, but by that time, his insurance had expired. I felt horribly for him as fate had dealt him a second cruel blow, and wanted to do whatever I could to help him get back on his feet. So I contacted Carol at Spine Health Foundation and she was able to make all the arrangements for him to have his surgery . We are most fortunate to have this service in our area to help patients like this gentleman. Without it, there is no telling how long his suffering might have continued.

The Spine Health Foundation, Inc.	228246	2	/users/profile/291943	Chrissy_	Client Served	5	10/28/2014	I have had back problems and pain for several years.  I have gone to the doctors but where I was uninsured they couldn't just get me the help I needed. One day in the fall of last year I had taken a fall and had to go to the ER. I had x-rays on my back & there wasn't anything the ER doctor said he could do other than give me something for pain. That was when he ask me if I had ever seen a neurosurgeon for this problem. I told him no and that I wasn't able to afford one.  This is when I learned of this wonderful foundation and Carol C. The following day I gave her a call just as the dr had advised.  When I spoke with Carol the first time she explained how the foundation helps people such as myself. She asked me to explain what problems and pain I had in my back, hip, and leg. She told me that she could help me!! I could have cried right then, I'd never been told that someone could help. She sent me an application which I filled out and got back to her.  A few days following I got a call from her and she had already been in the works of getting me help. She was able to get me seen by a neurosurgeon who drastically cut his bill for my appointment.   It was then I seen Dr. P.,  He was very thorough and honest. He then  advised that I have a mylegram so he could see things more clearly.  It was after that he told me that we would do everything we could before having to go thru surgery.  I was then referred to a pain mgmt. physician. And if it hadn't been for Carol, I'd still probably not seen him either. I had an epidural injection, but no relief. It was then referred back to the neurosurgeon.  Still in the wait for all of this to come thru. But I understand and know back surgery is a serious and expensive matter. Thru the years this whole ordeal of back pain and leg numbness I'd gotten to the place where I figure I will live with it forever! No one could help me or acted as though they understood what I was going thru.  That was until I spoke with Carol! She has helped me so much, both mentally and physically.  She understood the pain, numbness, and falling. She is  one of the most helpful,  kind, caring, and understanding persone I know. She has went out of her way to help me!   I am honest when I say that I'd not know where I would be today if not for Carol and the Spine Health Foundation!! She has helped me and others so much! I'm still receiving help thru the foundation and I am grateful and blessed!! I pray that I can soon get my "normal" life back. Back pain is not and easy thing to live with. And no one really understands it unless they've been thru it. I am thankful that there are foundations and people like Carol that help people with these kinds of needs.  I can't say enough great and wonderful things about the foundation,  Carol, and the Dr's that are willing to donate their time and efforts. There are alot of people like myself that don't see a way to get the help we need. Back pain can ruin your everyday life! When you feel as though you will live with the pain forever! There is a way to get the help you need and your life back.  I'm proud to say that the Spine Health Foundation is a wonderful orginzation!! A big Thanks to the foundation and Carol for all you've done for me and others!!!

I take adopting a pet very seriously and want the match to be just right so the adoption can be a total success! When i fell in love with Sage on petfinder i didnt immediately realize she was in TN., so i was scared to adopt from such a distant but i just knew she was for us! That's where STAT and Sage's wonderfull foster mom Wanda came into the picture. We messaged back and forth and even spoke on the phone to make sure this would be the perfect fur-ever fit for all involved. The attention and detail the organization gives to possible adoptees is amazing and in doing so provides all with peace of mind and a whole lot of excitement and happiness! Sage has been with us for 3 years and is my best friend and i can't imagine my life now without her! I highly recommend this rescue to anyone looking for a well informed and confident adoption process. Thanks for all that you do!! -Melissa,Hbg.Pa

We have a satellite chapter here in PA where many of the dogs have been adopted.  I have found the vetting to be impeccable, questions are answered promptly and accurately, descriptions of animals are transparent, volunteers are friendly and helpful and the board members have always been receptive to ideas and appreciative of their volunteers.  I adopted Maggie Star from STAT over 2 years ago and she has been a wonderful addition to our house.  I am not a volunteer with them.  This is a very good animal rescue that I am pleased to be associated with.

Their adoption process was seamless and we now have a beautiful special companion Maggie.  Everything described to me about Maggie was accurate along with great fostering by Pamela.  Medical records were very complete and precise.  My volunteer work with STAT has been rewarding. I have meet the new adopters and dogs coming to PA.  Communication is great with the adoption coordinator Mandi.  I have had the opportunity to see many very happy people here in PA because of the great rescue work STAT volunteers and fosters do in TN.  Great rescue organization that I will continue to support!

They were friendly, easy to deal with and they definitely have the animals best interest at heart. I still keep in contact with one of the fosters years later. I would adopt another pet from them in a heartbeat.
Saving The Animals Together	293103		/users/profile/383672	Trish25	General Member of the Public	3	06/15/2016	It seems this organization is a great resource for a lot of people and that I do not doubt.  I did adopt one of their pets and I can't say I am having a great experience.  STAT sends a lot of dogs out of state for adoption, my dog being one of them.  I read her bio on 2 different pet adoption sites and she seemed like what I was looking for; good with dogs, good with cats, good for older adults.  Now I know all these people are volunteers but it seemed getting them to respond was pretty untimely.  I put in the online application and didn't hear anything for a couple days so I messaged them and eventually got a response.  After a couple more days I remessaged them to see the status of my application again.  In all after more time I was told I was approved.  After a few brief phone calls I was wasn't told much more about her and that they didn't want me to talk to the foster (reasons I will not go into).  I was told she didnt have many social cues (I figured she didn't know basic commands), but she was still a puppy.  The dog I eventually picked up is not what I would have expected.  They said she would be nervous - she wasn't, She made herself right at home right away, chases my cats everywhere and seems aggressive towards them, she has a extremely high prey drive, she jumps, nips, and in no way seems like a reasonable dog for an older person to have.  I am trying my best to work with her so she doesn't eat my cats but I am very frustrated with it all.  Because I don't think pets are expendable I hate to just say I don't want her but at the same time I feel terrible my cats are in hiding for the past month.  I don't understand how this dog had absolutely no basic training/manners after living with a foster.

They have given us quality dog food and quality cat food and cat litter as well as treats we could not afford to buy our pets ourselves.  It gives us so much joy to be able to reward our pets with a treat and to know that the food they are getting will not hurt them in any way.  We are so grateful for this organization and the dedication of those who stand out in the cold, rain, and extreme heat on the day food is given out to be sure every pet that can be helped is helped and in doing so helping reduce the financial strain on those of us who want out pets to be well cared for when events happen in our lives that change our financial circumstances and we do not want out pets to suffer as a result of that. These are a few pictures of our pets.  Bella and boots and Buster and Max.  Thank you all so much for making sure these pets we love so much are helped and  for helping us provide for their needs.  There have been times when this food we receive allowed us to get a prescription filled or buy needed groceries when their food was getting low.  They will always come first.   thank you again from Bella, Boots, Buster, Max, Scott and Phyllis ....

It is amazing to see the gratitude on the faces of the people that we serve each month. Without No Empty Bowls, these people could possibly be faced with having to give up their pets. It does not feed their pets for a whole month, but... it is a supplement to help them get through the month. Saving The Animals Together is a wonderful group of people working together to save animals. No Empty Bowls distributes about 300 pounds of dog food per month and about 60 pounds of cat food per month. They also are trying to raise money to help families get their pets spayed or neutered. It is just AWESOME to see how hard these people work to help this community and save these precious animals! There are just no words to describe how hard these volunteers work to raise funds and feed these animals.

Wish I was closer to help with more than pull fees.  A few weeks ago, I noticed a senior dog who had been at JRC long past her stray hold.  There was no plan for rescue, and euthanasia was looming.  I live 2 hours away and couldn't get there until late afternoon---too long to wait for a dog in jeopardy.  One of the STAT volunteers pulled the dog and transported her to an area vet for me.  Another met me at the vet's office later that day and helped me load and tether the dog so we could ride home safely.  Keep in mind that I had never met any of them before.  What a gift to me and this sweet dog.  The STAT crew works tirelessly, and we will be forever grateful!

I called Jackson Rabies Control and they said they had a yellow tabby that matched my Scooter. I was so distraught when I arrived. I was very ill and in tears. S.T.A.T.'s Diane Butler was there and she took me to look for kitty. Diane or another member is at this concrete jail almost everyday. I found out that the county charges charities for the honor of redeeming the least of these from certain death. S.T.A.T. networks with every reputable rescue to pull out every animal it can no matter the breed.They beg, they borrow, they fundraise, they network, they cry and they hurt for those they cannot save. I lost my cat but found a network of selfless people that make my home a much more humane place to live.

I can not say enough about how the door seems to continue to revolve with animals that STAT has helped from just this shelter alone. I try to help this shelter as much as I can because it has been dear to my heart since I was a teenager and now I am 55 so when I am seeing where Diane Butler has visited the shelter to help move dogs from there to give them a second chance on her limited time off work then its amazing. Stat volunteers are an amazing group of caring people who as a group that put there minds together to make room somehow if at all possible to move animals out just in the nick of time.  It takes a special person to volunteer her time off , whether its her lunch break or her day off to take a treat and one last loving hug to a dog that is very ill or time has run out. I cannot imagine having such a loving heart to be able to do that but Diane is an awesome lady. S.T.A. T.  is one of the best rescue groups that volunteer, yes volunteer there time, money, and  hearts to helping God's animals. Hats Off To You All for helping these precious babies:)
Saving The Animals Together	245596	1	/users/profile/332774	Teresa67	Volunteer	5	06/18/2015	I ran across the S.T.A.T.  group a couple years ago on facebook when I was looking for boxer rescues to adopt a boxer because our Sadie Mae who was 8 years old  had passed from Cancer.  That day changed my life forever. The particular rescue site had a S.T.A.T post shared on their page for a dog that was needing a home.  I knew nothing about shelter life for the animals until then.   As my mom and dad always said curiosity killed the cat.  Something about me made me want to  know and  I started researching this group.   Once i started keeping up with S.T.A.T. i no longer seemed to be interested in adopting a boxer because there were so many animals needing home.  This group of ladies are a awesome bunch to work with and have made it possible for me to help in rescue weekly and usually daily.  With their help and the rescue group i have backing me we have managed to save over 200 dogs from JRC in Jackson in the past two years.  The women there have helped my tremendously beyond measure with networking, pulling animals, pledges, temporary fosters and transporting because i am roughly 3 hours away from Jackson, TN and i also work a full time job just as many of them do.  I am very honored to be able to work with this group of women every day because if you don't know anything about rescue as i didn't it takes many humans just to save 1 furbaby and it is always a group effort.  Never is it a me rescue !!!!!!!  I know it is heartbreaking because we can't save them all but we can save one at a time and for that one their life has been changed forever.  Thank You S.T.A.T women of Jackson, TN.

Saving The Animals Together	245564	1	/users/profile/332741	Valerie58	General Member of the Public	5	06/18/2015	This group is pretty amazing.  They are a relatively small group of individuals who are doing mighty things.  They work tirelessly to save the dogs and cats of their county.   And when they are full and can't receive any new intakes, they work just as hard to keep saving these precious lives by facilitating the many levels of tasks that need to take place for other rescues to get a dog or cat "safe."  This kind of dedication and purpose makes their mission one of many successes, but they mourn those they can't save and keep trying for each new day.  This rescue actually does what their name says they do which is  "saving the animals together."

This group has made a tremendous impact on not only the Jackson Rabies Control shelter, but also the awareness of spay, neuter and animal well being in Jackson, TN.  They have assisted with networking dogs and cats in the shelter that would otherwise never have exposure or chance to be adopted/rescued.  They have also spearheaded improvements at the shelter campaigning for Karanda beds being donated.  They raise funds for pull fees, vetting and transportation. They are very careful with the adoption process and work tirelessly to assure that every dog and cat have a second chance at life and a forever home.   One of the worthiest organizations in the area.

One dog in particular stole our hearts so we foster failed and adopted. Throughout the process STAT was great to work with. They are always available, they provide a wonderful service to the community and our dedicated to bettering the lives of unwanted animals.

The staff was awesome from the adoption coordinator to transport. I couldn't ask for a better experience. My next dog will come from them too.
Saving The Animals Together	215776	1	/users/profile/279224	Amy_176	Client Served	5	09/19/2014	In early 2012, my husband and I decided we would like to add a dog to our family.  We had four cats and we needed to make sure that our new addition would do well with the cats.  We decided to look for a puppy and knew that we wanted to rescue rather than buy a puppy.  We came across S.T.A.T. and were amazed by this organization's helpfulness and honesty.  We never had a puppy before so there was a lot to learn and we were given valuable and trustworthy information.  We worked with two lovely ladies, one of whom was fostering the little angel that we decided to adopt.  During the entire process, we were kept fully apprised of what was happening with our baby girl.  We named her Satie.  The foster mom would send me pictures and cute little notes from Satie.  Satie was healthy, spayed and fully vetted.  She was transported from Tennessee to Pennsylvania and the S.T.A.T. volunteer that coordinated the pick-up was so genuinely kind.  It was a wonderful gathering of families picking up their new family members.  Satie is the most amazing dog and she has brought so much joy to our home.  When we're ready to add another dog to our home, we will definitely be going through S.T.A.T. again.

I knew I could never replace him for my husband, but I wanted to try. Looking through STAT'S  dogs for adoption page, I came across little Aiden,  one Teddy. I must have looked through 1000 pictures, and knew he was the one!  I filled out an adoption form and they called me right away. They were very thourough. In their background check to make sure this baby was right for us. We drove up to Jackson and met him and it was love at first sight! We couldn't imagine our lives without little Teddy. He is my husband's constant companion. Needless to say, STAT mended our broken hearts and for that we will be forever grateful. Margaret  and Ken Croft
Saving The Animals Together	215762	1	/users/profile/279209	Josie3	Client Served	5	09/19/2014	I have a new puppy. He's about a year and a half, a coonhound/border collie mix with a sweet face and sweeter personality. I'd been looking for a second dog for over a year, since my beagle/basset mix is not much of a walker -- she's a smeller. I saw Wyatt, my new puppy, on a friend's FB page as a dog in need of a rescue and fell in love with his face. I called my friend, who had taken in a dog from STAT, and he raved about STAT, hooked me up with Kelli, and in a few hours I knew where Wyatt had been born, who his parents were, his last vet's appointment, his disposition (most important since I have cats) and so on. STAT was concerned about Wyatt, who had been surrendered by his owner, at a shelter in Pennsylvania, not his native Tennessee. Wyatt is at that age where the wrong experience can become part of his personality, and he was terrified of all the dogs he was sharing the shelter with. Kelli coordinated with the shelter, and the pick-up could not have gone smoother.  He's a big dog with a lot of energy and a fantastic walker. Our boys love him and even our little drama queen beagle/basset will admit sneaking kisses on his nose. Since the shelter in Pa. was a high-kill shelter, it's quite likely he would have been destroyed, despite being a perfect family dog. 
Saving The Animals Together	214962	1	/users/profile/278289	Wanda Y.	Board Member	5	09/13/2014	I started fostering years before I heard of STAT.  A friend at work asked if I would like to be a foster for STAT and I'm so glad i said yes.  STAT is a group of caring people who do a great job rescuing dogs from Jackson Rabies Control.  The adoption coordinator finds wonderful homes for them.  Each person in our group does their part to save lives.  I am so proud of to be a part of this awesome group.  We have made a difference in the lives of hundreds of dogs and the lives of the adopters.   I love getting updates on my former fosters telling me thanks for saving my best friend.  Sure does feel good!  I love STAT. 
Saving The Animals Together	214960	1	/users/profile/278287	Dogmom13	Volunteer	5	09/13/2014	I was looking to adopt an oldie but a goodie. And that's when I was told about STAT. I thought to myself instead of saving one dog why foster to be able to save more? That's when I contacted STAT about fostering. They helped me through every step of the process. Two weeks after I put my application in I got my first love. She is an absolute joy. I would HIGHLY recommend STAT to anyone who wants to adopt or foster. 
Saving The Animals Together	212900	1	/users/profile/275998	Anne101	Volunteer	5	08/31/2014	 I joined STAT as a foster almost 2 years ago. My first foster was a puppy with parvo and both STAT and the vet responded very quickly to my description of her illness symptoms and she pulled through. Once returned to good health, she was quickly adopted. My next 2 fosters were older dogs and I adopted my last one. At all times, with any concerns I had, they were addressed immediately. It was a pleasure fostering with STAT.  I would do it again but it seems there's a sign on my mailbox inviting strays to stop in.

Everyone is always extremely nice. The dogs are cared for very well and also are trained, depending on age, to do most normal activities. Morgan is fantastic at what she does. She is always checking in to make sure the girls are doing well. I recommend STAT to everyone I talk to about my babies! I will adopt from Morgan again in the future.

We looked on petfinder.com and ran across a cute dog named Star. They had videos and pictures of her which was really nice. When we looked at the location we noticed it said Tennessee. We were at first a little concerned on how we would get Star back to Pennsylvania. We filled out the adoption form anyway and received a call almost immediately. They wanted to know a little bit about our background and the type of dog we were looking for. They then told us about Star, and we agreed it would be a good match. The whole process went very smoothly. They told us that they have a pet caravan that would drop the dog off about a half hour away. When we got there they were waiting for us, with all of Stars vet information and a goody bag for her. We are extremely happy with Star. Morgan was the foster parent prior to us adopting, and she really cares about the dogs and does a great job. Star was house trained, very good with dogs and her personality was exactly what they told us. We still send pictures from time to time. Overall this is a fantastic organization, and I would recommend them to anyone... and do when people ask where we got Star.

This means our pups are better socialized, because they learn to interact with other animals. Also by being foster based,we can tell first hand the dogs personality to a potential adopter. STAT takes care of the animals very well. STAT also appreciates the people that foster for them. I'm pleased and honored to work for them and with them to help the unwanted animals in West Tennessee find loving homes.

The Isha programs (Isha Kriya, Inner Engineering) and outreach efforts (Isha Vidyha, Project Green Hands, Action for Rural Rejuvenation) offer people from all walks of life tools for well-being and the possibility of creating a better life for themselves and those around them.

The people there are so selfless that you would automatically want to give in more than yourself.  Everyone there goes out an extra mile to serve just one purpose "YOU".  With this kind of an atmosphere, anyone stepping in there would want to give in themselves into any activity put out there.
Isha Foundation Inc	189449	3	/users/profile/247301	jordan.i.funk	Volunteer	5	11/27/2013	Over the past 3 years that I have been involved with the Isha Foundation my life has changed dramatically.  The yoga and meditation programs have brought greater balance, peace and wellbeing to me.  Working as a marketing consultant and in start-ups, the long hours and stressful work life left me very anxious, fearful and in seeking some sense of peace and joy.  The yoga practices I've learned have fundamentally changed me into a more peaceful, joyful and vibrant individual. The organization is of the highest quality, and run very professionally.  Having worked in the event planning business I can attest to what it takes to put on a program.  Everyone that I've been involved with has been well-thought through, no details overlooked, always putting the participants first.  As an actively involved volunteer, I've had the opportunity to make grow immensely.  Taking on new roles, being challenged to go above and beyond what I thought I was capable of.  This has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and one that stays with me each and every day.
Isha Foundation Inc	188989	1	/users/profile/246668	Cammineni	Volunteer	5	11/21/2013	I've always been about me, myself and moi, until I started volunteering at Isha. I've always volunteered at different NPOs, but it was because "I wanted to be helpful/useful". It was, for the first time, at Isha that I learnt that volunteering can be an opportunity to simply do something, not because I want to do it, I want to help, but because it needs to be done. So the work can be anything from phone calls, emails, or cutting vegetables in the kitchen or arranging flowers, but it's an entirely different elevating experience when you place your ego aside and simply do what is necessary! It's a good way to change the world!

Everybody gets benefited immensely so how can we say it is nonprofit. The true meaning of volunteering and get awareness on what you do can be achieved without any attachment. I wanted to start a nonprofit being a social entrepreneur working with different nonprofits understanding the mission and goals doing volunteer work but nothing had a great impact like Isha foundation.

I tried everything that Christianity prescribed, but always it never worked. I looked closely at what Christianity promises and says is the goal (see above). Nothing worked. Worse, almost everyone around me at church simply could not even make it LOOK like they wanted to be there. Finally I saw that this is not it. I started to look at myself and inward to see what was even possible in this creation. I asked for guidance and it came, this was years before Isha. After Isha came into my life (at just the right time) now I can see plainly that what the bible verses above says is 100% possible for me. Sadhguru is the most capable person alive right now who can ASSIST people to realize what they, who they are. I say assist because I see clearly that it cannot be forced on you, you have to make it happen for yourself.

They have been founded by Sadhguru, a yogi,  mystic, and humanitarian - who not only imparts yoga to all willing to learn but who is also a talented writer and poet, having spoken in numerous forums (TED, United Nations, World Economic Forum). The yoga programs run at Isha are held in the classical tradition - with teachers who have spent 5-7 years with Sadhguru, before being allowed to teach. Much care is taken to ensure that yoga is transmitted properly. Also, this is an organization run exclusively by volunteers - I am amazed above and beyond by their success and dedication and I highly recommend all of their programs.

Their teachings are commendable (they are actually repackaged buddhist principles), but they operate as a cult.  Before you join Isha, or if you are a member of Isha, please inform yourself about cults and the way the operate.  It is VERY difficult to realize that you are in a cult, but remember, it if looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is probably a duck.  Of course, Isha's first statement is that 'perhaps it is not really a duck' ... which is a classic strategy used by cults to avoid any labeling by confusing the issue with distractions and strawman arguments.  Be very careful.  If you are interested in Budhism, meditation, and yoga, it is better if you learn it directly, rather than through Isha.

I was cahrged as artist in charge of designing the artworks, but the work was very dependent on other willing hands to do the actual painting and creating the works to draw attention to PGH's specific work to increase the green cover of Tamil Nadu province to 33% (the national target). I was very moved by the incredible willingness of the Indian people I met at the centre, who happily put their all into the painting work. It was great fun for us all, and for me to see how easy collaboration can be. Things are often a litle chaotic on the surface, in my experience both in India as a whole and Isha in particular; but like the apparent chaos of the road-traffic there, underneath it all is a fascinating dance where each individual seems to know what he or she is doing, and so it works in spite of appaearances!

I am working to help plant 114 million trees in Tamil Nadu as part of a culture change project designed to reverse desertification, reduce poverty and end malnutrition. The project assists the most deprived villages in rekindling the energy to change their circumstances, empowering themselves to become self sufficient again whilst transforming their environments and rebuilding their relationship with the natural world. I put down my career to volunteer with this organisation as it is the only one I have found that deals with environmental sustainability, social justice and spiritual fulfillment as one complete holistic whole. I have benefited in every way from the experience, and would reccoment to anyone wishing to explore themselves through service to others and deep internal exploration, to engage with Isha.

Seeing people's enthusiasm in contributing to a project that benefits us all is truly worthwhile.
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	305801	1	/users/profile/397075	Writer	Volunteer	1	09/21/2016	To whom this may concern: So apparently our coordinator Amanda Lin thought it was appropriate to have London taken away over an email response that took longer than 8 hours for a reply. But she didnt call or text us for a status update. She says she did but thats a lie. She implied that because we didnt respond fast enough to the email,  we were imcompetent & too busy to take the dog to the vet. So next thing you know she tells our neighbor who is also involved in the bug fluffy group to take the dog away from us making her feel very uncomfortable the next morning.Amanda,Ill have you know that we took well care of the London. We worked 24/7 with London. We took him to beach , dog parks , and fed him top of the line food.To imply that we are incompetent to take care of an ill dog makes you a false accuser. Never once did you try to call or text us , if you wanted us to process further action for the dog. So sorry my husband didnt respond to you in the time you wanted but if you would of clearly read our emails the dog was healthy & back to normal after his diarrhea mishap. And if you were serious about taking him to the vet right away you had our number. But let me guess ? Too busy too call ? You have to deal with other foster dog families too ? Maybe you shouldnt bargain more than you can handle. We told you that the dog was well & healthy. But, you should learn how to communicate before you jump into conclusions. You are a very disrespectful & offensive person to bring our neighbor involve.  What makes you think we are incapable of taking the dog to our vet ourselves ? Someone is with London around the clock. Just because we didnt reply the same night of the email but the next morning!  Oh my gosh ! We are sooooo busy..too busy to go to the vet right ? Too busy to be a foster parent? Wrong. We put our dogs first & our jobs are willing to comply with any last minute visits. But how would you know when you didnt even get the chance to know us. How dramatic of you to make such action over night. Its either your way or the high way ? How do you feel seperarting London from our dog, which are insperable. Causing mental emotion to both our dogs. Yeah you supposedly had the best interests of the dog when he was completely happy with us. We had interests in adopting the dog because of how well our dogs were getting along. But no, you have given us an ill taste in your non profit organization. Let me guess . Delete anything negative that anyone says about yall to make yall look oh so perfect. We have insiders telling us what type of people are behind this company. So far they are proving us right.  Hopefully, yourre content with your decision because people like you just like bringing people down with them. Because  of ignorant people like you in this company , you lose great dog foster parents.Get Outlook for Android

Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	243334	6	/users/profile/330055	sth12345	Volunteer	5	05/20/2015	I have volunteered for this organization for several years now, I started fostering for them in 2012, and adopted one of my fosters in 2013.  Around then I started volunteering in other ways, making phone calls, writing emails and doing clerical work.  They are a fantastic organization, helping over 2000 dogs last year.   
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	243333	4	/users/profile/330054	Star3bux	General Member of the Public	5	05/20/2015	BFDR saves so many beautiful dogs who are about to be euthanized due to expensive health problems and/or no more room in a shelter. These people spend countless hours saving the lives of these beautiful animals.  They always seem to manage to save some poor dog at the last minute even though they don't really have the money. I respect these people very much.

We had to wait several months before she could travel because she was being treated for heartworm.  This organization is amazing and has done so much for dogs in need.  I can't thank them enough for what they do for homeless dogs in need whether they are big and fluffy or not.  
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242890	5	/users/profile/227522	Jennifer248	Client Served	5	05/12/2015	I have adopted all three of my dogs from this organization! They made sure to check my references in advance, they are clear in the rules for their dogs in order to keep them safe after adoption, and are happy to take back any dog from a home that doesn't work out so they can rehome them and the cycle of abandonment doesn't continue. The director and volunteers clearly put their heart and soul into the work and save so many beautiful souls. Even though they are called "big fluffy dog rescue" they don't leave a dog behind just because she isn't big or fluffy - they take our tired, poor, and huddled doggies no matter their needs or appearance. They are a godsend to rescue!

So we went to visit and he came out from under his bush and proceded to play with and herd my boys. They loved each other! The foster said he didnt do that with the other families he saw . So i suppose he chose us ! We ended up taking him home a week later he has been a wonderful fit! The people who work with bfdr are wonderful and he was very loved at his foster there were lots of tears when he left.  The dogs are fixed ,vetted and chipped  also driven from down south. Working with animals my self  i can say they go out of their way for these animals they are wonderful!

BFDR does amazing things, taking on cases that no other rescue (or major organization--yes, I'm looking at you Humane Society) will touch, regardless of how much deeper some of those pockets are. They step in with grace and energy, and they make things happen. I love the honesty and sincerity demonstrated by these dedicated folks. Our fuzzy might just be the most perfect pet ever.
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242877	4	/users/profile/329445	eb03618	Volunteer	5	05/12/2015	I am a foster for this wonderful organization. The dog I fostered was part of a large group (58-60) of dogs BFDR rescued from the Magnolia, AK animal control facility. The dogs were crammed into small pens (I use that term loosely) designed for only a couple dogs, without adequate food, shelter or water. My foster dog came to the rescue emaciated, pregnant and with a badly infected eye. BFDR provided medical treatment and she spent several months with me recovering, getting to a healthy weight, socializing and learning good house manners. She was recently adopted to the PERFECT family, and BFDR was careful to screen all potential adopters. This dog, and all the dogs saved by Big Fluffy, now has a great future full of love and happiness. 
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242050	4	/users/profile/328775	valrih	General Member of the Public	5	05/03/2015	Big Fluffy raises the benchmark on how to be a successful rescue organization. Using a 'no dog left behind' can-do attitude even when their resources are stretched beyond capacity, these folks say "what else is possible" every single day. If I lived in Tennessee, I would volunteer because I want to be around people that are inspiring, decisive and ok, damn funny. I live for the witty social media posts that highlight their dogs' stories, before/afters and things going on. Seriously, those posts alone could be compiled and sold in a book. Creative fundraising, BIG out of the box thinking, I just love these people. Call me smitten and unabashed fan forever.

Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242035	2	/users/profile/328763	Laura237	Volunteer	5	05/02/2015	I wasn't really sure whether to pick volunteer or client served because we started as client served. I heard about BFDR from a coworker when I told her I wanted a pyrenees. She had recently adopted from them and had nothing but good things to say about them. So then started my search for the perfect pup through them. My husband was a little weary of all the fur from pyrenees so we compromised and said we would get a mix. I fell in love with a pyrenees/border collie mix and started the adoption process. They informed me that the foster was torn because they wanted him to go to a good home but also wanted to keep him since they fell in love. I told them he should stay and we would keep looking. Only a few hours later I got an email from an adoption coordinator who told us they had his sister, she was searching for the right dog for us. That was back in 2012 and she has been the love of our lives since. I had such an awesome experience that I always wanted to foster. So this year 2015 I filled out foster app and got our first foster. That was when I realized how truly amazing this rescue is. They care so much about their dogs and try so hard to match the right dog with the right family. We hope to add another dog to our family but I absolutely love this rescue that I'd probably always foster or volunteer for them when I can! You won't be disappointed adopting or fostering from them!

Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242029	1	/users/profile/328756	jxm215	Client Served	5	05/02/2015	I recently started fostering for BFDR. They are a wonderful organization that truly goes above and beyond for their dogs. You will not find a more hardworking and compassionate group of volunteers anywhere. While communication may not always be as quick as some would like, you have to realize that these are volunteers with full-time jobs, children, family obligations, and lives. The foster and adoption coordinators are essentially working a second job, 24/7, since dogs don't only need rescue and fosters and adopters don't only need questions answered during weekday business hours. They work tirelessly to find the best fit for each dog. They do not rush dogs through, mislead you, and hide any "bad" qualities about any dog just for the sake of placing it in an adoptive home. This organization cares for and loves each dog. Thanks BFDR for all you do, and I recommend this rescue to everyone I know! 
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242028	6	/users/profile/328755	Bill103	Volunteer	5	05/02/2015	I volunteer with Big Fluffy Dog Rescue giving foster care to dogs with special/critical needs. . . .one with a shotgun blast to the face, one who was on the verge of death from starvation and dehydration and who was so eaten with mange that the ends of his ears had rotted away, one who had been caged in a tiny cage with raw sewage in the floor  in the dark for FOUR years with the result that her back leg had become septic and was rotting from the inside out, one with congestive heart failure who was abandoned to die alone huddled in a cold cement pen. Shall I go on? BFDR never turns away ANY dog, no matter how desperate its condition and never spares any expense to turn other people's trash into real treasures and carefully matches them with homes where they can be loyal companions and loving family members.
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242027	2	/users/profile/328753	Aggie123456	Volunteer	5	05/02/2015	This is a simply awesome rescue group. They do it right. Ensure dogs get vet care, not just minimum required. Dogs are in foster homes before adopted, so they used to family life and one can get true appraisal of temperament, etc first. The volunteers care about dogs. They are there supporting adopters and foster families.  They ' leave no dog behind' and so have small, non fluffy dogs too.  And if that wasn't enough, everyone should read the ' late night posts on their website....so funny, so well written. BFDR is the best there is!!!!

The people that work at BFDR are dedicated, caring, and tireless in their efforts to see every dog in a happy, safe place.  They are responsive to questions and work hard to make sure that they are matching dogs with the correct families.  I am impressed every time I have an interaction with anyone that works at BFDR - from the drivers, to the the vets, to the adoption and foster coordinators, and everyone else.  I can't say enough great things about BFDR and the work that they do.

The volunteers, coordinators, and the "family" of fosters are incredibly supportive of each other as the common desire and goal of all is to open their hearts and provide the tenderest of care, attention, and unending love so that each rescued dog may find the best forever home.

They do their best to make sure you are a good fit for the dog and the dog is a good fit for you. They have been more than willing to answer all my questions, before and after the adoption, they didn't just disappear after we brought him home. We really loved our dogs foster family, they were great at honestly answering all of our questions and letting us spend as much time as needed to be sure we were compatible with our dog. We are still Facebook friends, so they can see our dog grow up. They all care so much for all these dogs and help however they can. We love our Big Fluffy Rescue Dog and Big Fluffy Dog Rescue.

Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242018	3	/users/profile/328743	Niki A.	Volunteer	5	05/02/2015	I have gotten 3 of my 4 dogs from Big Fluffy Dog Rescue (BFDR) and they are the best dogs ever. I initially found them after I did a search for a dog on PetFinder. The dog *I* wanted they thought would not fit in well with my family. I was initially disappointed but then they suggested another dog, Logan. I would have never picked out Logan just from his picture. But oh my gosh, BFDR was right. He fit right into our family and he is the sweetest dog ever. We adore him. We decided to foster dogs and on our second foster with Liza, we failed. We fell in love with her and adopted her. What is especially lovely is BFDR has a FaceBook page and I am now friends with the family that adopted Logan's brother and with the family that adopted Liza's brother and also the family that has their mother. My kids and I love to watch our dogs siblings grow up. BFDR also has outings and we have actually met the dogs and families in person and have become friends outside of FB. At the camping outing I heard of a pupoy that was coming up north and needed a place so we fostered her and of course she fit right into our family too. BFDR vets the dogs down South and they foster them for a little while before they come up North so the Foster Parents down there know the dogs and know where they would fit best. We have also become friends with our dogs Foster Families. It is like one big happy family. I don't know how else to describe it. I love my dogs, they are perfect for our family of 5 and I love being a part of the BFDR family. Plus I really enjoy the Late Night Posts written by Jean Harrison on FB. I look forward to reading them. I would recommend adopting a dog from BFDR in a heartbeat. 
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242017	1	/users/profile/328742	Hockey_mom_18	Volunteer	5	05/02/2015	I love this rescue and the volunteers that work so hard for these pups.  I am a sometimes foster for them and it is amazing to see the volunteers swing into action when they find a pup at risk.  From rescuing dogs in hoarder situations to emptying shelters with deplorable conditions, they try their best to leave no dog behind.   A typical day would have a list of volunteers transporting a dog up or down the east coast to get a dog out of a bad situation.  Keep up the good work Big Fluffy!
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242016	1	/users/profile/328741	Widget13	Volunteer	5	05/02/2015	I have fostered six dogs for Big Fluffy in the past year and a half. And I foster failed, meaning I adopted,  with a seventh. I have volunteered for other rescue groups in the past but Big Fluffy is hands down the best. Unlike another reviewer I have never had an issue with lack of medical care when one of my fosters had an issue. The volunteers I have met, emailed and talked to on the phone have all gone above and beyond to help the dogs that Big Fluffy takes in. We all celebrate when a dog goes to his or her forever home. If someone has an issue there is no shortage of people to offer advice or even drop everything and hit the road, for sometimes several hours, to lend a hand.

The dedication that this rescue shows is beyond belief.  Our dog was rescued from an animal sanctuary that also housed exotic "pets" ie. a Siberian tiger caged next to the dogs, and without BFDR taking the time to care, Will was destined to a life of fear.  Since our adoption, it amazes us to read about the countless dogs they have helped since then. We are truly thankful for all of their hard work.

I've held a couple of volunteer roles, and I'm impressed with the people involved, the care shown to the dogs, and how well the organization functions. Every foster with whom I've spoken falls in love with each dog and, when necessary, works hard to rehabilitate sick and abuse dogs so that they can have happy furvevers. Great leadership and scores of happy, healthy dogs living with their new families. BFDR is one of the best rescues I've ever seen. 
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	242011	1	/users/profile/328736	William63	Volunteer	5	05/02/2015	I have been a foster for Big Fluffy Dog Rescue (BFDR) for over 1 1/2 years.  I am a Southern Foster in TN.  I cannot speak for the Northern Fosters, but my experience was and is awesome!  When beginning fostering, you have to identify what you are willing to foster (IE: short term/long term; cat friendly dogs; dog friendly dogs; seriously ill dogs; etc.) BFDR DOES pay for Vet visits and meds as long as you get PREapproval (Unless it is an emergency and you call your coordinator as you are rushing there or while you are there.)  They do this because money is tight for rescues (I know, your shocked) and they have resources for getting things cheaper when they can. Yes, there are times when the founder and/or coordinator is so overwhelmed with hoarding cases, evaluations, Vet references, dog transports, etc. that 'stalking' may be necessary (which they freely  admit may be required). If you are thinking of fostering in TN, I challenge you to find a better rescue than Big Fluffy Dog Rescue.  If you think that I am a fake reference or being paid for this reference; email me! wcrunyan@bellsouth.net  BFDR took on 3 stray dogs that my family found dumped in our area when none of the local rescues would...and I contacted ALL of them locally before I went searching the web far-and-wide for help.

Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	193575	11	/users/profile/252838	mcbrown108	Volunteer	1	01/31/2014	Think twice before you foster with this rescue..especially a dog with medical issues. I love this dog but this rescue has put a bad taste in my mouth. 4-6 weeks has turned into 5 months and counting, still denying their dog heartworm treatment after entangling 2 vets. (one of which  has the meds and is willing to do it at cost) The rescue told us to find a second vet, because the cost was too high at our vet (we called our vet, they had not heard from the rescue). We got an email demanding the dog be at a location at 2:30 in the morning for pickup via email less than 36 hours before the meeting time, they could have given more notice and a respectful phone call would have been the proper form of communication. They denied vet visits when the dog had been throwing up all over our house for 12 hours straight (they sent meds a week later, showed up crushed because they sent it in a regular envelope). They then called us to ask if we could take another dog from them. (We were told their dog was supposed to be a one dog household they responded that they had no clue we still had him). Can it get any worse, probably: Recently they finally approved our foster dog to have some tests run. Some came back suspicious (could be a highly contagious bacteria in his stool) The rescue would not pay for the additional tests (~40 dollars) to make sure he would not infect other dogs he came into contact with. (we payed for it out of our own pockets, as well as other meds for his on-going ear infection the rescue refuses to pay for) 
Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	192840	6	/users/profile/251820	cnmulligan96	Client Served	1	01/20/2014	Big Fluffy Dog Rescue was awful. We were approved to adopt a dog and then turned down because we weren't, and I quote, "enthusiastic enough" when meeting the dog. Mind you, this dog had been abused, and we were explicitly told that he was nervous when meeting new people and scared of loud noises. The foster family decided to keep him because of our lack of enthusiasm.  I have to wonder how closely BGDR screens their families, because the dog was being kept in a household with three other loud dogs. He didn't even have a bed to sleep on. The foster father even tried to drag the dog down the stairs on a leash, even after my family explicitly told him that we would rather not take him out for a walk due to the intense snowstorm we were having. In my experience, they didn't care very much about the dogs. I recommend working with any rescue organization besides them.

Big Fluffy Dog Rescue	100952	3	/users/profile/37668	dotleach	Donor	5	11/22/2011	I learned of this group when a Grat Pyranees was missing from my home town in Scituate, MA.  A Facebook page "Find Charlie" tells the story of a dog, rescued  by Big Fluffy Dog Rescue from an ice cream cooler after the TN tornados, survived for 2 months "on the lam". He was presumed killed by a car on a highway, fended off coyotes, and finally trapped by Granite State Dog Recovery of NH, in Weymouth, MA.  Bigg Fluffy Dog Rescue identified him from the huge scar from the surgery he had (a huge benign tumor), took care of the vet bills, and placed him back in the home of Big Fluffy''s Northeast coordinator.  Now, Charlie needs dental work since he chewed through cans to get food while on the run.  Big Fluffy is raising those funds via ChipIn for Charlie, and they have not given up on this gentle giant.   Please read Find Charlie on Facebook, and donate if you can to help this loving boy.

I remember going to my very first Greiving Mothers Meeting, I was so nervous. I didn't want to talk. I did end up saying a few words about Lisa but not to many. I was thankful there were only about 5 moms there because by nature I'm shy till I get to know you. I have met so many wonderful people. They would do almost anything for me as long as they could, and I for them. There is a special bond we have created between us, but I wish it was for another reason
Listening Hearts	261569	2	/users/profile/287301	majikwon	Client Served	5	10/04/2015	After losing My Daughter at the age of 22. I was numb, my feelings were all over the place. I thought, am I going crazy. Why am I feeling like this, how can I deal with this. Then I found Listening Hearts. To know there are other moms going through the same thing as I was feeling, was a feeling of relief. I felt like I wasn't the crazy one. I found a support system that has helped me so much. I look forward to the meeting and talking to the other moms. The best thing a grieving mom can have is another grieving mom's support. Only she has felt the same heart breaking pain of the lose of her child.

Listening Hearts	285474	1	/users/profile/375461	Jane104	Former staff	5	04/10/2016	It's been 7 years since my sweet Chad passed at age 25. I went searching for other mothers in my situation, and found Listening Hearts. I thought I was going crazy! But they let me know what I was experiencing was normal. At first it was hard to go to face to face meetings, but after I started going, I looked forward to our shares and hugs that we shared. They always understood where I was coming from and never tried to fix me or make me feel like I should be different. Sometimes friends hate to see me hurt and want to fix me, when all I need is to be heard. My feelings are my feelings, not good or bad. Listening Hearts is that safe place, come as you are, we love you where you are at.

I will never stop grieving for my son,I will always miss him and yes my heart breaks everyday because he is gone,this group helps you by sharing their stories and being there for you when it seems as if you are all alone because only a mother that has lost their child can understand this nightmare we live daily.

Such an anniversary brings back thoughts, emotions, and pain from that horrible event and loss. Every birthday and holiday is endured with grief. Each day is a struggle, but the days mentioned carry heavier grief.Listening Hearts gives support whenever needed, but they reach out to moms even moreso on birthdays and death dates. Our group Facebook page is kept current with such dates, and because bereaved moms understand they often leave words of encouragement and understanding empathy.Seeing this print in front of me allows me to let go of the fear that everyone has forgotten my child. They ask me to talk about Sawyer, share memories, and even show pictures. They say his name. The group is a welcoming and loving place where we can acknowledge our children's lives. They are a tremendous blessing in my life.Sincerely, Tracy Bradshaw

Obviously not something you would normally Google, I decided I needed to get ideas from others how I was going to get through the death of my son. I found Listening Hearts.

That was the being of my healing and coping with the days ahead.

I went to doctors, psychiatrist; everyone felt empathy for me, but didn't know how to help. The mothers group could relate to all the craziness I went through because they were living it theirselves. it was or is a place of trust where you can share your feelings without being judged. I truly don't believe I would be where I am today without this group. This is a group no one wanbts to be a member of , but thankgod for it. I was able to go back to work, I am a registered nurse; my marriage did survive the death, but it was a fine line. There is life after the death of a child ; but you are never the same; you carry a sadness and a weight in your heart that never leaves. But knowing there are other mothers out there just like you; that needs you, encourages you to get up and make it through another day. THanks to the Listening Hearts mothers group, I continue to function, and occasionaly even smile these days,,,,

Then in 2005 my husband died and again I did the same thing.  In 2007 my daughter became ill with leukemia and then died in 2008.  She had three children and her oldest daughter was expecting so again I felt the need to care for everyone else.  My friend invited me to a meeting of Listening Hearts and it really opened my eyes.  We all need to grieve and it has to come out sometime.  Listening to other Moms sure explained why I had been feeling the way I was.  I had days when I cried all day and days when I didn't want to do anything.  I thought I was loosing my mind because I didn't know why.   Finding others who were going through the same thing was a blessing to me .  Finally someone understood me.  I'm sorry for the reason we are in this group but it is a huge blessing to me.  Love all the Moms with all my heart....

I'm unsure how I could've made it through those early months, and beyond, without the support, love and friendship I found in this group.  For a mother to lose her child has to be the most devastating thing that can happen.  Friends were there for me, but honestly, finding a group of moms who travel this same journey helped me understand that so many of my feelings and thoughts were "normal" that I don't think my other friends were or are comfortable with.  I am now five years into this journey and still find support as I need it in this group.  I have made friends for life here.   At times I haven't been up to attending and I love that it's ok to feel that way and not judged.  It's a group I am free to be me.  It is a rollercoaster this journey and so glad to have my Listening Hearts moms there for me whether it's a meeting, on Facebook or in a phone call or email.

However, Blount County Animal Center is an EXCELLENT facility.  It is clean, the staff and volunteers are wonderful people to work with, and the animals are well taken care of.  Furthermore, BCAC goes the extra mile to give the animals the needed veterinarian care.  I am always amazed by the dedication of the volunteers.  It is truly a wonderful place to volunteer and spend time with like-minded people and, of course, all the great animals.

I've had the privilege to help volunteer and work in the center under many different roles, as well as see and be a part of Many,  many different  changes through these years.I've watched our volunteer base increase from just a few dozen to hundreds of volunteers! Our beautiful furry friends, have never been so lucky and blessed to find themselves moving through out center as opposed to any other. We function on a very high saving rate with all of our volunteer help... even with a less than average employee base vs. any other county shelter. Despite the fact that there are so many different personalities coming into one place, everyone always comes together for the benefit of our beautiful furry friends, as a family, and a team making it an amazingly enjoyable place to work/volunteer!I truly encourage anyone with any type of a love for animals to come and visit!

It was a way for my kids and I to work together to help animals which we all love. I have adopted several animals from there as well and foster cats when needed.

It is very rewarding to see the adoptions take place and know you have helped make a difference in not only the animals life but the family adopting as well.

Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	174308		/users/profile/230576	TerriLane4FurKids	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	I enjoy volunteering with this organization because I want to help animals and be of service to my community.  I have made wonderful like-minded friends who are also concerned with animal welfare. At this shelter, there is plenty to do.  I have volunteered for nearly 3 years and I have been a dog walker, worked the front desk, been foster coordinator, counseled potential adopters, and helped at adoption events.  I currently take photos of the adoptable animals, and help with post-op procedures on surgery day. I am also the admin for the center's Facebook page.  I love it when I can post photos of dogs/cats that have arrived in very bad shape with mange, sores, malnourished etc and then post a photo which shows how much they have improved with lots of TLC and the LOVE that the volunteers provide every day. I call those "What Love Can Do!". It is also very satisfying to see terrified animals calm down, trust their handlers, feel the love, and come out of their shell and be a happy animal!  We all rejoice especially when these special cases are adopted into loving homes.  The shelter goes above and beyond in providing excellent medical care for those who have health issues!  We are thankful to SMACF for their support which enables us to go the extra mile!

We are a close knit community of volunteers it takes alot of teamwork  to get many animals taken care of.  I have to say we get it done!  We have reports to prove it. I love to hear whom is going where "their story" as you get to know a dog when you come walk them from week to week.  Truly a friend to greet you...BCAC is great with increasing chances of exposure of a dog by getting them to adoption fairs and out at Petsmart in town locally here or far.   I walk the big dogs.  It gives me a schedule and a "friend" to cheer.  I always hear good reports but sometimes sad ones as animals get sick or hurt from time to time, but we can try to help and that's what we want to do.  I'm glad to be a part of it and get to meet many animals and people in the process.

Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	174162	1	/users/profile/230371	rhetawrites	Volunteer	5	10/05/2013	I started volunteering with BCAS about a year after my dog of 14 years died. I didn't want to get another dog. I could walk the bigger dogs, and know I was making a little difference to a shelter dog who stayed in a kennel most of the day.  I started fostering dogs by accident. Someone needed a foster for about four days. That one worked out so well, I took another short-timer, then another one. I didn't miss my dog so much  because the dogs I fostered needed me. Doing short-timers helped me keep from getting too attached. Most of the dogs I fostered required extra attention for several reasons.  My best story is Maxine, a young, scared mama dog. I took her so my friend could work with the pups. Maxine hid in very small places like between the recliner and the wall, or my quilt rack and the wall. By this time, I had already adopted a little dog from the shelter that I named Faith. Faith spent time with Maxine during the day and I walked with both of them, and petted and talked to them.  Maxine started standing near the window with Faith, watching for me to come home from work. She didn't hide as much, either. Maxine left my house after about 3 weeks. I heard later that the dog who hid a lot the first two weeks ran up to the man who was looking to adopt her. Wow! I felt so excited to know that I had made a difference in that dog's life - with a little help from my own dog.
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	174129	1	/users/profile/230339	Judy89	Volunteer	5	10/05/2013	I wondered what I was going to do when I retired to East Tennessee, but the answer came when a new acquaintance posted a photo on Facebook of a young feral dog at the Blount County Animal Center who was depressed, unsocialized and unadoptable. I thought to myself, "I can help that dog." He was also our first foster failure, as we adopted him after a month. In that first year we fostered 34 dogs and 9 kittens, and eventually, added volunteering at the shelter, walking dogs and helping at weekend events. It has been a rewarding experience that has made every day worth getting up for. I have also gotten to know some amazing people, whose dedication and perseverance to helping our Blount County animals is extraordinary. The Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation has made it possible for us to help the animals with their medical needs and to transport many of them to rescues.

Walking big dogs has been wonderful therapy for me. The dogs love getting out on walks and playtime they pay us with kisses. I can't think of any better pay. Watching a dog go from being so scared it would just sit in it's kennel shaking one day, to playing fetch in the pens a few days later is just priceless. The joy you get seeing a dog in danger one day go to it's forever home the next day is overwhelming in a good way. This is a wonderful shelter with plenty of room for more volunteers. We have lots of animals waiting to give kisses.

Everyone there does his or her best to put the needs of the animals first, and then takes a bit more time to comfort, guide and observe each one's health and well-being.  I saw the good work being done and felt compelled to pitch in as a volunteer.   The staff is made up of dedicated professionals, experienced in handling animals. They go the extra mile in every way to meet and help potential adopters in the community find the right animal companion.  They strive every day to make BCAC the most efficient and effective animal shelter in the State of Tennessee.  They use their resources wisely.  They show boundless heart and energy, and they are turning the tide and making a difference for the animals.  I am very proud to be associated with and part of such excellence.

Because of a female dog we already had, we took the pups to the center. Everyone was very nice to work with and the pups were adopted within that week. I decided that I wanted to help in anyway that I could, so I have begun by walking the small dogs which is fun, but I want to learn more about the different  ways that the center helps the animals, so maybe I can do more in the future.
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	173529	1	/users/profile/229674	ashton99	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	my father and I started volunteering about a month ago because my dog ran away. we went to the shelter to see if he was there, and he was in the very last kennel, he looked just like he did when he ran off! I wanted to volunteer because I wanted to help other peoples pets to find there home or find a new forever home. all of the animals are loved with all our hearts. all of the volunteers are kind to all of the animals and people that come to the shelter. it is also one of the cleanest shelters I have ever been to. i now that if you look you will find your new best friend at the shelter.
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	173522	1	/users/profile/229667	kaylagreen160	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I have recently started volunteering for the Blount county animal shelter, and already I feel like I'm at home. The workers and volunteers are very welcoming and are very willing to show new comers how its done. I believe the faculties are the cleanest I have ever seen. I have only volunteered a short while, but during this time I witnessed a African American man come all the way from North Carolina to adopt a terrier. I personally helped him show case the pup to his son over face time. The man ended up adopting the terrier, and it was life altering for me to see how happy and joyful the man and his son was to find the perfect pet. I felt a sense of renewal and rebirth for this puppy that was abandoned and found a new home, and it was all thanks to the Blount county animal shelter. My first volunteering day was last Sunday and while I was volunteering I really felt like I was making a difference in these dogs lives. I saw know how stressful it can be stuck in cages constantly hearing other animals barking and afraid. I adopted my own dog Alfred from a shelter and he was stressed when we first got him before we even left. And when I am able to help by giving these animals relief from this scary stressful time I am extremely happy to see them happy and free. I am so very proud to announce that I will be continuing my volunteer work!

Every volunteer and staff care so much about all of the animals and work so hard to make sure that every animal is being taken care of. We all work hard to find homes for all of the animals, and take excellent care of the animals that are in the shelter.

They'll stop at nothing to make sure all of the animals are well taken care of. They have love, not only for their animals, but for the whole Blount County community. I would recommend the BCAC to anyone and everyone. The are EXCEPTIONAL!

Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	173456		/users/profile/229597	oley	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I started volunteering almost 3 years ago after my 12 year old cat died.  I  thought that working there would ease the grief a little.  The new shelter had not been finished yet but was in process.  One day one of the cats caught my eye.  I looked at his kennel card and he had been there the longest of any of the others.  Well, he then became mine and I sure do love that boy, Rufus.  The shelter is finished now and is wonderful.   It is kept so clean inside and out by the many volunteers that we have.  The cats have a great "gym" where they can climb and play.  The dogs have about 2 or 3 acres to be walked in and have about 6 enclosed areas to play together and socialize. There is always some way to contribute.  The volunteers keep the entire shelter spotless. They make sure the kennel is clean, dogs & cats have water and food, are not sick or just need some special attention.  There are cuddlers for puppies after surgery and a host of volunteers to do laundry, sweeping and mopping, washing dishes, greeting potential adopters and taking animals in.  Having nothing to do is not an option.  The animals need human contact, love and attention and they get it there. Everyone works so hard to be sure they are taken care of  and will  go to any length to get an animal adopted to a loving family.  I fostered 4 kittens for a while.  They were so sweet and I hope I made an impact on their life.  2 of them were adopted from my home before I could take them back to the shelter.  Everyone goes to any extreme to make an impact on an animals life.  We have adoption events at the shelter and outside the shelter too.  Our main goal is to give animals special attention and find a family that will love them.  They crave attention and love and they get it there. There is a great team of volunteers that make sure the adoption events are a success and try hard for every cat & dog can has a home.
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	173403		/users/profile/229547	mama mia5	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I was first connected with this fantastic organization when my daughter contacted them to take part in a countywide community volunteer expo as part of her Girl Scout silver award.  Needless to say the BCAC made quite an impression because the two of us now volunteer there and love it!  Every single animal that comes through that door is treated by the staff and volunteers as if they were their own.  The care and compassion shown to these "fur babies" is exceptional.   It takes a lot of volunteer hours to run a shelter as top notch as this one and it's obvious we have the best!!!    I am thrilled that my daughter can take part in something as special as the BCAC, and learn valuable life lessons along the way.

A huge group of super people working as volunteers to save the animals through transport, adoption, rescue or foster and reuniting with owners.  Come join us!
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	169570		/users/profile/224744	Diane80	Board Member	5	09/13/2013	I am on the SMACF Board and also volunteer at the Animal Center twice weekly socializing and walking dogs - and often getting my kitty fix too!   The Animal Center is very clean and bright and provides a safe loving environment for all the animals thanks to all the wonderful volunteers and staff.  It is amazing to see the physical and mental transformation that occurs with these animals when they realize they have arrived in a safe haven.   When I first started volunteering I was afraid (and my husband was too) that I would bring all the animals home with me but I soon realized that most will get good homes.  We still have periods when we get overcrowded which is a concern but the volunteers and staff rally to foster animals and double them up in kennels until we can find them homes.   Please come out and see us at the Blount County Animal Center.  Come adopt a wonderful friend and consider volunteering with us to get in your weekly puppy/kitty fix!  Your donations to SMACF are appreciated and help pay for needed medical care and spay/neuter to help reduce pet overpopulation.  
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	169538	1	/users/profile/224705	Kristin at BCAC	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	I started volunteering at BCAC in January 2013.  I originally signed on to walk big dogs one morning per week. That changed pretty quickly once I discovered the impact that a committed volunteer can have on the life of a shelter animal.  There are so many opportunities to help - adoption events, fostering, walking small and/or big dogs, cuddling after surgeries, helping prepare dogs and cats for transport to rescue organizations and many more.  The high adoption rate at this shelter exists because of the efforts of its volunteers. If you want to make a difference in the lives of homeless pets this is definitely the place to be!
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	169379	1	/users/profile/224457	Robin76	Volunteer	5	09/12/2013	I love helping here! By far the cleanest and well taken care of animals!
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	169185	1	/users/profile/224225	Lillie N.	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	I began volunteering for the Blount County Animal Shelter two years ago. I didn't really know what to expect at first, but I attended an orientation and decided that this would be a good thing to do for the my community and the welfare of animals. I was assigned one three-hour shift per week and started out cleaning puppy kennels and scooping litter boxes on Monday mornings. It took awhile to get to know everyone and find my niche, but soon I was confident enough to help in many areas of the center (we officially became the Blount County Animal Center in Nov 2011), at off-site adoption events and with the spay/neuter clinic. I became involved with our foster network and coordination. There are so many needs here and so many volunteers with so many different talents. Our director has an open door policy and is always available to discuss anything with volunteers. The staff is compassionate and extremely ethical. It can be chaotic, but we accomplish so much. Please think of joining our team!
Smoky Mountain Animal Care Foundation	169177	2	/users/profile/224216	Eliz at BCAC	Volunteer	5	09/11/2013	I am a volunteer and foster for the Blount County Animal Center.  If you a looking for an opportunity to help animals in need, then this is the organization for you.  A few of the things we do at the center can range from walking dogs to assisting after surgery including cuddling puppies.  We do adoption events and assist with transports to rescues up north.  There are so many things we do there to help keep the center running and reliable volunteers are always needed.  They allow you to become a part of the rescue experience and hold it close to your heart.  Fostering is a big part of the center; it makes kennels available for other dogs and cats to have a safe place until adopted.  Foster animals are usually adopted for transport and need a home atmosphere prior to their journey.  Its wonderful to be able to care and nurture an animal in a safe environment.    The occasion I remember the most was a Sunday morning walking small dogs.  This little mixed girl came into the center late Saturday.  We were cleaning, feeding and walking the dogs.  I had brought my sister with me and she has several small dogs. This little girl in the kennel was a bit nippy so I thought quickly and asked my sister to get her out.  She was nippy because she had given birth to four small babies during the night.   Its amazing some of the experiences you have, share with others and keep for ever. Elizabeth

They do things no one else is able and/or willing to do.  I applaud their efforts both personally and corporately, as a local church pastor.  We have partnered together on multiple occasions and will do so again in the future.
Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	209470		/users/profile/272233	PastorJeremy	Volunteer	5	08/08/2014	KICKO transcends traditional notions of outreach.

Sidewalk Sunday School is a fun time for the kids to sing, play games, listen to a Bible story, learn a verse, and apply truth to their lives.There are great volunteer opportunities.Bill, Janice, and Michael do a great job stretching the dollars donated to have an incredible impact.

Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	206107		/users/profile/39885	grant1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/15/2014	Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach (KICKO) is special because of their intentionality about being in relationship with the children and their families in the public housing developments in the Knoxville area.

Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	115892	1	/users/profile/39885	grant1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/20/2012	Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach (KICKO) cares deeply about at-risk children in the Knoxville area. They conduct sidewalk Sonday Schools in the public housing developments that teach the children life-changing truths in many creative and positive ways. Their work, however, does not end there. They visit the children and their famiies every week and walk with them through the ups and downs of often difficult circumstances. They also have summer camp for kids who might not otherwise ever get a chance to go to camp. As the children mature they provide leadership development for them, too. Bill, Janice, and Michael Clark don't just preach it, they live it. 
Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	197437		/users/profile/258110	Abby14	Volunteer	5	04/11/2014	I've only been volunteering with KICKO for a semester, but they have proven to be one of the best organizations working with inner city kids in Knoxville. The sidewalk Sunday school is one of the most well planned and executed ways to get the message of Christ to children. Not only do they share te message of Christ with them, but KICKO teaches good character. I love all the little hugs and high gives I get from the kids and I know that they enjoy the time that is invested Into their lives. Even though I may not see the fruit of this time, but I have faith that these kids are having fun and encountering Jesus, which will impact their life.

God has done great things with the Clark family, amazing work in Knoxville: building relationships that last among kids, volunteers, and Christ!  I sincerely hope that the area will continue to support KICKO and its vision.
Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	197342		/users/profile/257976	joycotn	Volunteer	4	04/09/2014	I don't have the vocabulary to express what I feel the benefits of KICKO are, but I can try to sum it up with Luke 14:23 "And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled ." Sidewalk Sunday School is about the most phenomenal outreach tool I've seen. Hearts and minds of children are being transposed by biblically based stories, music and interactive learning activities. The Impact teens have the opportunity to go to camps and events that they probably never would have the chance to experience. Giving is more than a donation, its an investment.

Due to some personal family obligations at that time I could not continue as a volunteer but have continued to pray for the group and the wonderful ministry that Bill, Janice, and Michael Clark and a host of volunteers who work to serve the inner city community.   My heart's desire is to bless this wonderful organization by planting a financial seed to allow this ministry to continue to invest in and make an impact in the lives of the children.

Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	178725		/users/profile/235352	blountlays	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	I was introduced to KICKO almost 10 years ago and fell in love with the work and mission of this ministry. The Gospel is unashamedly front and center for this ministry, and there is no other group that does what they do. Each week the Sidewalk SONday school program is touching and impacting the least of these in our at-risk communities. I have served as a board member, a site volunteer, and am now a site leader. (non-paid staffer.) Having participated in virtually every aspect of this ministry from the budget to ministering the gospel on the front-lines, I can say with confidence that KICKO is the real deal. These are the good works that God has created us to walk in. What a blessing!!

Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	174715		/users/profile/231022	Andy Wallace	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	After learning about the tremendous impact that KICKO is making in our community (and has for decades) I was compelled to go volunteer with my 8 year old son at one of their Sidewalk SONday Schools.  WOW! I am convinced that he and I received a greater blessing than we delivered.  My son asked two questions that I would ask you: 1.  "Daddy, where are their daddy's at?"  My response: many of them are not involved in their lives.  2.  "Dad, do they not go to a church like ours?" My response: some of them may, but many of them will never experience God's love unless we take it to their communities like we did today. Hence, I am moved by what KICKO is doing and would encourage you to support them with your time, talent and/or money. You'll never regret it!
Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	174443		/users/profile/230717	alwogden	Donor	5	10/06/2013	It is often hard to decide whether to donate to an organization.  Where will your money go?  What will it be used for?  Does it really go to help those in need?  KICKO has proven themselves many times over and we are confident that when we donate to this organization children are helped in numerous ways.  From ministering the Gospel, mentoring, sending to camp, and providing a Christmas gift, KICKO truly has the children's needs in mind.  They are working hard to change the future of so many kids.

In college,in Texas, and working my butt off witnessing and living my life for The Lord. There is a friend of mine, I've known him my whole life he is like a brother to me Jamarcus Mattress. He has now joined the army and serving The Lord. I know 100% that if they didn't do what they did there would be no Jamarcus in the army. And no Ashley in college. I would have given up. I thank God every day of my life for Bill and Janice Clark and there son for serving The Lord and teaching Kids like me in ruff neighborhoods.

There are  numerous volunteers and workers committed to helping these kids succeed and most importantly develop a relationship with Christ. Becoming a recent mentor with this  ministry has been life changing to me already.I love what KICKO's purpose is, winning kids and teens for Christ in communities that aren't often reached & I'm honored to be a part of it.

Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	114930	1	/users/profile/156593	Mike Evans	Donor	5	06/13/2012	KICKO was started by Bill and Janice Clark, who are long time friends of mine.  I have had the privilege of sending kids to summer camp through their ministry, as well as working in several back to school block parties where kids are given free back packs full of school supplies that they otherwise would not have.  They have worked faithfully for many years, visiting the homes of the children they minister to as well as potential ministry candidates.  They started with one or two side walk Sonday Schools and have expanded to several in more than one city.  With their team, they are diligent and work tirelessly all year long, investing in the lives of inner city kids, from teaching them, mentoring them, and training them to someday take the Gospel to their world, too.  I do not know of a ministry anywhere that has a more dedicated team working day in and day out to minister to those who the world has mostly forgotten.  Bill and Janice, and now their own kids, are the real deal.  They are faithful to their ministry, but also to their local church.  As an Elder in my church, I see many ministries started that end up taking the place of the local church for those involved.  That is not the case with KICKO.  The bottom line is that this ministry is operated by sold out Christians who have taken the Great Commission seriously and to another level.
Knoxville Inner City Kids Outreach	114924	1	/users/profile/156583	Ging	Volunteer	5	06/13/2012	The faithfulness of KICKO to the inner-city children has proven to transform lives.  I continue meeting youth who came up through KICKO as children whose lives are forever changed; they are going to college and pursuing their goals.  One young man, Ronnie, is an amazing and talented guy.  He is now giving back to his community and others. With the continued support of Junior Staff Leaders, I can't wait to see what he accomplishes in the next 20 years!

Women Identity Purpose Organization NFP	185288		/users/profile/242245	Ambassadors of Memphis	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I have attended and worked some events with WIP and their President Cynthia Jones.

Women Identity Purpose Organization NFP	185003		/users/profile/241942	rrutdoss	Volunteer	4	10/29/2013	WIP provides direction and mentoring opportunities to single mothers while encouraging them to pursue their dream.  The workshops, events and speakers are insightful, dedicated and encouraging.  
Women Identity Purpose Organization NFP	184824		/users/profile/241758	dbalston	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I was introduced to Women Identity Purpose through its founder and president and learned to love the mission and vision for this charitable women's organization. The beauty of this organization is that it serves an overlooked population--the working poor single parent who is doing all they know to do to provide the best life possible for her family. WIP is doing a stellar job in making a difference in this population through its programs and services. They are to be commended for their hard work and dedicated service.

I was really honored and touched by the care of the organization, as well as impressed with their willingness to help.  The scholarship took me a long way towards my goals.

Women Identity Purpose Organization NFP	182165		/users/profile/238932	Joyce33	Donor	4	10/24/2013	I have had the privilege to attend two events of WIP. Both events were positive and uplifting for women. I am thankful to have been involved with this organization whose focus is to celebrate and help females better themselves in every area of their lives.  I excitedly gave donations to WIP because I knew that whatever I gave, would benefit some woman or girl who needed help or who had achieved greatly.  Encouragement and celebration are two awesome gifts to give women, whether it done verbally or tangibly.

My daughter entered me in the contest for Mother's Day. Even though I did not win, I won just the same. The flowers that were sent in my daughter's name are simply beautiful. The unique basket is something I will keep long after the flowers are gone. I just wanted to thank all of you and to encourage each of you to keep up the good work that you do. Thank you so much and may God bless each of you!

Women Identity Purpose Organization NFP	100380		/users/profile/122148	dac25	Volunteer	4	11/07/2011	My recent first volunteer effort was to facilitate a workshop on Interviewing for several of the women associated with one of WIP's  community partners.  The experience was rewarding because it offered me an opportunity to connect with others that could use my expertise.  The ladies were able to gain inisight and suggestions on how best to approach the job market.  They were engaged and found the time well spent.    I would encourage anyone to consider volunteering with WIP and supporting the organization financially.  It will be time and money well spent. Debra AndersonIndependent Consultant 
Women Identity Purpose Organization NFP	84457		/users/profile/93695	Nichole	Board Member	4	03/31/2011	I have enjoyed working with WIP (Women Identify Purpose) as both a volunteer and now as a board member.  The vision has allowed me and many other women to be touched both emotionally as well as mentally.  Each event that I have been involved with has provided a forum where women are able to uplift other women by sharing not only  their struggles but also their accomplishments.  The events that I have attended as a volunteer have finally given purpose the struggles and trials I have personally endured as a single mother with a limited budget.  When women know that they are not alone in their struggles and there is someone who has endured AND overcome, they are empowered by the strength of those around them.  This organization not only gives hope to women who feel powerless but connects them with other women and other organizations that will help them step by step rise to the next level of success.  I have been able to encourage others that I have met as well as be encouraged when I needed that extra push!  Thanks, WIP!!

Specifically, I believe their programs directed to working mothers are extraordinary because they offer options that are not only needed, but also, educational.  Resources are provided that extend far beyond the initial meet.   WIP seeks to interconnect the community allowing for more transparency and exposure.  I look forward to their model being duplicated across the nation.   Congratulations Women Identity Purpose for more than 7 years of service in Illinois and Tennessee.

Women Identity Purpose Organization NFP	83909		/users/profile/93010	Kim M	General Member of the Public	5	03/29/2011	Women Identity Purpose (WIP) is geared toward the overall well being of all women.  If there is a need WIP is there.  Whether the need involves helping another agency or nonprofit meet its staffing needs for a particular event that speaks to the mission of WIP OR if the need involves WIP hosting an event just to encourage women of all backgrounds....where there is a need WIP is always available to step in and help.  I've attended several events and I've always left more motivated and inspired not only to do more in my own life but in the life of others.

Special Spaces	186413	1	/users/profile/243424	Jan DeMaggio	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	Since the Secret Millionaire aired in March of 2011 so many lives have been changed, mine included.  Our Special Spaces affiliates are not only Changing Childrens Lives One Bedroom at a Time were also changing the lives of their friends and families, the lives of our dedicated volunteers, the sponsors of our rooms, businesses in our communities who have donated countless items.the list is endless.  Its difficult to describe the feeling that comes from the smiles on the faces of our children and their families at the end of our makeover day when they come home to see what has been created just for them.  Im blessed to be a part of such an amazing organization.  
Special Spaces	184209	3	/users/profile/241146	Ann Swain	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I feel blessed to be a part of Special Spaces. It is an amazing national  non-profit organization. Helping to change children's lives around the country who have life challenging illnesses. The organization began in 2004 and will be celebrating the 10th anniversary this coming year! We have had the pleasure to work with many talented and skilled professionals along with creative volunteers who come together in a day to recreate a child's dream bedroom makeover. Special Spaces has dynamic Directors around the country all making a difference to those children and families in their own communities. You will never regret a minute of energy you spend in helping to transform and make a difference in the lives of these resilient children. It has been a rewarding experience!
Special Spaces	182245	3	/users/profile/239014	rebseel	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	When my friend, Lynn Wall, asked me to be a part of the Special Spaces team I was both excited and a bit nervous.  Excited, because I loved the idea of helping such young people get through such difficult times.  Nervous because I already had a busy life, and I wasn't sure how I'd feel giving up some of my precious down time.  It's been 2 years since Lynn asked me to join her team, and I have never once regretted saying "yes".  We bring happiness to the lives of children facing unimaginable obstacles.  We get to see their smiles and hear their screams of excitement when they see how we've brought their dreams to life.  We get to see the tears of joy in their parents eyes, as some of the sad memories melt away and are replaced with more joyful ones.  The challenges these children and their families deal with every day is more than most people will face in a lifetime.  I'm so happy to be a part of an organization that brings them happiness.
Special Spaces	181990	2	/users/profile/238747	dawngunnoe	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I started the Columbus, OH chapter in November 2011 and have since completed 10 room makeovers. After spending 10 years in the nonprofit field, I chose to start a chapter of Special Spaces rather than create a new nonprofit from scratch because I could see what an amazing organization founder Jennifer Swain has created. She and the national board of directors have made working with Special Spaces a wonderful experience. Their expertise in the field has ensured I have all of the tools and resources I need to have a successful chapter! Each and every director has such a caring heart and we are all able to be successful in helping sick children because of the support we receive from the national organization. I love being a part of Special Spaces and look forward to many more room makeovers in the future.
Special Spaces	180592	2	/users/profile/89459	Lisa	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2013	I first heard about Special Spaces through a makeover they did for my cousin's son Logan. I have been a fan ever since. It is amazing what they do to bring a bit of happiness to the children's lives. Keep up the good work Special Spaces! 
Special Spaces	180374	2	/users/profile/237056	Lyndsey_as	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	I first saw an article about Special Spaces in a magazine a few months before I contacted Jennifer Swain, the founder.  Not long after I first heard about Special Spaces, I was required by my school program (I was/still am a full time interior design student) to find an internship for a semester. I immediately knew that I wanted to reach out to Special Spaces. Jennifer let me dive right in at the Knoxville branch and during my internship I was in charge of two room makeovers. Even after my internship was over, I stayed on with Special Spaces and completed three more rooms. Since then I have become a co-director for the Knoxville branch. I love this organization so much! Not only are all of the volunteers awesome, but the experience of giving something wonderful to a child and family going through a difficult time cannot be matched.  If you are contemplating volunteering, or donating money or time to this organization, do not hesitate! These children deserve every bit of happiness and joy that comes their way.
Special Spaces	180289	2	/users/profile/236948	Denise70	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	In 2011 I joined Special Spaces as the director of the Orange County chapter.  Special Spaces' mission touched me on a personal level.  When I was 16 years old my 14 year old brother was struck with a childhood illness that had him in & out of hospitals for the next 20 years.  He passed away at the age of 34 leaving behind a 3 year old son & 8 year old daughter.  I know what these children & their families are going through.  I knew that giving a child a dream bedroom where they could escape & feel normal & just be a kid would be rewarding but I was not prepared for how much these families would give me.  I feel so blessed to be taken into their homes & their lives.  The children, families, volunteers, donors, and retail stores that help us do what we do have shown me the most beautiful side of humanity.  Denise Sutherland
Special Spaces	178176	1	/users/profile/234804	Brian77	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	I became involved as a Special Spaces Director in 2011 and it has changed my life! While our goal is to create a special space for a child in need and to help make their life a little better we are doing so much more! Not only have we been able to make children's lives better but I feel that doing this work has improved my life as well as our many wonderful volunteers.  It is awesome receiving emails from volunteers the night of a makeover telling us how much fun they had being involved with the makeover and asking when the next makeover is! Everyone should get involved with Special Spaces! I love being able to work with an organization that has become a Family!
Special Spaces	178062	1	/users/profile/234682	Tammy55	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	I became involved with Special Spaces a couple of years ago while in design school.  School encouraged us to seek out and volunteer.  I located Special Spaces and discovered that there was a child's room that needed a makeover in Nashville, TN.  I was part of the makeover from the very beginning of the process to the reveal.  I've since completed 6 rooms.  I've volunteeed for other organizations but never met the families we were helping.  At Special Spaces, we meet and interact with the family and the child getting to know them and they are so excited to have been chosen for a room makeover and see how many people come to volunteer.  The room reveal is the best part of the day.  To see their reaction of what was accomplished in one day and how much they love the new room is a very rewarding experience.  Doing these room makeovers gives the child a place to retreat that makes them feel safe and comfortable.  The response I hear the most is "my child doesn't want to leave their room" and that makes it all worthwhile.
Special Spaces	178041	1	/users/profile/234660	Gail25	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	I have been involved with Special Spaces for a couple of years and find it a rewarding and special involvement.  I know it is making a big impact for many families.
Special Spaces	177921	2	/users/profile/234518	Amy_116	Client Served	5	10/15/2013	We were blessed by a room makeover by Special Spaces Tri-Cities for our Trinity this summer. We cannot begin to thank the volunteers and donors enough. In the midst of doctor's appointments, medication, scans, worrying and more, Special Spaces was a light to our Trinity and whole family. They not only made over Trinity's room but also made significant changes to her sister's room to not let her feel left out. The magic does not end there. Now looking at the front of our house, it feels like home. They did landscaping and worked on our porch as well.  Now, we want to give back and help out this wonderful organization.
Special Spaces	177909	1	/users/profile/234507	Sparkeester	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	The most rewarding thing that I have ever been a part of.  You quickly realize how much the entire family struggles when a child is diagnosed with a life threatening illness.  Volunteering means spending time with great people and making a huge difference to people in their time of need.  People with a variety of skills and interests somehow manage to complete these bedroom makeovers in one day.  The best part is sharing the reveal with the families and all the volunteers that made a difference.  You will not regret one minute of volunteered time or one penny donated to this amazing organization. 
Special Spaces	177813	2	/users/profile/234400	annestrunk4	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	After my children graduated from college and began their own families, I was unsure what would be my next step in life.  Volunteering for Special Spaces has been life changing.  I love working with this wonderful team whose only purpose is to bring joy and encouragement to families that are experiencing tragic medical circumstances.  To be able to show that they are loved and cared about is true servanthood!
Special Spaces	177795	2	/users/profile/234379	BevOlsen	Board Member	5	10/15/2013	Two years ago when my friend, Lynn Wall, told me about Special Spaces, I told her, "Sure! I'll help you paint some rooms!" Well, I found out there was a little bit more involved in just painting the rooms!  What there is the extreme pleasure of seeing the faces of the children and families that we impact with our 'work'. What there is hearing the excitement in the voices of these people who can not thank us enough for what we've done to the child's room. And there is the wonderful feeling of giving to someone and not expecting anything in return.  Knowing that this child is now spending time in a room that was THEIR dream, how could they not feel better, if not get better? That is how we are 'paid' for all our 'work' and it's worth is immeasurable!
Special Spaces	177691	2	/users/profile/234271	JenniferSwain	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/15/2013	When I founded Special Spaces in 2004, I knew that this organization had the potential to become a national nonprofit.  We are reaching that dream one bedroom at a time across the United States.  What I didn't realize at that time was the amazing directors that I would meet.  How blessed I am to have them represent Special Spaces across the country.  Thank you to all the directors, board members and volunteers who give of their time, treasure and talent to help children battling their toughest challenge.  You are all truly appreciated.  
Special Spaces	177614	2	/users/profile/234182	srschultz	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	It is often said within our organization that Special Spaces promises you "a day you will always remember and a day that a child with a life threatening illness will never forget".  That's an understatement!   I attended a fundraiser for an ill child,  signed up to volunteer for his room makeover for the following weekend after meeting someone from Special Spaces that night.  The following week, I was volunteering in the national office in Knoxville and now 18 months later, I have the pleasure to work side by side with our Founder and  Executive Director, Jennifer Swain.  I challenge you to find a group of more talented and tirelessly generous individuals all with the common goal of putting a smile on a child's face.   Our mission is simple,  to create a "Special Space" that the child has designed, anything that he or she can dream while also addressing their medical needs.   We have 35 volunteer directors across the country leading teams of volunteers to create these unique special spaces.  Many have full time jobs or some have made our mission their "job",  but they all work equally from their heart to put that smile on an ill child's face.  I promise you, the day you get involved with Special Spaces, is a day you will never forget!
Special Spaces	177565	6	/users/profile/234128	Donna120	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I cannot begin to tell you the impact that Special Spaces of the Triangle has made in my life. The people I have met, the families that have been helped, the look of pure joy on the faces of the children and many more elements that add up to an experience that you will not soon forget. I hope to continue to be a part of this group for many more of these wonderful makeovers.
Special Spaces	177534	5	/users/profile/234098	natG	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I've been a volunteer with the Special Spaces of the Triangle chapter since its inception.  The core group of volunteers are amazing and so generous with their time and talents.  What we do is quite incredible too.  We make over rooms of some very sick kids.  It is so rewarding to watch those little kids discover their new rooms for the first time and see the smiles on their faces.  This is definitely one non-profit that I will be helping for as long as they are around.   I love these people and what they believe in and am happy and proud to be a part of SST.  
Special Spaces	177465	2	/users/profile/234024	jglenn13	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I started the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter late last year, and we are currently working on our second makeover. The entire experience from meeting the families, to planning the rooms, to working with volunteers, to seeing the reactions on makeover day are absolutely priceless. This organization not only touches the lives of the children we are able to help but also the many volunteers and directors around the country that are impacted. It is truly a life changing experience to be a part of, and I cannot be more excited to see how the organization continues to grow around the country. I love being a part of something bigger that is making a difference in the lives of so many.
Special Spaces	177329	2	/users/profile/233875	Tamatori	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I've been involved with Special Spaces of the Triangle since the first makeover as a volunteer.  I have met some of the most generous, kind-hearted people in our community who donate their talents and/or treasure without hesitation.  This is because it is such a special charity.  It brings the community of the sick child together, working to better the life of the child and to bring joy to them and their families in a time of need.  I have a child with a life threatening illness myself, so I know the pain and anguish that families go through and the importance of this unique charity.  Getting day to day chores and tasks done is a near impossible task when your child is battling for their life.  The families focus is mustering up enough energy to get through the next treatment, so this is where Special Spaces swoops in to bring a little joy to their lives.  When my child was born, I envisioned him involved in sports, community, playing with friends and going to school to achieve his dreams.  His dreams have been altered due to his sickness and he is in the process of reconstructing himself.  Dreams disappear for these kids since they must learn to survive.  If you have the time, please volunteer for your local chapter....if you have a donation, please support your local chapter and put a smile on the face of a child and their family.
Special Spaces	176645	2	/users/profile/233051	shelham	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	This organization is beyond a shadow of a doubt all about heart!  From the founder to the various chapters across the country; from the volunteer directors to the generous room sponsors and businesses in support of the mission to help these children; from the various volunteers such as contractors, seamstresses, electricians, painters, muralists, and volunteers who give it all, and then give moreit all boils down to one thingbig hearts giving to very ill children who need hope and a reminder that they are loved.  The rooms are beautiful and they are indeed a very special space for these children to go and heal and just be a kid, but the message behind the rooms is what I love most.  That is that these children matter, they are not forgotten, and we celebrate them and all that they are in spite of their illnesses.  I am the director of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter, and I am also blessed enough to help at a national level.  By the end of this year, our chapter in the past two years will have made 22 Special Spaces childrens lives just a little bit brighter (well maybe a lot a bit brighter.)  But what I can also tell you is that this mission brings only the best of people together in the way of volunteers who want to make a real difference!  And you will absolutely get back so much more than you could ever give with all your hard work, sweat and tears as you watch that child see their room for the first time after the makeover, and you learn months, or even years later, that their special space is why they fought so hard as the little warriors they are to win their battle with cancer or another kind of life-threatening illness.  As one of our Special Spaces children said, My bedroom is now a reflection of me and why I matter in this world.  I am surrounded by everything and everyone I love!  There is no price you can put on that!   This organization indeed is all about heart!!!
Special Spaces	176618	3	/users/profile/233036	Tina45	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	I am a Co-Director for one of the newest affiliates within the Special Spaces organization, Special Spaces-Green Bay. We have completed one bedroom makeover for a very special little girl and are hoping to do another room in November. We have been extremely well received within our community! A local baseball  team created a fundraising event at one of their games to help fund our first bedroom makeover and they raised over $900.  Several local businesses have made generous in-kind donations and we have had individuals share of their talents via sewing, painting and/or carpentry work. Being a part of this organization is amazing! We are looking for people to share of their time, talents and treasures. If you are interested in doing something wonderful with your free time, please consider becoming involved with an affiliate in your local community - it can change your life!
Special Spaces	176365	5	/users/profile/232769	lweberwall	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	I first heard about Special Spaces on the first episode of Secret Millionaire and was immediately hooked!  I was so moved by the idea that such a small gesture as decorating a room could have such a amazing impact on a sick child and his/her family, that I knew it was something I needed to do.   So I gathered a group of talented, generous and trusted friends and started a chapter in Buffalo, NY.    That was two years and 12 makeovers ago!   We've added many volunteers to our Special Spaces family along the way, and once they've experienced the " makeover big reveal", they're hooked too and ask to come back time and again!   We're not curing these kids, but we're definitely making their journey a little less scary and a lot more comfortable.  And, we're proud to report that 100% of "our kids" who where sleeping with Mom & Dad prior to their makeover are now sleeping in their own beds every night! 
Special Spaces	176030	3	/users/profile/232421	Mary214	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	I found Special Spaces Buffalo through Facebook and completely fell in love with the organization. I have been actively involved with them for a year now and the organization has changed my life. Being able to work with such an amazing group of people who help bring smiles to children with life-threatening illnesses has been an absolute privilege. It's an amazing and different experience each time a child walks into their new room and you see how excited they are. These are moments that take your breath away and bring happy tears to your eyes. I cannot say enough good things about Special Spaces!

The rooms are amazing and the families benefit as well. The people involved in this organization are awesome and are grateful for any donation that is given to them. They need all the help they can get and every penny goes into helping a seriously ill child have a space where they can be surrounded by the things that they love while convalescing.

She and this company are absolutely AMAZING.  I love being a donor and donating things like a brush that my salon sells called  The Wet Brush for her to give to all the tender scalped children.  I cannot say enough good things about Special Spaces.  Please donate on a monthly basis.

Special Spaces	175448	3	/users/profile/231795	kbavouset	Donor	5	10/08/2013	This charitable organization is awesome.  Working for no salaries, they make special spaces for critically ill children.  Volunteers and business sponsors donate time, equipment, supplies and money to make it happen.  Be it a bedroom, a play area in the back yard and more.  The children are given a haven desperately needed between their hospital stays and doctors appointments.  Special Spaces gives this to them without fail finding designers, painters, builders, and contractors to volunteer their time and expertise; whatever is necessary to complete the project.  If the parents have spent all of their resources paying for medical bills it is not unusual for these volunteers to also redo bedrooms for the other children in the home as well as yard work and anything else that needs to be done.   These volunteers are so giving and dedicated it is incredible to see what the accomplish for these children and their families.

I searched high and low for a nonprofit that directly and tangibly made a difference in the lives of kids in need, and Develop Africa fit that criteria perfectly.  They don't spend all their money on marketing, and the link between donor and recipient is fairly direct. Even 18 months later, I am still inspired by the work they do, and proud to be part of the team.

Develop Africa worked with the Ministry of Health in Sierra Leone, purchased needed materials and worked on getting it to them all within a relatively short time. They were really great and dedicated to the task of providing assistance during the epidemic. Develop Africa is an outstanding organization.

More recently DA has been really involved in combatting Ebola through awareness and educational campaigns, sending protective gear for health care workers on the ground, and a recent online Q&A with Reddit. The work they are doing is especially during this time. Volunteering as the twitter manager for Sylvester's organization has been a great experience so far.
Develop Africa Inc	220018		/users/profile/283645	FlorenceKayemba	General Member of the Public	4	10/05/2014	Develop Africa is a great organization. I have marveled at their relentless efforts in helping the needy especially in East and West Africa. The founders truly have a heart for the poor and needy. They challenge me and inspire me. I have been very moved by their efforts in supplying medical and protective kits to the health workers on the front line in Sierra Leone. What I also find interesting is that sometimes, it is hard to know who's behind Develop Africa if you didn't already know them or you haven't visited their website. This is because they promote the work, they amplify the voices of those in need. They don't promote themselves as personalities which I find exceptional especially in a world where people seek to use these platforms to get famous. Looking forward to see what's in store in 2015. God bless them for a job well done. I also hope that they can also document their experiences and lessons they have learned so other organizations on the continent can learn from them as well.

Africa is dear to my heart and anything that has to do with the development of the continent captures my attention. Mr. Sylvester, who oversees the day to day running of the agency, is an affable man with a great personality. He is passionate about the development of Africa so much that he goes the extra mile to get things done. I could not have been anywhere better than volunteering for this reputable organization.

I've read letters from teens who have move from hopeless (in their minds) to viable citizens who have learned the value of work, the importance of integrity, and (occasionally) the purpose that God has for their lives.  I'll never forget the words of a former MH participant as he encouraged those in the MH program to cut the ties that connect them to a life that will probably lead to jail or death.  He shared how satisfying it has been to be enrolled in college, have an apartment and own a car.

Monroe Harding has big dreams for the youth of middle Tennessee who need their services and the staff, BOD and our many supporters are working hard to make sure those dreams come true.

Monroe Harding	115973	1	/users/profile/157908	Julie60	General Member of the Public	5	06/20/2012	I became aware of Monroe Harding in December 2009 through Jimmy Wayne and his Project Meet Me Halfway, which brings awareness to the challenges foster youth face. Since then I have followed the work of Monroe Harding and visited them twice (from Wyoming). During my most recent visit I was taken by the dedication & caring hearts of the staff I met. I truly believe Monroe Harding does what they claim, "Changing Young People's Lives". Their programs offer young men in foster care the chance to overcome their hardships and gain an education, learn life skills, make friends and know what a home feels like. I wish there were more organizations such as Monroe Harding with the heart and dedication to helping foster youth achieve happiness and success.

General Member of the Public	5	06/20/2012	I originally heard about Monroe Harding through Country star, Jimmy Wayne, who himself had lived a hard road as a boy and youth. Jimmy had been a Foster child and had ended up homeless and alone at various times himself, just as many of the youth - now taken care of in the safety and support of Monroe Harding - would have statistically ended up also. Recently I had the pleasure of visiting Monroe Harding in person and I couldn't have been more impressed! The staff and volunteers working there are dedicated to helping the desperate and deserving youth in their care get on their feet. They not only provide them with a place to call home, but teach them life skills and help them with their education and work goals so that they may thrive and succeed. I highly recommend Monroe Harding as a place where young men's lives can be saved and turned around, and their dreams can be seen to become possible in their still malleable young hearts and minds.

We met several of the young men who greatly impressed me and underscored just how important Monroe Harding is at this point in their lives. The words they used were - 'hope' 'respect' 'esteem' and 'learning to be a man' . As the mother of teenage sons I know how vital these things are in the development of  young males  and I am happy to support Monroe Harding as they pursue their missioon to change lives for the better.

He shared how satisfying it has been to be enrolled in college, have an apartment and own a car.  Independence and self-worth are two consistent themes that run through the halls and programs of Monroe Harding.  Everybody deserves a chance . . . 
Monroe Harding	115418		/users/profile/157186	MRLNashville	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2012	I have a Monroe Harding tshirt.  Whenver I where it in the community, random people come up to me and ask how I'm involved.  Several times, I have had people tell me stories of how they had been in foster care and needed support from the broader community or how they had family & friends that had been helped by Monroe Harding.  That is a legacy I want to support!

Monroe-Harding exemplifies love in action.  The young people who are sometimes angry and always hurting, can find a staff that is not only skilled but compassionate and caring.  I know this because one of the staff is a personal friend and I see his dedication and compassion, his meticulous attention to detail and his willingness to 'go the extra mile' for both the youth in his care and for the staff with whom he works.  He is one of many who work tirelessly to provide quality care at Monroe-Harding.

Monroe Harding	115415		/users/profile/157183	ra5564	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/15/2012	Monroe Harding has been a successful program for many years and continues to serve children and families daily.  Their ability to work with children from the child welfare system and to help children and families move forward is amazing. 
Monroe Harding	115413		/users/profile/157179	MP2010	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2012	Monroe Harding truly does what they say they do- change young people's lives. This place gives children and youth in state's custody the chance for a better life. Nashville has many non-profits, but this one has been around for so long and day in and day out they continue to do all they can to help these youth!
Monroe Harding	115408		/users/profile/157173	Tonya H.	Volunteer	5	06/15/2012	 Many times challenging children are given up on, but with Monroe Harding many of these children have been given the opportunity to change their lives in a positive way and have went on to be successful young adults! I am an active foster parent through Monroe Harding. The concern and love they show each and every child that is placed through them is amazing. I recommend them to anyone who shows an interest in foster care. They are staffed with great people and have many wonderful programs. Supporting the work of Monroe Harding's programs is helping the communities around you because the children that come through their programs are the leaders of our future!

When I seen Danny ,how personable he was with all the people. I just melted and got goose bumps hearing the story of the kids ,then listening to the kids sing and perform . What talent they all had I was very impressed and would volunteer again.   Linda from the Ladies of Harley.

Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	140324	1	/users/profile/186497	kay h	Donor	5	11/15/2012	I have been supporting Sophia's Heart since 2009 and am very appreciative of the work they do.  I recently attended a performance of the Milwaukee Sophia's Heart Choir and Dance team and was very impressed with the growth, talent, and enthusiasm of these young people.  From their humble beginnings just a few short years ago until now, the dedication and joy can be seen in not only the kids who benefit from the program but the dedicated volunteers who mentor and develop these students into mature and responsible future adults.  In addition to the music and arts program I am happy to contribute to very deserving scholarship winners and to the SH mission to help homeless families in Nashville.  This is truly a worthy organization.
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139846	1	/users/profile/185989	PenR	Volunteer	4	11/15/2012	I am a huge fan and supporter of Sophia's Heart.  I believe in the organization and I am amazed at what has been accomplished in such a short time since it's inception.  I have been a volunteer for over a year now and have seen the difference the programs are making in the lives of young people in the music and arts programs, as well as families who have been given a 2nd chance to get back on their feet and re-engage in life.  Seeing the positive impact Sophia's Heart is making on the lives it touches makes me all the more passionate about furthering the goals of the organization in whatever ways I can!  If you are looking for an opportunity to be a part of something that changes people's lives at a foundational level, please consider supporting Sophia's Heart!
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139818	1	/users/profile/185957	Christy S	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	It's hard for me to believe it has been nearly four years since I began volunteering for this life changing organization! Not only does it change the life of the many people who receive help, in one of the several amazing opportunities Sophia's Heart provides, but it has changed my life as well! I consider myself to be very fortunate to be a volunteer for this foundation!  I have met many great people,  whether they be a fellow volunteer, one of the many generous donators, or someone benefiting from the foundation. It is my personal goal to go to Nashville and help at SH of Compassion. I feel that my volunteer efforts can never be enough. There are so many people in need, and we are definitely helping them "one heart at a time". May God bless everyone involved in the organization in whichever capacity they are in; from volunteer to recipient! And, of course, may God bless Daniel J. Gokey for starting this foundation during the most difficult time of his life! I must also acknowledge and thank his wife, Leyicet, for all she has done and continues to do for Sophia's Heart. It is great working with such amazing and inspirational people!  And I can not wait for next years Gala! I know it will be a huge success! Thank you to all our leaders for all your hard work and efforts. I know the families and children effected by SH are eternally grateful for everything!  
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139560	1	/users/profile/185680	CoriZ	Donor	5	11/14/2012	I have been happy to support Sophia's Heart for the last 3 years and will continue to do so.  I know my dollars are being put to good use, for example the music and arts programs in both Milwaukee and Nashville, college scholarships for deserving students, several programs for the homeless and others in need.  I am honored to be a part of this wonderful organization.
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139539	1	/users/profile/185663	jezzie	Donor	5	11/14/2012	I've watched Sophia's Heart grow from a very small start to now serving children learn through music & arts in two cities, granting several scholarships to very impressive students seeking higher education. and establishing needed programs to serve the homeless and others in need.  I've been fortunate to meet several of the volunteers and staff, almost all unpaid, who have made this happen out of their commitment to their local communities and the programs they have been building together. Because Sophia's Heart is a relatively new non-profit, it's easy to see that donations truly make a difference in its ability to meet its goals. 
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139483	1	/users/profile/185601	Marcia D.	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	One heart touching many.  I love that tagline for this great non-profit.  Sophia's Heart has touched so many lives the last few years and continues to grow in numerous ways, recently expanding its programs to include help for those in human trafficking.  This program has joined other offerings that include awarding scholarships to kids who have overcome a severe obstacle, keeping homeless families together for temporary housing instead of splitting them up which is the norm, plus giving them necessary lifeskills training, providing a relief center during Nashville's flood a few years ago, and providing music and arts programs for youth who need to reestablish themselves in a positive way in their community and allow dreams to evolve.   I have been a volunteer for this organization for over 3 years, serving in both Wisconsin and in Nashville.  It has been so rewarding for me personally to see kids who are hurting due to a multitude of issues and lack of reason to dream that their lives can get better, rise above the difficulties. Many of the kids talk about how participating in Sophia's Heart programs has made them a better son or daughter, better friend and a more happy person.  This revitalization in turn can help the whole family unit become better adjusted and look to a brighter future.  Danny Gokey, Sophia's Heart's founder, had the vision to give hurting families a reason to keep their dreams intact and in turn, has turned lives around for many people who needed to see that their dreams are not gone...they just needed the tools to see them again.  He has asked others, including his volunteers, to step up and help him bring his vision into reality, carefully thinking through necessary steps and goals so dignity is kept intact for those hurting while pertinent skills are taught to make a permanent change in the families' conditions for future growth.  He also makes it known he is able to relate to hardship and shattered dreams that the kids and families experience since he also experienced this when he lost his wife Sophia due to an unexpected medical tragedy. He shows by his real life example that keeping the faith and accepting help when it is needed most can rebuild a life.  I am very proud to support this organization that keeps evolving to meet the needs of others in a multitude of ways and shows genuine concern and compassion for others.
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139460	1	/users/profile/185577	LaurieVogt	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	The honor of serving as a volunteer for Sophia's Heart Foundation has been mine for the past (nearly) four years.  The mission and vision of SHF initially touched my heart, and I knew I wanted to be involved.  I had no way of knowing how very much being a volunteer would FILL my heart.  The life-changing events and moments of which I have been a part have been life changing for me!  Two years ago, we gave away bicycles to underprivileged children for Christmas - as a surprise!  We've donated turkey meals to families for Thanksgiving.  We have raised money to fund music and arts programs for adolescents who would otherwise never have such an opportunity.  What an honor to watch these kids grow and develop into talented performers!  We've taken cruises to raise money for SHF - so much fun and so beneficial!  This organization means so much to me that I actually had a dream about SHF opening a facility for displaced families.  Six months later, God delivered a building for us in Nashville - now known as Sophia's Heart of Compassion!  AMAZING!  Recently, we held our first annual Gala in Milwaukee, WI.  I was moved to tears by the generosity of attendees, donors and volunteers.  SHF has amazing leadership, generous donors, and dedicated volunteers.  And, we have the support of the Good Lord above.  We truly are changing the lives and mending the hearts of broken families and children with broken dreams.  When Daniel J. Gokey began this foundation, he said he wanted it to become a movement.  I believe it truly has.  I am honored to serve, and I look forward to see how we'll continue to change the world ... one child, one family at a time.  It's only LOVE!  
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139454	1	/users/profile/185571	Lucysfave	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I have been involved in the Sophia's Heart Scholarship program by reviewing, ranking and selecting recipients for the scholarship awards for deserving students.  The scholarships are targeted at kids that have overcome significant personal challenges, earned good grades and chosen to give back to their community.  Wonderful kids and the scholarships have helped them financially and provided encouragement/recognition of their achievements!    I have also volunteered in regards to the Music and Arts programs and the Homeless facility in Nashville.  SHF is helping kids and their parents.  
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139144	2	/users/profile/185248	beyoutiful	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I have been helping Sophia's Heart for the past three years. I have truly seen people's life  been changed in many way in Nashville area. From music program,flood relief  and helping & equipping homeless family to live a better life thru classes & mentorship, people are very much appreciated all the help in every area when they need most in life. It's also a great pleasure to serve others & see their life to be changed & they become a much better person in life. I know Sophia's Heart will help many people & children who need help. They are certainly make the community a better place. Thank you for your heart and passion! 
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	139135	2	/users/profile/185240	Rosie10155	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I volunteered at the First Annual Sophia's Heart Gala and had a chance to hear the Sophia's Heat Choir sing and listen to their stories of how this foundation has helped them.  The choir was awesome, so many talented kids who have been given a chance to be a part of something so great. Listening to them sing and their stories of hope was inspiring .
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	138985	2	/users/profile/185077	Miracle of God	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I have been a volunteer for over 2 years now. In the last 2 years I have seen how God has provided the means for us to reach out to our community here in the middle tenn area. Our organization allows a family to stay together when they need a place to live. Our programs help our families to have a new start. Our staff and volunteers are dedicated to the vision and work together in unity to get the job done. I have volunteered in different areas of this organization and it has been a blessing to my life and a calling as well. I have seen first hand the heart that our founder Danny Gokey has and for a young man his age to have such a heart to help people it brings you to tears and you feel very blessed to be apart of that vision that God gave him years ago and see that vision become a reality. I look forward to the years to come as I know that through all of us who are apart of this organization with hard work and determination and God leading us change for the better will happen in our community.
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	138972	1	/users/profile/185064	WHSR	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/14/2012	It has been an honor being a part of Sophia's Heart for the past year. When making a difference in an area of what matters most, people's lives, I can say it is at the core very touching. Watching men and women, boys and girls come in devasted through lifes hardtimes it is a blessing to watch them leave with self confidence that they can make it in life. Working in the areana of homelessness you may realize that self worth is at an all time low, but seeing their face when they leave many with a chance to get their own place and moving in a direction that makes them feel like they do matter because someone took the time to say I Love You, with more than words. Yes, it is a blessing to serve an organization that believe in people and want to do something to stop the cycle of homelessness especially when the devastation is stopping the children from becoming who they were meant and desire to be. 
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	138928	1	/users/profile/185018	starfter	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2012	Supporting and helping homeless is not an easy task.  When you working with the homeless family, it adds more complications to the conditions of mix men and women in the same building.  Sophias Heart is taking the challenge not just to provide the place for the homeless family as one family, but provides proper tools to assist these needed people. They believe the mind and attitude changes are the solution.  Financial change is just a surface change.  Sophias Heart is the only non-profit to keep married couples as one family in the middle TN area. Sophias Heart is the only non-profit to access single dad with kids. Sophias Heart is the only organization to provide the opportunity for people who need the 2nd chance.  Great work guys!

To see how the organization has grown over the past two years is amazing and heart warming.  The "light" in the children's eyes as they perform their hearts out is inspirational.  The vision and future of the organization is bright and one that will influence generations of children to come providing them with hope, joy and talent.

Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	138755	1	/users/profile/184834	Steven26	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	Sophia's Heart continues to help those in need with the resources God provides for Sophia's Heart through the friends and donors of Sophia's Heart.  Sophia's Heat is currently hosting performing arts classes for 38 middle and high school students in Milwaukee and housing single mothers and families in Nashville.  It is a privilege to watch Danny Gokey and his professional volunteers and staff face the challenges that come before them in their efforts to honor Sophia, Danny's first wife.  Sophia passed away shortly before Danny entered the American Idol contest during Season 8.  He did this at the urging of his family and friends to continue this quest that he and Sophia began.  Danny refused to use insurance proceeds he received from Sophia's death for anything other than creating a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation named Sophia's Heart.        
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	138751	1	/users/profile/184830	rwaagen	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	My first volunteering experience with Sophia's Heart was in December, 2010.  In Milwaukee, they had a wonderful concert with Danny and the choir.  Specially selected children were invited to the event for the concert.  They enjoyed home-made Christmas cookies and a special surprise at the end of the day;  A brand new bicycle for Christmas.  The memory of their  joy and excitement  made my Christmas extra special that year.

Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	138699	1	/users/profile/184775	Karen128	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I've been volunteering at SHF in Milwaukee since 2009.  I'm become increasingly more active over time because I've seen and recognized the changes we are making in our community.  At our First Annual Gala on November 3, 2012 we saw the children in the Sophia's Heart music and dance program perform and we handed out  a scholarship to a deserving child that is striving to overcome horrible financial hardship.  The changes we make and the good things that we do are impacting the lives of others.  
Sophias Heart Foundation Inc	138679	1	/users/profile/184757	mfafef	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I have been a supporter of Sophia's Heart since 2009.  I have watched this organization grow from its infancy and am proud to be both a donor and volunteer.  I have been able to personally witness the positive effects that Sophia's Heart has on inner city youth.  I have also witnessed the sense of relief among homeless families that they have a place to live.  The passion and inspiration behind Sophia's Heart are what initially appealed to me.  However, seeing the effects on population we serve makes being a supporter even more rewarding.  I highly recommend becoming a partner with Sophia's Heart!

I have watched this foundation and their volunteers as they work to enrich  children's lives through music and dance.  At each event I see the faces of these young people glow more as they gain more confidence.  Sophia's Heart not only helps children but also has programs to help the homeless.  I cannot think of a charity I would rather trust to use my funds to the fullest.

Much of this information is left out of the media and never truly brought to the publics attention.  I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the enthusiasm and dedication that alpha omega shows toward our local veterans and also their promotion of veteran rights on the national level.  Everyone should take a page out of their book and lend a helping hand to those who fought for our rights.

For the past three decades, this organization has faithfully helped more than 10,000 military veterans in the Memphis area recover from physical combat and service-related conditions, including anger management, substance abuse, combat stress, PTSD and various mental health disorders. As a result of the housing, food, clothing, transportation and counseling programs provided by AOVS, many of those who served our country now have the chance to successfully rejoin society and engage in healthy, independent living. Alpha Omegas mission is more important today than its ever been and certainly worthy of being one of our communitys top priorities.

I now work for and fully support the mission of Alpha Omega Veterans Services.  Alpha Omega Veterans Services serves those who have put their lives on the line to protect the rest of us.

One conversation with Lila Jean set my mind at ease. Every dog that she rescues is given the very best medical attention as well as tons of love. When I brought my puppy to the vet, he was truly amazed at the organization of the paperwork and astounded at the wonderful medical attention she had received from Dogs in Harmony. He said he's treated thousands of dogs from rescues but had never seen any who had received such amazing, thorough medical care prior to adoption. Aside from the excellent medical services and organized paperwork, Lila Jean provided helpful tips to aid my puppy's adjustment and she was available to answer any questions I had. My precious baby, Maggie has been with me for almost three years now. She is the most lovable, gentle, funny and sweet dog I ever met. I thank God every day for Lila Jean, her tireless work with Dogs in Harmony and my perfect furever friend, Maggie.

I had a huge hole in my heart and knew the best way to honor Phoebe would be to adopt another dog and shower it with all my love. I began my search online and stumbled upon Dogs in Harmony. I contacted Lila Jean and she responded quickly. We were on vacation in Disney World and it was very difficult to hear her but she was so understanding and sweet. The paperwork was a breeze because it was so organized and easy to read. The fee was very reasonable as well. My precious Maggie was transported from Tennessee to a location near my home by two southern gentleman. While my husband and I were anxiously awaiting her arrival, we had the pleasure of meeting fellow adopters. Nearly two years have passed and I still keep in touch with the fellow adopters as well as Lila Jean! When we took Maggie for her first vet visit, our vet was shocked at how well she had been cared for. Many rescues do not provide all the health services Maggie had received before she was adopted. I could not be happier with Dogs in Harmony! Lila Jean is an angel on earth, who loves and cares for these precious babies until she finds them the perfect furever homes. My Maggie is the sweetest, gentlest, most loving dog I ever met and she's the perfect match for our family. I am so grateful to Lila Jean for all her tireless devotion and her endless love. When we are ready to adopt again, I will definitely be contacting Lila Jean at Dogs in Harmony :)

From her two Yorkshire Terriers and two Irish Setters when I first met her, to her farm a few years later, and then to her move to Tennessee and starting her own rescue. When you look at the sun at noontime, that is nothing compared to the light in Lila's eyes when she helps an animal. Anyone who knows her or has adopted an animal from her is better for having known her. God bless Lila Jean - an angel here on earth.

Well 19 years, 1 kid and 2 cats later, he finally got to pick the dog. He searched on different sites and it always ended on bad reviews. Then he stumbled upon pictures of these really cute beagle pups. He inquired and that's when we met Lila Jean. That litter was spoken for but she listened to what we were looking for and showed us pics of a litter she just got, in fact some where born in the car on her way home from a shelter that the mom was just rescued from! We immediately fell in love with our 4-legged baby girl Rocky. We live in NJ and people asked why we were adopting from Tennessee vs somewhere local. Well, it's because we knew right away when we spoke with Lila that this was our rescue. She has a passion that we cannot put into words. These are her babies. She was very upfront with the process, gave frequent updates and pics despite the endless hours required. The fee was super reasonable and the pickup from the K9 Cowboy is a story we will forever tell. Our Rocky is loving and affectionate. Her first night home we knew this pup had been cuddled and received many, many belly rubs before coming to her forever home. That shows the level of love and care the dogs are provided. We would highly recommend Dogs in Harmony to anyone interested. Thank you Lila Jean and all of your volunteers for making our family complete!

It is not too late for others. I give so that others may better live! There are many memorable times I have given to NSDF; all have led to victory! For instance, the time, talent, and treasure I gave to help NSDF help a member fund her seizure service dog. Because I gave, I know she will have a higher quality of life as her seizure service dog increases her peace and security.

In 2009 I sustain a tbi and near death, after 2 week coma and finally awoke I was transfered back home from N.C. and began my recovery. Although I have lost my balance and did 3 face plants along with 4 falls none were cause by a seizure. Thru the sites about TBI my hope of not ever having a TBI sEIZURE was changed from no actvity to wait and see. My daughter's family relocated to here in hoprs she could assist me. On the day I came home she was in hospital for seizure precautions , as she had a episode while being evaluated for gallbladder inflamation This immediately became an issue of us caring for her. HER SEIZURES ARE POST mTBI from MVA. Adding to this situation MY BROTHER received trauma to his head and inner cranial bleed requiring partial lobectomy and 3 month hospitalization . A month later he had his first seizure diagnosed non epileptic seizure. The xray staff and ER Nurses witness 3 more episodes. He was on way for cat scan, which I was told normal considering the injury received and its life alteration. Thru this sites interaction I have received info about meds, others experience with home care, unanted side effects of their meds. This info help me and wife care for my brother .

I acquired Epilepsy at age 45  not knowing a thing about it. I was scared and felt alone. This group opened their arms night and day and helped me through very tough times. I am still learning every day and still at times am very trepidatious of the things I am going through but with all the help and knowledge this group has given me I feel much more comfortable and not alone and know that I will make it through with friends that care about me and will help me every step of the way.

And when I think I can't watch her suffer another day I am reminded by all of the kindness and understanding at NSDF that I'm not alone. And that there are parents out there that would give anything to have their children back with them- children they have lost to seizures. Thanks to NSDF for always being there to offer information, resources and kindness but most of all for reminding me we are never alone in our fight against epilepsy. 
National Seizure Disorders Foundation	149616	2	/users/profile/190823	Jeanne P.	Volunteer	5	02/19/2013	 I have found the National Seizure Disorders Foundation to be Very Informative w/ Lots of Great people. This is a Great Site to Learn more about Epilepsy and the ways to Cope. A 'home' where people w/ seizure disorders can ask questions, comment, vent or just be there for others' who need assistance/support. As a member of Several Epilepsy Groups, I can truthfully say this is the Best Group I have belonged to in a Long Time.

This agency and Tonya have helped me tremendously, even with calming my over the top fears of SUDEP. This is an amazing community and I'm blessed to be a part of it. Tonya is THE most amazing person who is more positive than anyone I've ever met even after going through all that she has and does.  I am excited at the growth and for the future of this organization!!!
National Seizure Disorders Foundation	149613	2	/users/profile/199463	k.petrucci	Client Served	5	02/19/2013	My 9 year old daughter was formally diagnosed with epilepsy in August 2011. She suffered from febrile seizures (or so docs thought) as a toddler & what we assumed were night terrors (as she would wake up soaked in sweat, shrieking inconsolably, & pupils totally dilated). Her symptoms disappeared for some years & resurfaced when she was just shy of 8 years old. It was all a bit confusing, as she rolled off of a chair after just nodding off & hit her head/neck. She seized for over 10 minutes & when she came to was totally out of it & was unable to answer basic questions. ER docs assumed the fall itself was what caused her seizure. However, my daughter said that she "felt funny" (tingling/pain in her legs & disoriented prior to her fall). Several months later, she suffered 2 more seizures after just nodding off into sleep & was finally referred to a neurologist at Children's Hospital in Denver. Turns out she has sleep-induced secondarily generalized seizures. Heightened contrast was discovered through a sleep deprived EEG & an MRI (with & without contrast) confirmed an abnormality in her right frontal lobe region of her brain. Through several med trials & a diet change we have been able to manage her seizures (*knock on wood). She has been seizure-free for the past 4-1/2 months. The NSDF group has been so beneficial. I have learned so much about different types of seizures & get a lot of support/advice from others in this wonderful community. Thank you NSDF as I am truly grateful & honored to be a member of this group!

Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	270390	2	/users/profile/359106	Vera4	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2015	The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis is the premier youth development organization in the Midsouth. They have great leadership, beautiful facilities and a highly motivated and trained staff. Please join me in supporting this incredible organization... Memphis needs them! 
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	269092	3	/users/profile/357821	Writer	Former staff	5	10/29/2015	I am a part time teacher who has experience with working at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis.  My son, also, is a member.  It is an excellent program for our youth for a lot of reasons.  A few notable ones include the following:  The BGCM give our youth the support that they need educationally, mentally, physically, and emotionally.  During the afterschool hours, students have a safe haven to go to.  Therefore, they can get assistance with homework, continue their learning, become motivated about their future after graduating from high school, and they get to have a nice meal should parents be working.  It keeps them out of the streets and out of harm's way.  Additionally, the summer program that the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis has is an excellent alternative to kids staying at home and possibly getting into trouble while parents are working.  
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	267435	2	/users/profile/356169	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2015	The vision of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis showcases the organization perfectly: "Provide a world-class experience that assures success is within reach of every young person who enters our doors, with all members on track to graduate from high school with a plan for the future, demonstrating good character and citizenship, and living a healthy lifestyle." The Clubs provide a safe and fun atmosphere that allows members to grow through various learning opportunities that the members may never have access to on their own. If you were to ask any of the members at the 6 area Clubs and Technical Training Center why they come to the Clubs it wouldn't be for the basketball or because their parents make them - instead it would be because of the caring staff and volunteers and the high standards that they are kept to. 
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	267405	3	/users/profile/356135	Mark1081	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis provide an essential service to this city. By providing these kids with a supportive, healthy place to spend their after school hours, the Clubs fight many of the negative influences our youth come up against. The Technical Training Center should be a model for other after school organizations: these trainees are given so many resources to find jobs and post-high school education. 
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	267401	2	/users/profile/356133	FrankLamanna	Board Member	5	10/26/2015	I have been involved with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis for almost 15 years.  When I see the kids that go through our program, it is very motivating and compelling to give both personally and professionally to the organization.  There is such a void any many kids lives for positive role models and environments.  The BGCM fills that void helps produce quality and productive young adults here in Memphis.  I don't believe there is organization in our city that is in a position to make this type of impact on our kids.
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	267373	2	/users/profile/356103	TwoWheeler	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	I am a volunteer teaching pool at the Oakhaven Boys and Girls club and very aware of the everyday operations.  I am impressed  that these clubs do extensive background and drug testing on volunteers and employees protecting the youth.  I have been teaching at this club now for about two years and Miss Evelyn Young, the executive director, takes great personal pride and care in running this facility.  The equipment is always maintained, the facility is always clean and there are always improvements taking place. She deals with all issues quickly and fairly while maintaining a positive, controlled and safe environment. The Oakhaven youth enjoy many in-house programs and sports that keeps members very busy.  Miss Evelyn has also created a program for older youth on Friday nights keeping them off the streets.  She is creative and always looking for new ways to help her kids.  I am proud to be associated with this club and will continue into the future.  Memphis needs more of these facilities and caring, concerned directors like Miss Young.

Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	266779	3	/users/profile/355535	Writer	General Member of the Public	4	10/23/2015	The Oakhaven Boys & Girls Club of Greater Memphis provides an excellent opportunity for young people to have a clean, warm, nurturing and safe place to go after school.  It is also comforting to know the club provides snacks and meals for the attendees and assists them with homework.  I especially like that the club provides limited work experience for several of the teens, which teaches them responsibility, and helps them learn good work ethics early in life.  
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	266662	2	/users/profile/355421	Writer	Board Member	4	10/23/2015	I have been on the Board of the BGCM since 1993 and can attest to the fact that it is a fundamental part of the social fabric of Memphis. With as many 'at risk youth' as we have in our city, lending them a hand in their journey towards becoming productive citizens is now more important than ever !
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	266646	2	/users/profile/355405	Evelyn Y.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/23/2015	My connection to Boys & Girls Clubs spans about 45 years...38 of those years as an employee  in three different states. Not only has my family benefited from the many resources the Club has offered, but I have learned to be the best I am. Now I am serving and giving back a wealth of competence, a sense of belonging, a willingness to influence others and  a useful attitude to care. Truly, the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis will change the life of a child who needs a fun, safe place to be. Parents can be confident that the Club  is more than just a hangout place...we are a home away from home. Had it not been for our Club in Omaha, Nebraska, my brothers and I would surely have different ending to our stories. Thank you Boys  Girls Clubs for making a difference in my life and for making me...a phenomenal woman!

I know we provide quality programs and the dollars are spent wisely. Anyone who drops by a club and wants a tour will be guided by one or more of "our" kids and they will be more than happy to tell "their" personal story.

Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	266425	2	/users/profile/355195	roybell	Board Member	5	10/22/2015	One of the greatest issues facing the Memphis inner city youth is the breakdown of the traditional family structure. The Boys and Girls Club of Greater Memphis provides a supervised community with positive role models and and programs that help our youth make the right decisions as they navigate the difficult years of adolescence. The BGCM is the home and family that so many of our children do not have. The Memphis organization has been able to provide these services on a very tight budget over these last several years in a tough economy.
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	139758	4	/users/profile/185887	bertbarnett	Board Member	5	11/15/2012	The Boys and Girls Clubs is my primary long-lasting community involvement. Since 1966 when I was introduced to the works of the then one small club, I have been convinced that more is being done with less by this organization to nurture the growth of inner city kids. The measurable outcomes, such as 100% high school graduation rate of last year's seniors, is testimony to the devotion and competence of the staff. The Boys and Girls Clubs are a high impact positive force in our community. Bert Barnett

They truly have a servants heart for these kids and anytime I stop by there everyone has a smile. You can tell they are devoted to serving their community by offering opportunities to children that wouldn't receive them any other way. I hear stories from these kids saying they never would have never had the hope of graduating high school without the encouragement and programs offered from the Boys and Girls Club. I am so grateful to this organization and their staff for all that they do!!

Smith) club for about a year and can not think of a better way to serve to the city of Memphis.  It is true that our children are our future, and the Boys and Girls clubs of Greater Memphis provide an environment that cultivates learning.  The most recent statistics (2009) that I've seen show the graduation rate for Boys and Girls Clubs seniors at 98.8% versus 61% for Memphis City Schools.  Education is a key part to success later in life, and these kids will be ready for the challenge.
Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	87931	2	/users/profile/98747	RandyMc	Board Member	5	04/28/2011	The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis is, in my opinion, the most effective youth services organization in the area.

The Clubs have literally saved lives and has almost five decades of alumni to show as proof.

The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis is the Salvation, we take our kids out of diseasters each day in their homes, BGCM is the person there for their pain and hurt that they face each day.  BGCM is the religious place for kids, we teach them right from wrong.  BGCM is the Education place for our kids, we stress the importance of Education each day in our Clubs, we graduate 97.6%.  We are family for most of these kids, we are their mother, father, brother and sister.  We do so much, but we need to reach more.  We reach 7300 a year, we need to reach all the kids out there that need us the most.  BGCM is here for all those kids and we will continue to reach more.

You name it. Nothing compares to the kind of success we see everyday in our Boys & Girls Clubs.  If only we could take all of our youth today and guide them through the BGCM system, this city would be a very different place just a few years down the line.  Just imagine a city with a 98% high school graduation rate or rare teen pregnancy!

Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Memphis	87252	2	/users/profile/97886	Mr. Shaw	Board Member	4	04/26/2011	The Boys & Girls Club of Greater Memphis (BGCGM) has been an organization that's helped the families in this community for many years by providing a special & safe place for children to learn, grow & gain exposure to the world around them.  As a board member for many years, not only do I help raise the funds to carry out the mission, I parcipate and communicate directly with club members and staff to gain perspective on how the club is going.  I choose to give of my time and talents to be a part of an organization that truly is involved in children's lives, tries to enhance the character of every child and provide a safe, clean place for them to come to.  This organization has always been about putting the best staff with the best programs in the clubs which produces the best children possible who come from disadvantage situatons.  And when you put this organization in front of a community that can see the benefits, you can get people and board members like me who truly see how this organization should be supported.  We need to keep asking people to give a little time and a lot of money to this effort.  The founders of the Boys Club are getting old or have past on but their community spirit and sense of purpose needs to be rekindled in others today so that this organization continues to provide safe places to for children.

Teen Challenge of East Tennessee	11662	2	/users/profile/13600	Meems	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I have served as a volunteer with Teen Challenge at the Women's Crisis Center for several years. I must admit that each time I am asked to volunteer, I'm a little reluctant to give up my "day off" activities. However, there is not one single time that I have gone that I haven't come home high on blessings. I cannot sing enough praises about the staff led by Barbara Mitchell; they are not only spiritual, but they actually care about the program. I know that Barbara leads by example and each of them give much more than is required to just "get the job done". Volunteering at the center has enabled me to get acquainted with the ladies going through the program and listen to their stories. This has left me with many memories - some heartbreaking, some horrendous, and some downright hilarious. I LOVE this organization and feel truly blessed to have had the opportunity to be a small part of this truly remarkable program.

Teen Challenge is one of our best resources not only for rehabilitation but for programming, counseling, and literate. Barbara, Lou, and staff are very easy to work with and as we serve our population we can refer them to Teen Challenge with confidence - confidence in follow through, appropriate placement, and outcome.  Barbara and usually a woman who has successfully completed the rehabilitation program go into the jail with us once a quarter.  I is always one of the most inspiring and motiving sessions we have.

They have long been a vital resource of hope for troubled individuals and families in the area. From counselling to temporary housing, they provide pratical help coupled with sincere loving care for problems ranging from substance and/or physical abuse to long term rehabilitaion of women who find themselves imprisoned for misdemeanor charges.I have a young daughter who has an on going problem with alcohol and may face a jail sentence in the future. I am extremely thankful for a place like Teen Challenge that can offer her more than a sentence behind bars and actually has the resources to help her successfully change her lifestyle. As a parent, I'm very impressed and relieved to know that there is a place like Teen Challenge available for families with young women who need help.

I can truly say that Barbara and the staff strive for excellence in all that they do. They have a heart for those in need in the Knoxville area. I have attended several events over the years like the Tent Meeting and Parade of Tables. This organization is worthy of praise. I have heard the testimonies of several ladies that have gone through this program and come out as strong citizens in their community, ready to serve and give back to others in need. I support Teen Challenge of East TN because of their integrity, commitment to excellence, and their proven record of changing lives for the positive. This organization should be commended for their impact in the Knoxville Community and the surrounding areas.

Not only are they helped physically and mentally with their problems but Teen Challenge works from the inside (spiritually) out to make sure that the demon of self destruction does not return. This organization serves anyone and everyone that has a need. The positive results are almost 100% if candidates will simply give theirselves to the program. Praise God for the hearts of the Teen Challenge team!

It has been an honor to meet and support Barbara Mitchell and Teen Challenge.  The work that they do in our community is amazing.  They truly are making a difference and changing lives!!  I believe in this program with all my heart and only wish we had more financially to give to this program so that it could meet the needs of more individuals in our community.

Teen Challenge of East Tennessee	11132	1	/users/profile/13071	MGribble	Former Volunteer	5	09/28/2009	I was a counselor for Teen Challenge and saw first-hand the great need. Most of the clients served did not have the ability to pay or donate toward their services. Teen Challenge ALWAYS ministered and would try to find a way to meet clients' needs regardless of their circumstances. This is a worthy cause because it makes a difference in families, the community and God's kingdom. Many of the clients served were teenagers from surrounding communities who were struggling to make good choices and go against peer and community pressure to take the easy road with drugs and alcohol.
Teen Challenge of East Tennessee	11130	1	/users/profile/13070	dla1954	Volunteer	4	09/28/2009	At first as a volunteer I spent every other weekend at the crisis center. On Saturdays we would have free time, bible study, writing in journals, reading, talking, crying. I took the ladies to church on Sunday.  This was my first experience doing volunteer work of this kind.  Spending time with the women that came through the center was a blessing. A blessing that I had not expected. The Teen Challenge staff became my second family after my church family.  I was doubly blessed! As a volunteer now I help where needed.  It may be to take the ladies to church, helping teach bible study or helping with fund raisers. My church has become involved with Teen Challenge by offering manual labor and financial support. Praise the Lord for Teen Challenge!

Teen Challenge of East Tennessee	11068	1	/users/profile/13001	candybowl	Volunteer	5	09/26/2009	I have been a volunteer at Teen Challenge for many years. The past several years I have given my time to help cater banquets and ministry events. During these events I have seen men and women who have lost all hope find hope once again through the message of Jesus Christ that Teen Challenge offers them. Teen Challenge offers free counseling to anyone in need and residential referrals to men and women for long-term care for drug and alcohol addiction. The most recent and awesome undertaking of Teen Challenge of East Tennessee is the opening of the Ladies Crisis Center. During minstry events I have seen women in need be able to escape from an addicted and controlled lifestyle and enter into a place of safety and deliverance. What an awesome ministry!!
Teen Challenge of East Tennessee	11054	2	/users/profile/12983	jesus91874	Volunteer	5	09/26/2009	I was a volunteer for TC of ET back in 04. When I started volunteering, I just wanted to give something of myself. I didnt know what a blessing would come to me.WHile working there, I KNEW about David Wilkersons work, because he led ME to Jesus in a Church revival in my hometown. I KNEW about the MOVIE The Cross and the Switchblade, but I DIDNT know about the BOOK that came before the movie.While I was volunteering there in ET, the other volunteers that had spent years more there before me, told me about the book, The Cross and the Switchblade! WHATTA BOOK. Its the FIRST BOOK in Mission Work, as far as I am concerned! WHile there, I read the book, and Pastor Wilkerson states in it, that the major problems of gangs are loneliness, and hatred. This was KEY to ME, because, the summer before, I was in Honduras on a mission trip with my Church, and went back for 4 more weeks to minister, because I met a lady whose daughter was MUREDERRED by a gang member, and left HER with a polio victim 5-yr-old girl to raise, on just 2 DOLLARS a DAY income! I SOMEHOW want to get the WORD out. THERE IS hope for kids thrown out in the streets because the parents cannot afford to feed them. God is revealed slowly, and the blessing to do it turns as slow, I am convinced!Then this one day while in the office, while answerring the phone for Barbara, a schizophrenic man calls. The call helped set my feet in missions and inspired me greatly.The man called many times a week to try to talk to Barbara for counseling. This one day, she was too busy, and asked me to tell him to call the next Monday (it was a Friday).So, I saw a possible oppurtunity to minister to him, possibly. I would try.I begin telling him that Barbara was busy and that she would like him to call again on Monday. He said ok, politely, with a quiverring voice. I asked him, why he needed counsel. He said that he was a schizophrenic, and that his dad had raped him as a boy.A while back, long before I started mission work, I learned that 90% of all mental illness comes from unforgiveness, and here I had an oppurtunity.I asked the man, Have you forgiven your dad? You could have guessed he would of said no, as he did. If PEOPLE that are NOT in bad situations could give ONE KIND THING in just VOLUNTEERING for Teen Challenge, they might help change the world in a corner of the Earth for the better! Its so simple, and so scary to do, but just takes ONE STEP FORWARD to send someone on the road to Jesus, and recovery.

Clowning, parking cars, etc.  I have personally seen lives changed through the Truth of Jesus Christ through Teen Challenge of East Tennessee.

My husband's hours then got cut and my babies needed fixed. They set me up with the "big dog special" that included the neutering of both dogs and a rabies shot!! While I was there my eyes were brought to the awesome prices they had on flea preventatives. They took such great care of my pups and the surgeon Keri spoke with me on the risks and the pros and what to expect after the surgery. Their surgery sites were clean and healed beautifully. If it were not for the awesome care of PPaws my dogs would have not been able to be neutered. I now use plows for their flea meds!! I recommended them to everyone!

We adopted a dog who showed up on our doorstep and made herself at home, but only because we were able to take her to PPAWs for checking over and spaying.  We were not able to afford to take our pup to the vet otherwise, and couldn't have kept her unspayed.  To our delight, they checked her over, pronounced her healthy, and began the procedure.  Imagine our surprise and delight when the vet came back out within about fifteen minutes to tell us when they shaved her they found a spaying tattoo!  "All you'll have to do is wait for her to wake up" they told us.  They were as delighted as we were and couldn't have been more helpful.  We continue to order our anti-flea meds for our three cats as well as our dog through PPAWs.  These are some of most helpful and generous people we know!

I chose to donate my time with this organization for several reasons, not the least of which is that I feel that spay/neuter is the ground zero solution to prevent over-crowding at area shelters that leads to high rates of euthanization.  PPAW makes low cost spay/neuter surgeries available to everyone, even those that can't afford to pay.  Their staff is cheerful and compassionate, and truly believe in what they are doing.  They help folks in every way imaginable, from low cost spay/neuter, to affordable vaccinations, to discounted flea products and feral cat TNR.  I am proud to be associated with this non-profit.

Keep Putnam County Beautiful Clean Commission Inc	74526		/users/profile/81435	Erica	General Member of the Public	2	02/24/2011	I live and work in Putnam County and see the litter linning the streets.  I myself take the time to separate and recycle everything I can and clean up the trash when I see it floating along the roadsides.  However, more funding is needed so everyone can be provided with a curbside bin designated solely for recycling making it convienient and seen.  Right now the way it is, we all have to take our recycling to designated area, now I don't mind doing this, but most people just can't or won't find the time.  This is a problem.  If Putnam County wanted to make the change, grants and funding are available not to mention the money the County could make off of recycled products.   As a region we are proud of our land and our beautiful plateau, we can become a leader in greening our communities if only we made the effort together and our elected official made recycling a budgeted priority.

I first noticed their presence at a local festival several years ago. The current coordinator, Lisa Luck, puts in many more hours than she is paid for because she is so committed to this work. In addition to speaking at various area schools, Lisa meets with community members, elected officials and local business people to discuss a variety of topics related to the work of the organization. This is my third year as a board member and I can tell you that this board does much more than meet once a month! We clean a section of roadway twice a year and we all volunteer to staff our booth at several annual community events in addition to keeping these events litter-free with the help of many volunteers.
Keep Putnam County Beautiful Clean Commission Inc	72817		/users/profile/79597	Gerry Kaller	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	It amazes me to see how a small group of people can affect a community so dramatically.  Cookeville has changed from a town inundated with litter to a proud community, conscious of clean-up, beautification and the need to recycle.  This has been due to an active board and a dedicated administrator, Lisa Luck.Litter-control reminders abound through display and information booths at local events and festivals.  School children and members of organizations are educated creatively to keep the city clean and  to recycle. The annual beautification awards for residences and businesses serve to encourage and reward.  Recycling sites are provided and solid waste managed.  Public events are monitored for litter by volunteers.   Individuals or groups take responsibility for designated pick-up.All this is accomplished with a small budget and a part-time director.  Increased funding could provide an office copy machine and additional educational materials.

The Clean Commission has a booth there for educational purposes as well as handling the huge job of litter pick-up throughout the event. This organization has made us all aware of how much can- and should be- recycled, and are willing to work hard to show us just  how to do that. I have a great appreciation and respect for Lisa Luck and the Clean Commission, and fully support them in their mission.
Keep Putnam County Beautiful Clean Commission Inc	68042		/users/profile/74358	Betty Case	Board Member	4	02/14/2011	When I first moved to Cookeville in l981 it was the amount of litter in this area that first caught my attention.  As a result, I was one of the first Board Members to the Clean Commission in the mid l980s. Since that time much time and effort has been spent on educating people about litter prevention, hazardous waste, recycling efforts, Adopt-A-Highway participants, property awards and so much more. As the number of new residents has grown in and around Putnam County over the years so has the amount of litter.  The need for curbside recycling is very real, massive education efforts in schools, civic clubs and businesses has to be addressed... all of this takes dollars and manpower. I am proud to live in this area for many reasons.  However, we have to find a way to make  every person care about their environment.. at home... at work... even on the golf course! I respectfully request that the Putnam County Clean Commission be considered for this prize.  Your dollars will be well spent!

The Commission attempts to educate, encourage and recoginize community members to recycle and prevent littering. Our county, as any county across the nation can attest, the litter problem we face is an epidemic, defacing the beautiful countryside of all our communities and generally saying to those visiting, "we really don't care about the litter and trash along our highways!" What a sad commentary on how the general public feels about the unsightly trach and garbage that is strewn everywhere!!! Until we all take more pride in where we live and how we can improve its aesthetic appearance, litter will forever be a plague on our environment.

It is an organization that relies heavily on donations and volunteers.  I have been in this community for over 20 years, and their presence is unbelievable considering their limited funding.  They have always done an amazing job promoting recycling, as well as educating the general public of its importance.  
Keep Putnam County Beautiful Clean Commission Inc	65553		/users/profile/71653	hcobbs	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/09/2011	The Clean Commission was founded a year after Keep Tennessee Beautiful was founded 26 years ago. Both organizations saw that the state was picking up litter but no one was trying to break the cycle of littering. Over the years this commission has made huge strides in improving, not only the problems of littering, but has also worked diligently to changes attitudes and encourage the community to take pride in where they work and live. Litter pick up and education are only a part of what they have accomplished. The Commission has spearheaded recycling projects and encouraged its citizens to "reduce, reuse and recycle", and sponsored  beautification projects across the county that have been a major factor in the improved appearance and character of their communities over the years. Keep Tennessee Beautiful and the state of Tennessee have received national recognition from Keep America Beautiful for being the first state in the nation to have 100% county participation in the Great American Cleanup and have accomplished this feat for the past four years. The Cookeville-Putnam County Clean Commission and their volunteers across the county have been one of the most active participants in this event each year and have strongly contributed to its success over the years.I cannot think of an organization the better exemplifies  the hard work and dedication that goes into maintaining such a worthwhile purpose in continually striving to better their community

During this time they have promoted a litter free program. They started an adopt a highway program. In conjunction with this program, our club has adopted a downtown park to keep it litter free.Our club donated money for the Ceal Commission to purchase recyling bins which are used for all major city events. Our club also purchased recycling bins for all the county public schools. The clean Commission is responsible for educating the public, especially the children of our community.  A wonderful organization. Bea O'Donnell

Their work is not only timely, but necessary.  Helping them to provide recycling bins in various schools in the area was of great pride to our club, especially since we did the easy part.  They continue to be out there reminding the community of the importance of keeping our environment and surroundings clean for future generations.  Without thei tireless efforts many would not have the option to do something as simple, yet crucial, as recycling.

One small action today can have a major ripple effect for the future.   If all organizations with the objectives of this one had the same impact relative to size and resources that this one does, it would be an amazing world.  Very impressive with the group and the goals.

They have a presence at all community events and help keep our city clean by educating our citizens and mobilizing volunteering efforts. The Clean Commission doesn't just direct, though. They get their hands dirty picking up litter across the city and Lisa Luck is always the first one to arrive and the last one to leave at Clean Commission project sites.

ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	301710	4	/users/profile/392687	J.D..	Donor	1	08/28/2016	I used to give money to St Jude sporadically since some months my funds are tighter than others, but I am going to find a different organization to donate to. I recently called St Jude to have them mail me a form so I could donate. A month went by and I never received anything. So I called back again and same thing, never received anything. Now 2 months have gone by and I call a 3rd time and explain to a woman the situation, and with no apology proceeds to ignore what I just explained to her and ask if I can have 19 dollars a month deducted from my account as if she didn't even care to listen to a thing I said. I finally had enough and told her nevermind and hung up. I then sent an email to the H.R. department letting someone know what's been going on. I have never gotten a response or even a call back. I guess unless you are only wanting to have monthly donations deducted from your bank account St. Jude does not want to deal with you. It's sad because I have never had this problem with St. Jude in years past. Sounds like they are getting a little too big for their britches. 
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	288618	7	/users/profile/378818	Paula86	Donor	1	05/05/2016	I called to pledge a monthly donation to St Jude's and right before the call ended, I was asked to pledge a single donation first ($50/$100 +)......I declined since I would be making donations each and every month.   Immediately after the $ was deducted from my checking account,  I received a form asking for a donation ($25/$50/+) along with personal return address labels.  If I wanted mailing address labels, I would purchase them and would not want St. Jude's to spend my donation dollars on unnecessary items & postage.  I have cancelled my monthly pledge and will decide how to proceed with getting my donation directly to who it should benefit........the children.
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	286926	1	/users/profile/376998	Jennifer_O	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I'm inspired to give back because of a sweet little boy, named Brandon, who unfortunately lost his battle with brain cancer.  Attending his funeral was eye-opening.  I knew about cancer, I have lost loved ones to cancer- my amazing dad most recently.  There is something unbearably painful about attending the funeral of a child that only wanted to live- the pain in the families eyes- the loss and complete sorrow of the parents who will never in all their time, be the same.  It humbles you- shakes you- and hopefully- makes you a better person because of it.  I now give back to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  They worked so hard to save Brandon's life.  They work tirelessly to save every child that comes through their doors- when you arrive- they are waiting for you and know your name in the admissions office- which has desks short enough so that the child can be a part of the discussions.  They want that.  They want you included, they want to answer your million+ questions- and they want to assure you that because you're a patient of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, you will never receive a bill.St. Jude covers all costs associated to the treatment of a child.  They cover food, housing, travel, and most importantly, the treatment itself.  If I were ever in the darkness of fear, worrying about my child, I would want a place like St. Jude to turn to.  That is why I need to help- why I need to give back.  They do so much for kids.  They do so much for their families.  Not to mention- providing school for those too sick to attend; graduation for kids who can move up in their academic grade; prom- they take donations of gowns and tux's so that the teenagers can experience something that should be a given in their lives.  St. Jude gives the kids and their families Christmas, Halloween, Easter- a chance to be normal in a world of chaos.St. Jude Children's Research Hospital gives back.  That's why I give back to them.
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	284875	4	/users/profile/374928	Writer	Donor	1	04/06/2016	I recently knew of a person who could reduce the credit card processing for ALSAC/ St. Jude,  This company GUARANTEED to beat the credit processing of give a $1000 donation.  Carol Crowder would not even let him come spend 20 minutes with her to prove to  her how he could reduce the charges.  She made a unilateral decision to NOT SAVE ALSAC THE MONEY.  IT just goes to show that ALSAC is not about saving money and have become like all other companies that take in donations, they piss it away!!!!!!!!!!!That is another reason I do not give to St. Jude or ALSAC!!!
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	275109	13	/users/profile/364671	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	12/29/2015	Why does St Jude Children's Research Hospital tout itself as angels of mercy, like a Mother Theresa organization when they pick and choose what children they will accept or reject?? To reject an innocent child like my son's 7 yr. old brother who had a benign, fast growing brain tumor which eventually took his life, is absolutely deplorable to me!! They are not an organization worthy of donations since there are children they just allow to die due to their insensitivity!
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	246368	10	/users/profile/333703	chuck88norris	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital is a very responsible and respectable institution.  I have been making donations and not fundraising with the organization and their personnel that I have had the pleasure to interact with have been extremely responsive and transparent with all the inquiries that I presented to them.  The company pays extra attention to ensure that every donor is well noticed and has a very strong system of donor retention.  I appreciate St. Jude's quality event planning and will be a long time participant in their events!
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	194067	21	/users/profile/253537	CraigDismuke	Client Served	5	02/10/2014	As the father of a patient at St. Jude, I wanted to weigh in on their fundraising.  First, and foremost, I want to thank anyone who has ever donated to St. Jude.  Its a big organization that has relied on small gifts from millions of people over the last 50 years.  And because of those gifts, St. Jude has better been able to understand and treat my sons type of rare cancer.  Ive been on both sides of the coin, and giving to St. Jude is very compelling.  It is an easy decision and it feels good to help children fight for their lives.  But when you become the beneficiary of those gifts, it is hard to describe how overwhelming the feeling of gratitude is.  I vividly remember driving onto their campus for the first time, how relieved my wife and I were to know that we were at the place that knew more about childhood cancer than any other place in the world.   As such, before I say anything about the fundraising process at St. Jude, I want to say thank you to everyone who has supported their work.  It is because of so many peoples generosity that St. Jude gives families like ours that peace-of-mind.   Officially, ALSAC is the fundraising organization responsible for raising 75 percent of the money that funds St. Jude each day.  It is a very big organization with two priorities.  First, a big part of what ALSAC does is telling the world about childhood cancer.  It is not a cause that is championed by religious groups, business, or government.  There is no big advocacy group.  There are small groups doing things around the world, usually related to families who have been affected by childhood cancer, but nothing significant.  That leaves ALSAC as the organization that keeps the cause in the publics attention through their various media outlets, all which cost money.  The second part of what they do is raise money for research and treatment of these diseases.  ALSAC employees something like 1,500 people and hosts hundreds of events each year for donors all over the country. They rely on a lot of volunteer hours as well.  ALSAC uses an external agency to benchmark their costs to make sure they are in-line with peer organizations.  While they have to keep their costs reasonable, they also need to attract talented professionals.  It is my experience that those talented professionals will work at ALSAC for less than they can make in the private sector.  But we need them to have good people because what they do is significant.  As it relates to their CEO pay, remember that they list two CEOs.  One is the CEO of ALSAC, Rick Shadyac, who makes a little bit less than the peer average even though he is an unbelievable leader for that organization and left a lucrative career in the private sector.  We know him personally.  We met him the first week we were at the hospital.  He remembered my sons name after the first time he met him.  He knows all of the children it seems.  He is visibly anguished when a child loses their battle, which unfortunately still happens.  And he is a tireless advocate for them.  He is the leader in the cause of fighting childhood cancer and we need him in that spot.  There is also a CEO of the hospital, St. Jude, whose salary is reported.  That has been Dr. William Evans, although he is in the process of retiring as CEO.  Dr. Evans is a renowned scientist who St. Jude has been lucky to have.  My family is so grateful that people have given their money to ALSAC/St. Jude for the past 50 years because it has given my son a better chance in the fight for his life.  We are grateful for the people at ALSAC and St. Jude who have dedicated their careers to fighting childhood cancer.  As a donor, I dont want our gifts to be wasted.  And as the father of a patient at St. Jude, I assure you that they are not.  
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	193932	6	/users/profile/253266	richjhagen	Client Served	5	02/07/2014	As a parent of a child who has been under the care of St. Jude since March of 2012, I hope my perspective is useful.  St. Jude is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer.  Everything St. Jude does is centered on finding cures and saving children. When my son was diagnosed with Leukemia at the age of 12, there was no doubt in my mind where I needed to take him to be cured.  Families like mine never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing and food.  This allows for 100% focus on curing my child. St. Jude freely shares the breakthroughs it makes, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children.  Whether a hospital is a for profit facility or a not for profit one, it takes talented leaders to operate them. To continue to do its lifesaving work, St. Jude must hire and retain the best doctors, researchers, scientists, nurses and fundraising leaders. The skills and experience of executive leaders are in very high demand across the country and internationally. In my opinion, its important that compensation for these positions be reasonable, fair and benchmarked to their peers. I think if you look at the compensation packages for the Leaders of St. Jude and ALSAC, you will find that they are actually in many cases below market.  I think thats a responsible way to operate and it allows St. Jude to offer fair wages and still attract top talent.   
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	187279	7	/users/profile/89180	Fathers4Justice	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital is and always has been my favorite charity. My dad was friends with Danny Thomas the founder. They used to talk on the phone sometimes on the weekend about helping out, donating our time to help children in need.  I remember meeting Danny Thomas, he was doing a stand up show, I was just a kid so that was probably 45 years ago. Danny was larger than life, smoking a cigar and genuinely a kind man. He was getting ready to go on stage, people were all around him but he stopped everything to play with me and my younger brothers, insisted we sit on his lap and gave us all big hugs, he didn't have to do that, how many in today's world would do that? I Thank God that my children are all healthy and I Thank God that St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital exists, just in case we needed, you needed, anyone of us needed their services, they are there.  I also read the negative comments about pay scales, I will continue to donate for the rest of my life. I don't care if they are putting the money in a pile and burning it, they are helping children and no amount of money can replace our children.  
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	168702	10	/users/profile/223652	bricen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2013	As i read the negative reviews, i notice that most of it is about money. I guess you are all right, no one needs that much money. However, the need is never a part of the value now is it. If each of you were paid on your " need" at your job, would it be less or more? Highly educated , sharp professionals are hired to administrate this wonderful organization and yes they cost a lot but maybe, just maybe they are worth it and maybe their professionalism and talent is what filters down to that staff member who takes care of someone you know or love one day. Now, would you choose a cheaper version? Look at both sides and watch what you say on public boards. Writing bad reviews may make you feel better about things, but it hurts more than you think to those you point and wag your finger at.
ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	162890	17	/users/profile/216201	Kathleen49	Client Served	5	07/17/2013	My son is a St. Jude patient.  He was diagnosed in Sep. 2003 with a baseball-sized malignant brain tumor, 3 days after his 9th birthday.  They performed emergency surgery hours after the MRI that revealed the tumor, it was big and the swelling was so severe he was lapsing into a coma. We live in San Diego and I never imagined us traveling to Memphis for treatment, we sought opinions at CHLA, UCSF, Rady Children's in San Diego, and Children's Nat'l Medical Center in DC. We ended up taking him to Memphis because at that time, they had a treatment available nowhere else in the U.S. that involved use of a lower dose of radiation to his brain and a treatment duration of 8 months instead of 2+ years that was producing higher survival rates than anything we could get elsewhere.  The lower dose of radiation was the clincher, all radiation amounts to brain damage, and is particularly devastating to the developing brains of young children.  We had great insurance coverage and did not choose St. Jude because of the financial benefits. My son is 19 now and in a couple of months he will be a 10-year survivor of this tumor.  Simply put, St. Jude saved his life and with better quality than he could have gotten anywhere else in the world at that time.  He just graduated high school this past June and he is about to enter college, something that 10 years ago I did not believe was possible.  I do not believe he would be in this situation if we had gone ahead with the treatments available in CA at the time of his diagnosis.  The treatment he did then is now available in CA and other places.  St. Jude is simply the best of the best and our family owes them a debt we can never repay. They do operate using clinical trials, and they only treat patients that they have an available treatment for and expertise with.  They do not say in their ads that they will take any patient, they state very clearly that "no patient will be turned away because of race, creed or inability to pay".  They will bill your insurance if you have any and take whatever they get, a patient will never see a bill.  They are privately funded, because of this they are not held hostage by the insurance companies/hmo's.  In addition to patients that have conditions they've developed treatments for, they will also take patients who have rare diseases that have no available treatments and develop a custom treatment protocol for them.  We also know of patients from other countries they will accept who have diseases for which there is no good treatment in their home countries.  I know of no other organization that does this. I encourage those who take issue with the CEO salaries to calculate those salaries as a percentage of revenue brought in and compare against similar organizations.  St. Jude has huge operating costs and large financial reserves, part of this is so that when they take on a patient they are guaranteed the funding to finish their treatment.  Some of the leukemia protocols are in excess of 3 years, St. Jude houses and feeds these families for the complete duration of treatment. St. Jude will accomodate up to four people in any patient housing.  If the patient is in the hospital, up to four other family members may stay in the patient housing.  There is a meal allowance for use in the cafeteria, patients staying in Target House (apartments) get a weekly grocery card to offset expenses.  They provide transportation to and from all of their facilities. Perhaps the very best thing of all about St. Jude was that I can say that in my entire life we've never been shown such unconditional love by complete strangers, in Memphis not only did they take care of my son but also our family in the most loving way imaginable, body and soul.  There is a saying at St. Jude, you go there with one sick child and you come home with 35, we hold so many of the friends we met there so very close to our hearts, and so many we've lost.  Having a child with a life-threatening illness is perhaps one of the very worst thing a parent can endure and St. Jude ministered to all of us in just so many ways, I truly believe there is no other place like St. Jude in the world.  To Kathy Wolfe, who commented that on their form 990 they list no fundraising expenses, I'd like to direct you to form 990 for FY2012 schedule H, it's on page 64 of the PDF at the below link:http://www.stjude.org/SJFile/990form-stjude-fy12.pdf It says:"THE FUNDRAISING SOURCE FOR ST. JUDE IS ALSAC WHICH RAISES FUNDS SOLELYFOR THE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION, PEOPLE NATIONWIDECONTRIBUTE VIA TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FUNDRAISING EFFORTS. ALSACCONTRIBUTED $442 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012 TO MEET THE OPERATING COSTOF ST. JUDE." St. Jude doesn't hire any outside companies or people to do fundraising.  To see the St. Jude fundraising expenses, you need to take a look at ALSAC's (American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities) 990's, available on their page:http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/35-1044585/american-lebanese-syrian-associated-charities.aspx I hope this information helps.

ALSAC-St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital	150729	36	/users/profile/200993	Kathy Wolfe	General Member of the Public	2	03/07/2013	I will not be donating to St. Jude, because I cannot trust their Form 990 Tax Return. I just received a direct mail charitable donation request from St. Jude, with address stickers and a note pad.  I know the request for donation I received, cost something to produce.  I recently started to review Charity ratings because my donation dollars are limited. I am a non-profit accountant with 30 years of experience. I reviewed the Organization's Tax Retrun (Form 990) for 2011 and found no expense whatsoever being attributed to Fundraising. One of my key criteria to donating to a charity is how 'efficient' the charity is in allocating it's dollars. Since these costs are not disclosed, I am suspicious about the ratio of Admin & Fundraising expense to Program Services. When St Jude reports the cost of their fundrasing efforts, I will reconsider my decision to donate.

They gave us hope when NO one else could including the top experts in the field. They have to spend money soliciting because they are completely not for profit. It cost more than 1.6 million dollars PER DAY to run this organization. They freely give out the research to the medical community. Some of the top researchers and physicians have reached the point in their career where they do not even accept a salary! St Jude is everything they claim to be and more. Every employee is exceptional. I have been a registered nurse for many years and have never seen a group of more dedicated professionals.

My brother dropped out of college to pursue music which didn't turn out like he expected and without a college degree I watched his self confidence plummet. He found a place among a crowd of partiers, which were not a good influence. It broke my heart to watch my best friend slowly lose his joy for life, thinking it was found in the nightlife. He wasn't the brother I knew anymore. After a lot of prayers, a few wonderful people entered his life, and told my brother about Narrow Gates. My brother recently graduated and his love for life his back! His mind, soul and heart are wise, sound and full of abundant joy. He now has two jobs, is active in his church and feels called to lead in ministry one day. Most important, his relationship with God is stronger than ever. He no longer carries a weight of guilt around for he knows God loves him regardless. Narrow Gates changed my brother's life. The leaders, teachers, and skills the boys learn at Narrow Gates will help any young man in life, and I recommend this beautiful place in a heartbeat!

It is an awesome gift to watch the transformation happen in these young men, and also see them continue in this practice of helping others. Narrow Gate is a gift--to families, communities, and ultimately the world. Thank you, Narrow Gate, for your investment in the lives of our kids. Forever grateful. 
Narrow Gate Foundation	313693	3	/users/profile/405048	Londonb14	Board Member	5	10/24/2016	I can't say enough about Narrow Gate! The time and love they poor into these young men while they are there and even after they leave are beyond words! This is a God Centered Ministry that you can definitely see God working it every single day! When our son was there I had such peace and rest knowing he was being loved and cared for in such a way that I would love and care for him! These people devote 24/7 nonstop attention to these young men and as a foster parent myself for the last 13 years  I know exactly how exhausting and how much time it takes from you! But the reward is watching them do well! I can say that when these young men Narrow Gate they are forever changed and they know their place in Gods Kingdom! Narrow Gate my family is forever devoted to you for what y'all have done and giving up to do what you do! God Bless & we love you! Thank you! Peggy Bradley in Odessa Texas
Narrow Gate Foundation	313451	4	/users/profile/404821	MASWsusie	Donor	5	10/22/2016	My husband and I have supported Narrow Gate for the past several years.  We have been fortunate to have witnessed first-hand young mens lives being changed.  When we visit the Narrow property you can feel the presence of the Holy Spirit at work.  Bill and Stacy Spencer are incredible servants of our Lord and are remarkable stewards to His incredible blessings for Narrow Gate.  
Narrow Gate Foundation	303019	5	/users/profile/394181	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/09/2016	I have been connected with Narrow Gate for 11 years. It has been amazing to watch this great non profit grow all because of their faith in Christ and allowing God to lead them on this journey.  Even though I do not have a son that has gone through the program yet, (he is 11 and I call hm NG JR in training) we visit when we can and are truly embraced by compassionate hearts and the love of Christ. As a family, we have met some of the young men along the way and followed their journey. Narrow Gate is life changing, inspirational, encouraging, and God driven. Many, many young men that have gone through the program have been a big ripple effect across our world today. The impact is priceless.
Narrow Gate Foundation	285645	4	/users/profile/375650	Writer	Client Served	5	04/12/2016	Narrow Gate is the most indescribable experience one can have as a part of their faith journey. The Holy Spirit has filled that property with outstanding leaders who are nothing but faithful to the end. Its an opportunity to witness God's miracle of saving young men and transforming them to be a witness for His Glory. Its an opportunity to get away from the world and be shown the spiritual realm of His Holiness, which is eye opening to see that spiritual warfare exist everyday no matter where you are. But while you are there and upon graduation you exit knowing God is with you wherever you go and most importantly we know the end of the story, HE WON the WAR! I am a Narrow Gater and if you feel like there's something more out there but don't quite know what that maybe, this experience will enlighten you. Back ground doesn't matter because staff knows it just Him writing out His Story. There is fear for each individual but that is quickly overcome by Him. "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of sound mind." (2Tim. 1:7) Go and see that God is GOOD!
Narrow Gate Foundation	285640	5	/users/profile/375644	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/12/2016	First visited Narrow Gate when it was about 6 months old. Bill and Stacy are the top of the chain in Carrying for kids that need some help and a little push..I still have contact with some of the original guys to go through Narrow Gate and they are pillows of the community and Christian young men..They have more success stories and the other..This is a great group and we moved and do not get to see them and cook for them anymore. A great Christian study camp and an experience you will never forget..Love you guys and gals..God is great
Narrow Gate Foundation	280088	5	/users/profile/369957	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/13/2016	Daryl and I learned about Narrow Gate when Bill Spencer and a few Narrow Gate graduates shared their stories one Sunday morning at church.  We were deeply moved to hear about how God was transforming young men's lives through this ministry, and we knew we wanted to get involved.  Within a few weeks we made our first visit to Narrow Gate and had a chance to spend some time with these guys.  What an incredible group of young men!  It is so evident that Bill, Stacy and the staff care so deeply about the character development and growth of the guys, and have created an environment of trust and love that allows each of them to discover who they are and how they can best use the gifts they have been given.  We can't say enough good things about Narrow Gate!
Narrow Gate Foundation	279210	6	/users/profile/369272	Writer	Former staff	5	02/06/2016	Narrow Gate was the tool God used to shape me into the man I am today. Without the foundational truths and values I learned here as a student I wouldn't be where I'm at in life. 
Narrow Gate Foundation	279135	6	/users/profile/369183	Writer	Client Served	5	02/05/2016	My life was a complete mess before narrow gate. A broken drug addict with no sense of direction or purpose in my life. Narrow gate has swung the doors wide open for me. This place allowed me to seek the god of love that radically changed my life.
Narrow Gate Foundation	313809	2	/users/profile/405163	Sarah337,	Client Served	5	10/24/2016	My brother attended Narrow Gates this past year (2016 ),and it has been life changing, for he and our relationship. My brother dropped out of college to pursue music which didn't turn out like he expected and without a college degree I watched his self confidence plummet. He found a place among a crowd of partiers, which were not a good influence. It broke my heart to watch my best friend slowly lose his joy for life, thinking it was found in the nightlife. He wasn't the brother I knew anymore. After a lot of prayers, a few wonderful people entered his life, and told my brother about Narrow Gates. My brother recently graduated and his love for life his back! His mind, soul and heart are wise, sound and full of abundant joy. He now has two jobs, is active in his church and feels called to lead in ministry one day. Most important, his relationship with God is stronger than ever. He no longer carries a weight of guilt around for he knows God loves him regardless. Narrow Gates changed my brother's life. The leaders, teachers, and skills the boys learn at Narrow Gates will help any young man in life, and I recommend this beautiful place in a heartbeat! 
Narrow Gate Foundation	276909	7	/users/profile/366742	Writer	Client Served	5	01/18/2016	God used this ministry and the staff involved to radically change my life. Before coming to Narrow Gate in 2009, I had been to a handful of drug rehabs and Christian programs. Nothing worked, and I didn't have much of a hope that Narrow Gate would do anything to help my addictions either. What would end up happening though, is a complete and total transformation of my life. The setup and culture at Narrow Gate allowed my old identity to be stripped away from me, and the incredible teachings and unconditional acceptance from the staff allowed God to implant his new identity within me.I initially went to Narrow Gate so I would stop doing drugs. I figured I would go and get clean and then come back home to live my life; maybe get a job, maybe go back to school, etc. What I actually got was a complete transformation of my life and also the lives of my family/friends. I'm beyond thankful for the staff at Narrow Gate and their willingness to lay their lives down for a guy like me, someone who thought he wasn't worthy of anything good. This is what the love of God looks like, and this is why Narrow Gate works.
Narrow Gate Foundation	276523	7	/users/profile/366311	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/13/2016	It is difficult to briefly sum up what a wonderful organization Narrow Gate is and how life-changing the experience is for the young men who attend Narrow Gate.  God is using Bill and Stacy Spencer, along with Narrow Gate staff and volunteers, to demonstrate God's love, mercy and grace to these young men...and then discipling them, challenging them, offering them opportunities to learn new skills and helping them answer the questions of "Why am I here?" and "What is my purpose?"...all to help these young men become all that God has created each of them to be.My son entered Narrow Gate as a student in May 2014 and was a different young man when he left there.  Prior to Narrow Gate, he had struggled with questions about God, about his own purpose and direction...but left there knowing he had a personal, saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and relationship with Him, and also had developed a sense of God's purpose for his life.The staff and volunteers associated with Narrow Gate will truly love your young man and will truly help him find God's best for his life.I'm a grateful mom of a blessed Narrow Gate graduate.
Narrow Gate Foundation	276389	9	/users/profile/366152	Gail65	General Member of the Public	5	01/12/2016	When my son was 22 he was  throwing his life in the gutter. His days included drinking, smoking weed/spice, playing video games  and chillin with "friends". All the things he thought were fun.  He became very skinny and sick. He ended up in the emergency room a couple times with stomach problems. I just knew he was dying on the inside because it showed on the outside.   A friend at church told me about Narrow Gate Foundation. Her son had been there several years before and it had helped him tremendously. After speaking to my son about it a couple different times, he decided to half heartily look into it. He knew he was on a very dangerous path. IT wasnt long, he had filled out the paperwork and after a few calls from a staff member he was accepted into the program. Within a couple of months he was living in a tent on a hill. This is where it all started.  The staff at NGF loved him into their arms and introduced him to their God in a way he had never known before. He became hungry for Gods Word and studied, read, and prayed daily. I cant say enough about the staff and volunteers at Narrow Gate foundation.  They are angels on earth working with one boy at a time showing him the way to become a young man and  one of Gods Disciples.  Brent has been there over a year now.  He has been working at NGA which is a leather, wood and metal shop,  He loves his job and the people he works with.Two years ago i was sick with worry that Brent wouldnt live another year. Now, because of Narrow Gates love for MY Son, he is living a life he never thought  possible and loving every minute of it.  Praise God for Narrow GAte Foundation!
Narrow Gate Foundation	276027	6	/users/profile/365725	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/08/2016	Narrow Gate Foundation is truly a vibrant community comprised of those who know what it is to desperately search for one's identity, and finally find it in Jesus Christ. I have witnessed firsthand the journey of discovery, acceptance, and transformation this wonderful organization makes possible for the young men fortunate enough to experience it. With Narrow Gate, you will find yourself deeply challenged and deeply loved, all at the same time. There is no shortage of those in our society asking the vitally important questions: "Who am I?" and "Why am I here?" I am truly thankful Narrow Gate Foundation exists to graciously and lovingly come alongside young men in their quest for the answers!
Narrow Gate Foundation	275759	5	/users/profile/365423	Rochbrann	Volunteer	5	01/06/2016	My son entered Narrow Gate in 2011.   He came out of there a changed man.  The time spent there taught him what it means to be a sold out Christ follower.  He learned who he is in Christ and what God desires from him as a man of God. To be bold in sharing the truth and wisdom he gained, to make a difference for His kingdom and to serve Him faithfully always.  Narrow Gate changed him from the inside out and because of this, it changed our entire family for the good.  We have seen the fruits of Bill and Stacys labor of love do great things in other young men as well.  We love the staff at Narrow Gate and we will continue to support them financially,  through prayer and volunteering as long as we can.   Thankful beyond all measure for this ministry and their staff. 
Narrow Gate Foundation	275673	5	/users/profile/365322	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	01/05/2016	My wife and I our supporters of Narrow Gate.  They our very obedient to their call to ministry.  This organization has help numerous young men to become  Godly men, fulfilling their call in life!  So many lives have been blessed through this ministry.  If you have a chance to listen to the teaching of God through His servant, Bill Spencer you will be blessed as well.
Narrow Gate Foundation	275667	5	/users/profile/365313	Writer	Client Served	5	01/05/2016	An amazing organization that tells 18-25 year old men who they are why they are here.  They take in all types of people but in many cases the ones that even society has given up on and shows them the love, light, and peace of Jesus.  
Narrow Gate Foundation	275645	6	/users/profile/365288	James183	Client Served	5	01/05/2016	My son entered the program at Narrow Gate in 2007.  It was a life/changing experience for him. From my personal experience with Narrow Gate, I have witnessed how the love of God can transform young men under the guidance and teaching of Bill and Stacy Spencer. I have always been impressed how well they conserve the funds they raise and how many Tennessee folks have poured their time and resources into this program to make it work. They have always been transparent and open with everything.  I have never felt more close to God than when Bill Spencer ministers to these guys. I often marveled on how Narrow Gate survives financially since the cost to the men's families was so affordable. To honor that I contributed $100 a month for several years as my ability to do so Permitted. Supporting Narrow Gate loves these young men in ways you could never imagine. Jesus Christ runs Narrow Gate. Bill and Stacy are his servants. The photo is of my blessing to my son at his graduation; the most honorable moment of our relationship. 
Narrow Gate Foundation	275641	4	/users/profile/365284	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/05/2016	We have been involved on and off for 7-8 years. We hosted boys in our home and dinners and participated in functions at the Lodge. Tracy and Bill Spencer invest their all into these young men who participate.  And watching what God does in their lives is nothing short of miraculous!
Narrow Gate Foundation	273196	4	/users/profile/362400	djwhite1948	Board Member	5	11/30/2015	My nephew was the seventh student at Narrow Gate back in January 2005. Since that time his entire life has changed for the better and that was due to the God centered foundation he received at Narrow Gate. Most of the students of Narrow Gate become friends for life and encourage each other to stay on the narrow path that leads to life. I have been a supporter of Narrow Gate for over 10 years and I have seen with my own eyes the effectiveness of this ministry.

Because of the confidence I have in this ministry, I have consistently given over the past 8 years.  I have personally witnessed how my investment is being used to help change the trajectory of young men's lives.  I so strongly believe in this ministry, I along with my sons, have established an endowment at the Community Foundation of Abilene to insure that the mission of Narrow Gate Foundation will continue to be carried out and young men's lives will be impacted for the Kingdom.

Vietnam Veterans of Nashville Foundation	34197	6	/users/profile/35015	jc1	General Member of the Public	5	03/30/2010	I volunteered with this organization at an event where they were assisting Veterans with resources and support available to them.  These guys spend many hours a month on the phone and at events waiting for Veterans to approach to help them find a shining light of hope.  They seem tireless in their mission to help Veterans and let them know they are not alone.  More Veterans should join the organizations they are affiliated with.  They share a unique brother and sisterhood that is hard to find.  Veterans from ALL walks of life go to their meetings and feel right at home.
Vietnam Veterans of Nashville Foundation	34187	5	/users/profile/35003	loohoo28	Volunteer	5	03/30/2010	This group deserves recognition for their hard work, sacrifice, commitment and selflessness they have shown to their not only their country but their fellow veterans.

They already have done so much to help other non-profit organizations such as VVA Ch# 953 and AM Vets Post# 1776 accomplish their missions. These guys deserve recognition and all the support we can give them.
Tiger Haven	320192		/users/profile/412435	ronnieredmond	Volunteer	4	12/16/2016	I believe Tiger Haven is doing their best to help these beautiful big cats. And I agree that charity navigator doesn't explain clearly,that the costs of fundraising are ridiculous. So it's understandable that Tiger Haven must spend 50%.H however,sending dollar bills in the mail-in the hopes you will get it all back,is foolish. Less than 5%will return that dollar,and those that do,will only send a small 5-10$ donation. Ex:$30k5%=$1500$10=$15k-$1500recovered 1$bills=$13,500. Net loss=$16,500. At best,you break even,if 10%give$10each...it is possible that if 10%respond@$25each=$75k-$30k sent out,you net$35k. I tend to think a net profit occurs not more than 3 per year. And if these mailings are done 6 a year,with 3netloss$16k=&49,500 and 3netgain$35k=$105k-$49,500=$67,500 net gain/year,minus payments to the experts. Not great. But I love the calendar,but I think more people love hi-quality silkscreened t-shirts,sweatshirts,etc.and would gladly pay double the cost.Also,that former admittedly underpaid employee,was working there because he/she obviously cared for the animals....so you better get the owner in-check with her spending of excess...I can't fathom why this former worker would lie about that. So, I would like to see full disclosure of all net income minus salaries&non-profits I would hope,do NOT/SHOULD NOT give bonuses. Excess income should not be at the owner's disposal. I will be conservative in donating,for now. Put it all out there&i will gladly give more to help.
Tiger Haven	290520	8	/users/profile/380869	Elsie B.	Volunteer	4	05/21/2016	I am writing this because I wouldn't  have known anything about the crap that going on in China to these big cats if Tiger Haven didn't get it out there! So a lot of their $$$ is spent on fundraising. All this means is they are doing it from the ground floor. Instead of pointing fingers, lend a hand. They are shouting for help the best way they know how!!! The first time I got a petition to China was Tiger Haven.They get my vote for having the guts to give these animals the grace they deserve. I know they are on the top of my donation list , whatever Charity Navigator's  stars show.   And a THANK YOU to Tiger Haven for kindness  and courage...
Tiger Haven	195929	12	/users/profile/252415	karmakaze	Donor	3	03/20/2014	I certainly agree with the goals of this organization--rescuing and providing homes for the big cats that people without expertise, financial means for housing and care, and access to veterinarians have acquired. And that means virtually everyone who buys a big cat. As for the fund raising, I donate to multiple organizations and it seems as if most of them either have the same fund raisers or the fund raisers have similar methods. However, I have some sympathy for the amount of money being spent, although I would rather have to go for the animals. Basically, how many people are aware of these organizations or what they do? It is expensive to get the word out and then to compete with other similar facilities with the same mission of saving animals that should never been in private hands. I will probably continue to donate since the big cats did not contribute to their fate nor did they have choices. I'm also disgusting with the neighbors who bought property when cats were already in the area and now are trying to close down the sanctuary. Too much development! If they didn't want to be anywhere around an animal sanctuary, they should have gone elsewhere. This sounds like a lawsuit for financial gain. Shame on them.
Tiger Haven	193984	10	/users/profile/253411	Leda T.	General Member of the Public	1	02/08/2014	I got a request in the mail from Tiger Haven.  Like all requests, I checked with Charity Navigator.  They got a 1 star rating and had a lot of financial concerns and 50% of their budget went to fund raising! ( A fund raising efficiency of 50%). By comparison The Elephant Sanctury, also located in the rural South had 5 stars and a fundraising efficiency of 3%.  There are better places to donate.
Tiger Haven	193521	36	/users/profile/252760	GreatCats	Board Member	5	01/30/2014	I do find it troubling that disgruntled employees have the freedom to write fictional reviews that have no connection to reality.   Negative reviews are admitted former employees.  Tiger Haven has a CPA who enters all receipts, and this is sent to another independent CPA for a audited financial report every year.  There is no cash coming into the organization from visitors, gift shops or concessions. All donations are entered by a independent data entry company and deposited into a Tiger Haven bank account.  No room, for any ill fated donations.   Fundraising cost are a ongoing challenge.  Tiger Haven DOES NOT have multiple non profit charters and organizations that we hide fundraising cost in like so many others.  Many others raise money through another organization, then donate it to the functional organization to legally hide the high cost of fundraising.  Tiger Haven is also not open to the public like a road side zoo, so all funding must come from other sources that does not use the exploitation of the animals to raise their funds.   I am responding to your comments regarding our fundraising expenses and charity rating on Charitynavigator.org I hope that this letter will address your concerns. Tiger Haven is designated as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) charitable organization. This status, however, does not mean that we get any federal money or any kind of subsidies for doing this type of work. Tiger Haven is 100% funded by contributions from donors. Several years ago, it became clear that we could no longer rescue cats unless we did something drastic to raise funds. At that point, we hired a professional fundraising company. This is extremely costly, but the funds that it generates far surpass any funds we could hope to secure by ourselves. Tiger Havens mission is to take care of neglected, abused, or otherwise unwanted big cats. That is what we do best. When we investigated our options prior to hiring the fundraising company, we realized that this type of work was best outsourced to professionals. The expense breakdown is alarming when looked at out of context. What sites like charitynavigator.org do not tell you is that fundraising is difficult and inconsistent at best. They also group a lot of different costs into the administrative category. This administrative category is not a synonym for salaries. Our staff is extremely underpaid for the amount of work that we do. This category includes all aspects of our fundraising such as filing a yearly permit to solicit donations (for each of the 50 states), obtaining donor lists from other organizations, bookkeeping, publishing and graphics, etc. Further, Tiger Haven is our only corporation; we do not have a parent company or other affiliate nonprofit corporations to "hide" expenses.Another issue that is not addressed by the charity rating is the amount the percentages represent. For instance, one national Humane Society uses 19% of their income on fundraising, but that translates into $24 MILLION since their income is $148 MILLION. Twenty-Four million dollars will go a very long way to find new donors. Tiger Haven has 280+ mouths to feed daily and our method of fundraising generates enough money (on a fairly regular basis) that we do not have to worry where the next food shipment is coming from. We are looking into alternate fund sources, however, and are always open to suggestions
Tiger Haven	193455	5	/users/profile/252659	Janel N.	General Member of the Public	1	01/29/2014	I received a mailing requesting money to donate to this organization. However, after doing research online I decided not to give money because of the bad reviews here and only a one star rating on another site. I am horrified to think that this owner is using these poor animals. I sincerely hope not. It seems doing the right thing for right's sake is rapidly vanishing in this world and for that I am very afraid. Despite anyone's belief in a higher power we are all on this planet "together". No one species is here for the sole purpose of serving another. Animals are on this good Earth WITH us; not FOR us to use, abuse, discard and mistreat as we see fit. In fact, it is the opposite. We have a responsibility as a member of the species of reason to co-exist, not control and destroy. The bio diverse species on this Earth can tell us much if we let them; instead, we look down our noses at them. Disregard of any life has consequences for which people live in a dream world of arrogance. Retribution comes to all and we have yet to see the consequences of how serious this will be for many future generations to come. There are some things technology can't fix; there are mistakes that can never be undone. I sincerely hope that this organization can improve so that I can feel good about donating to these magnificent animals. For now, I will look for another.
Tiger Haven	163559	19	/users/profile/217194	Tadpolejaxn	Volunteer	1	07/25/2013	I worked at Tiger Haven for 4 months. Please, find another charity to donate to. The owner brags about the fact that she has 3 million excess dollars above the cost of running Tiger Haven to spend however she pleases. Everyday, she has multiple packages from Amazon delivered to her office, most of which contain things that are of no use to the cats. For example: cat statues, blankets, candles, posters, movies, house plants, and an assortment of useless crap. This place needs to be changed. The cats could be cared for far better. Mary Haven isn't qualified to own and run a place like tiger haven. I'm just ranting, but I care about the cats and they aren't being cared for the way they should and more of the money that is being donated should be used in a far more responsible way, and should be improving the cats quality of life.
Tiger Haven	150910	10	/users/profile/201262	Karen Frauman	Donor	2	03/11/2013	I have watched this organization for several years and am very disappointed in the small amt of the donation that goes to the programs of actually helping the tigers.  I will be sending a small donation within the next week (probably $5) and hope that at least $4 goes to helping the tigers at Tiger Haven.  I certainly hope that you can find people that will donate their time to help you run this organization more efficiently so that most of donations rec'd will go to helping the tigers.  Sincerely, Karen Frauman 
Tiger Haven	150538	8	/users/profile/200737	Kim Reynolds	Donor	2	03/05/2013	This is a costly undertaking for sure, and I try to support it when I can. But your financial review on charity navigator is terrible. Your fundraising expenses are killing your program expenses, and sending out dollar bills to - what - 30,000 people??  Not a good strategy! Those who are willing to support the cause will do so regardless of the dollar bill. Those who won't, are just taking and pocketing my donated dollars. I will return it this time, but it seems I speak for others here when I say I will discontinue my support if this practice continues.
Tiger Haven	148254	2	/users/profile/196329	Connie20	Donor	5	01/18/2013	Well, people please stop complaining, we are here to help out... whatever it is  we are getting a lot of blessing from GOD by giving donations you have to give within the bottom of your hearth ok!!!!
Tiger Haven	121081	4	/users/profile/164757	HucksMom	Donor	2	08/20/2012	Today I received $1 bill from this charity! I don't know who raised the stakes from a nickle or a quarter...? but I feel like I'm being played. 
Tiger Haven	121063	6	/users/profile/164729	red_dahlia226	Donor	3	08/20/2012	This charity is working for a great cause, but I am concerned about the amount of money being spent on fundraising efforts.  I am sent some type of desperate-plea fundraising letter at least once a week, and it is off-putting.  I wish they would limit those letters to 3 - 4 times a year, and spend the money saved on their operating expenses.  Also, I am concerned about a lawsuit that they are fighting.  Will my donation be going toward fighting that, or do they have a lawyer working for them pro bono?  I wish they would address that topic in one of the frequent letters they send out.
Tiger Haven	115553	5	/users/profile/157349	pattheratlol	Donor	3	06/16/2012	Mission is needed ! You spend all that money raising money why???  All you need is to give us pics where they live the conditions and you'll get your money!! All I see is sick big cats, where do they rome !!! Show us what the description says!!!  i here the state is giving you problems why??? for real why? i have limited funds but my wife and have give in the pass I WANT TO GIVE !!!  Give me the reasons with pics of the enclosures,explain why the state is doing this, i know its not your salary which must be the lowest in all these charities. i believe you are for real!!
Tiger Haven	112815	8	/users/profile/153550	racingrescue	Donor	5	05/23/2012	I have been on the board for a shelter and finding dependable help is difficult.  It ends up the animals which are the most important thing get cared for by the people who are hard workers and things like paperwork and fundraising have to be done by paid professionals just because there are not enough hours in the day to do it all.  Not the way you would like it but that is just the way it is.  Donations are still needed so badly to continue to care for the unfortunate animals.  They can't be adopted out like a dog for fear they end up in the same horrible situation so they are to be cared for until they die.
Tiger Haven	109030	1	/users/profile/148362	Bill  Morgan	General Member of the Public	2	04/05/2012	Incredibly poor (and annoying) fundraising techniques. 49.3% of money raised goes to the fundraiser
Tiger Haven	102676	1	/users/profile/135105	Sandra Wemple	Donor	3	12/28/2011	I would hope this organization would want a favorable report and would welcome it to create more donations.  In the current years they have had troubles with the state government and residents to stay in business.  They have a dedication to many big cats, but to put so much money into raising donations they need to relocate their direction.  
Tiger Haven	96006	7	/users/profile/111721	kittyfan	Donor	3	08/18/2011	I have been a regular donor to Tiger Haven for many years. I strongly support their mission to save/protect great cats and hope they succeed. That said, I am continually put off by what seems, at best, a somewhat chaotic management situation. Many of their requests for donations are frantic cries for help for daily disasters (e.g. "the truck won't start", etc). I have no doubt that Mary Lynn and her team do their very best, but it is really too bad that they can't persuade a good young lawyer or marketing person to come in pro bono to advise them (maybe university law students??). They seem to need vastly better daily management, awareness, and planning.  Maybe that is why some raters only give them one star.  I will continue to support them and I wish them good luck.
Tiger Haven	93416	6	/users/profile/107436	Erin C.	Donor	5	07/05/2011	I learned about Tiger Haven through a mailing, and then looked it up online. I am so grateful to have found this charity so that I can support it. I am not able to give a lot, but every dollar helps I guess.  I understand that Tiger Haven rescues big cats from bad conditions and offers them a safe sanctuary to live their lives out in peace and happiness.  In a world that has canned hunting--not only in Africa but here in the US, in TX I think--a sanctuary like this is a blessing, a sign of hope, and absolutely needed more than ever. Do you remember when former VP Dick Cheney shot one of his friends? Yes, he was participating in canned hunting at the time. I support this charity and have had a very positive experience with the website and my monthly automatic contributions. I wish I had more to give.
Tiger Haven	86942	7	/users/profile/97490	Rylinn Sorini	Donor	3	04/24/2011	A couple of months ago I symbolically adpoted a cat from tiger haven and was initially impressed with the quality of the package they sent me. I am shocked that they got only one star and don't know what "fundraising expenses" might be because they have never emailed me and scarcely ever send me mail. In fact, they are not well publicised at all, most people don't know about the need for sanctuaries for big cats. 
Tiger Haven	84854	8	/users/profile/94284	K N	Volunteer	5	04/05/2011	I cannot believe that this organization only has 1 star, when there are numerous organizations on Charity Navigator that are rated higher even though their scoundrel Presidents, CEOs, etc. are paid nearly a quarter or half a million dollars which equals a quarter or half of their funds.  The president of Tiger Haven takes a meager salary which is a strong indicator that what a person donates actually goes to helping the Tigers.  Check out the website, it's very informative.  Unlike the bogus organizations who contacted me to become a member or asked for more money after I already had joined or donated money,  I am not inundated with e-mails or mailings from Tiger Haven asking for money.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	32103	8	/users/profile/32906	susabelle13	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/01/2010	Since the very first production, Tennessee Women's Theater Project (TWTP) has exceeded all expectations. From the choice of plays, the casting, direction and all production values - the company continues to produce gem after gem.  What also continues to stand out is that the talented, committed people TWTP brings to the table - actors, technicians, designers and volunteers, all understand and are proud to embrace and advance the TWTP mission "giving voice to women through theater arts." Also worth mentioning is the annual rite of spring entitled "Women's Work." For three weeks, TWTP offers a stage and an audience to artists of every genre - drama, music, dance, poetry, visual arts...  Every performance is different, and the $40 Women's Work Festival Pass would be a bargain at twice the price.Finally, I think the founder of TWTP, Maryanna Clarke deserves special recognition for her social consciousness and for her commitment to making live theater an experience everyone can enjoy.  TWTP is exceedingly generous with the community, providing inumerable complimentary tickets to underserved segments of community.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	32031	7	/users/profile/32837	pittmf	Volunteer	5	03/01/2010	The first time I worked with TWTP was about two years ago, as a member of the run crew.  When I met them, I realized that Maryanna and Chris were good honest people pursuing a mission that they believed in: not only to create more opportunities for women in theatre both onstage and off, but to do so through quality productions that most people in there area have not heard of.  While the plays they choose have at least as many women as men, the plays themselves aren't focused strictly on women's issues, but rather address issues that appeal to everyone. As long as I've been involved with them, TWTP has created high quality productions and I've enjoyed being able to play my part.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31963	7	/users/profile/32781	robert5	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2010	I do not give five stars lightly. TWTP's work is among the best in Nashville. I never miss a show because I know that I will be challenged, delighted, entertained and always intrigued. With limited resources, they take on issues that are germane to life in today's world. Courageous is the word that comes to mind. I look forward to the day that their theater is filled with an appreciative audience.They tackle relationships, disparity in income for the people who do much of the work in our society, the problems of growing up in America...the list goes on. I would like every CEO in Nashville to attend this theater. I would like every man in Nashville to attend this theater. They are doing more for the awareness of Women as second class citizens than all the sociology Phd's you can gather on a Saturday night.Thank you to Maryanna and Chris Clarke for living their dream and inviting us to join them in it.Robert Kiefer
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31780	9	/users/profile/32629	janis1	Donor	5	02/28/2010	I have supported TWTP for several years now, thru audience participation & donations.  I donate my hard-earned money to this non-profit because they are worth it!  Their high-quality plays are quite entertaining & Maryanna Clarke's creative ideas add a sense of delight & anticipation to attending the shows.  I always try to make it a priority to see each production when I'm in town, and look forward to her emails to see what's playing next. The plays AND the actors are great!
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31773	10	/users/profile/32622	susan15	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2010	I have been part of the TWTP through audience participation over the last several years.  I have been impressed with the high quality of the works presented and with the commitment to providing a voice for women in the world of theater.  The three programs that were outstanding to me were "Kingfisher Days" - truly a magical performance, the staged reading of "A View from Tall" - unfortunately only seen for one evening, but what an evening, and the incredible one woman show that depicted the experience of the Little Rock Nine.  Maryanna Clarke is providing something no other group in Tennessee or even nationally is doing.  Thanks to her and all the hard work of others to bring this quality and affordable theater to the Middle Tennessee area.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31752	6	/users/profile/32604	kpactor	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2010	I have had the honor of being part of their productions and the thrill of being part of the audience and I can honestly say the shows they put up are some of the best I've ever seen and been a part of.  This company's heart and soul is a living entity that is part of the experience in the theater during the performances.  Maryanna's mission to present the highest quality of work that features "real" women is always presented successfully.  She is great at selecting pieces with this in mind and an incredibly gifted director - not to mention, supportive, clear and so much fun to work with.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31731	6	/users/profile/32585	maureenorgan	General Member of the Public	4	02/27/2010	This play was so well done!  Seven of us who saw it together and have little experience with which to identify with soccer moms thoroughly enjoyed it.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31682	6	/users/profile/32540	amanda5	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/27/2010	I had heard a lot about Tennessee Women's Theatre Project and really admired their message, and was ecstatic when I was finally given the chance to work with them. This company is Maryanna's baby, and she has put so much of her time and love into making it as great as it can be. They are the only company in Nashville focused on giving women more opportunities to perform and play real, strong female characters. They are also one of the few companies in Nashville that is willing to produce premiere productions. It has been incredibly informative and empowering to work with this company.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31674	4	/users/profile/32535	robin4	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2010	You can always expect relevant, insightful projects and delightful productions from this Great*Nonprofit!  Another wonderful Tennessee Treasure.  (and you still have time to see the current offering... "Secrets of a Soccer Mom")  My cheeks still hurt from the laughter.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31672	11	/users/profile/32534	capricorn1946gmailcom	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	I attended my my first Tennessee Women's Theater Project production about two years ago.I have attended nearly every one of their shows ever since then.I am always very impressed with the quality of their productions. Although scenery and props are minimal, the actors that work their stage are absolutely wonderful and the direction is near perfect. After meeting the people who put it all together, I decided I wanted to be part of the Project and volunteered to help with publicity.I have become a fan of local theater due directly to my experiences with the TWTP and try to support other local groups whenever I can.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31666	10	/users/profile/32529	libus	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/27/2010	I worked on a play with Maryanna and Chris and was amazed at the amount of heart and soul the two of them put into this theater company. They both are totally committed to excellence and are willing to work as much and as hard as it takes. I hope they will attract more volunteers over the years to help their fabulous cause. It's a lot of pressure for just the two of them. I was a bit overwhelmed at times with the amount of work involved and Maryanna was cool and calm and focused and the show went on without a hitch. They produce professional interesting shows and many times offer premieres to the Nashville community- which not many theater companies in town are willing to risk. I had a very positive learning experience from being involved with this company and hope to work with them again in the future.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	31644	4	/users/profile/32508	drummerdavethomas	General Member of the Public	4	02/27/2010	... frequently quirky and always entertaining and interesting.  TWTP is an opportunity to see 1st class work that wouldn't otherwise be available.  Speaking as a music professional that plays a lot of theater, this is one of my favorite theater companies in the middle Tennessee area.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	30858	5	/users/profile/31801	terry3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/25/2010	I have seen many of their shows and acted in two plays and a Women's Work performance.They not only have artistic integrity, they treat all artists and their audiences with respect.TWTP is dedicated to their vision for theatre and women in the arts.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	30471	5	/users/profile/31446	susan11	General Member of the Public	4	02/24/2010	The TN Women's Theater Project is a wonderful addition to the arts in Nashville. I love going to their performances and always bring a friend or 3. The productions are high quality.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	30342	3	/users/profile/31331	holly8	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2010	TWTP is serving this community in ways that no other theatre company in middle Tennessee is.  Their focus on women playwrights and strong women characters is what makes this theatre so special and so needed. Maryanna Clarke, who is at the helm of the company, along with her dedicated husband, Chris Clarke, have given their sweat, blood and tears to keep this company and their mission forging ahead.  Part of their deep dedication is evidenced in a competitive wage for their actors along with offering affordable ticket prices and giving back to the community by offering discounted or free tickets to underprivileged women who wouldn't normally go to the theatre.  What they have done in the past 5 years is nothing short of amazing.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	30317	3	/users/profile/31313	kenjaxlaw	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2010	One need only hear the story of the formation and mission of the TWTP to understand how vital this organization is to Middle Tennessee and beyond.  Warriors Don't Cry is just one in a series of original or premiere productions to appreciate how TWTP holds up a less distorted mirror to nature, and how that contributes not only to women in the performing arts, but to an enriched civilization for all.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	30310	7	/users/profile/31306	nashvilleathena	Board Member	5	02/23/2010	I have been a board member of TWTP since its inception and have seen every production at least once.  I am also an actor locally, both in community theater and professional productions.  Maryanna Clarke's commitment to quality offerings and reaching underserved audiences is second to none.  On a shoestring (and with the help of an equally deeply committed husband) she has managed to present thoughtful, well-written and entertaining new plays to the Nashville community that have the look of quality, not shoestring!  She is able to elicit fine performances from the actors and develops quite a loyalty among those who have worked with her.  I always leave one of TWTP's productions happy that I spent time there.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	28314	7	/users/profile/29370	lauraskaug	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/14/2010	I have worked with the TWTP since it's first production in 2005.  Having worked both onstage and backstage I can honestly say that my experience with them each and every time had been fantastic.  Maryanna Clarke has an incredible eye for material that is new and exciting to produce and she brings together some of the strongest ensembles I have had the pleasure of working with.  I have been a professional in the field for more than 20 years and worked with many different organizations and, in my experience, the TWTP continually brings some of the highest quality, professionally produced shows to Middle TN.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	27836	7	/users/profile/28921	sonia1	Former staff	5	02/10/2010	Tennessee Women's Theater Project provides a voice for female playwrights and actors in a society in which theatre primarily consists of the "male story"--currently only 18% of produced plays in this country are by female playwrights!  TWTP seeks to corrects this.  TWTP is also a joy to work for; they not only create a nurturing environment for creative freedom and artistic expression from their artists, but they are dedicated to making sure their artists receive a fair wage for their work, even when the company is struggling financially.  Their shows are high in calibre, and have brought audiences to tears of joy and laughter.  They are a huge asset to the Nashville community and deserve to be recognized.
Tennessee Women's Theater Project	27670	7	/users/profile/28750	jeanmarie	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2010	Tennessee Women's Theatre Project, under the artistic direction of Maryanna Clarke, is as fine a theatre company as the US has produced in many a decade. Featuring the voices of women, TWTP produces excellent, thought-provoking, authentic theatre that feeds the soul and sparks the imagination.
Cancer Support Services	269410	2	/users/profile/358139	Writer	Donor	1	10/29/2015	I got a call from the cancer support fund contributions and asked how much goes towards helping the patients. Only 15% goes and the rest goes to the running the programs. So they will get the pledge card back no money and will block their calls. I'm glad they told me how much goes to what and that made up my mind on not giving.
Cancer Support Services	209442	12	/users/profile/272207	frandorton	General Member of the Public	1	08/08/2014	My husband was home one afternoon when Cancer Support Services called. We have lost many dear friends to cancer. My husband has two brothers fighting caner at present. Naturally he is a soft touch. Ready to help all he can when he hears the word cancer. He gave a pledge of $20.00. Now this is not a lot of money, but I became skeptical when phone calls and letters started to arrive. Every other day we are getting call telling us we did not fulfill our pledge. This just made me even more uneasy. This afternoon another phone call came and I heard all the other little bees in the background working the phones. Thank you for this web sight. I have an answer for the next call. I also am printing this information and sending it back in the letter minus a $20.00 check. I will help all the local funds, motorcycle runs, bake sales. but as for phone solicitation, NO WAY.  WHEN THEY CALL AGAIN I WILL ASK THEM FOR A DONATION FOR MY TWO BROTHERS IN LAW !! BET THEY WON'T CALL BACK.    
Cancer Support Services	183747	6	/users/profile/240659	silf	General Member of the Public	1	10/28/2013	Worst charity ever. They pretend to help people and just harass the elderly. They are disgusting. All the money they receive goes to the rotten telemarketing company that they co-own. They should be put out of business.

Cancer Support Services	150306	4	/users/profile/200440	TeeRey	General Member of the Public	1	02/28/2013	It was VERY hard to find any information about this 'charity'...not the first sign of a legit charity :-/ Called many times from a local number, but told to mail donation to another state (after requesting mailings...was asked to just forward without).  I wonder why... As others stated, shall forward my pledge to the American Cancer Society instead.
Cancer Support Services	129189	2	/users/profile/174551	Connie C.	Donor	1	10/25/2012	Came to this site to verify the company and glad I did. Thank you to services like this for helping the uninformed  donor. No money from me!
Cancer Support Services	125321	3	/users/profile/170470	vet613	Donor	1	10/13/2012	They fooled me once...then I checked up on them.  Needless to say I will give them nothing further.  A true scam!
Cancer Support Services	121406	4	/users/profile/165192	Carol  Konshak	Donor	1	08/25/2012	The Cancer Support Services contacted me at a vulnerable time.  My father had just passed away from cancer, and my mother was ill and has since passed. I never heard of the charity prior to their phone solicitation.  I promised minimal donation.  I received multiple phone calls to remind me of the donation I had promised.  It most likely cost more to make the calls than I will be sending. I will be including a printout of their ratings with my check, along with the request that they do not contact me. 
Cancer Support Services	119512	7	/users/profile/162504	Robi58	Donor	1	07/30/2012	This organization is a disgusting shame to America and it's citizens. Any organization that collects over 11 Million dollars, spends 10 Million on itself and makes a 1Million dollar donation to another organization needs to be shutdown.   They need to be stopped immediately.  This makes lies and deceit 'just legal' enough to continue ripping off the American public.  The ONLY reason I would give this company 1 star is to register this review.  
Cancer Support Services	113519	5	/users/profile/154467	siannetravis	Donor	1	06/01/2012	I'm fed up with all charitible organizations that are using telemarketing practices to the degree it's harrassment!  I no longer donate to anyone unless I personally recognize them and their standing within the rank & file of charities.  Not only have they annoyed our family's privacy by constantly interrupting dinner, movie, etc., they've become downright rude with their insistence even after you've told them 'no'.  We're a caring family and donate when we can, but this has destroyed our faith in the system.  Telemarketing tactics have become so abusive to our privacy....so please JUST STOP!!!!!
Cancer Support Services	112747	6	/users/profile/153444	Lightning8	General Member of the Public	1	05/23/2012	I came to this site because I got a call from them and the number that was used ( 313-203-8198 )is listed under another organization. From my experience and what I have read here, I think they should be investigated carefully before donating and perhaps by law enforcement. For sure I would not trust them with a donation, there are too many other charities that seem more ethical.
Cancer Support Services	109008	2	/users/profile/148340	Daniel25	Donor	1	04/04/2012	I made the mistake of falling to CSS's guilt-tripping, persistent phone calls, and contributed to them.  They call me constantly asking for more.  Has anyone actually heard of anyone who received SUPPORT from this organization?  Their website does not tell you how to seek their support if you have cancer.  SCAM!!!!!!
Cancer Support Services	106900	3	/users/profile/144595	stephanies	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/22/2012	Just received my second call in 2 weeks, after being asked to be removed from their calling list.  They confirmed again that only 44% of funds raised goes to cancer patients.  From everything I have read, this organization is unethical beyond inefficient, and preys on grief and fear to raise money.  Absolutely shameful.
Cancer Support Services	105697	4	/users/profile/142062	fredbrown585	Donor	1	02/02/2012	Received several calls from this charity with all calls showing up as "ACS".  The fundraiser lady said, "fully 100% of donated funds go to helping cancer patients".  A misleading statement as I suppose after all expenses are paid that 100% of what's left does go to patients.  They urge you to use a credit or debit card something I never do over the phone.  I always check out charities and this one is a NO-GO.  Expenses are high.
Cancer Support Services	101243	6	/users/profile/56633	Michelle G.	General Member of the Public	1	11/29/2011	This charity has called our home non-stop throughout the holiday season, despite multiple requests that they stop.  They call as early at 7am and as late at 10pm.  They're extremely rude, frequently just hanging up on us when we say we're not interested or they don't reach me.  I'm the COO at a nationwide nonprofit and I would be disgusted if our employees treated potential donors this way.  I would highly recommend against giving any money to this horrendous organization.
Cancer Support Services	100995	6	/users/profile/126101	groovymarlin	Donor	1	11/23/2011	Not only did the caller ID identify this organization is "ACS" (American Cancer Society), but I would swear up and down that their rep told me he was actually WITH American Cancer Society. He also mentioned helping cancer patients who "can't afford healthcare," etc. Needless to say I pledged $20 to get him off the phone, but when I got the pledge form was shocked to see it was for this "Cancer Support Services." OK, I'm down with their supposed mission, but the sad fact is they spend most of their money on fund-raising, and not actually supporting cancer patients. I will not be honoring my pledge, and will instead give money to a reputable organization.
Cancer Support Services	94593	8	/users/profile/109434	Jacqueline Pritchard	General Member of the Public	1	07/28/2011	I first received a call from this charity in which my caller-id said "ACS", which made me believe they were the American Cancer Society.  They didn't lie when I specifically asked, but if someone doesn't catch this, they will be fooled into thinking this is the American Cancer Society. I have no intention of honoring this pledge after reading that they spend more than 69% for fund-raising.  I will be emailing them telling them why and then I will honor this pledge by giving it to the American Cancer Society.
Cancer Support Services	86116	5	/users/profile/96281	ptcsahm	Donor	1	04/18/2011	This charity spends $6,000,000 a year on fundraising and only gives away $1,000,000 in a supporting grant to Cancer Foundation of America.What a scam.  They use aggressive telemarketing to acquire donations, using "cancer" and "hospices" and "poor patients who can't afford medical supplies" as their catch phrases to prey on your sympathies.  Do Not Be Fooled by this poorly run excuse for a 501c3 into giving them any of your money!
Cancer Support Services	84832	9	/users/profile/94250	Bill Woodward	Donor	1	04/05/2011	I received a phone call from this organization and I pledged $10.  After doing so I checked up on the charity.  I should have done that first.  I've learned my lesson.  I honored the pledge because in my state it is considered a legal obligation to do so.  I also wrote them a note explaining that I would never donate to them again and asked them not to call me for future donations.  They have repeatedly ignored this simple request.  Each time they call I ask them not to call again and I tell them I will never donate to their organization again.  Over the last 2 years I've received at least 3 more calls from them.  The next time this happens I plan to file a formal complaint to the government and may take other actions against them to put a stop to the harrassment.

This is a very well put organization and the Staff really do care about the youth... you could say that this organization is like family.

While there he was groomed by his coaches as one of the leaders of the team.  After he aged out of the program, he went back on several occasions and worked as a volunteer junior coach.  I can truly say that Memphis Bears is not just a youth sports organization; it is so much more and for most, it is a way of life. If you like to volunteer and give back to the community, this is a great place for you. For the child that has idle time, Memphis Bears gives them an opportunity to keep busy with all of the programs they offer. For the fatherless or motherless child, the coaches, staff and coordinators are there for them on and off of the field. For the child that has never been outside of Memphis, the Executive Directors Big Picture vision for the organization has afforded them a travel opportunity to experience life on the road to another city in and outside of TN, where they compete in tournaments and visit local attractions in that city.  A few other things that impressed me about the Memphis Bears, is that they cater to the whole child and not just the sports side of the child.  They bring in professionals to conduct Gang Awareness and Teenage Abstinence classes for all of the kids.  Not only that, did I mention that they cater to the parents as well? They implemented Parent Night Out for parents & volunteers (adults only), so that the parents can relax, mingle and get to know other parents and volunteers on a personal base. Finally, what was most impressive to me outside of everything else was when they started having Daddy Meetings with all of the fathers to get them more involved with the program during practice and on game day. So you see, Memphis Bears Inc. is not just a Youth Sports Organization, its a Family Organization where kids play and parents participate.     See picture, my child #96 - 2013 SYS Super Bowl Champs!   
Memphis Bears Inc	275562	2	/users/profile/365192	davists	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/04/2016	Having worked with other nonprofit organizations, I can truly say Memphis Bears Inc. (MBI) is a pillar within the community and a much needed asset to the children that it serves.  The opportunities that it provides for inner city youths who are from noted high crime and poverty stricken neighborhoods allow them to be removed from the daily struggle of survival and gives them positive alternatives, by focusing on education, athletics, teamwork, leadership, etc..  The various activities, along with the mentorship that is displayed by all within the organization, reinforces the mission of the organization, which ultimately promotes community pride, good citizenship, and a positive attitude geared towards success.  Additionally, I have been privy to the first-hand selflessness of the organizations leader and how without regard for personal elevation, he has devoted personal resources to ensure the youths of the organization are served.   There are not enough good things that I could say about MBI without making this review a dissertation, but if you do not believe me, take a look for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.

I love MBI, because its not just about organized sports, but it offers volunteer opportunities for adults and teens, academic assistance, life skills, and mentorship. A former parent said it best when she referred to the organization as a well -oiled machine. MBI runs very smoothly, with professionally trained staff and board members in place who work well together. With MBI, everyone has a specific job and knows whats expected of them; from the participants and parents to the staff and volunteers everybody knows what to do, when to do it and it gets done.

The MGLCC has a special place within my heart because it has allowed me to do a great majority of my Social Work Intern hours plus learn a great deal about many of the issues and concerns of teens who expeirence homelessness after telling their parents they are either gay, lesbian or trangendered to the point they're literally kicked out of the house right at that moment into the mean streets of Memphis. The Memphis Gay Lesbian Community Center has become many of the teenagers and young adults refuge last hope before getting into serious trouble like attempting suicide or getting into drugs or prostitution after getting kicked out of their own homes.  A few families has stepped up to allowed these teenagers and young adults to move into their homes but not until the Executive Director hss completed a background check on the adults. I just think doing my hours at this Center has openef my eyes and made me feel good about many things am learning when I was a board member and volunteer.  MGLCC is an excellent non-profit within 250 miles in any directon for many LGBTQ individuals in the South with many resources.  Thanks for being a beacon for those individuals in the community.

I like being able to assist others in the community with finding the resources they need.

In an ultra-conservative region of the country, teenagers are often shunned not only by their peers, but by their own families, often thrown out of their homes for coming out. The MGLCC helps these at-risk youth to find temporary homes, provide food, clothing and toiletries, and provide programs to help them survive the emotional trauma of being rejected by their families.

Not only does the MGLCC offer a wide range of services (including health screenings, educational classes & entertainment events), they are also a safe haven for the GLBT and GLBT-friendly community.

MGLCC gives people an opportunity to be themselves, to feel supported and valuable regardless of where they come from and what others have told them. Every person  has a role and a story to tell, and MGLCC allowed people to share those stories. I am not homosexual, and confess that I was nervous about whether others would question why I wanted to volunteer, but my fears were put to rest within 2 seconds of being there. The center is about loving and accepting others, and I'm a big fan of that. I think MGLCC is one of Memphis' greatest assets.

Homework Hotline	234045	2	/users/profile/298119	MaryBethIkard	Board Member	5	11/19/2014	Homework Hotline makes the most efficient use of funds of almost any nonprofit I've encountered. They employ extremely competent and caring administrative staff and teachers to answer the phone. They have a track record of excellence in service to students, with the longevity to prove it. For as long as there is homework, Homework Hotline will be helping students in our community to achieve. I have enjoyed my service as a board member, primarily because staff is such a pleasure to work with, and the board is stacked with talented and dedicated community members.

All it took was one visit to an after-school session to see firsthand the great work being done by teachers and volunteers AFTER their "day job" for me to say yes.  The level of commitment and benefit to the students is tangible.
Homework Hotline	233455	2	/users/profile/297258	TandemRealty	Board Member	5	11/11/2014	My connection both up close and remotely goes a long way back. My father-in-law was on the board when it was still establishing itself in the mid 90's. Fast forward about 15 years and I was contacted by the director for some professional services with my company. She had been referred to me by my father-in-law and I learned a little about what Homework Hotline did. At that time, I didn't give it much thought and forgot about it for about another year or 18 months. It was when I was in an office supply store that I ran into the director again and it quickly hit me how passionate the organization and her, the director, were about helping kids. She was loading up shopping carts full of school supplies to have on hand as give-aways/rewards to the students the worked with. When I approached her and she remembered who I was, I offered to purchase the entire cart of supplies as a donation to the organization. The director then told me she still had a few other stores she was scheduled to visit but they were not near by. One was 40 miles away but it would not deter her from getting the best things she could for her students. When I say "her students" I mean she treats these anonymous kids on the other end of the phone as if they were her children. She and the rest of the organization make unbelievable sacrifices and efforts above and  beyond the call of duty to give the kids they interact with the absolute best they can offer.  This sense of purpose and passion led to my interest in being on the board of directors and establishing a corporate sponsorship. Having spent a couple of years on the board, I can say even more today that I am proud to be on the board of such a wonderful organization. The good of the children they serve comes before anything else. The sacrifices made both personally and professionally that the director, teachers/tutors, assistants, and volunteers is amazing. I see far more of my money making it to the kids than I could have even imagines. In a world now with many bloated admin budgets for non-profits, they are doing it the way it should be done.  Give to Homework Hotline and you will never regret a single dime.

As a volunteer, I was able to see first hand the difference this organization is making in the lives of school children in Middle Tennessee. The phone rings non stop with math problems, science problems, reading and writing from children who may not have a parent at home to assist with homework. We even get calls from parents who need help! Homework Hotline provides free tutoring (not answer giving!) to children who need help outside of the classroom. I am proud to support this organization and know they are truly making a difference one child at a time.

As soon as a teacher finishes one call for homework assistance, the phone rings again.  It is non-stop action.Whats more important is the way Homework Hotline teachers work with students.  They take time to be sure students understand concepts and master new understandings.  The teachers communicate that they care about learning and the student on the other end of the phone.Homework Hotline has done more than most in our community to remove language barriers.  I appreciate the respect  they offer each caller.

I am personally committed to this program because I have witnessed the daily experience of our teachers as they help individual students navigate through those subjects that are giving them problems. Because of crowded classrooms most students do not get the one-on-one attention they may need and Homework Hotline fills that gap to help children succeed in school.

You can really tell the all the teachers really care about those students who call in, and you can see that they're giving all of their effort to help them. It made me a student volunteer want to do all that I could to help those child, and the satisfaction that I got from helping out was heart warming.

You know damn well your review of Paws of Dale Hollow is nothing but one lie after another! I'm pretty sure I know who you are and I darn well know why you wrote that despicable review. Puppy Lover, boy you got that right don't you? You make a small fortune taking in pregnant dogs then selling their puppies for a tidy profit all under the guise of a compassionate adoption agency. There is more class in the poop the good people at Paws have to scoop up then you have in your whole body and your shyster organization! DO NOT believe this persons review of Paws of Dale Hollow people. Just read all the other reviews then you will obviously come to the conclusion this person has a hidden agenda.
Paws of Dale Hollow	190229	2	/users/profile/248349	Lively	General Member of the Public	5	12/09/2013	Our friends, Pam and Denny Schock, are PAWS of Dale Hollow volunteers.  They would like to adopt all their furry friends but they know it isn't possible.  So instead they foster dogs and puppies.  Pam and Denny love them like one of the family.  Sometimes they get too attached to them, and find it very hard giving them up for adoption to their forever homes.  However, they keep on as PAWS volunteers because they know there is no other organization in the county to look after abused, neglected and abandoned animals.  PAWS of Dale Hollow is their ONLY hope.   To all the volunteers of this wonderful group: You are making a huge difference in the lives of these animals.   Keep up the good work!!!

Paws of Dale Hollow	190190		/users/profile/248290	fayzink	General Member of the Public	5	12/08/2013	Prior to moving to this area, I was accustomed to having the county's animal control officers patrol the streets and pick up stray dogs and haul them to the pound where they were routinely "euthanized" if not claimed in 24 hours. Thanks to PAWS of Dale Hollow, Pickett County Tennessee does not treat it strays in that manner. PAWS volunteers provide kind and loving foster homes for the dogs and care for them until they are adopted. Oftentimes, the stray is a pregnant female in which case, dedicated PAWS volunteers care for the mother until she delivers her liter and when the pups are weaned, find homes for the pups and the mother dog. If the animals are sick or have special needs, they receive whatever medication or treatment they need. PAWS volunteers provide an essential service in our community and I commend them for the fine job they are doing.
Paws of Dale Hollow	190186		/users/profile/248285	susienal	General Member of the Public	5	12/08/2013	The need in our area is so great for loving homes for the many abandoned and abused dogs.  I have come to know many of the wonderful, kind hearted volunteers that open their homes and hearts to these animals.  I am truly amazed at how they always put the lives of these dogs first no matter the cost or time involved.  I know several of their success stories and feel that they should be recognized for the wonderful work that they do to match these dogs with the right people to give the animal a great forever home.

Paws of Dale Hollow	106356		/users/profile/143561	Monika2	Client Served	5	02/13/2012	I have found PAWS of Dale Hollow to be a wonderful organization.  When I adopted a puppy from them via PetFinder and he came to us sick, Ms. Crockett and the other wonderful volunteers helped us through a terrible time.  Someone was in contact with me everyday, either by phone or email to see how the puppy was doing.  The puppy had to be put to sleep and the vet bills were I incurred were high;  PAWS reimbursed me for the vet bills.  In my opinion, PAWS is an organization that cares deeply for the animals in their care and just as much for the people that adopt them.  
Paws of Dale Hollow	190174		/users/profile/248274	amyngyp	Client Served	5	12/08/2013	We adopted our 4 month old lab mix Millie in March of this year, and we were so pleased with the PAWS of Dale Hollow team and the process that when we saw our adult dog Oliver this summer, we fell in love and adopted him as well. The adoption process was extremely fair, and I appreciated the adoption application and Lorretta's thorough questions. I also appreciated the fact that she contacted all of our references. The  PAWS Team wants to make sure their dogs are going to be well cared for and are going to forever home. The best part is that they are always there if you need them for advice. Millie and Oliver are our first dogs, their foster mom, Mary, and Cathy are alway available to give advice on any questions I had (or still have), and they never make me feel like I am bothering them! The work this organization has done is amazing. I intend to support their efforts for as long as they are rescuing dogs.

Paws of Dale Hollow	190129		/users/profile/248221	Kim_121	Client Served	5	12/07/2013	My family found PAWS of Dale Hollow thru Petfinders a couple of years ago.  My mom & dad had unexpectedly lost their dog, and my dad went into a depression.  My dad finally agreed to let us look for a dog and I searched online.  When I found "Chelsea" thru PetFinders and contacted Cathy, she very quickly responded to my email inquiries, informing me of the cost and the procedure.  Once approved with had "Chelsea" by the end of the week.  Even after receiving the pup, she answered all my questions about some concerns we had, even offering to pay for doggy training.  This pup has become my dad's constant companion.  He is visually impaired, and she helps maintain his independence, and gives him a purpose every day. In 2013, my husband and I decided it was time to get another dog.  I saw a pup thru PAWS FB page that caught my attention, that needed a foster home, and my we agreed to foster him (with the intention that we would probably adopt him).  After we had him a couple of months, we realized that he was going to be bigger than our little apartment was going to hold, and he had so much energy that it wasn't going to be fair to force him to  be an apartment dog, so we got in touch with Cathy.  She worked with is to find another rescue organization that was local to us that specialized in the  breed of dog our pup was.  It was devastating to give him up, but it was in his best interest to be in a better environment, and Cathy worked with us every step of the way.  Never once making us feel bad because we couldn't keep this pup.   I would adopt from Cathy in a heart beat!   The group at PAWS of Dale Hollow are a wonderful group of people who are in this for the dogs and only the dogs.  I believe if they all lives on large farms, none of these dogs would ever make it for adoption because they would keep and love and spoil them all!
Paws of Dale Hollow	190126		/users/profile/248217	LovesNH	Client Served	5	12/07/2013	I have had Poodles most of my life and wanted another for us and as a companion to my Toy Poodle Holly.  It was time to adopt from rescue though and I had never done that before.  I found my Levi on Petfinder with Paws of Dale Hollow in 2012.  I filled out the application and had some phone calls back and forth, they called my references and I was approved.  Not sure why someone (the one person with the negative post) would be so worried about when and where they could return their pet???  I consider my pets to be forever and would adopt from them again in a heartbeat.  Any time I have had a question they have addressed it and I have continued to follow them and will.   I seriously don't think the adoption fee was at all unreasonable and have seen others with much, much higher fees and some want the fee up front before you are even approved.  Not so with Paws so I was not at all worried that they were a scam.  There were some that I felt very uncomfortable with and stayed away from when they asked for a large sum of money up front just to fill out the adoption form.  We also love our Levi dearly and he has been the best addition to our family that we could have asked for.   Love this organization!
Paws of Dale Hollow	190121		/users/profile/248213	Julie157	Client Served	5	12/07/2013	I adopted my dog through Paws of Dale Hollow two years ago this month. They were very thorough in their application process which I found to be impressive. These people make sure their dogs go to good homes. In the application process I was asked to provide three character references and Loretta called each and every one of them. Do you know how many times references are requested but never followed up on?  It happens a lot! Again, these folks take the time to be sure their dogs are going to the right home. If you're not the right fit, you're application will be denied. That's how it should be. Loretta was fostering my dog and to this day she still checks in and asks how he is doing. The dogs that pass through this rescue are loved from the very beginning. Their dogs are treated with respect and their well being is always number one. Some rescues might cater to potential adopters in an attempt to get a dog into any home, but not these people. If you want to be coddled and catered to you're simply doing it wrong. 
Paws of Dale Hollow	190118		/users/profile/248209	Portiasmom	Client Served	5	12/07/2013	I first met PAWS volunteers in 2008 when a mother dog and her 2 pups were dumped near our home.  This was a routine situation where, before PAWS, our only choices were to look the other way (not gonna happen) or try and help the dogs ourselves.  Two PAWS volunteers came to our home to meet the dogs and offered assistance with food, vet and medicine if we could foster.  We did and this was the beginning of a wonderful friendship.  Since then PAWS has helped us with approximately 10 stray dogs, mostly pregnant females and their pups, and because of this I have also started volunteering with them.  Every penny PAWS gets whether its through donations or adoption fees goes solely for the care of the dogs.  Currently all the dogs are fostered in private homes but PAWS is looking toward acquiring a facility so they can help many more animals, because there are more in need that can be helped right now.  I'm so happy to have met them and honored to be able to help in my small ways.
Paws of Dale Hollow	188838		/users/profile/246463	Robert Butkus	Donor	5	11/19/2013	I have been a donor of Paws of Dale Hollow since 2008. Previously I had donated to PAWS Chicago as they began a transition to a new facility. I stopped the Chicago donation when I decided to retire in Byrdstown TN and realized the Paw's of Dale Hollow organization needed my funding more than PAWS Chicago. (A fine organization).The Paw's of Dale Hollow organization has proven to be a stellar operation with good direction. The organization is driven solely by volunteers. That is volunteers who have a strong desire, big hearts and a constant drive (at any time of the day), to assist any animal in need of help. Most instances require the volunteers to turn over their own homes, as fosters, to help the animals get "back on their feet". I am making this sound too "simplistic" due to space constraints as this picture involves much more including vet visits, assessments, possibly daily medication and preparing the animals for adoption in a healthy physical state. No dog is put up for adoption unless it's judged to be ready for the transition into a new home that also must meet the requirements of the organization. 
Paws of Dale Hollow	169854		/users/profile/225120	ReneA	Client Served	5	09/16/2013	In 2007, I was looking for a dog as I had lost mine to cancer. I went on line and googled the type of dog I wanted. I was directed to Pickett County Humane Society. After exchanging emails and phone calls with Cathy, she arranged to have someone come out to meet me and inspect my property for fitness. Once that was done, I got me new dog named Will. Five years later, Will is the greatest little dove ever. In 2010, I saw a toy poodle on their web site named Peanut. I adopted my little special needs dog. He weighed about seven pounds. He, too, was my constant companion...sadly in May of this year, I lost Peanut to a brain tumor. Now I have Bella, a pup and such a wonderful dog......from Cathy. In all the years I've known Cathy, I have never known her to be unresponsive towards either me or my dogs. I suspect if it was not for Cathy and her organization, many dogs would not be alive today.... Rene Archambault
Paws of Dale Hollow	169499	2	/users/profile/224621	Puppylover	General Member of the Public	1	09/13/2013	This rescue is a complete joke! First of all they aren't clear at all about their procedure and they lie! I was looking at a dog from them and in the first email Cathy sent me she said that she and her rescue were "directly linked" to a shelter in NH and she said if there was any problem with the relationship between dog and owner that the people in NH would help you out. So after saying this and that I have 15 days to give back the dog, I assumed that I could give the dog back to the shelter in NH. WRONG! After I filled out an application and was approved, she put me in contact with one of her volunteers, Loretta, who was very pushy on the phone and wouldn't even properly answer my questions! When I asked if I can return the pup if there was a problem to the place in NH, she answered back with would you return your own child!? What kind of response is that? She also said that they aren't linked with a shelter in NH. What!? When I told Cathy this and how she practically said that they wouldn't take the pup back and if it was true, she said that Loretta would never say that and she denied my application! She seriously denied my application because I asked a question and accused her beloved employee! Oh and she also said that they aren't linked with a shelter in NH even though she herself said they are. Loretta apparently called it a rescue which isn't true. It's actually a shelter. Plus there was a different story of how the dog was found on petfinder and a different one from Cathy herself! These people are seriously crazy and I would stay far away if I was you! They are very unprofessional and don't know how to run a business. If they told me from the beginning where would I return the dog, i'm guessing Tennesse, then I wouldn't have wasted my time. But they made it seem that they were working with NH, just so they can get the dog adopted. What a bunch of bull. I hope all the dogs get taken away from them and they get shut down. I've dealt with many shelter/rescue people and none of them have been this rude before. Stay far away!

I have followed their activities with increasing admiration over time.   This is an all-volunteer organization which always puts the animals first -- there are no fancy offices, no  salaries, no staff retreats at resorts.  Donations are used solely for the benefit of the dogs in their care.  And this group of warm-hearted, kind people provide wonderful care to the needy animals in their area.  Although I live clear across the country from Pickett County, I feel privileged to be able to support their efforts.
Paws of Dale Hollow	106352		/users/profile/143374	jepineo	Client Served	5	02/13/2012	We found PAWS via Petfinder when we were looking for a new dog to bring home. We have always adopted dogs that were strays or unwanted, and we were impressed with the devotion of the PAWS rescue people. The folks at PAWS were incredibly helpful - and thorough when finding out about our backgrounds. When we chose our boy, we found out he had had a rough start, but they did everything they could to help ease his transition and today we have a loving, energetic dog. He still has fear issues, but he has overcome so many obstacles and the result is a rescue dog who is a brilliant companion. We are grateful for the foundation they gave Kai, and for the realization that he could grow and mature if he had a forever home.

Using Charity Navigator, I am reviewing all the potential charities that I will support this year.  After seeing the two huge salaries for the CEO and COO of St. Jude, I concluded that my financial support should go elsewhere.
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	148778	1	/users/profile/198157	Jordan Coleman	Client Served	5	01/31/2013	I am a patient at St. Jude and I give them five stars because even though they may not be making enormous breakthroughs they still treat cancer patients, especially children for free. Personally I have received medications through them that I never would have been able to afford. Their fundraising may not be very efficient but they still treat their patients with enormous integrity.
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	148578	3	/users/profile/197825	Lady G	Donor	2	01/27/2013	My sister passed away from Leukemia and I've always donated to St. Jude - but seeing the outrageous salaries of the top officers has really made me reconsider giving to this organization.  I regret that I will not be giving this year.  There are other organizations more worthy of my donations.
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	146848	11	/users/profile/165890	Judith10	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/17/2012	I worked at St. Jude on staff for 17 yr. I saw it change from an institution focussed on the children to an institution that derided its clinical staff and placed its priorities elsewhere i.e. laboratory though they still used the children as the means to raise money. Professionally, St. Jude has not made a major contribution to the outcome of children with cancer in over 20 yr - others have done that including the key areas of leukemia, brain tumors and non-Hodgkin lymphoma despite their claims on TV and elsewhere. The staff including nurse, techs etc  who actually take care of the children have minimal retirements/benefits - actually embarrassing despite having spent 20-30 yr at the institution. Danny Thomas was great - and truly loved the children and supported staff. When he died - that died. When Don Pinkel (first medical director)  left , the achievements in cancer therapy left. Give to your local cancer hospital - they give the same or better care. St. Jude is bloated with money.
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	146364		/users/profile/193153	Linda Powell	Donor	4	12/10/2012	I put exceeds expectations because I believe their HEART and INTENT is in the right place.  I think their Fundraising Methods are outdated.   They need to use more Internet and less mail service.         Partnering with Carnival Cruise Lines was a smart move.  But they need to do more to develop that relationship and those cruising on their ships.  That is a an audience of 64,000+ every week.   And there are people like myself who cruise with Carnival 7 or 8 times a year that would more than happy to volunteer to assist St Jude in getting the word out on these ships.   We are cruising on them anyway, so there would be ZERO cost to St Jude.
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	146286	5	/users/profile/193030	Mark Payette	Donor	2	12/09/2012	My wife and I have been donors to St. Jude Research Hospital for many years. We always did it to help the kids. We were inspired by the late Danny Thomas who did so much to help St. Jude Research Hospital. Recently, through Charity Navigator, we were made aware of the outrageous salaries paid to the COO and the CEO. It is beyond belief that these two men would work for a charity and take a salary this large out of the charitie's funds. Needless to say we are very disappointed.
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	146200	6	/users/profile/192906	nfl8able	Donor	1	12/07/2012	I am disgusted by the size of the executive salaries. I urge the board of this otherwise worthy charity to trim the bloated executive salaries back to the five-figure range, which is an amount that is more in line with the philosophy of a charitable organization.  The word is GIVING, not GREED...
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	146069	5	/users/profile/192722	Adrienne L.	Donor	2	12/06/2012	I saw a commercial about St. Jude that really touched my heart about 4 years ago and called their number to donate $20 for their research.  Since then, they've probably spent over $20 in all the letters asking for more donations, address stickers, and notebooks they've sent to me since then.  I've also moved three times since then and gotten married/changed my last name and they've somehow always stayed up to date with my current address and last name which must cost more money.  I mean this sounds like a great organization but why would I spend money on them unless I know that they'll deal with my donation wisely?  They should spend more money on the kids directly and less on measly gifts to donors that they didn't ask for.  And--not to sound bitter--but I called them this morning to ask them about where the money goes.  I talked to several people and they were all extremely snotty to me in tone and word and none cared to hear my genuine concern.  I think that there a lot more charitable organizations out there more worthy of your support.
American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, Inc.	128091	4	/users/profile/173223	Cure Cancer Now	Donor	1	10/23/2012	ALSAC spends so much of the money it collects for children with cancer that it is no longer a reputable charity. When you give a gift of any amount to this charity, over 20% of your gift is spent on things that have nothing to do with childhood cancer. Last year, the charitys rate of growth in expenses outpaced its rate of growth in revenue. Yet, the CEO of the charity nearly DOUBLED his own salary from the previous year. This charity would have you believe it desperately needs your money to keep the hospitals doors open, yet it reports that it has over $2.5 BILLION in net assets on hand today.There are some good cancer charities out there  ALSACs just not one of them.

Less than 5 cents out of every dollar has been reported as actually been given to cancer patients. Grants were a measly $50 - $200. But, 95 cents out of every dollar, millions of dollars, goes to management and fundraisers, who get filthy rich from 'charitable' contributions. They are being investigated by the state of New York for the car donation scam. Why aren't rip-offs like this illegal under federal law?

They need to be shut downThey called everyday early morning even evenings, sometimes 3-4 times a day.. I can hear all the other solicitors in the back ground making calls. I never gave, as Susan Komen would never operate like that. Either would MD Anderson when fund raising. i think this is a Inc. that raises money but a small portion actually goes to Childrens cancer.  The soliciting company and the person that set up Childrens cancer fund  get paid with your money.

Childrens Cancer Fund Of America	151266	18	/users/profile/201910	Donna Maske	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/19/2013	I worked as a professional fundraiser for CCFS and let me try to explain how this works. First we contact you for a childhood charity (this is what is called cold calling). Once you make a donation your name became part of the companies list, which gave us the okay to call you again on behalf of other charities such as Children's Cancer Fund of  America. These calls usually came just a couple of weeks after your donation was received. Then a few weeks later we'd be calling you again on behalf of another organization, and then another and another. After that...we'd be calling you again to renew your pledge, which is usually every three months. So all in all, your kind hardheartedness bought you a boat load of calls. As callers we had no way of knowing when your donation was last made and as for me, I lost sleep over the harassment that we were causing you, the donor.It seemed to most of us in the office that some of these charities were fraudulent but when you need a job, you need a job.As for asking to be removed from our calling list...as callers we did click the remove button on the computer, but once we moved on to the next call we had no idea what took place. There are thousands of people I talked to over the course of the last two years that demanded to be removed, only to be contacted by us again and again.If you feel that you have been harassed, please contact the attorney general in your state to find out what you can do. While I was a caller we called CA MN and MI

They are completely unprofessional,when I refused to donate, the person told me that 'children were dying' and couldn't I spare $10??I would never donate to a so-called 'charity' that uses tactics like that.
Childrens Cancer Fund Of America	148977	11	/users/profile/198449	Scott52	Donor	1	02/05/2013	I previously donated to this organization but this year decided to do some research before answering calls for donations.  My research determined that nearly 95% of the money donated goes towards corporate salaries, commissions and administrative costs.  I have stopped donating to them but they continue to call me 8-10 times per day.  Additionally, it appears that the company operating the Childrens Cancer Fund of America also runs several other funds, each calling me for donations.  This company sells your information to others and will not stop calling.  I recommend that no one contribute to this organization but research companies like the American Cancer Society and other reputable organizations where your money will be used for something other than CEO payouts.
Childrens Cancer Fund Of America	147640	12	/users/profile/195308	Best Bob	Donor	1	01/03/2013	This organization called me last year and asked for a $25 contribution.  I said that I could send a check.  The caller pressured me for a credit card number,  saying that they would get the donation faster - I said no.  I received their letter and sent in the check.  I then received a call thanking me and asking for another contribution.  They promised not to call again, but I said no thanks.  Since then they have called twice.   Each time I have reminded them that they said they wouldn't call again and I hang up.I am very upset because I found out that only a small percentage of their donations actually gets paid out and that the BBB has asked them for information with no response.
Childrens Cancer Fund Of America	147021	2	/users/profile/194137	Spoklie	Volunteer	1	12/19/2012	I am angry at the solicitation tactics of this organization.  The person who initially spoke with me asked me if I wanted to donate $30 as I had in the past.  I said yes, but then went back and checked all my records (my husband donates sometimes, when solicitors call for me).  I had NEVER donated. When I went to my online account to make out the donation, I noticed that there was no Children's Cancer Fund of America set up as a recognized payee--but that there was a Children's Cancer RESEARCH Fund.  The names are very close--but NOT the same.  I have received two letters since then;  tonight I left a message as to my doubts of their legitimate purpose at the "personal donor page" they have set up for me. 
Childrens Cancer Fund Of America	142369	2	/users/profile/188833	pam.kinzey	General Member of the Public	1	11/25/2012	I contributed to this org. when they called once. Then they called a few months later and wanted another donation. I reluctantly authorized it. Then I read that the org. did not give a large percentage of the money to the children's needs. So next time they called, I said I wasn't interested. Now they've sent me a notice saying my last donation was $20, and can I send more? It has a recent processing date and number listed with my phone number. So I assume they did an unauthorized removal of funds from my previous credit card no. given. I will find out.
Childrens Cancer Fund Of America	131760	2	/users/profile/177296	VAmom2	Donor	1	10/31/2012	A few weeks ago I received a mailing like the kind you would get once you have offered money. I knew I had not made a donation promise, so I threw it away. The next week I received a call from the charity reminding me that I promised to make an annual contribution. I asked them the date of my last donation. The solicitor said I last gave in July. I said I wanted to make an annual donation and that if I had given in July then it was too early for another donation. Then the solicitor told be the previous donation was July of 2011. This was a LIE, but I did not discover it until after I promised a small donation. When I went back to my records I discovered that my last contribution was made THIS July. I am sending the donation this time in the hopes that it will actually do some good, but I have my doubts. I will no longer be making any contributions to this charity.
Childrens Cancer Fund Of America	121689	5	/users/profile/165570	dhaig	General Member of the Public	1	08/30/2012	I manage my Mother's financial affairs and noted several suspicious transactions in her checking account.  Between May 1, 2012 and August 22, 2012 were four transactions totaling $130.  Two of the transactions were telephone authorized debits, the other two were checks written by my Mother.  After questioning my Mother, the pattern described in other reviews became apparent- letters sent with "Friendly Reminders" for  donations, followed by telephone calls asking if promised donations had been sent.   These tactics strike me as abusive and constitute preying on senior citizens.  I cautioned my Mother not to give her checking account or credit card information to anyone calling her on the phone.

One person is generous to a fault.  They sent her a "Friendly Reminder" dated January 9th (received in February).  Then she received a telephone call asking if the funds had been sent yet.  She is insistent on sending them a token donation.  HOWEVER, the "Friendly Reminder" is in the exact same format as the Firefighters Fund.  The tactics are identical as well...receipt of the "friendly reminder" followed by a telephone call within a day or two.  The telephone calls she received insisted that she had promised them money in a previous telephone call.  I know this cannot be the case, as she always tells them she has had a stroke and cannot make any donations at this time.

Horse Plus Humane Society	235854	4	/users/profile/319570	Ernie J.	Volunteer	5	12/23/2014	In 2014, Horse Plus drove a very large stock trailer with partitions and another large, multi-horse trailer hundreds of miles on the incident I know of (I've been told about their traveling 1000,'s of miles to help out with other wild horse rescues).  At the very difficult incident I'm familiar with, Horse Plus assisted another animal rescue/welfare nonprofit.  Their expertise in corralling, loading, safely transporting over rough terrain, and carefully unloading extremely wild and unpredictable horses at the destination was both professional and compassionate.  There were concerns for the safety of both the volunteers and the horses, but Horse Plus folks knew what they were doing.  When I say "wild," I mean that in the fullest sense of the word. They volunteered their services and transported all the horses to safety.   Horse Plus's integrity, expertise, and willingness to offer their services raised the bar for horse rescue groups.  We fully support them and their wonderful work.
Horse Plus Humane Society	233764	6	/users/profile/49971	husker01	General Member of the Public	1	11/15/2014	This is NOT a horse rescue, this is a scam and the animals pay the price.  They are NOT a HUMANE Society, it is Just a name.   People do not realize this, they are misleading and dishonest.  Their mission is to keep horses from going to slaughter, BUT they have a HIGH Euth rate as they do not work with horses to get them re homed. They are suppose to have gelding clinics but they kill stallions so there is no more breeding.  Sadly the name is misleading and people need to return their adoptive animals there to find out Tawnee is allowed to use certain words that will allow her to KILL Euthanize the horse.   Words  Like not adoptable, dangerous, is her  common language for killing them.   their mission is to keep horses from going to slaughter,  BUT it is what this non profit does that is not what the general public knows of.   sign over your horse along with MONEY,, and high risk of that horses dead in 30 days.     It is sad a non profit uses the name humane society when they are not..    They do not answer questions,  posting on the internet of going to an auction in Okla. yet no visual of being even in a parking lot of an auction.  asking for donations yet not answering questions of the public is against IRS non profit regulations.   NO name of the vet they allegedly used to put down 2 animals from this auction.    how odd is that?   Public is allowed to know this info.   what is the big secret?   the area of their rescue in NO. Calif  has no welcome mat for this couple.   Most rescues HELP the health and welfare of a horse.   They are Wanna BEES. wanna be like HSUS, wear shirts like HSUS, want to bring in big bucks like REAL organizations that rescue and rehab animals.  Horse Plus, has in the past posted their KILL count on New Years Eve each year.  As if its a big milestone that those number of horses were SAVED from the Slaughter pipeline.  But they were also not given a chance of rehab or being re homed.      Please find a real horse rescue that cares.   There is something wrong with an individual that finds glory in find excuse to kill a healthy horses without trying to  rehab it.   do your home work folks,  too many lies can go on the internet, if you are not local to a " rescue" then find a local rescue to donate to.  if the locals want nothing to do with  people in an alleged rescue, there is a reason.

Horse Plus Humane Society	161986	8	/users/profile/214880	Ms. Lacey	Donor	1	07/03/2013	I was a supporter of Horse plus humane for quite awhile. I started to notice some inconsistencies with their posts, posting pictures of the same horse , using a different name and begging for money to help pay for care of the horse. They advertise that they offer low cost gelding clinics to offer the service to people  who could not otherwise afford it, showed pictures of the horses they helped the owners with gelding, then they post same picture of the horses asking for donations to pay for gelding??? They put down horses that are healthy young and just need time , patience and training, claiming they are dangerous. Most horses in a rescue situation are traumatized and require time and patience, they kill them. They have killed horses to make room for others coming in instead of saying we are full and working on placing the horses they have. The money they collect and their adoption rate does not match, most are put down after surrender fee is paid so where is the money going??? I started asking questions on their facebook page and my questions were ignored by Horse Plus but I did get nasty private messages from people affiliated with them. I finally tried calling them directly on the phone and each time I was told no one was there to answer my questions but promised a return call right away, after trying for two months I gave up with NO RESPONSE from Horse Plus but they did block me from their facebook page so my comments would not be seen by the people who fund this fraudulent so called rescue.  I have watched them make personal attacks on peoples character for simply questioning them about where a horse ended up or how much money they raised. They make false claims about who they are and what they do, they recently were forced by I believe animal control to revise their website and remove the false claims. Someone needs to stop these people, they give all rescues a bad name . The truth is very ugly!!!!!!

I was sad that I wasn't able to meet Tawnee, but understand that she is very busy.   They answered all of my questions honestly and without using pre-written lines.  Steve especially is a very down-to-earth kind of guy and is very nice. The facility is immaculate, well cared for, and all of the horses had food and water.  I would recommend adopting from this shelter to any of my friends!
Horse Plus Humane Society	117975	3	/users/profile/160454	MommaG	Client Served	5	07/10/2012	The comments made in the December 2010 time frame were generated by the County seizing horses from a neighboring "rescue." The hearing is on You Tube with graphic details.   NER, now known as Horse Plus Humane Society continues their above reproach work.  I have adopted 2 mustang mares from them, and supported numerous projects and emergency rescues.  Their facility has been recently moved to Bangor, CA.

Horse Plus Humane Society	108819	8	/users/profile/148103	HorseDR	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/03/2012	Horse plus  kills 90% at least, of the horses that people pay to surrender or they have donations to get horses from auctions.  They do not know how to train or properly care for horses  and kill horses untrained calling them "dangerous".  They are nothing but money greedy killers!  they do nothing to rehabilitate to help the horse get a proper home.   I watched them load up 9 horses crammed in a trailer and left the property for over an hour with the horses standing in the trailer without anyone on the property at all.  it is likely they hauled them to the rendering service where they were all put down in the trailer. (which people have witnessed before) they are dangerous people.  no horse is safe around them.   God help the horses that get stuck in thier hands.  Ive never seen such heartless people.

She was a nice young mare with a lot of potential.  Neither of these mares were dangerous.  They were just young, wiggly youngsters who did well with patience & being shown what was expected of them.  I worked under them with no problem.  Such a tragedy.  Just one more tragedy perpetrated by Horse+.                                                                                                                        " Hello Diana. This is Gary Vincent, you came out to my house in Bangor to trim my horses hooves back in the summer of 2011. You really liked my horse Jazzy. She was a Arab cross and you said that if I ever had to find her a home that you would take her. Recently because of economic hardship I was forced to return Jazzy and Bella to the Horse Plus Humane Society. I thought that I was doing right by them. After multiple e-mails to them going unreturned about Jazzy and Bella, I finally received a response from them about how Jazzy and Bella were doing. They responded with this " We were unable to place them into our adoptions program and decided to give them the Last Act of Kindness. Jazzy was almost impossible to catch, even in a small area with more than one person. Bella was bad on escaping pens and could have seriously injured herself, or even struck by a vehicle. We do apologize but it was for their best interest. "  Would you be willing to write an e-mail statement on the Jazzy's temperament and if you would have been willing to take her could you state that also. My daughter and I are both devastated by this. We never thought that they would euthanize two young adoptable horses. We were not under the impression that this would even be considered and we were never even notified that they had decided to do that. We had many, many people that would have taken those horses but we thought that it would be best to give them back to the rescue. If you could write a statement stating how you felt about Jazzy and how she and Bella behaved when you were trimming their hooves, I would greatly appreciate it. " 
Horse Plus Humane Society	108338	4	/users/profile/147453	Ken Maguir	General Member of the Public	5	03/26/2012	Horse Plus Humane Society, formerly NorCal Equine Rescue, is by far and away THE BEST horse welfare organization in the world.  They stay true to their mission statement (saving horses from abuse and slaughter) despite so many naysayers.  Don't believe those that have a personal vendetta against Horse Plus.  They do a great job, their facility is neat and clean, and the horses make amazing recovery while at their shelter.  Yes they are open door, yes they euthanise and YES they are completely open about it.  If you don't like that, don't donate, but if you are a real person living in a real world that is somewhat devoid of pixies and rainbow bridges with unicorns dancing across them, Horse Plus is the place for you to donate your hard earned money to make the most good.

She was killed by Dr Death Weaver of Look Ahead Veterinary, Ororville, CA in a few days.  They NEVER verify ownership of horses and/or try to locate legal owners of horses they take into their "rescue"  They killed my horse!
Horse Plus Humane Society	58995	6	/users/profile/63334	gary	Donor	1	12/21/2010	These people are power mongers!  They put horses down so readily that do not need to be!  They bully people into turning thier horses into them then turn around a put it down cause its "ugly'.   I found out that my horse was distroyed  2 days after I took it to them unknowingly of how they are.  I would give anything to have my horse back and alive!  he was better off with me than dead.  a 6 year old broke trail horse  that was not lame did not deserve this!  I want to sue them for there cold hearted lying!  they are Con Artists and need to be stopped.  They sounded so sincere i believed them.  They need to be euthanized!

Horse Plus Humane Society	58500	3	/users/profile/62314	sir count	General Member of the Public	5	12/06/2010	Actually I have been to this rescue, I went with a friend who adopted a horse there. A dump?? HARDLY. It is clean, safe and the horses are well fed.  No Yes you got it all....who created the suffering??? You really have to ask that??? The rescue???...LOL....HOW ABOUT BLAMING THE UNCARING OWNERS WHO DUMPED THEIR HORSES AND ALLOWED THEM TO END UP THIS WAY???? Kill buyers are only middlemen...cleaning up the messes left by uncaring owners. And I suppose you blame Animal Control for killing cute little puppies and kittens instead of the moron owners who didnt spay and neuter...GEEEEZZZ  Norcal/Horse Plus Humane has NEVER claimed to be no-kill. Geez people, get on their website, click on "policies" at the bottom of the page and learn something. Tawnee has stated on their blog they are a open door turn in shelter, just like the ones for dogs and cats. Unfortunately, there are not homes for every horse and they do euth for space, among other reasons. If you dont like that, then dont support them. This is America, its your choice. Its real easy to criticize sitting behind a compter when they are the ones out there actually DOING something...even if that means euthing a healthy horse instead of letting it go thru the agony of slaughter. 
Horse Plus Humane Society	58458	8	/users/profile/62234	husker01	General Member of the Public	1	12/04/2010	This organization states on this site that they have a gelding clinic. It appears they have only had one gelding clinic,but aggressivelyget horses at auction that other private owners would buy, and thenthis rescue destroys them if no home is found in 60 days. This rescue asks for funds on their blog and website to rescue horses,but it is not clear what happens to these horses. their policy is to put down a horse, healthy or not, if a home is not found in 60 days.

Hope Restored	261767		/users/profile/350393	Writer	Board Member	5	10/05/2015	I love that Restore Haiti is a cause my whole family can be involved in.  I have taken 3 of my children on mission trips to Haiti to and have enjoyed sharing this experience with them. When you go on a trip to Haiti you can see where your donations are going and how they are impacting lives. I have no doubts that my money is being used appropriately to truly make a difference.

Hope Restored	200458		/users/profile/261679	garyinlockport	Volunteer	5	05/16/2014	This was my second trip, march 2014, with Restore Haiti.  We were a part of a team that included 6 children and 9 adults. It was a great and life changing trip.  Having children as part of the team was great.  The interactions they had with the Haitian kids was priceless.  Our team was involved in a home construction project, daily visits to a school, serving with the daily feeding program, and just loving on the people.  I was also able to see my sponsored child and give her a gift and spend some time.  I saw many of the same kids from the first trip in 2013 and it was great to see progress and how they are cared for.  Our team was well taken care of from the time we got picked up from the airport, to where we stayed,  and to the food we ate.  Coming from America, food and weather can be big roadblocks, but we were well prepared beforehand with the information that we needed and we were always looked after during the week.  Seeing first hand and being part of the work they do,  I highly endorse Restore Haiti, from their sponsorship program to their short term trips. 
Hope Restored	197102		/users/profile/257648	Dina G.	Volunteer	5	04/05/2014	I went on my first trip with Restore Haiti in March and the impact has been life changing.  When we first got there, traveling through Port-Au-Prince I was shocked at the conditions of the city - I've never seen anything like it.   Traveling through the mountains to Jacmel - I kept thinking, "There are good things in Haiti, Lord show me the good things here."  I have to admit I struggled with the disparity of Haiti- things were either very beautiful or very horrible.  Sitting in the small cinder block church on simple wooden benches with a community of believers worshiping our Lord, I saw the beautiful things in Haiti.  Meeting my sponsor kids for the first time, hugging the preschoolers everyday at playtime, greeting the kids in the feeding program with a smile and eye contact everyday~ I saw the good things in Haiti.  Having kids come up and just want to touch me or hold my hand~ there are so many good things in Haiti and Restore Haiti is making it possible for anyone to be a part of all the good things the Lord is doing there~we had 6 children under the age of 12 on our team and the impact on them will last throughout their lives...and mine.
Hope Restored	171940		/users/profile/227634	gretbet	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	If you sponsor a child, most organizations send you a picture, here you can hug your child and they hug you back. This is my 6th Haiti trip and every trip I see improvement in conditions, education and attitudes. These children are precious.  I am 72 years old and can still hug a child. I have 3 in Haiti and can't wait to go back. Remember children are 25% of the worlds population and 100% of the future. God bless Restore Haiti.
Hope Restored	171816		/users/profile/227472	Bob_45	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	I recently participated in my first trip with Restore Haiti (Hope Restored) to Jacmel in my capacity as director of missions for our church New River Fellowship. Our church has financially supported RH for several years and in the interest of full disclosure both the founder of RH and the executive director are personal friends and members of our church. With that background I can say I was extremely impressed with the work taking place in Haiti. The school, feeding program and the home building programs are meeting tremendous needs in this community. The poverty is beyond description yet the children are being well cared for and are learning not only book knowledge but tangible life skills that will serve them for ever. Most importantly they are meeting and building relationships with people that are demonstrating the love of the Father. I know RH to be fiscally responsible and they really care for their volunteers. It is easy to see why volunteers fall in love with the people of Haiti and return time after time!    
Hope Restored	171736		/users/profile/227382	Kisha J	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	I honestly had to wait until I had decompressed and processed my most recent trip to Jacmel, Haiti through Restore Haiti. This was the 3rd trip I've been on with this organization, and I am pleased to say that I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The lives of the people in the community are changing. The children are healthy, and happy. They are fed, and schooled. They are learning english. Every dollar coming into the organization is going to directly serve those who need it most. This trip impacted me so deeply. I am thankful, and grateful for organizations like Restore Haiti who do, what they say, they will do.

Hope Restored	171499		/users/profile/227089	Karen197	Volunteer	5	09/24/2013	I have personally experienced how Hope Restored (aka Restore Haiti) is changing the lives of an entire community outside of Jacmel, Haiti.  I first travelled with Restore Haiti to Jacmel in July of 2012.  I have witnessed how this organization is providing sponsorship for approximately 500 children in and around Jacmel.  Because of Restore Haiti, these children have an opportunity to go to school, receive hot meals and have access to basic medical care.  The gratitude and love of the residents in the area is apparent everywhere.  Everyone that I spoke to told me their story and how Restore Haiti was changing the future for this community.   I had the privilege of returning to Haiti with Restore Haiti again this September to assist in delivering school supplies to the children of the community.  It was amazing to see the changes that had taken place in the past year.  Restore Haiti had built several new homes for people previously living in substandard conditions and a new kitchen for the children in the feeding program had been completed.  Their hard work and dedication to the community continues to amaze me.  I look forward to continuing to support this amazing organization.
Hope Restored	123627		/users/profile/168314	kimpettit	Volunteer	5	09/27/2012	My first trip to Jacmel, Haiti was June 2012.  This organiziation is making a difference in the lives of not only the children, but the people in Jacmel as a whole.  While there I helped in the Feeding program, working with the most incredible kitchen ladies who so willingly gave their entire day to providing a meal to over 400 children.   It was hard, hot work in a very small kitchen with primative tools and they did it with a smile on their faces.   I also helped finish painting a house that had been built by a previous team.  Getting to meet the family that would move into that house was incredible.   My team and I also participated in what we called the 'One More Brick' project, where we carried concrete blocks down a very long, steep hill to a work site where a house was being built.  By carrying these bricks down, we saved a great deal of money on the cost of this house.   But the greatest thing I did was just love these people.   They are so open in how they worship and show their love and gratitude to Jesus for all that He has provided to them- to be in their presence while they are worshiping, is to be in the presence of God.   These people have very few material possessions, but the one thing they have is joy.  Restore Haiti is providing much needed food, housing, medical care, schooling , clothing and the love of Jesus.  This organization is run like a well oiled ship:  the trip was well planned, all travel arrangements were taken care of, all housing and meals were taken care of and the day to day activites were well planned.   This is a life changing experience and if you are considering an organization to sponsor, I can't think of a better one.   I am definitely going back next summer.
Hope Restored	122033		/users/profile/166124	Vance L.	Board Member	5	09/07/2012	Hope Restored (AKA Restore Haiti) provided me an opportunity to serve people living in oppressive poverty and seeing the direct, positive impact on their lives and the community they live in. Restore Haiti is an organization that has passionate and caring individuals providing the utmost level of care and prudent management of the organization. I have served on the board for two years and until I went on a trip, I could not imagin the effect this organization has on the community. I returned from a one week trip to Jacmel, Haiti on September 7, 2012 and have seen and touched the projects they said they would pursue and have successfully completed. I cannot describe with words the experience, the love or kindness that the people of Haiti showed us. This has been a blessing that can only be known by going and serving. Financial support is greatly needed, but if you are able, I emplore you...GO.
Hope Restored	121961	1	/users/profile/166014	Cheryl35	Volunteer	5	09/06/2012	I have been working with this organization since 2011.  In my two trips to the community they serve in Haiti I can see that a difference is being made.  Because of this organization, the number of volunteers from my church who are willing to serve has grown exponentially from 4 in 2011 to 21 in 2012 and we hope to bring 30 in 2013.  The resources donated are hand delivered to the community by the volunteers who travel there, so nothing is lost in administration and red tape.  This is a very transparent group that I plan to support for many years.
Hope Restored	121905	2	/users/profile/165895	Juli C.	Volunteer	5	09/04/2012	This organization truly makes an impact through relationship, integrity, and professionalism.

The education, encouragement, love, and support that HRM offers is genuine and sincere.   I have personally seen how this ministry has gone beyond it's four walls of operation to reach as many young women as possible.  God has truly blessed our community with an organization that really wants to help and not hurt or gain from the lives of others!
Hope Restoration Ministries	57813		/users/profile/61229	pnpc	Board Member	5	11/24/2010	I started with HRM as a volunteer because I believed in Ms. Vaughn's vision for these young ladies and she has never waivered in her desire to assist the young ladies who are basically dumped out of foster care and find themselved homeless with no one to meet any of their needs.  This organization is about meeting needs - physical, emotional, mental and spiritual and Ms. Vaughn strives to help as many ladies as she can, in any way she can, so that they realize there is someone who cares and there is hope for them and their future.

HOPE RESTORATION MINISTRIES is one of these organizations.  Although it's focus is to assist young women, the saying still holds true, "Each one, Reach one."  Indeed, we all benefit from each other's experiences when we share our stories and a helping hand.  Chatiqua Vaughn and her staff are blessed to be able to positively shoulder young women in need of someone to care.  One quote to remember: "Help others get ahead.  You will always stand taller with someone else on your shoulders."

Since I met this awesome outreach worker, I have known her to be a person to reach out to young people, everywhere she goes. She would give her last dime to them and go hungry, just to help them out.

Hope Restoration Ministries	563	7	/users/profile/952	CP	Board Member	5	03/11/2008	I came to know Hope Restoration Ministries by the President/CEO, Chatiqua. She came a few years ago to the local church that I attend. She would reach out to the young people as much as she could, sometimes giving them the last dime in her pocket, so that they could get something to eat. We found out that two young adults got put out of their homes and were out on the streets.One of them had a small child. Chatiqua heard about them, and immediately took them into her own house. I watched how she took care of them, bought them clothes, food etc.Later I found out that she was starting a non-profit just for homeless adolescents, like the ones she had been helping all along. She asked me to be apart of the organization, and I agreed. I am delighted to be apart of an organization that truly cares about serving people.
Hope Restoration Ministries	562	8	/users/profile/950	lezleec	Client Served	5	03/11/2008	Well, where do I start? I came to Hope Restoration Ministries in 2007 all the way from California. When I arrived in Tennessee I had no place to live, no transportation, no money, no job, no licence, and I was not attending school. When I went to Hope Restoration Ministries with these issues I immediately recieved help. Within weeks I was found a place to live. I was appointed a Case Manager and not only did she help me search for jobs, she even took me on interviews. Within 1 day of searching for a job and was offered a position at a sturdy, reliable company. I am still with the same company today. Shortly after finding a place to live and getting a job I was accepted into a major university. Not only did Hope Restoration Ministries help me with these issues I was also taught how to manage my money, how to balance my check book, and began to learn how to drive. Hope Restoration Ministries helped me learn how to drive and I got my licence on the first attempt. Also, I began to save money and bought a car. Hope Restoration Ministries helped me become the woman I am today and is still helping me to be a more responsible, wiser person.
Hope Restoration Ministries	560	8	/users/profile/946	cparker	Donor	5	03/10/2008	What can I say, Hope Restoration Ministries provides all the services needed for young women so that they can have the life that God always intended for them to have.  Many young women are not able to get the help they need because they have no one to help them or they are beyond the age to get assistance from the government; that's where Hope Restoration Ministries comes in.  They offer not only help emotionally and finanically but also spirtually. I urge all young women out there that need help to put your trust in Hope Restoration Ministries, you will truly be blessed!!

Orphanos holds to the highest standards of integrity in its financial and government reporting, as well as in every aspect of their ministry. The percentage of funds which actually go to their charitable programs (as opposed to administrative or fundraising costs) is among the best I've ever seen. Their heart is for children at risk, and they serve them very well in many ways. But they take their financial stewardship very seriously, too, and are very transparent in all of their financial dealings.

Throughout the years they have provided training in standards of excellence for short-term mission trips. We have also used them for Perspective Classes and other mission training. Our church members that have joined on trips have been pleased with the preparation before the trip and the debriefing process afterwards. They sponsor children as well as great orphanages, giving people a number of areas to serve and financially support. The staff is professional with a great degree to be personal and excellent in all they do.
Orphanos	201225	2	/users/profile/262692	Dshort	Volunteer	5	05/29/2014	Orphanos has been, and always be, about the the children that it serves!The purpose is make sure that orphan children get the best care that can be given. The administration of this program is funded by others sources so that the money given to a project, by the donor, will 100% to that project!!! This is remarkable! Orphanos is currently working on strategies that will allow the orphanages to be self -sustaining in the future. They are implementing those strategies to ensure that the children will be able to have a way to take care of themselves and their families once they leave the orphanage. They are very aware that everyone needs to feel the need for dignity by being self-sufficient in order to help others!Orphanos is the best!!!!
Orphanos	201222	2	/users/profile/262689	Elisabethsue	Donor	5	05/29/2014	I sponsor 2 children through Orphanos.  Orphanos does a great job and the staff is all so friendly and helpful.  They keep me up to date on what is happening at the home where my sponsored children live and there are many opportunities to send cards and pictures to them and receive those from my kids as well.  For many years I have sponsored children through various organizations and Orphanos is the Best of All!!
Orphanos	201218	2	/users/profile/262684	Parpeebs	Donor	5	05/29/2014	My wife and I have supported Orphanos for over 5 years and wish all charitable organizations operated like they do as a 100% pass thru.  I was introduced to Orphanos by a board member and have the utmost repect and appreciation for the work that Wayne is doing to further the Kingdom by not only getting kids out of harms way but giving them a hope for their lives.
Orphanos	166441	3	/users/profile/221087	Perry2	Donor	5	08/28/2013	My family has supported Orphanos since its founding and have supported Wayne Sneed even longer.  It is truly an exceptional organization of both the highest character and quality.  100% of all donations are passed through to the supported children and the organization and staff are all about establishing relationships with the children and serving their needs.  We have been a part of four missions trips with Orphanos and have been incredibly blessed by each experience and have established life long relationships with the children there.  If you desire to help God's children and witness God's heart for these children, there is no finer organization than Orphanos.
Orphanos	166358	4	/users/profile/220995	Bill53	Donor	5	08/28/2013	I have great respect for the Orphanos Staff and Leadership team.  They are meticulous in making sure the organizations they assist are excellent in their support of children.  Orphanos passes 100% of my contributions directly to the places they support, so my donations are making the most impact possible in the lives of at risk children around the world.  Orphanos has a diverse list of orphanages/organizations they have investigated so I have flexibility to apply my donations to many opportunity areas.  The Orphanos team ROCKS because God is specifically and precisely using them in a mighty way each and every day to enrich the lives of at risk children on a global scale.
Orphanos	166328	4	/users/profile/220930	Wil T.	Donor	5	08/27/2013	My wife and I have supported this non-profit organization for over a decade. It is the only organization we support that has 100 % Pass- through on donations. It truly impacts the life of children at risk and changes the lives of those who joins them on a trip.  If you want to have an impact on orphanges became a donor of this orginazation.
Orphanos	166292	4	/users/profile/220891	Glen Parham	Donor	5	08/27/2013	Excellent organization.  I have supported this organization since it's inception.  This organization holds itself to the highest levels of integrity.  All donations go 100% to the desired Orphanage requested.  There are fund raisers that help keep the lights on, but all donations to Orphanages go 100% to the organization.  I have gone on a short term mission trip with Orphanos and the training was excellent.  They train you for the culture where you will be serving.  The training also included a Spiritual side that was invaluable when interacting with the children and helped put into perspective your personal objectives for serving.  Would recommend to anyone, supporting or going on a mission trip with Orphanos personnel.
Orphanos	166277	4	/users/profile/220876	mharvey	Volunteer	5	08/27/2013	Awesome organization.   100% pass-thru of donations.  Every dollar goes exactly where you want the donation to go.  I personally work with Orphanos in Colombia, ministering to children at risk in the Amazon area.  Lives are being changed through Orphanos!
Orphanos	166275	3	/users/profile/220872	chadhall	Donor	5	08/27/2013	I personally support Orphanos and one of the orphanages it serves in Leticia, Colombia.  Wayne and the Orphanos team have one goal...to minister to children in distress.  I will continue to be involved with this work for many, many years to come.
Orphanos	166264	4	/users/profile/220859	memphispete007	Board Member	5	08/27/2013	Have personally supported Orphanos for nearly 10 years.  Traveled to the children served at the home in the Amazon jungle.  Served on the Board and seen how many children have been helped.  Focused intently on keeping overhead low so that we make as much go to the kids as we can.  Amazed that our 100% pass thru has always worked - we even pay the wire fee from the operating budget and don't take it from the gift.  Love that people will donate to Keep The Lights On (our overhead initiative).  CPA said we are in the top echelon of charities nationwide on keeping overheads low.  Involved because we really make a big difference.  Ethics and doing things right are huge for us.  Very rewarding to see the kids' smiles and see lives/hearts transformed.  
Orphanos	5061	4	/users/profile/6864	jenniebrooks23	Donor	5	06/10/2009	I have donated money through Orphanos before and really appreciate the fact that 100% of my money goes to the person I am supporting. They don't take anything off for overhead which is nice.
Mountain Faith Mission	259433	1	/users/profile/347959	AnnManginelli	Volunteer	5	09/24/2015	I have traveled to Mountain Faith Mission for several years now, and I am continually humbled and amazed by the work of the mission and Pastor and Mrs. Turner.  God has done wonderful things through them and the willingness of everyone who partners with them.  Their work involves meeting the spiritual and physical need of the Haitians who are a part of the mission and the larger community.  I am involved with the schools of the mission primarily, and I can say that the blessings I have received as a part of my involvement there (with the friendships and bearing witness to God's mercy and love through the Haitians) have far outweighed any cost.  Mountain Faith Missions is a wonderful non-profit to support!
Mountain Faith Mission	259156	1	/users/profile/347674	NaomiSanders	Advisor	5	09/23/2015	I would like to introduce myself first.     I am Naomi Sanders (Carroll).  My father and mother went to Haiti in 1945, along with my brother and I. I was almost 12 years old and my brother, Paul Carroll (deceased) who was 10 years old,  Daddy and Mama worked for a while with a new mission getting started in Haiti, then in the summer of 1947, we moved to Saute-D'eau, Haiti and begun the current Mission, which is Mountain Faith Mission.     I have been the Sec./Tres. of Mountain Faith Misson for many years.  Bro. Ronnie Lee has been my Asst. Sec./Tres. for a number of years, as well. He has been so faithful and worked very hard to advance the cause of God's work in Haiti. He has been to Haiti many times. God has blessed his efforts in a special way.    Mountain Faith Mission has been 'a lighthouse on the hill' just above the town of Saute-D'eau.  Mountain Faith Mission is supported by donations from God's people and their prayers are so needed and so helpful!  If you have any doubts as to if your money will be used for what you want it used for, consider visiting Mountain Faith Mission. By air you go and land at Port-au-Prince, Haiti (the capital city) and from there the people from Mountain Faith Mission will meet you there and take you up into the mountains to The main Mission Station. Mountain Faith Mission also has many outstations.  Our faithful missionaries, Pastor and Mrs. Richard Turner, welcome visitors and all the teams that come in to help out with the Missionary work as well as holding revival services, Vacation Bible school each year etc.  You will NOT be disappointed!! It will change your life to visit Mountain Faith Mission!  God Bless you!   
Mountain Faith Mission	258766	1	/users/profile/347293	Ashley136	Volunteer	5	09/21/2015	MFM is an incredible organization. I went to Haiti a few years ago and stayed at MFM for a week long mission trip. I will forever be changed for the better from my experiences there. The wonderful people, children, and love of God they have are unparalleled. Please support MFM! 
Mountain Faith Mission	258734	1	/users/profile/347261	sharkey	Volunteer	5	09/21/2015	I have worked with Mountain Faith Mission since 2007 and have been on the properties and witnessed the workings of this Mission and of the leaders on the American Board and the Haitian board these folks have one of the most worthy works that I have came across. As a Pastor I had always wanted to support a mission work Spiritually and help with the needs of Children that would likely never have been helped, I would never commit because of the stories I had heard but when we made our first trip in back in 07 I was Privileged to spend a week with a group that the treasurer of the mission was a part of as well as another board member and I had never met these guys, I will tell you that their heart is for the needs of the Haitian people giving themselves to the mission and its work without expectation of any tangible returns. I have since been back 9 times after that first trip, it is no picnic but when you see the children being fed and shoes being handed out or clothing distributed and even at times clinics set up on the compound you would say I am glad to be a part of such a great organization. Harley Sexton
Mountain Faith Mission	258709	1	/users/profile/347234	LaurenApple	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2015	I have had the privilege to visit MFM in the past. Although the country is poor, MFM is rich when it comes to the love, joy and hope that Jesus brings to all involved. MFM is impacting many Haitians by providing education and opportunities to those in need. One of the greatest blessings at MFM is to witness the children's joy through their smiles and songs. In my opinion, MFM is constantly improving the organization to help empower the Haitian's and learn how to spread the love of Jesus. --Lauren Apple
Mountain Faith Mission	258656	1	/users/profile/347173	kyken2001	Board Member	5	09/21/2015	I have been involved with MFM since 1999. I have had the privilege of being  involved with several mission fields and organizations. I have never seen more done with less than through MFM. I serve several positions with the mission and believe there is so much more that can be done with more physical and financial help. The Turners have dedicated their lives to serving the Haitian people and their Savior. It is an honor to serve along side this Christian couple. God is greatly using MFM to meet the needs both physically and spiritually of the Haitian people.
Mountain Faith Mission	258652	1	/users/profile/347165	MarkApple	Volunteer	5	09/21/2015	I have had the privilege to go to Haiti through Mountain Faith Mission two times now! The experience has been life changing experiences both towns! MFM is a great opportunity and the peopl work hard and are very passionate about what they do! I look forward to going back in the future through MFM and experiencing challenged and life changing events to bring me closer to God!         Mark Apple
Mountain Faith Mission	258649	1	/users/profile/347159	BigDaveBo	Volunteer	5	09/21/2015	Over the past 15 years I have had the opportunity to visit Mountain Faith Mission is Haiti.  Very few non-profit organizations do as much with the little resources they have.  They take serious the resources that God has blessed them with and multiply the blessings.  The leadership in the US and Haiti have directed the mission in ways that makes a difference in the lives of the Haitian people.  I highly recommend Mountain Faith Mission.  
Mountain Faith Mission	257544	1	/users/profile/345985	Ron_42	Donor	5	09/15/2015	Mountain Faith Missions is a organization that is dear to us even though we have never visited the site in Haiti.  Our role up to this point has been friends of the mission through monetary donations and prayer.  We have several dear family friends that are very involved in this organization and keep us updated on the projects and needs.  Through them we have met Richard and Wilma Turner, the American missionaries that have lived and worked in Haiti for many years.  Their faithfulness to God's calling is evident in their years of service to the children and families in Haiti.  Churches and schools have been built, medical care has been given, and various projects have helped these people in their every day lives.  Physical needs as well as spiritual needs have been met.  We consider it a blessing to be able to have a part in this endeavor.    Ron and Renee Wilson
Mountain Faith Mission	257536	1	/users/profile/345975	Ryan63	Volunteer	5	09/15/2015	I have been able to travel to Mountain Faith Mission 15 times and am able to work with the Children's Home associated with the ministry. In addition to the home, there are numerous churches, schools, a bakery, medical clinic, and agricultural program. The donations received by Mountain Faith Mission are used in exactly the way they are intended to be. There is no overhead expense, but instead, it is volunteer run in order for 100% of the donations to go to Haiti. This organization is top-notch with a bright future and a rich history (since the 1940's).
Mountain Faith Mission	257300	1	/users/profile/345707	Stephen47	Volunteer	5	09/15/2015	I have visited MFM several times over the past few years. Saut d' Eau has a beautiful waterfall park. My main interest was working and helping with the schools that the mission sponsors. They are very serious about education the people there and want to improve with their educational system. Stephen A. ParksOld Hickory, TN
Mountain Faith Mission	257247	1	/users/profile/345653	Supporter12	Volunteer	5	09/14/2015	I have visited MFM in Saut d'Eau, Haiti multiple times and am amazed at how much is accomplished with so little money, (little is much when God is in it!). There are several churches in the mission, as well as schools, a children's home, medical clinic, bakery and a mill that is currently being installed. They do their best to educate people by developing their skills to support themselves in various trades.  I am a financial contributor to this non-profit and have visited with the Turners personally and have seen first hand, where the money goes, which is to feed and clothe children, as well as to educate adults (young and old) in order to better their lives. My only regret is that I am only one person and unable to give more so that many more could be reached and touched and changed by this organization. 
Mountain Faith Mission	257187	1	/users/profile/345597	Writer	Donor	5	09/14/2015	I have visited Mountain Faith Mission in Haiti and was very impressed by how things are run! All donations go directly to the missionno monies go for "overhead expenses". The different programs I saw while in Haiti were filled with many Haitians who go to great lengths to be a part of whatever MFM has organized to help the people spiritually and physically and also in ways to promote careers for various Haitians.
Mountain Faith Mission	257179	1	/users/profile/345590	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/14/2015	As a mission pastor I have the opportunity to visit many places and the time I have spent with Mountain Faith Mission has been a blessing. Taking fellow believers to this location is one of the best mission trips of the year. The missionaries, the pastors, and the other Haitian believers are hard working and serious about their calling. 
Mountain Faith Mission	247257	1	/users/profile/334764	lois3245	Volunteer	5	07/02/2015	I visited Mountain Faith Mission a few years back as a volunteer for Vacation Bible School event at their central campus in Saut de Eau.  I was amazed at the attendance of Haitian families; some who had walked several days from the mountains to attend.  It was a wonderful personal experience to see the way Mountain Faith Mission is having such a positive influence on the Haitian people.  They not only offer them the opportunity to become Christians but provide ongoing traditional education to children plus teaching trades and agricultural experience to the adults so they can become self sufficient.  My husband and I have been supporters of this wonderful nonprofit organization for over fifteen years.  I invite you to seek out their website mountainfaithmission.com to learn more about them.
Mountain Faith Mission	157302	2	/users/profile/208589	Ronnie Lee	Volunteer	4	05/07/2013	Mountain Faith Mission is a small independent nonprofit operating in Haiti.  The ministry of MFM is multifaceted despite it's small size.  The mission has 17 churches, 6 schools,  children's home,  medical clinic, bakery, and an agricultural program.  The mission is headquartered in Saut d Eau, Haiti within the Central Plateau. I have been traveling to Haiti and MFM since 1999 and have found the ministry of Mountain Faith Mission to be a great help to the people within the Saut d Eau area.  The American missionaries, Richard and Wilma Turner have been living in Haiti for 20 years and are well loved by the people in the community.
SMiles	245186	3	/users/profile/332301	holly1t	Volunteer	5	06/12/2015	I volunteer for SMiles and absolutely love it!!!  The clients that use SMiles are so thankful for this service.  It's a need that most of us take for granted.   You only have to do 1 ride per month (but could do as many more as you want) and you pick the ride (rides) you want to do.  Most of the rides are very short and the mileage and times are listed for each one.  Helping others is always a win!
SMiles	244994	2	/users/profile/332069	SuMar	Volunteer	5	06/10/2015	What a gift and great service the SMiles program is for Blount County! It meets the need to maintain independence for so many who are no longer able to drive, and provides an extraordinary opportunity for the drivers to get to know truly amazing seniors in our own neighborhoods.The added bonus for volunteer drivers is that it is so easy to volunteer!!! It's all done online, so comparing one's personal schedule with available rides is a snap. I can't recommend volunteering as a SMiles driver highly enough. You won't be sorry you did. 
SMiles	244946	2	/users/profile/332009	ebestjr	Volunteer	5	06/10/2015	I believe in sharing talents. SMILES keeps growing. It provides more opportunities to serve. It also provides an action plan for SMILES drivers days & weeks in advance. So filling needs of clients & drivers is a good thing. Great program for all!
SMiles	244927	2	/users/profile/331984	jhoy	Volunteer	5	06/09/2015	It is a wonderful feeling to know you are making a person's day a little brighter.  I have been with SMiles since the beginning in 2013 and have met many folks who are very close to my age and they appreciate talking about the OLD days!  And sometimes being asked to do an odd little job for them which turns out to be a bigger help in their eyes than you would ever expect! All are very appreciative and it means we must keep going with this great program.
SMiles	244916	3	/users/profile/331971	plzrecycle	Volunteer	5	06/09/2015	This is an extremely well coordinated and run program with effective service to a great group of riders who share their knowledge of Blount County's back roads, eating establishments and events. As somebody "new" to East TN, this has been a great learning and giving opportunity. 
SMiles	244886	3	/users/profile/331927	FrannieH	Volunteer	5	06/09/2015	Smiles is a wonderful opportunity to give back to the Blount County community.  I enjoy meeting all of the seniors and learning more about their lives, and the flexibility that I have as a volunteer is unmatched.  I can schedule rides around my work schedule, something that I have not been able to do with other volunteering opportunities.  Please consider this very worthwhile organization!
SMiles	244850	3	/users/profile/331879	mcculloughk1	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	I want my life to count for something before I pass on.  I want to leave the world a better place because of the life I gave to it.  As a Smiles volunteer driver, I have many opportunities to render service to those who need essential transportation for all of life's necessities, including medical appointments and weekly medical procedures or even grocery shopping.  Many of these individuals are isolated and have little contact with either friends or neighbors.  Many have long histories of major accomplishments in professional and civic careers.  Many were world travelers.  I enjoy swapping stores with them.  I enjoy their company.  When I leave them, I know I have done a good thing for one more day.  There is no better reward!
SMiles	244844	2	/users/profile/331867	BeckyHsis7terS	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	I have been a volunteer since October 2013, And feel very blessed to have found this program. I enjoy my riders so much. I love hearing their stories about their lives and telling my storie.  Every rider is so appreciative and grateful for the Volunteers and never fail to say so. I feel I've made some very special friends thru this program. Thank you Amy and Joni for all you do to make this program a success.
SMiles	244842	3	/users/profile/331866	COOPERs	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	I have been with Smiles since it started up. The program has grown steadily and we have quite a roster of riders now. I hear lots of positive comments from the riders, and no complaints. They really appreciate the service, I hear that constantly.These folks are like aunts and uncles that I don't happen to be related to.  I can be a lot of help to them without inconveniencing myself.  Just furnishing them a reliable ride takes a big worry out of their life. Helping with their groceries or sitting with them in a doctor's waiting room is not a big thing to me, but it can be to them. There's a nice feeling that comes to me from volunteering my time. 
SMiles	244841	3	/users/profile/331865	toobusyvol	Board Member	5	06/08/2015	SMiles is such a godsend to our senior community.  Not only is it growing by leaps and bounds, but the program always seems to bring a Smile to the faces of both the driver and the passenger.  As a driver since the program began, I have met some of the nicest people - some who have lived here his or her whole life, but lots of newcomers to our community.  The backgrounds are fascinating, and I always look forward to meeting another new friend through SMiles!
SMiles	244832	2	/users/profile/331849	driverdon	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	Some things I appreciate about being a SMiles volunteer: 1.) We were carefully screened and qualified before being allowed to carry anyone. 2.) We can carry or not carry anyone. 3.) We can take as many or as few trips as we want. 4.) Every rider knows the value of this service and is extremely appreciative. 5.) As you get to know the riders you hear a lot of fascinating stories. 6.) It's a great feeling to be able to be part of a service that has been desparately needed in Blount County. 7.) The administrator, Amy, is a fantastic resource for the program.  Her ability to communicate, to encourage, to plead when necessary and to be a steadying influence for this program while under a fair amount of pressure to get everyone taken care of is truly exemplary. SMiles Rocks!!!
SMiles	244810	2	/users/profile/331827	mimiwax	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	Hi, I am a SMILES volunteer driver, being one of the originals when the program began here in Maryville, TN Oct. 2013.  I truly enjoy picking up & talking to ALL of the riders I help.  It is such a blessing to be able to assist our seniors here driving them to their doctor appointments, as well as taking them to the grocery store or beauty shop.  They are VERY grateful for everything we do for them.  
SMiles	244808	2	/users/profile/331825	garlandd2	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	I completed the training about 3 months ago and have tried to do one trip a week since.  So far I have had nothing but good experiences.  In fact, I think the rides have often been more beneficial to me then to the ones riding.   I have not had one rider who did not appear to be very appreciative and often I have learned much from  the knowledge they have shared with me from their life experiences.
SMiles	244803	2	/users/profile/331819	Brenda80	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	Volunteering for SMiles is easy and very rewarding!  I have a full time position running a company and I travel for business but with SMiles I was able to volunteer on my lunch hour.  This is the one non-profit agency that you can arrange around 'your' schedule.   Just check the rides that are available and then select the ride that best suits your schedule.  Again, it is easy and very rewarding....and we need more volunteers!  
SMiles	244802	2	/users/profile/331818	Flo S.	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	I volunteer for SMiles and love it.  You meet the nicest people and they are so grateful to have a ride to doctor appts and grocery stores, etc.  You are able to pick the rides that you can do weekly and if something comes up and you can't do it, the SMiles people are very helpful in filling the ride.  It helps your own self-esteem knowing you are helping others too.
Focus on Cumberland County Animal Shelter	315228	2	/users/profile/406555	EthelMertz	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2016	This group will succeed where others have failed. Why? The members are young,locals, and are dedicated to their cause. They are not "outsiders" trying to tell the locals how things are done in other places I.e., up north. It is a grassroots movement with passion in their hearts. They truly care about the shelter, both animals and staff, wanting what is best for them. FOCCAS will be around a very long time

I have never seen a group that had their act together like we do. I have only been with them a short period of time but already see the dedication that goes on...FOCCAS is truly an amazing group we will soon be launching our JR FOCCAS program, it will include children under 18. We will educate on animals, care, spay and neuter info and much mucheaper more. We are very excited to soon launch our capital campaign to raise money to build a new shelter. If you can donate please please do. It all adds up, and our county/city needs this so bad.

Change is on the horizon. A model for other communities in bringing about change when it comes to pets!
Focus on Cumberland County Animal Shelter	301845	5	/users/profile/392902	Jennifer572	Board Member	5	08/29/2016	This group started with a few people and within a year has developed a 900+ following on facebook, a professional website, a newsletter and great relationships with local rescue groups. Many have failed where this group has succeeded. I see great things in their future.
Focus on Cumberland County Animal Shelter	301842	5	/users/profile/392898	Ricky K.	Donor	5	08/29/2016	This a wonderful  non-profit that defines what a rescue group is,  and does.

From organizing fundraisers and volunteering and doing whatever they can to help meet the needs of our local animal shelter, no task is too small or to daunting for this group of motivated individuals.  I am very impressed with what they have accomplished in one short year. There is no telling what goals FOCCAS can achieve.  This group deserves our support!

From inking donations of food and supplies to emergency medical funds that have saved the lives of numerous sweet creatures that would have otherwise suffered or been euthanized. They are transparent about the organization and funds. You defiantly know how your donations are used. Great job foccas.....thank you for making a difference.

McKamey Animal Center	160324	2	/users/profile/212598	jdww	Client Served	1	06/11/2013	I lost my american bull dog on 6-10-2012. I looked for her everywhere. I looked on Craig's list and found her at Mckamey shelter on access road in chattanooga ,Tn. I went to get her and was told it was going to cost me $ 90.00 to get her. That was ridiculous. She isn't a stray. She has an owner. They are promoting adopt a pet but all I wanted was my pet back. Some people don't have the money to pay to get their pets back so I guess that means they keep your pet and SALE it to someone else. I guess they are going to get their money one way or the other. I wouldn't recommend adopting a pet from there at all. The fees you have to pay are over board and you could be adopting someone else's pet who just couldn't afford to pay to get it back. How do you think that would make the person who couldn't get their pet back feel? I'm sure they don't care as long as the money keeps rolling in.
McKamey Animal Center	104349		/users/profile/139919	kpaul	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	I have volunteered at McKamey for 3 years walking dogs, greeting clients, helping with off-site adoptions, etc., and I have seen first hand what a loving and caring organization it really is. The animals are extremely well taken care of. The facility is clean and well maintained. Every effort is made to find forever homes for the lucky animals that are there.
McKamey Animal Center	104276	1	/users/profile/139797	DDeweese	Board Member	5	01/24/2012	The McKamey Animal Center is a prime example of what an animal shelter should be for the entire community. They offer the whole package: adoptions, education, spaying/neutering, cruelty invesitgation, field services, partnerships, and more. I helped open the Center in 2008 and was there for their first adoption. It's always been about the animals...bottom line. The staff works out of passion for the thousands of dogs and cats who enter the open admissions facility. They do the work that most people wouldn't want to do. They are unsung heroes. I will plan to adopt my next dog from the Center!
McKamey Animal Center	104269		/users/profile/139789	Break The Chain	Board Member	5	01/24/2012	My first exposure to the care, compassion and expertise of McKamey was in 2011 when a young black cocker spaniel (later named Maddie) was rescued and delivered to McKamey.  Maddie's fur was matted in filth, feces and other unsanitary debris. The length of her fur prevented her from seeing or walking without any interference.  Maddie arrived at McKamey around 5:30 in the evening.  McKamey officials and volunteers treated Maddie for approximately 5 uninterrupted hours, removing over 3 laundry baskets of hair.  No complaints were ever uttered or whispered throughout the entire procedure.  McKamey offers a perfect haven for abused and neglected animals and it does so with superior care, compassion, knowledge and determination.  
McKamey Animal Center	104267		/users/profile/139788	AMGC	Donor	5	01/24/2012	I have supported McKamey Animal Center for more than six years. It is by far one of the most compassionate and caring facilities anywhere.  They have one focus - the welfare of the animals.  The Center has earned and deserves the respect of their peers, the animal community  and has received numerous awards and recognitions.  The City of Chattanooga is fortunate to have this fine organization as an advocate for the animals in our community.  
McKamey Animal Center	104193	1	/users/profile/139700	jw9241	Volunteer	5	01/23/2012	     McKamey Animal Center has  dedicated staff that demonstrate a love for the animals they serve, and people who visit express amazement at both the facility and the condition in which it is maintained. I especially love to see the happiness shared by visitors and the animals receiving attention. It is a place where volunteers can experience the love of the animals and find joy in seeing them find forever homes. It is the most rewarding volunteer experience I've ever had.                        John Williams
McKamey Animal Center	104137	1	/users/profile/139610	Jenmajic	Client Served	5	01/22/2012	 After meeting the members of the McKamey staff at an adoption event, I knew it was time to bring a dog into our family.   In September, we adopted the most amazing dog that I have ever had the pleasure to know.   We first met her online, and she immediately won our hearts.  Kimmie was brought into McKamey as a stray puppy with her brother when they were only about 8 weeks old.  Her brother was almost immediately adopted, but she was not so lucky.  She had a serious infection in one of her eyes, and in spite of the heroic efforts of the McKamey staff the eye could not be saved.  So she underwent surgery and the eye was removed.  Now she had 2 strikes against her, she was a black dog and she had a disability.  She spent the next 5 months alone in the shelter, and she never let any of this dampen her bright spirit.  She won the staffs' hearts, and was a shelter favorite.  They never gave up hope that she would find a forever home.  The staff and Kimmie never gave up hope, and she now has a loving family to call her own.
McKamey Animal Center	104109	2	/users/profile/139541	Cheri5	Client Served	5	01/22/2012	I have adopted 4 bundles of love from McKamey.  Keats is an energetic kid who always needs to be chased and petted.  I get rewarded with the loudest PURR and drool you have ever seen.  Brock is our diplomat.  He isn't scared of any situation, and is usually the first to venture to the farthest part of our enclosed yard, with a train of everyone else behind him.  Romo is our snuggle cat.  IF we are on the couch, in bed, or even sitting at the dinner table... he will be there to offer his body heat.  Lucy is our special, not at all disabled, blind cat.  She rules the roost, and has the run of the house.  Everyone avoids getting in her way.  I can not thank McKamey enough for the amount of love they have brought to my home.  Especially being neutered/spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all medications.  I love this!  This is the best!
McKamey Animal Center	104083	1	/users/profile/139500	khulley77	Client Served	5	01/21/2012	I adoped my dog at McKamey in 2009. She has been a blessing for me. What little we know about her previous life isn't pleasant, but she is one of the best dogs most people have met. She has become a pet therapy dog and visits area hospitals to allow the patients an opportunity to love her. We go to McKamey every Christmas to have her picture taken with "Santa Claws" and my family and friends always receive the picture on a Christmas card. I think what this organization does for local homeless pets is amazing. They have definately given me one of the best gifts ever.

He was brought there as a baby and lived the first six months of his life in the facility.  I was so impressed with how professional the staff was and how beautiful and clean the McKamey Center is.  Suds was such a character and very used to being loved for the first part of his life in McKamey. I knew he must have had first rate care to be the kind of cat he was when I brought him home.  He is such a loving and happy cat, and I'll always be grateful  to McKamey for keeping him until he found a happy home.  
McKamey Animal Center	104072		/users/profile/139484	AnnBall	Volunteer	5	01/21/2012	I've been involved with a lot of non-profits over the years but McKamey is far and away my most satisfying opportunity to make a difference. Chattanooga's stray animal problem was an embarrassment to the city until local leaders announced a new shelter would be built. With state-of-the-art equipment and an exceptional caring staff, they are making inroads in our problem, gaining national recognition and showing the world we do care about helpless animals who are without a forever family through no fault of their own. I'm proud to tell people I'm a volunteer for McKamey.
McKamey Animal Center	104070		/users/profile/139482	Arthur Eugene	Board Member	5	01/21/2012	 I have served on the board of a number of non-profit organizations in our community and, I can say, without hesitation, that the McKamey Center uses what resources they have more compassionately, wisely and cost-effectively than many other agencies with much larger budgets and staffs.  The Center has made a huge difference in our community in directing community attention toward the responsibility to spayor neuter,  to advocate for the animals, to educate themselves to be more responsible pet owners, and to comply with our city's animal ordinances.

We love how great our adoption experience was and the impact they're making on the animal friendliness of our community that we attended a McKamey fundraising event at a local minor league baseball team. There they had a foster dog to raise awareness that we fell in love with and he's now our newest child. Can't find nicer people, better facilities, or greater animals than those loved by McKamey. Thanks for all you do!

I was nervous that if I adopted a pet it might be sick or have a behavioral issue. The staff at the mcKamey Cneter changed all that for me. I learned how much goes into preparing a pet for adoption and all the care that the McKamey team use to be sure that they adopt great healthy animals. My new dog is great. He is the healthiest happiest little guy. Now that I have him I will always adopt. I know there are no guarantees with ant pet and you love them all their lives through thick and thin but it is nice the lengths they go to to try to be sure every pets getsoff to a good start!

Tennessee Kidney Foundation Inc	185444		/users/profile/242414	laurea	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2013	A life lesson we all must learn is that no matter how dedicated we are to our work and family, no matter how we plan for future; life's twist and turns have a way of dishing up the unexpected.  As a social worker in a dialysis clinic, I see on a daily bases how End Stage Renal Disease effects not only our health but  also can bring  a potential for financial hardship.  We forget how additional medication and doctor visit copays can mount up.  You figure in the additional transportation cost of 13 trips per month.   The budget becomes stretched, sometime to the breaking point.  Lifestyle adjustments must be made to make ends meet.  I love watching some of the stress on a patient's face melt away when they are told they were approved for a TKF grant.   TKF grants are not about giving money away - TKF is about preserving one's dignity.

TKF is a wonderful non profit agency, and helps many of the patients tht I serve.  Our patients, alot not working, and TKF helps them with help with their bills, mostly with electrric bills.  I am from Philadelphia, and it is against the law to turn off the electric in the dead of winter, TN is not like that, so many of our patients would be in the cold if it was not for TKF,  Also, some of our patients could not afford supplements, and the help them with that.  TKF is used  for so many patients, for so many reasons that they might otherwise not be able to afford...thanks TKF for caring about individuals that you don't even know, or come in contact with, but care enough to fill the need. 
Tennessee Kidney Foundation Inc	185379		/users/profile/242340	JulieLarson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2013	The Tennessee Kidney Foundation is one of the most important resources that a dialysis patient can turn to for help.  They provide much needed emergency assistance for things like electric or gas bills in the winter/ summer, transportation assistance to help pay for a ride to dialysis and assistance purchasing supplements to help improve their protein among other things.  The availability of funds to help provide this assistance for the patients are essential.  Without the Tennessee Kidney Foundation, many patients would have difficulty providing for these basic needs. The staff, headed by long time advocate, Teresa Davidson, is outstanding and have always strived to do everything possible to provide education and assistance for kidney patients!!

We also adopted a cat from BCHS earlier this year - she is a wonderful pet.  Working with BCHS has been a wonderful and rewarding experience for us.  The staff are very caring people, they work hard and they take excellent care of the animals.  They work hard to find suitable homes for cats and dogs.  Before they would allow us to adopt our cat, they made a visit to our home and thoroughly inspected it to be sure it was appropriate for our new pet.  They called references including our veterinarian.  The organization has very good leadership.

I was looking at the time I found BCHS a way to give back to the community that I live in.  I am so glad to have found BCHS and being No Kill really peeked my interest because I love all animals.  I have seen many changes over the years and know there are many changes to come in the rescue world.  BCHS group works so hard to save animals they have started new programs to teach our community and other communities about NO KILL.  We have started a transport program, fostering program, trap neuter return program for ferral cats, and the biggest acomplishment is the hard work our Maryville Shelter team has put in to pull all  animals from the shelter for fostering until they are adopted .  You can find our harding working volunteers team at events almost every weekend showing off our adoptable animals.  We have a Cat team / Dog team that is so dedicated I am  proud to be a part of this organization.
Blount County Humane Society	176230		/users/profile/232626	3stax	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	I began volunteering with the Blount County Humane Society approximately one year ago and am very impressed with and inspired by the whole organization.  The team members get off work from their full-time jobs every evening and go straight back to work for the animals, sometimes until after midnight, forgoing social lives and family time. They believe every life matters and is worth saving. The team can also be found cleaning, transporting, and working adoption events every weekend, and they do it with a smile on their face. Being No Kill is not always be the easiest option, but the Blount County Humane Society is proof that it can be done! I am always more than happy to donate my time or resources because I know how much it is appreciated and I can see with my own eyes how much a difference it makes.  So proud to be just a small part of improving our community. No Kill Revolution!

Blount County Humane Society	176017		/users/profile/232408	current board member	Board Member	5	10/09/2013	I currently serve on the board for the Blount County Humane Society.  There has never been a more dedicated group in our community.  They are the only group in our region that has single-handedly turned a HIGH KILL shelter (Maryville City Animal Shelter) into what is now the shelter with the HIGHEST SAVE RATE in our entire STATE.  One of the highest save rates in the nation.  This is a huge accomplishment.  As a group, they saw the need for change, educated themselves on how to make the needed changes, started working and haven't stopped.  Instead of talking, they have been DOING!  They have been succesfully managing the entire intake for this shelter for over two years, losing only the animals that cannot be safely rehabilitated due to severe aggression or animals involved in legal situations that the court has deemed unreleaseable.  That number for the last few years is a very few, around 10 animals total.  They do not discriminate the animals, but save every breed, every age, every behavioral and medical need.  Every other animal is networked by the Blount County Humane Society into adoptive or foster homes.   They even created a program to spare the lives of the feral cats taken in to the city shelter.  While managing the shelter program, the Blount County Humane Society also helps by taking in others abandoned at vet offices, surrendered by their families directly and animals they take in from their own animal cruelty investigations.  They also assist other surrounding shelters by pulling when they are able to take in additional animals and by providing transport for those that are eligible in surrounding counties with much higher kill rates.  They do not rely on transport for the animals in either their system or those at the Maryville City Shelter.  Transport is reserved as a way to help other shelters that are in need.  They are entirely volunteer, donation only, receiving no government funding for the enormous amount of veterinary care that they provide for our community's animals each month.  They provide sanctuary and rehabilitation for those animals in need.  They are very resourceful, and make a little go a very long way.  They have truly changed this community, and we should all be very grateful to them for their ongoing contributions.  No other group has ever matched the save rates that this group has achieved, and it is clear that the Blount County Humane Society is here to stay!  I will forever support their efforts, and I can't wait to see what the future will hold!  They are proof that No Kill works, and is already working in our community!
Blount County Humane Society	176008		/users/profile/232398	Cindy98	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	I'm a volunteer with the Blount County Humane Society and the way that I found out about them was after going to the Maryville Shelter where a Pit that had been in a fight was not doing very well.  I was given the number of one of the girls who checks everyday on the animals at the shelter and I voiced my concern about him.  She told me that they planned on taking him to the vet that evening.  At that time she invited me to attend a Thursday meeting, which I did the next week.  I've been a volunteer with them since that day!  The pit that I was concerned about is doing great now thanks to the help he received.  If he had been in any other shelter in our area he would of probably been put down because of his injuries.I have only seen good things happen since I've been associated with the BCHS.  All of the animals that are pulled out from the Maryville shelter go into foster until they are adopted.We have adoption events almost every weekend where the foster parents bring out their cats or dogs so that the public can see them.  We also have a website and are on Facebook where we share our animals every day which are looking for their FOREVER HOME ~

It is this exact perserverance that has resulted in an increased save rate at the municipal shelter, quality care for both the animals onsite and in foster care, and an introduction of new programs to continue to help those who cannot help themselves...the animals.  
Blount County Humane Society	175219		/users/profile/231553	jh3305	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	I began volunteering with BCHS in July of 2013.  BCHS is a volunteer driven organization that trying to create a No-Kill Community in Blount County.  The Shelter Pet Program that is their partnership with the City of Maryville's Animal Shelter that serves Maryville, Alcoa, and Rockford has achieved a 99.8% save rate.  Prior to this program, the save rate was as often as low as 20% with many healthy adoptable animals being euthanized. They provide all of the veterninary care that animals entering the Maryville Shelter receive and provide vet care and meds for all of the animals in their care.  BCHS is completely dependent on the communty for support......and they have a dedicated team of volunteers helping the animals every day because Every Life Matters!   In response to previous reviews, all of the financials are available under the category "legal"  on the website www.blountcountyhumanesociety.org.  There are no money "secrets".  Their largest expense is vet care and boarding for injured or sick animals.   These are good people doing good things for animals......
Blount County Humane Society	93381	4	/users/profile/107372	Retired DAL	General Member of the Public	1	07/04/2011	I came to a couple meetings of the Humane Society at their store last Summer.   The leader was real obsessed with talking bad about the mayor, shelter, and other rescue people.  Then he started telling us who to go and vote for because the mayor didn't like them.  He wanted us to vote him out.  He also talked bad about Obama.  I thought non-profit organizations were not allowed to endorse political candidates?  I think this group has a lot of problems, mainly the head guy.  I can't remember his name.  He was also very rude, taking phone calls and caused the meeting to be late- even taking calls in the middle of the meeting! How unprofessional!  The meeting seemed real disorganized and unfocused.  I came a couple times just to make sure - but I decided I didn't want to be a part.  Later on, I found out that the leader is a very shady character.  I've been told that he doesn't take proper care of his own animals!  But that is just hearsay, but I have to say I wouldn't be surprise if it were true.  I don't think this group is worthy of a donation either, according to another post, they aren't telling the truth about how they spend their money.   Also, a friend of mine found a dog and needed help, and they called and got a man (probably the same guy) and he was very rude to them.  He shouted at them and hung up - how is this helping animals?  I am from New York and ppl up there seem to be nicer than they are here - the animal people I mean!  Thanks for letting me give my opinion - 1 star for sure!-- Sincerely,  Retired DAL  (Retired Democrat Animal Lover)
Blount County Humane Society	93346	5	/users/profile/107306	Former Volunteer	Volunteer	1	07/03/2011	I am a former volunteer with the Blount County Humane Society and was very involved with the organization during the time period of this 2009 form.  I find it very curious that they say they spent $8,000 on their "Dogs Deserve Shelter" program.  While this is a wonderful progam to help animals,  I know for a fact that all of the dog houses and kennels that were given away in this program were DONATED to the BCHS.   Perhaps they had to purchase a few, but in no way did they spend $8,000.00.  This form has been falsified.  Mr Phipps, the BCHS president, spends the organization's money however he sees fit. While the money is definitely used for some good, it is questionable about where all the money goes since Mr Phipps absolutely refuses to turn in detailed receipts.  I know first hand that he does not believe in being accountable to anyone.  I doubt the validity of this entire form because Mr Phipps is not to be trusted.
Blount County Humane Society	71924		/users/profile/78643	Volunteer	Volunteer	5	02/20/2011	I'm a volunteer at this humane society.  I have seen first hand that the money does go toward the animals.  There has been a management shift in the past year, and the financials were left in a bit of a mess.  There is a bookkeeper going through everything, and financial information will be made available online this year, including tax forms.  The group has many community programs and does lots of wonderful things to help the animals and people in Blount County.  I will continue to volunteer my time and money.  
Blount County Humane Society	64080		/users/profile/70049	ahug2000	Volunteer	5	02/06/2011	I personally volunteer for this organization now, and have for some time.  The organization does a fantastic job at rescuing at risk animals, fostering and adopting them out.  They also have several community assistance programs like a pet food pantry and animal cruelty investigation team.  The volunteers, members and president are hard-working and dedicated.  The Blount County Humane Society is growing, and doing everything they can to move Blount County toward a no-kill future.  I have seen everything I need to see to know that donations go towards the animals, are making a difference, and I will continue to support this group with my time, energy and money.
Blount County Humane Society	60192	5	/users/profile/65360	EyesOpen	Donor	2	01/16/2011	This organization does contribute to the welfare of animals. The organization holds weekly adoption events for animals it cares for in it's foster network. The organization transports animals out of the area for adoption in needed areas.  The organization runs a thrift store to help support these initiatives, along with events and donation jars around the area.   However, with all that being said, I no longer support this organization.  After my donation, I found that this organization does not have a functioning board of directors.  One person, the founder, was authorized to spend money out of the accounts, no annual reports were available, and policies were not written to follow for assisting the public in animal issues.   There was also an atmosphere of religious overtones when moral decisions were made. Nothing wrong with that, but that is not advertised in the organizations mandates. If your convictions are such, you will likely not mind.   In closing, I think the volunteers  are the heart and soul of this organization. Without their dedication and commitment, there would  be an empty space needing filled.  Each and every one is there for the benefit and welfare of animals, just as I was.       
W.O. Smith Community Music School	215679		/users/profile/279116	Ann_95,	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	I taught saxophone and worked the summer camps at the school for 5 years. This is one of the most special places in Nashville. Not only does it serve a great purpose, but more importantly many students see this place as home. I was strongly impacted by the staff, fellow volunteers, and especially the students in my 5 years of working there. I miss it whenever Monday night rolls around and I'm not driving down Wedgewood to see my students. Everyone in Nashville should know this school exists and find a way to get involved and support what they do. 
W.O. Smith Community Music School	215243		/users/profile/278632	JLPercussion	Board Member	5	09/16/2014	My first experience with this amazing school was as a volunteer teacher almost 10 years ago.  I had the opportunity to teach percussion lessons to a high school senior to help prepare her for her college drumline audition.  Great news...she made the drumline!  Over the past 4 years, I have had the pleasure of serving on the school's Advisory Council and now Board of Directors!  This school is amazing and continues to touch the lives of hundreds of students every day!  This is by far, the most amazing music school of it's kind!  I love the W.O.Smith Music School!
W.O. Smith Community Music School	187584		/users/profile/244607	Jordan24	Client Served	5	11/02/2013	I was taught piano, trumpet and drums at W.O. Smith as a child. I absolutely loved everything about this place. As a kid I didn't quite get the blood, sweat and tears that went on behind the scenes here, but wow - I do now. I still have my old W.O. Smith Summer Camp t-shirt! Great memories and I'll never forget it. My experience at W.O. Smith was life changing. I've moved away from Nashville, but I've had college friends move there and I've recommended they volunteer there. I had 5-star treatment at W.O. Smith.
W.O. Smith Community Music School	178712		/users/profile/235340	Lance A.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I taught guitar at the music school for several years and seen some wonderful talent there. It's a great organization and very organized. I've gotten great referrals for my own business as a result of being a volunteer. They are well connected in the community and serve a great purpose of teaching kids music in a safe and positively influential environment. 
W.O. Smith Community Music School	89345		/users/profile/28470	chrisreynolds	Volunteer	5	06/01/2011	I taught guitar here a while back & I have helped them out with computers a few times since. I also created a birdhouse for their annual fundraiser. These folks are AWESOME! I can't say enough about this program. The work they are doing changes the lives of these kids. Music heals the soul & some of these kids can use some healing. I personally saw how music brought joy to my students. Sometimes they would come in and their spirits were very down. After a few minutes of playing some music....the smiles start. This is a bright moment in their day. If there is only one non-profit you give support to, make WO Smith the one.
W.O. Smith Community Music School	27397	1	/users/profile/28470	chrisreynolds	Former staff	5	02/09/2010	W.O. Smith school opened my eyes to the power of giving and reaffirmed my opinion on the power of music. I was a volunteer teacher for a year and I saw 1st hand how much this school does for for the kids. It was awesome to see the gleem in my students eyes when they "got it". When they were able to play the part they thought was too hard or learn their favorite song. I had students who really didn't have much and were having trouble at home, and their lessons were a tiny escape from all of that.When I think of Jonah, Lynn & the staff, I smile. They are doing GREAT work.
W.O. Smith Community Music School	27797	1	/users/profile/28878	kevine	Volunteer	5	02/10/2010	This is an organization where mission, management and participation of board, employees and patrons all come together. The school, with only three full time employees, manages approximately 200 volunteers to serve 400 students. In addition to just teaching music to underserved children, the school is now reaching out to help these children apply for college, teach the volunteer teachers and provide music events for the community. The only problem is that even more students want to learn at W.O. Smith Music School.
W.O. Smith Community Music School	27689	6	/users/profile/28774	suz1	General Member of the Public	5	02/10/2010	As the daughter of two musicians, I know how important music education can be in the life of a child.  The years I spent studying piano have been a benefit to me in ways I never could have imagined.  Every child deserves the opportunity to have the well-rounded education that music can provide, and the work that the W.O.Smith school does provides virtually unlimited opportunities for the students who participate.  I have interviewed a number of the students and have seen how their pride in accomplishment has given them a new confidence.  From the recital hall to the White House, W.O. Smith students are going places!
W.O. Smith Community Music School	27423	6	/users/profile/28508	musycgnp	Volunteer	5	02/09/2010	I have served as a volunteer teacher since it's doors opened. It is a marvelous place to participate in and observe a child's growth in the scholarship and artistry of music. When I was a full time teacher and sometimes questioned if music in my classroom was having any effect, my weekly after-school WOS sessions reaffirmed the power music has as a discipline & inspiration for children & youth. Many hours given by so many musicians in such a nurturing atmosphere has impacted generations across Nashville communities. It is a model for any city seeking to access community/professional music resources for its underserved clientele (school aged children & youth).
W.O. Smith Community Music School	27386	6	/users/profile/28452	cwevans	Board Member	5	02/09/2010	WO Smith Music School is a dynamic organization that fills a great need in Nashville.  Studies have shown that children who participate in arts and music programs have better self-discipline and greater self-confidence, and unfortunately, public school systems across the country are cutting arts and music programs due to lack of funding.  WO Smith Music School helps to close that gap by offering an array of music lessons to children for next to nothing. Thanks to WO Smith Music School and the more than 200 volunteer teachers, children are learning to play a musical instrument, are learning music theory, are singing in a choir and are gaining exposure to the world of music.  Without WO Smith Music School, hundreds of children would not have the opportunity to participate in such a program.
W.O. Smith Community Music School	27382	1	/users/profile/28449	justin1	Board Member	5	02/09/2010	I am a current advisory council member and a former private lesson instructor.  My experience teaching at WO Smith was amazing.  To be able to share the gift of music with another person is a blessing and one that I am thankful to have.  The school always made my job as a teacher enjoyable as the administration of the program crossed every T and dotted every I.I can not think of a non-profit organization in Nashville that speaks to this being "music city".  I encourage everyone who reads this to visit the website www.wosmith.org and find a way to be involved.  The gift of music is a powerful thing!!

Smith for five years.  WO staff does an incredible job on a very small budget.  We impact the lives of so many kids.  If they stay in the program they all graduate from high school.  Many go on to college.  Music helps kids learn math and that they can succeed with discipline and hard work.

Smith School for 16 years in one capacity or another, starting as a volunteer and rotating from the council to the board and back numerous times. I have watched the school grow and fund a beautiful new school, record an album with Jimmy Buffett, receive a Pensky truck load of free musical equipment (including pianos) from the Today Show's Al Roker and perform at the White House for the Obamas. This is the most effective and efficiently run organization with which I have ever been involved. It has given many children an opportunity to learn and grow and feel good about themselves and their accomplishments.

With a full time staff of 3 it oversees a vast army of over 150 volunteer teachers that reach over 500 children of low income families with the opportunity to learn a musical; instrument. The impact that this has made in the lives of so many is both overwhelming and gratifying.

My oldest daughter struggled with motor skills, balance and coordination. She had very low self esteem.  She couldn't even ride a bicycle but after working with Cindy a short amount of time, she learned to ride a horse! It has developed a passion that has totally changed her confidence level.

Hope Reins	219950	1	/users/profile/283575	Sue_99	Volunteer	5	10/04/2014	I am an animal science teacher and brought my students to Hope Reins to volunteer and learn. They worked with horses that have been healed from terrible situations thanks to the love and support from Cindy and the other volunteers. Their hearts were touched with stories of success and their eyes were opened to the huge number of horses who endure horrible abuse daily and need our help. Thank you for the life lessons that they learned through this program. This cause is so worthy of any time or funding you can give.

Hope Reins	219544	1	/users/profile/283156	Allison42	Volunteer	5	10/03/2014	This previous summer I became aware, through a friend, of Hope Reins volunteer program, and I am so glad that I found out about it! Volunteering at this ranch is not only fun, but it is also very rewarding and teaches you something new every time you are there. Sadly, I've had to stop volunteering for the moment due to school, but I can't wait to see Cindy and all the kids again and get back to work!
Hope Reins	219069	1	/users/profile/282687	Kelsie M.	Client Served	5	10/01/2014	6 years ago as hope reins was building up as I came to kingswood school I met swinger which was the sweetest and strongest horse I've ever met he had the biggest heart but then I met Brandy as a 12 your old that had been through too much to handle she made it better she showed me you always can't see where your going but as I led her I knew God was leading me where I needed to go just as I helped her get to where she needed to be. Cindy is the most strong willed person I've ever met only someone like her could ever make an organization as strong as it is because of her love and passion for these horses as she did for me when I was there. People wouldn't realize it but it really is a wonderful program for kids like me that didn't know what to do at the time. I love seeing hope reins grow! 
Hope Reins	217678	1	/users/profile/281216	MarthaWilson	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	I became aware of Hope Reins a few years ago thru our church. We began helping with different things such as trees down and building stalls. I fell in love with the horses and the kids. The love and dedication that Cindy has towards the horses, ponies, and kids are amazing. Her passion has kept this great ministry alive. The children grow in confidence and tell the horses more about themselves than they ever would an adult. To see how the children grow is wonderful, and it is working because there is now a waiting list to get children in the program. This is truly a great nonprofit to support.

Hope Reins	217391	1	/users/profile/280916	Blessed70	Donor	5	09/25/2014	In 2013, I became aware of Hope Reins when Cindy came to our church and talked about this program and explained her compassion and love for horses along with her love for children.  In her presentation, she showed videos and pictures of how the horses minister to children and the children minister to the horses.  I was so impressed by her presentation that I had to see what it was all about.  Her presentation brought back fond memories that I had from childhood with horses involved.  So, my husband and I purchased several bags of feed and some other items that the horses needed and delivered to Hope Reins.  WOW is just one word that describes this program.  Seeing first hand the love, compassion and desire to love and care for these horses was vivid.  To see the work that they are doing with children and to rescue these horses was amazing.  I love animals but never had a place to keep them so I thought that this was my opportunity to make a difference.  Since then, we have had several items delivered to the ranch to help out along with monetary donations.  To see the horses being truly cared for and the smiles on the children's faces is worth it all.  This program allows the children to forget all the bad things that have happened to them and finally enjoy life and to be a kid again is truly a blessing.  So, I encourage you to invest in this worthwhile program.  May God continue to bless Hope Reins.  
Hope Reins	214065		/users/profile/277295	Angiestout	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/08/2014	Hope Reins is located on the campus of Kingswood home for Children where I am the Residential Services Director. Kingswood is a home for dependent abused, neglected and abandoned children. Hope Rein's provides therapeutic services for these children, free of charge. The children trust and bond quickly with the horses as they learn the circumstances and difficulties the horses have faced are much as their own. The children learn coping skills, face their fears, team building, communication and many other necessary tools to heal from their past. I frequently hear how Hope Reins positively impacted the children that have left our facility. 
Hope Reins	213447		/users/profile/276631	Trina Allen B.	Volunteer	5	09/04/2014	Last fall I had the honor of helping take care of the most loving horses I have ever been around. To hear each of their stories was a story in its self. After learning how to take care of them(meds,food,cleaning) I had a different outlook on rescue horses. After time, I feel in Love with each one of them...but the most amazing stories where those that you see on each of the kids faces. From the ones who had never saw them to the ones who spent time with them in the past.  Hope Reins is a Special Place, there is a lot of hard work, Love, and Satisfaction there.  I would  recommend that if you had time to stop by you would feel the rewarding environment. I promise you will not leave without  feeling Love, And the Spirit of The Lord in your Heart.
Hope Reins	189687		/users/profile/247617	HarmonyRescue	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/02/2013	Hope Reins adopted a pony from us, Harmony Rescue. The pony was found wandering the streets, neighbors put her in a pasture and tried to care for her. Unfortunately, that care did not include medical care. The neighbors called us. It took about six of us to finally get her in the trailer and to our facility. This was our fist pony. Reeces proved to be stubborn and wanted to be a big horse. After a year, Hope Reins called and wanted to adopt her. They did not shy away from Reeces personality and specialize in the challenges. Cindy and Bryce came up, stayed the night, and took Reeces home. We have received updates (stories and pics) often. We laugh and still can't believe how Hope Reins and the kids have been able to connect with Reeces. Reeces has found the perfect home of unconditional love, patience, care, laughter, and new horse friends. We have found new friends at Hope Reins.
Hope Reins	189490		/users/profile/247351	Chapi	Volunteer	4	11/27/2013	I have seen, first hand, the amazing results in the heart of a hurt child as they experience the unconditional and gentle love from a strong majestic horse; and I have seen the love of a child touch the heart of a hurting horse. The relationships that are developed at Hope Reins provide hope, healing and love for both child and horse. As a volunteer and supporter of Hope Reins I have the privilege of grooming our blind Brandi, joke around with Silver, assist Katie through some physical challenges. I have seen the expression on Buds face change as he sees a child approach the gate then run to fence as though he is visiting with that child and no one else; and I have Buc prance through the pasture with a strong beauty and our little Reeses show off with pride. Children have overcome fears, faced new challenges, and learned life skills while experiencing love, acceptance, and friendship through the horses at Hope Reins.

I have been there when horses were dropped off looking like they would not live another day!!!   What Kathy Miller does for these horses is wonderful!!!  First she nurses them back to the best health they have ever been in & then she trains them to be safe with children.  I have seen first hand what Kathy does for these horses & my grandchildren have learned to ride, care for & even some training with Kathy that is amazing.  I saw a horse that was scared to be touch by humans go to a horse that came to the fence for feeding when Kathy called them by name.  Kathy is saving horses that nobody wants & making them child safe....
Horse Rescue Foundation	170134		/users/profile/225439	BHmiller	Volunteer	5	09/17/2013	Kathy has helped many people, young and old, gain their confidence back on ground and under saddle. I am impressed by a number of their "success stories". To see the transformations that take place in some of the worst neglect/abuse cases is truly remarkable. I am impressed with their placement for rescued horses and the efforts they make to match the prospective horse with the adoptive family's needs to best insure that the new partnership is a success for both horse and human alike. Their continued involvement to monitor the welfare of placed horses is also impressive. No horse ever seems to be forgotten once he/she leaves the rescue facility.
Horse Rescue Foundation	168049		/users/profile/203625	Miller2000	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	The time and attention that they spend reconditioning the horses as amazing.

The kids help out by teaching some of the horses the basics, in  which helps teaches the kids with response ability.

The kids and the horses are all so well taken care of.  The horses are not just let out and not touch. Ever horse is taught ground manners. All the kids can go get any horse and have the horse listern to them. So great to watch. I will definitely volunteer again.

She restores confidence, stresses safety, and brings out the very best in the horses she rescues.  I had spent a small fortune on other trainers methods but I needed a person.  After my first lesson I was accomplishing things with my horses that I had failed at for years.  Kathy is fun, patient, and passionate about horses.  If you love horses, she is worth the investment.
Horse Rescue Foundation	165777		/users/profile/198656	Coy W.	Volunteer	5	08/22/2013	Great training for horses. Lots of obstacles made for the horses. Riding trails and pastures/fields to ride in.   Kathy Miller is an experienced horse rider and trainer and knows a lot of steps of training. If a horse has a problem she will find out what it is and work on it to solve it. I've visited my Aunt Kathy's a lot and we always work and ride the horses.  I would suggest any horse u can't keep up with or busy ad don't anything with it, U should send it to Horse Rescue Foundation!

Horse Rescue Foundation	165678		/users/profile/220190	DillionShick	Client Served	5	08/21/2013	I first met Kathy four years ago when I obtained a horse from her that she had trained. Dillion is the most gentle, trusting, obedient horse; and yet I understand he was extremely fearful before landing in Kathy's capable hands. Dillion still bears some physical evidence from what we believe was inhumane treatment before Kathy saved the day (i.e. a scar on his nose from a halter left on too long, marks on his back legs, perhaps from barbed wire).     Kathy  truly loves horses, and they love her back. Her facility is kept immaculate  for the horses' comfort and good health, including a barn, run-in shed, obstacle course, arena, nearby trails, etc. She grows her own hay to ensure good quality. Kathy never takes on too many horses at once, so each receives the attention they need and deserve.  Her skill as a trainer ranks up there with the Clinton Andersons of the world. Beyond her horsemanship talents, Kathy is an optimistic, encouraging, happy person, eager to help others succeed and provide the right match between horse and owner. We still talk regularly if I have a question or concern, and just to keep in touch.   She has my highest personal and professional recommendation.  Ellie Shick
Horse Rescue Foundation	165669		/users/profile/220180	DHProc	Donor	5	08/21/2013	I've worked with Kathy for aproximately 3 years now, although I've not been able to visit her facility, I feel comfortable donating to a great cause and helping in some small way so that she can continue her good works.  I first began communicating with Kathy in an effort to locate a horse, Honey, she had trained. Kathy has not located Honey but her search continues which I greatly appreciate. Kathy has many friends she maintains contact with follows up with leads as she gets them. Kathy also keeps me updated through emails. Again, I do appreciate all she does for me and I'm certain she's doing a great job with the rescue horses in her custody. I have another small donation for Kathy, a new saddle, my intention is to bring the gift to her in Tennessee, from Texas, to tour her facitlity and visit a common friend in Athens, Alabama who also works with horses.   Thank you Kathy!

She was not only focused on how to ride, but more so, how to bond with the horse and take on a leadership role.  I rode horses for a good portion of my life, and i know how to ride, but I too, had a lot to learn about horsemanship.  We decided to board our horses with Kathy so that we can grow in our knowledge and skill before bringing them onto our own property.  Now i realize the importance even just for safety, of establishing leadership for the sake of us and our horses.  Thank you Kathy.Debbie Thompson
Horse Rescue Foundation	165551		/users/profile/220040	DaniP	Client Served	5	08/20/2013	After years of bad experiences with horses, Kathy taught  us how to use horsemanship skills to improve ground work and build the confidences of both rider and horses. The results have been well mannered horses, confident clients, and meaningful relationships  among riders and horses.  Her level of knowledge about horse health and behaviors is a most valuable for anyone learning or wanting to get better with skills. We will continue to use her services. I have trusted her with my child. My child would not even walk into a barn. My daughter now is the most skilled handler on our farm. Her confidence with the horses has spilled out into other areas of her life.  Thanks Kathy and the Horse Rescue Foundation! Sincerely,Danielle Paschall

Most of my work is logistical- helping to organize and transport the sheer number of car seats, cribs, and clothing; however, the real fun is seeing the looks on people's faces when they receive things that every baby needs...but their family can't afford.  Knowing that children are safer in their own car seats, sleeping in their own cribs, and having adequate clothing, especially in the cold months, makes volunteering very rewarding.

Working Dogs For Vets	302237	7	/users/profile/393356	combatcasualty	Client Served	5	09/01/2016	I am a 36 yr old combat Veteran with 100% disability for PTSD. I served as an Airborne Ranger in the US Army and when I had to leave the military I didn't want to and was absolutely lost. I struggled with alcoholism, addiction, homelessness etc. before getting help from the VA, turning my life around and dedicating my time to other Veterans experiencing the same struggles that I had. I ran a house for homeless Veterans in Boston for 5 years where we always had at least 6 or 7 other Veterans living together to provide support & companionship but after putting in my time to help others I decided it was time to move on with my own life & buy a home in Florida. The change to being completely isolated, on my own in a strange community was extremely stressful and I began to struggle with depression, severe anxiety, etc. in ways that I hadn't in a long time. It was then someone recommended the possibility of a service dog to help me feel comfortable at home and able to go out in public again. I hadn't really considered it before but I started reaching out to organizations. I was repeatedly told I would have to wait 2-5 years and pay between $7k - $12k to receive a service dog regardless of my status, doctor recommendations, etc. I was becoming increasingly desperate and started reaching out beyond my own state of Florida. Almost immediately I received a call from Ken and Brenda of WDFV. They were getting me a dog and they were doing it soon. They didn't call to see if they "could" help they called to tell me they WERE helping and that it wouldn't cost me a nickel. I was floored and after some coordination I was on a plane to go meet and be matched with my new teammate "Max". When I arrived it was abundantly clear that this wasn't some people who worked at a charity organization, this was a family who's lives were dedicated to helping animals and Veterans. The facility is their home, filled with dogs where volunteers and clients alike freely come and go in and out of the house as a family would. Every moment of everyday for them is about this work. They don't leave it and go home, it IS their home. I've worked with many charitable organizations over the years as a client and as a volunteer and rarely if ever will you find the same level of devotion, conviction and motivation where people sacrifice so much everyday in absolute dedication to others well being. I spent the weekend visiting with Max, participating in events and helping with some fundraising activities and I can say with absolute certainty that this organization does more than any other I've seen, heard of or know about it with every cent they receive. There is no way to go wrong in supporting them. None. While I was there I asked how they managed to support the organization without taking anything from the Veterans they serve and it's only that we as clients return to do what we can, to help the next animal, the next Veteran be saved as we were and to communicate our amazing experiences to people like you who have the power to help this organization continue, grow & thrive. We need to replace the high overhead, board of directors style high salary organizations like "Wounded Warriors" and support people like WDFV who do it out of care, an absolute genuine concern for the well being of others, animal and Veteran. Help them continue to save lives truly in jeopardy, 2 at a time. You won't find an organization that makes your dollars go as far or have as great an impact on so many, I promise you that.

Working Dogs For Vets	301843	2	/users/profile/392900	monicabrooks5	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2016	I am the wife of a disabled Veteran. after long discussions with my Vet and his counselor, he was advised that a service dog would help him greatly. We started our search and quickly found that not only was the waiting list for service dogs years long, the out of pocket cost was far more than we could ever afford. Thankfully we have a counselor that was determined to help us and she heard about Working dogs for vets!  We also had a young German Shepherd that was already attached o my vet and picking up on his moods and things. With the help of Working Dogs for Vets. My husband soon had his own service dog in training. This enabled my Vet to go out and be around people and spend quality time with our children and be able to watch more of their events. He has a "friend" to looks out for him when I am unable to be home. I shudder to think what our lives would be like if WDFV had not have came into our world.  I will be forever thankful.  Always  Greatful,  Monica Brooks

She was so cute. I call her "Hero" because she is my hero. After 16 months of training with Working Dogs for Vets (WDFV), Hero learned to assist and brace me going up stairs, keeps crowds at a safe distance for me, therefore preventing panic or anxiety attacks, and she reminds me to take my meds on time, and she loves to play when not working. Most of all, I have a goal in life, a responsibility now to take good care of Hero. The unconditional love I receive from her uplifts my spirit. Everytime we go out, I'm happy the general public comments on how beautiful Hero is, and in turn I and Hero help educate the public on Service Dog etiquette. Hopefully the more people see me and Hero out and about, or any other handler/dog unit, they will appreciate and help organizations like the WDFV in Lawrenceburg, TN

My landlord at the time didn't allow dogs or cats, so I had to keep Axl hidden. As a veteran you would think I would've been privy to the idea of a service dog, but with PTSD, ideas are fleeting. However a friend recommended that I make Axl my service dog, after a lengthy search I found Ken and Brenda. Knowing he was a veteran, made all the difference. They saved two lives in 2013, and for that, I am forever grateful, veterans and others need more people like Ken and Brenda!
Working Dogs For Vets	301706	2	/users/profile/392682	skellley	General Member of the Public	5	08/28/2016	This is a great organization dedicated to helping Veterans train their own Service Dog through online, onsite, via telephone, anyway they can possibly help. They also train dogs on site for Veterans as well and they have a vigorous training and agility schedule/routine.  I have a very unique and somewhat rare condition called Cataplexy and I own a German Shepherd that I've had since she was a puppy. I searched and searched for organizations that could help me get a Service Dog, however nobody could offer any help to me because of the nature and rarity of my disease. During my search for help, everytime I had a Cataplexy attack my shepherd would act funny just before the attack and then she would go and get my wife, or if I was home alone she would lay by my side until it was over. So needless to say after searching and talking to various groups, I come across this organization, Working Dogs for Vets, and I gave them a call and spoke with Ken. After multiple phone conversations, and research by Ken, he determined that since my own Shepherd was already responding and signaling my attacks, there is no better dog for me than her. Since then we have worked with Ken on site, via Internet , and phone for last year or so honing my dogs skills and basic obedience as well. I can take her anywhere and she does great everywhere we  go. If it wasn't for Ken and Working Dogs, I'm sure I'd still be looking for help. They truly go above and beyond to help in every way possible.
Working Dogs For Vets	301687	2	/users/profile/392665	Talkdogtalk	Donor	5	08/27/2016	I came to know this group thru a inmate dog training program that I run.  The dedication they have to the veterans has been unmatched by any organization I have seen.  Ken and Brenda put their heart and soul in helping the veterans in need of a service dog attain the right match,  train it to the proper needs, and follow the veteran thru the partnership it takes for a excellent service dog.  They give their lives to this cause and I truly admire them.   A very taxing endeavor, but it is deep in their hearts.  Changing lives for the better for our veterans.  Could there be a better cause?  PLEASE help this great organization in any way you can!

So many men let them selves go by the wayside and don't see the warning signs. This group puts humor into serious health issues plaguing men encouraging tham to get routine testing. Thanks for bringing the awareness to light.

Just can't say enough about the great work these guys do.

Jesus for Asia Inc	319111		/users/profile/410454	Samuel13	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/18/2016	Jesus 4 Asia is targeting the most densely populated area in the world, facing competing worldviews and entrenched religious traditions that are extremely resistant to Christianity--no small task.  But by God's sheer grace, they are making a difference!  Their staff members are compassionate, creative, savvy, economical and humble, yet bold for reaching hearts in some of the most difficult circumstances with the love and saving truth of Jesus Christ.  It has been a pleasure working with them and seeing lives changed through their ministry!   
Jesus for Asia Inc	318529		/users/profile/409717	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/08/2016	JFA is one of the few organizations where every single penny of what you send goes directly to the project it was intended for. They are sacrificially dedicated to spreading the gospel in Asia. 
Jesus for Asia Inc	318377		/users/profile/409542	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2016	I've personally worked with the members of Jesus for Asia and saw the difference they're making in many countries. They're passionate about their mission and dedicate their lives to service. When you're part of this ministry the stories of struggles, challenges, and miracles of mission work in Asia become real to you. Also you can support this ministry with confidence because you can see the direct results of your donations .
Jesus for Asia Inc	317039		/users/profile/408230	Bangkokservant	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	My wife and I heard about Jesus for Asia in 2012 when we attended a FaithCamp in Hayden Idaho. We learned that there were millions in the world who had never heard of Jesus and that blew me away. We also learned about the decline in giving to foreign missions and were convicted to do more to support God's work abroad.  We felt confident donating to  Jesus for Asia because 100% of the donation went to the project specified. After a year and a half of interaction with them on a donor basis we felt God call us to the mission field. Naturally we contacted the Woods at JFA and they have us so much of their time to give us guidance in the steps to take in preparing to launch and we weren't even going as missionaries with them. Eventually we did decide to partner with their ministry and it has been a wonderful decision. We have an incredible support team that is focused on praying for us but is also just as passionate about the people we are serving and the work we are doing as we are, maybe even more so. It is rare to find an administration that doesn't want control of things but understands that the front line workers need freedom to make decisions and adapt to cultural things that someone in America may not understand, but that is another great quality of Jesus for Asia. They counsel, guide and work together with us to build up projects rather than micromanage. In the end they are a wonderful ministry but more so, wonderful Christian people. From a donor standpoint and now a volunteer we have nothing but good to say. 
Jesus for Asia Inc	316988		/users/profile/408180	thewomanAtwell	Volunteer	5	10/30/2016	We learned about Jesus for Asia over four years ago. We were impressed with their devoted to seeing God's love shared with those who had never heard. Even though they aren't living overseas, they are missionaries right where they're at. They help so many of us in Asia with managing our finances at no cost to us or our donors. I didn't even know there were organizations like this! It shows that their heart is truly in this work. Everyone who works at Jesus for Asia is 100% dedicated to Christ and His mission! What a blessing they are to work with!
Jesus for Asia Inc	316912		/users/profile/408106	recordlikedaniel	Volunteer	5	10/30/2016	I met Jon and Natalie many years ago and have been acquainted with JFA since 2007. I worked with them full time off and on between the years 2009 and 2013.They are committed to seeing the Gospel go forward by faith no matter the cost. They have given everything they have to forward God's work. Donations made to JFA are managed responsibly and for the project they were specified for. I have been inspired by their faithfulness to God and their vision to see the gospel go throughout the world, especially to those places where it hasn't reached yet. They need all the help and support and prayers they can get. 
Jesus for Asia Inc	316859		/users/profile/408058	traveler4Him	Volunteer	5	10/30/2016	I first heard of Jesus for Asia from a friend in 2009. Faith Camp 2010 was life changing for me. God spoke to me through the messages I heard there and called me to be a part of this ministry. I have had the privilege of visiting India and Thailand and seeing how God is using the ministry of Jesus for Asia to bless many people around the world. What a blessing to see God using real people, with all their faults and limitations, to do His amazing work.  I'm grateful for the opportunity to partner with Jesus for Asia in sharing the Gospel around the world.
Jesus for Asia Inc	316676		/users/profile/407902	KirkVB	Donor	5	10/30/2016	I know of no other ministry that has such diversity of outreach, not only to the forgotten people of Asia, but also to those who have, for the most part, turned their backs on foreign missions. Through their many and varied projects, Jesus for Asia is making a huge impact!  JFA has also taken on the daunting task of raising awareness that there are still 3 billion people in the world who have never heard of Jesus! This is a much needed ministry that is worthy of ongoing financial and prayerful support!
Jesus for Asia Inc	316114	2	/users/profile/407381	msummers1	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2016	I have experienced personally, first hand, the love, the tears, the ultra sacrifice of those who have dedicated their ENTIRE lives to the work of this ministry in sharing the Gospel of Jesus to the Asian world.  To hear the pain in their voices and see the tears in their eyes as they talk of and plead in behalf of this world of unwarned and underserved people helped me to know of and care about the mission to Asia.  
Jesus for Asia Inc	315999	1	/users/profile/407269	Sharon206	Donor	5	10/28/2016	I've been connected with Jesus for Asia since 2013. Their commitment to their mission is unwavering, even in the most difficult times. They are constantly looking for ways to help those who desperately need it. I know with certainty that 100% of the funds I donate are used for the intended purpose. Jesus for Asia does not take a cut of my donation for administrative purposes. I personally know the leaders of this ministry. They are some of the best people I know. I plan to continue my relationship with this ministry for the long haul.
Jesus for Asia Inc	315966	1	/users/profile/407243	michaelmichaels	Donor	5	10/28/2016	Love these guys. Their administrative costs are so low because they volunteer, and really believe in what they do. My money will continue to be sent their way for a long time.
Jesus for Asia Inc	309581	2	/users/profile/400935	Carolyn117	Donor	5	10/10/2016	I was introduced to Jesus for Asia at the Faith Camp at Kooskia, ID in 2008.  I've found them to be faithfully carrying out the commission the Savior gave His disciples - to share the good news everywhere.  I am a regular supporter and can heartily recommend their work.
Jesus for Asia Inc	309471	2	/users/profile/400836	Carljet	Donor	5	10/10/2016	We first learned of Jesus for Asia this last June. We discovered a Faith Camp was scheduled for July 6-10 near us so we attended. We were blessed beyond measure and have become donors and supporters. We met so many fine missionaries at Faith Camp. 
Jesus for Asia Inc	309400	2	/users/profile/400767	Thaddeus L.	Donor	5	10/10/2016	Jesus for Asia's work is very impressive. Their commitment to spreading the Gospel is inspiring and the truly love the people of Asia! They are committed to making sure as much money gets into the hands of those who need it as possible. Often sacrificing much to do so.
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	145148	2	/users/profile/61406	wdoland	Volunteer	4	11/30/2012	I have volunteered at Knox Area Rescue Ministry for about 10 years.  I see the staff working hard to try and help the homeless, those caught in addiction, stranded travelers, and many more.  They have a newl program called Launch to help empower the homeless to get back on their feet.  Often when I am there every week, someone comes in who is homeless for the first time.  They are scared, confused and overwhelmed.  We help them find community resources to get back on their feet, provide them warm meals and a helping hand.  I had a young man come in this week who had been paying rent to friends and come to find out they weren't paying the rent and all of them were evicted.  He tried living in his car for four days and finally came to KARM.  He was cold, scared and hungry.  We provided him food immediately, a place to stay and will refer him to another agency for more help.  No organization is perfect, but I see people who really care about helping those down and out on their luck.
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	101314	1	/users/profile/61406	wdoland	Volunteer	5	11/29/2011	I work in the Welcome Center(Crossroads)  at KARM one afternoon a week. There are a variety of services in Crossroads.  Just to name a few..*People who come in for the first time are interviewed and provided an ID.*There are phones and computers for their use and they pick up the mail they have sent there.*People can pick up their mail and phone messages*We provide referrals to other agencies*Stranded travelers come into Crossroads to get assistance*We have a van that provides rides to the health department and DHS and other agencies*We provide information we have on available jobs and possible housing or other agencies that can be of help.*We have a place people put their bags for safekeeping*We send faxes, help people find numbers, addresses, directions and general information.The people at Crossroads really care and want to help people who come in.  They do the best they can to help people get on their feet and live a productive life.
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	57937	1	/users/profile/61406	wdoland	Volunteer	4	11/26/2010	I have volunteered at KARM for about 5 years.  The people at KARM truly want to help the homeless and those caught in drug addiction.  I am always amazed at how many services they provide - feeding over a 1,000 meals a day, providing drug addiction programs, apartments for families in need, a day room for the homeless,  emergency overnight beds, plus assistance in getting housing, health care, job training, vouchers for furniture and other local services.  The list seems endless and there are so many people who work tirelessly to help.  Truly a wonderful organization. 
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	102871	11	/users/profile/136125	Terry N.	Donor	1	01/04/2012	KARM has gone from being a Mission of Hope to a Mission of MONEY. They were donated Toys from the Toys from Tots to be given to the children at the mission BUT KARM decided to SELL THEM for profit. If you have any doubt about this here is a link for you to see http://www.wate.com/story/16387413/donated-toys-for-tots-pulled-from-karm-thrift-store-shelves     now are you going to believe a Military organization or a organization that got caught with their hand in the cookie jar. This isn't the first time I have seen something of this nature. Read the reviews on this link and I have donated coats to the Coats for Cold campaign and then seen them on the sales floor FOR SALE. I dropped them off in the box and the next day they were for sale  at a price even more than I paid for the coats. There are so many stories of the greed and lack of Jesus in their organization anymore it is truly a sad day for Knoxville. Don't waste your time or your money because they MAKE MILLIONS a year. MILLIONS and then ask for more !   Mark 4:22 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. 
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	100858	4	/users/profile/125337	johnmessner	General Member of the Public	1	11/20/2011	KARM has spiraled out of control and chaos now is a daily occurrence in the "Mission District".  KARM was formed as an emergency shelter but now is more of a flop house.  Even KARM refer to those seeking shelters as residents.  KARM once was a vital link that brought the homeless to resources that would then refocus their life and a better living.  Now its just a place to seek a meal and a place to sleep.  NO conditions, anyone, even the criminals on the run seek refuge there.  KARM even has a policy that allows those that are homeless can sleep there but during the day the day they must leave.  They wonder our neighborhoods breaking into our homes and cars, ward off customers with their aggressive panhandling and have affected the downtown and west sectors of town by luring hundred of homeless to Knoxville from all across the country.  Then while the homeless eat beans on Tuesday night, directors and several other take home enormous salaries, salaries donated by kind hearted people then skimmed off the backs of the homeless.  North Knoxville residents are ashamed of the state of affairs at our Mission.  We are truly saddened. 
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	96230	4	/users/profile/112014	jakeaaal	General Member of the Public	1	08/21/2011	The CEO, Burt Rosen  makes 6 figures from this homeless organization.  The "residents" of KARM are simply warehoused with no mandatory case management, contrary to other homeless organizations.  The residents take up sidewalk space outside the building.  
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	58303	4	/users/profile/61978	jbodie	Volunteer	5	11/30/2010	     Knox Area Rescue Ministries (KARM) is a wonderful place for emergency shelter for men, women and families, which includes a shower, clean beds, and three meals a day and free hair cuts by local cosmetologists. Their men and women's recovery programs include Bible-based teachings, mentors, classes covering many aspects of daily living, on-job training, and the Abundant Life Kitchen classes turning students into chef-material.     We are impressed with this organization because they take NO Federal funds. This way they are allowed to introduce those they serve not only to a clean place to sleep and eat, but they do it in the 'name of Jesus'.      For 2 1/2 years, my husband and I have served lunch meals every Monday, become volunteers on other occasions/events, and are  excited to attend graduations of those in the recovery programs.      We have a lot of respect for the staff and other volunteers; and have come to love the residents and overnight guests. Many of them have become our friends. We encourage them, pray with them, laugh and cry with them. 
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	58242	3	/users/profile/61901	Bootsy	Volunteer	4	11/30/2010	I have been a high impact volunteer at KARM for about 2 1/2 years .  I started with an encounter meeting and was very excited about helping the needy. I began working in the Admin. Department one day a week.  I love secretarial work and enjoy the challenges that come my way.  My co-workers are wonderful, loving, and enthusiastic people who love the Lord with all their hearts.  Last year I helped with the Tent of Hope on Thanksgiving Day and  watched as many folks sat together to share a wonderful meal and companionship with each other.  There are many opportunities to help at KARM. All it takes is a phone call and a willing spirit to help the downtroden.  I enjoy being a part of this wonderful organization.  
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	58030	1	/users/profile/61599	Jill Green	Volunteer	5	11/29/2010	I have been involved with KARM as a 'high impact volunteer' since my 'acceptance' in November 2008.  I love every moment I get to spend with the individuals at KARM, clients and staff alike.  The mission of KARM and the programs they offer truly change lives.  The word 'transform' is one I consistently think of.  Awesome.  
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	57989	1	/users/profile/61513	ddeibler76	Volunteer	5	11/28/2010	I volunteer once a week at the welcome center at KARM.  To see the staff interaction with the clients in helping them find employment, housing, health care is uplifting.  But what I truly enjoy is seeing each of the homeless clients being treated with love, dignity and respect.  The first day they arrive they are given hope.  One man looked completely dejected while I was there.  The staff determined his concern about having a surgery scheduled for a kidney removal, and then having to recover while on the street.  The staff found means of providing this man a bed and place to recover following his surgery.  And then to my great delight, the next time I came in to volunteer, I discovered this gentleman had been placed in permanent housing.  With over 200 homeless people a day coming through the welcome center at KARM, the personal touch provided to these people is a Godsend.
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	57917	1	/users/profile/61383	KimE	Volunteer	5	11/26/2010	From the day I toured KARM, I was overwhelmed with the feeling of "hope" that prevails.  Clients are hopeful, volunteers are hopeful, staff is hopeful, the programs and services are hopeful.  Who couldn't use more of that?  KARM doesn't "just" provide for the physical needs of clients, but they attempt to provide for the eventual transition from their current situation to one of living as normal a life as the rest of us do.  They offer recovery programs, social services counseling, job skills training.  They are the hands and feet of Jesus in a world so lacking.  They offer, to those willing to accept it, dignity and salvation.  I had had previously volunteered with an organization that seemed to want to maintain the status quo of those they served, as if to keep themselves alive.  KARM isn't doing that.  They have many success stories, many former clients are active in the organization, giving back.  I can't say enough good things about KARM!  Having attended the 50th Jubilee Celebration, I know that I am not alone in my sentiments.  BRAVO, KARM!  Your efforts help me be hopeful too!
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	57885	2	/users/profile/61333	hackdmar	Volunteer	5	11/25/2010	I have lived in east Tennessee all my life and often heard about Knox Area Rescue Ministries through church or a radio announcement. I thought it was just a place for the homeless to get a hot meal and bed for the night. My church was involved with serving a meal with KARM and that left me wanting more information. After attending a KARM Encounter information meeting I wanted to be involved. That was about four years ago, and at that time I thought my wife and I showed great courage volunteering. Now we know the courageous people are the ones who make the commitment required to change their way of life. We see this change come about because of the power of God yes, but also a KARM staff that expects, desires and does an excellent work making a positive impact for the kingdom of God!  
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	57867	1	/users/profile/61307	smccullar	Volunteer	5	11/24/2010	I have been volunteering at Knox Area Rescue Ministries (KARM) for last couple of years.  During that time I have seen many homeless individuals helped in various ways.  Food and shelter are only part of the story at KARM.  Through its Crossroads Center KARM helps connect needy people with various agencies and resources that are available in the city.  The Restoration Education component of the minstry helps individuals break free from lives of addiction and self destructive behaviors.  As a Christian ministry KARM's focus is restoring lives in Jesus' name.  This ministry certainly lives up to that objective.
Knox Area Rescue Ministries	57816	1	/users/profile/61232	dbodie	Volunteer	5	11/24/2010	KARM is a great organization. They help to feed and cloth any person who walks in their doors.
Fayette County Animal Rescue	216150		/users/profile/279609	Jsgirl2014	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2014	I have seen & heard nothing but great things about FCAR. They do so much to take care of so many animals. They make sure they are well taken care of, have food & medical, have a safe place to stay, & make sure they are placed in good homes withpeople who will love them & take care of them.
Fayette County Animal Rescue	216063		/users/profile/279505	joy2100	General Member of the Public	5	09/20/2014	We got our CJ from FCAR in March 2014. We immediately took him to our own vet who reviewed his records. Our vet said there were very good records kept on him and that you could tell he was properly cared for during his year in this shelter. FCAR seems to do so much with so little. It's amazing how they  know each animal and are in tune to their individual needs. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a dog or cat to love. Also would highly recommend them to anyone looking to volunteer to make a difference or anyone looking to donate and know that your dollars are going to to a great cause and would be used wisely.
Fayette County Animal Rescue	216022		/users/profile/279468	mfebuary	General Member of the Public	4	09/20/2014	I have seen nothing but loving people associated with this organization who are dedicated to helping animals find loving homes and in the meantime offer their assistance in taking care of them thru sponsors who open their homes until the permanent home is found. These animals are well cared for by veterinarians who assist in surgeries, and any medical needs necessary for the well being of the animal.
Fayette County Animal Rescue	216009		/users/profile/279454	Smeewes1	Client Served	5	09/20/2014	I received two puppies from FCAR.  They were so kind and thoughtful not only to me but especially to the puppies. You could tell they loved the animals they care for. They were so helpful to me for months helping me sort out puppy issues such as eating and training. Love them!
Fayette County Animal Rescue	215999		/users/profile/279443	Puppyloverone	Volunteer	5	09/20/2014	I've been volunteering for FCAR for several years and coming from a large city, I had no idea what to expect with a smaller organization. From the first day, I was so impressed with the loving, caring, and compassionate people that run this rescue and how amazing they are with their rescues. A day doesn't go by that I don't see something else that reinforces my first instinct, that these people are Rock Stars! If a rescue stays a few weeks or a few years before being adopted, they are given all the love and attention they did not have in their previous life.  FCAR takes in the abandoned, abused and sick and let me tell you, the world is a far better place with them in it. If someone spent a few hours at their shelter, they would see the difference FCAR makes in  Fayette County and what a difference they make in every  dog or cat's life they have saved. 
Fayette County Animal Rescue	215989		/users/profile/279434	Cheryl109	General Member of the Public	5	09/20/2014	From out of state. Stopped in for a visit. Was very impressed by the facilities but awed by the level of caring and care shown by the staff and volunteers.

With out FCAR many animals would never have the opportunity to feel love. I am so thankful we have them in my community. They rehabilitate and and find abandoned fur babies a forever home.
Fayette County Animal Rescue	215964		/users/profile/279411	Delores C.	Board Member	5	09/19/2014	Fcar has been in the rescue world for over 20 years. Two women, Delores Cowan Provow and Yvette Rose started the first ever no kill animal rescue in Rossville, Tn. With several cages in both our garages to the beautiful sanctuary that it is today.  Volunteers working tirelessly to rescue the sick, injured, abused, neglected and abandoned animals in Fayette County Tennessee without whose help  we would not be able to care for the hundreds of animals over the years. 
Fayette County Animal Rescue	215962		/users/profile/279409	Julie189	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	We moved to Fayette County in April 2013 and I have always wanted to get involved in the community and I thought what better way than to volunteer.  I pondered the idea  and reached out to Fayette County Animal Rescue and they welcomed me with open arms.  I have been volunteering with them since January 2014 and can personally say that they are the best!  from office work, events, cleaning the runs for the day or just sitting with a new rescue and assuring him/her that they will never be abused again is such a rewarding experience.  FCAR really takes loves each and everyone of their rescues and I am proud to be a volunteer there.
Fayette County Animal Rescue	215952		/users/profile/279399	Cheryl108	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	I have been a client as well as a volunteer for Fayette County Animal Rescue for almost 6 years now.  There is no nicer group of caring people people anywhere than at FCAR.  Everyone loves the animals and cares for each of them as if they were their own pet.  The grounds are well kept and most of all the runs are clean.  The animals there are happy and each family is checked out before animal is adopted to them.  We have two puppies from them now that are the love of our lives.  Fayette County is very lucky to have this group of people to care for the our abused animals.  I personally can not thank them enought for all they do.
Fayette County Animal Rescue	212236		/users/profile/275210	AmberK	Volunteer	5	08/25/2014	  I have been a volunteer with Fayette County Animal Rescue for 4+ years. I love going out to the rescue! All of the volunteers and staff are caring, selfless, friendly and they all love the animals in their care. The facility is a beautiful home for the animals that have been rescued. Being a no-kill rescue, there are some animals that have been there for years and others that stay for a short time until their furever home is found. No matter the length of their stay, you can tell they're happy to be in such a loving place.   Fayette County Animal Rescue is a non-profit that relies on donations of money, goods and volunteers to continue doing their amazing work.  I will continue to volunteer as long as I am able and will do what I can to raise awareness for this wonderful animal rescue :)

The Humane Association Of Wilson	69003	2	/users/profile/75404	Grateful Daughter	Client Served	5	02/16/2011	My elderly mother adopted her cat from New Leash on Life and it has changed her life. It gives her a reason for getting up every day. The staff at New Leash on Life made the experience so positive. They were kind, patient and understanding. They made my mother feel like she was special because she was adopting a cat. You could tell they cared about the cat. I was in the shelter 7 or 8 years ago and I couldn't believe how much better it looks now. Yes, it is still an old building that should be replaced but it looks like the staff takes pride in it and does everything they can to make it as comfortable as possible for animals and as pleasant as possible for the public.  Does the staff always do everything perfectly, probably not, but I can say in the case of my mother, they were the best. 
The Humane Association Of Wilson	65754	1	/users/profile/71875	PuppyLove777	General Member of the Public	1	02/09/2011	There is no respect and I don't mean JUST for the animals. While this shelter(or whatever it is now) does take in animals it does not live up to the expectations of Wilson's County. Do they take in animals from Wilson's NOOOO. All animals are on a waitlist while they take in other animals from other counties. This is EXTREMELY unfair. Add in they have employees there that are doing one crappy ass job. Just standing there pretty much staring at the wall while only two or three people (Usually only ONE person is ACTUALLY working!!) are working. What's wrong with this picture? The board needs to actually go to the shelter(again or whatever it is now) and see who is actually doing the work or they should have people who the employees don't know go in and get an unbiased opinion. This place is digging itself into the hole and it's DISGUSTING!
The Humane Association Of Wilson	65345		/users/profile/71432	Mattie	Donor	1	02/09/2011	The people that are running the shelter (Not sure that It Is even a shelter) have no clue what they are doing. When they drive down the street do they look around? Do they see what I see? Dead animals all ov...er the road that have been hit by cars? More and more every day I see this. Even on the road right in front of NLOL a cat ran cross the road and got hit by a car. People that used to pick up strays and bring them to the SHELTER can not any more because they have no place to take them. This means the animal Is left to roam, starve, be Injured, suffer, killed, and breed (and they will breed) and have off spring that will all do the same. This Is just UNBELIEVABLE when you have a place for them to go. And I also know they have food for them! But still this goes on and on. WHY!! I am also a little confused about the add they run In the paper Lost or found a pet? Call #, WHY? If I found a pet I can not bring It to them, so that means no one there seen It or checked to see If It had a micro chip Or a rabbies tag, Right, If I call and I have 3 times, my daughter has a few times and a few others that I know and was all told the same thing. We dont take strays to call pet finders and never asked about puting it In a book or bring It In and we will check It for a micro chip, nothing so now If you lost a pet well come on do the math now your chances of finding your pet has went down and your pets chance of becoming one of the strays that I talked about has just went up. I would also like to know how a place can be a nonprof. If It only takes In animals that they know will be adopted and nothing else. And If they will only keep the cages so full, would't they be making a proffit now? Im just asking. So back to driving down the street and seeing so many animals like I said, does that mean that everything that everyone has done over the last years Is just now gone? OMG and they Spay stations 3 of them?????? They do not use them!!!! If you call to make an app. It takes at least 6 months for them to call you back. What Is that about?? Wish that some how we could change all this. Thank you for making this page It Is very much appreciated and Thank you to all That Made The Humane Assoc. What It once was.
The Humane Association Of Wilson	64657	1	/users/profile/70698	lovesdoggies	General Member of the Public	5	02/08/2011	I admire the hard work and dedication of all the employees that work for the Humane Association and New Leash on Life.  I see their love and devotion everyday, these employess go in early and stay late and work weekends just to care for these animals.  The employees spend countless hours careing and nurturing for those that have no voice.  I know MANY people that have adopted their best friends from the shelter and would definitely go there again should the chance arise. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new family member, the staff is knowledgable and takes the time to help you find the right match or fit for your family. There have been many mornings that people had dropped off numerous puppies or kittens on the door step and the staff always lovingly takes them in. I have witnessed firsthand the awesomeness of this association.  God Bless. 
The Humane Association Of Wilson	64538	1	/users/profile/70571	kphan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/07/2011	After several months of waking up at 4AM for work and returning home at 9:30PM, I was realizing a sad trend of a workaholic. For 6 months I used my hectic work schedule as an excuse not to get a dog until I searched the website for probably the 100th time and had seen MY puppy on there. I anxiously waited for the work week to pass by to adopt him on the weekend. Of course this story can go on for months! Let's just say my life has changed. Everyday it breaks my heart to leave him for work and anxious to go home to see him. While I've provided him with a healthy and happy quality of  life, he has changed my life.  As far as the organization, I can't thank them enough for providing me with such a loving companion. Everyone should take a step back and simply think... any organization is one more that is helping an animal in need. One more is better than one less.  I am proud to say that many of closest friends and family has adopted puppies from New Leash. My cousin drove 8 hours to adopt a puppy from New Leash! My friend flew down from New England to adopt a puppy from New Leash!  
The Humane Association Of Wilson	64530	1	/users/profile/70562	maryh02	Client Served	5	02/07/2011	My friend and I adopted 2 puppies at the same time.  I had come to Nashville to visit a friend and talk her out of adopting a puppy.  But, when we were looking at the website that morning, I saw my puppy and knew I wouldn't be able to leave without him!   During the adoption, New Leash provided us with helpful information regarding raising your puppy and health information.  We refer all of our friends to New Leash when they are considering adopting.  We even adopted a puppy for a family member who drove from Virginia to pick her up!

The staff was warm and caring and I felt that my kitties were truly loved before they came to me. Thanks New Leash on Life! 
The Humane Association Of Wilson	64031		/users/profile/69998	Not Good	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/06/2011	I am not able to give this organization a very good rating.  They may be a safe haven for puppy mill dogs, but this is at the cost of the dogs and cats in their own community suffering.  They have done nothing to help in the community they were put in to help, which is Wilson County.  Never before have I seen such out right blatent refusal to help the animals in their own area.  This used to be a wonderful organization that Wilson County could be proud of, now it is just a joke.  They will only take little adoptable dogs and puppies that they can get the most adoption fees out of.  Absolutely not a care for the animals starving, abused, abandoned or otherwise not taken care of in their own community.  They should be ashamed to call themselves an animal welfare organization.  
The Humane Association Of Wilson	63945		/users/profile/69903	Paige Heriges	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/06/2011	I have had the wonderful experience of knowing and working with many of the people who were involved when it was the Humane Assoc. of Wilson Co. and can tell you that it was a wonderful organization which developed many new and exciting programs over the years. The moble spay/neuter clinic and later the high volume/low cost spay neuter clinic were state of the art and organizations not just from TN but all over the country used them as a model for their organizations. Soon after the name change to NLOL with a new set of executive staff and board members hand picked by the current ED after she alienated and caused the departure of many long term staff, volunteers and board members the organization and all of its programs began to fail!!  The salaries are a joke for a non-profit organization (Over $400,000.00).  All of the numbers such as animals spayed/neutered and animals adopted are all way down. But the thing that is hardest to hear is the way they are know viewed by the public. What was once nothing but high praise and respect has turned to distrust and disgust.  All of the positive posts I have read so far belong to someone still with the organization with a vested interest, try asking the general public of Wilson Co who they no longer serve but will gladly take their monetary donations but not donations of goods as was recently stated by the current Spay/Neuter Director! It is now all about the money and the glory and even unfortunately persoanl gain. It is not very professional for executives to gain on a individual basis from supporters. I can not even give them a one star rating in this poll.  I can only hope that what few good people are left on the board will do the right thing to restore this oranization and get the train back on the positive and shining track it was on before the current ED crashed and burned it!
The Humane Association Of Wilson	63899		/users/profile/69853	Discusted	Donor	1	02/06/2011	I was involved with this organization since the mid 90's.  I helped the organization grow and develop new programs.  The Spay/Neuter programs were very successful getting national attention and brought in lots of money in grants and donations.   In 2008 the board brought in a new Executive Director who sat on her pedestal and hired managers for managers.  Soon they became very top heavy with 3 new high paying management  positions.  Soon they were running out of money so they tapped into the spay/neuter money that was raised for spay/neuter and then the spay/neuter programs were out of money.  The programs that could have run indefinitely were hurting for money.   The organization needs an Executive Director who is compassionate and takes a "hands on" approach, writing grants, managing the programs, and watching the donors money.   If you donate to NLOL, your money must pass through the top heavy management before possibly reaching the animals.

I think NLOL is wonderful because they have evolved into an organization that makes a commitment to every animal that crosses their threshold. Each pet is loved and cared for and treated with respect and is given the chance to find a forever home. In the early days, I was afraid to ask about an animal if I didn't see it at the shelter. Only about 30% were adopted in those days. Now, I am confident that if a pet is no longer there, it is because it has found a loving family of its own and it will have a chance to live out a normal, happy life. The adoption rate is now around 98-99%,

Though I was a new face on my first visit, the Friends greeted me with hugs and handshakes and smiles that left me glowing. You can tell that amazing things are happening there every day. Friends Life is unique in its approach: keeping young adults with special needs engaged socially and helping them achieve independence through engagement with their community. Nashville is SO fortunate to have such a resource. Every city should be so lucky.

The staff members are patient, caring, compassionate, talented, knowledgeable, and have a genuine care for all the friends. The friends that come to the program are all uniquely wonderful.  They are encouraging, kind, helpful to one another, have a good work ethic, and create an environment with a sense of community that is a pleasure to be around.  I would highly recommend a volunteer opportunity with Friends Life.

We were not sure what was going to happen for the next stage of life after school. In comes Friends Life. Friends Life did something to her that my wife and I thought would never happen, she opened up. He new found confidence in herself because of Friends Life, allowed her to find a job (which she has been working for over a year) and she has just recently taking up driving and working on getting her license.

Through Friends Life's emphasis on "giving service to community" she has  experienced the joys of volunteering and helping others.

She loves going everyday and is challenged by the programs they have developed. FL is much more than a "baby sitting" program like many programs for people with disabilities. I would say it is more like continuing adult education. FL has classes for everything from creative writing, art, cultural studies to nutrition. They emphasize health and fitness and have done a great job in encouraging Katie to stay on top of her fitness. But the most important thing for Katie at FL are the people.  Many of the Friends have been there since it began and these kids have developed into lifelong friendships, something that rarely happens for people with disabilities. We love FL and know Katie's life would never be as rich and meaningful without it!

The entire Actors Bridge Ensemble wraps their love around this program- with the set up of the performance space, spreading the word to the community, sharing their wisdom and time, and sitting front row to cheer on these grrrls.  The ability for the leadership team to shepherd a group of teenage grrrls, help the grrrls write a full script after a week at camp, spend four days in rehearsal and then produce three incredible professional grade performances to a full audience is nothing short of impossible- but these folks will tell you, they specialize in the impossible.

My granddaughter has been a member of MET for 5 years.  This past year she took a 6 month hiatus.  During her absence she felt that she was not getting the proper choral training through her school.  She expressed to me that she was loosing the PROPER training she needed in order to continue to pursue her career of choice, MUSIC.  The school that she currently is attending did not provide the proper decorum that all music professionals should follow and she was loosing her vocal range and training, to a teacher that just really didnt seem to care.  She wanted more!  She made the decision to return to MET.  She now wants to finish her school years out with MET and this is a choice that she has made.  MET welcomed her back with open arms!!

My belief is that music, in any form, brings great joy to the performer and the listener beyond measure. When that music comes from a child, it brings with it something so pure and honest. From the youngest to the oldest, each member of the Choral Arts Link program is given an opportunity to learn and grow, whether they plan to be a singer or a doctor, the door has been opened. Anyone wanting to invest in our youth, would be well served investing in Choral Arts Link - volunteering, financially investing or just spreading the word. Join me in clearing a path to excellence. Support Choral Arts Link!

Her goal is to be a vocal performance major and perform.  MET Singers laid the foundation for her aspirations of being a classically trained performer.  What she has learned along with her private training has greatly prepared her for the college auditions she is currently undertaking.  The teachers and students are very proud of their work and it shows every time they perform.  Way to go MET!!!

The music teachers that volunteer their time to work with our kids are amazing. My son has always loved music, but MET has opened his eyes to things that he didn't think were possible. They have given him the confidence he needs to excel at what he loves. They also do a great job working with their students and teaching them to be well-rounded, respectable adults. They are taught lessons that will carry them through a lifetime.
Choral Arts Link	27688	6	/users/profile/28772	jeejee	Volunteer	5	02/10/2010	As a Grandparent Volunteer it has given me MUCH PLEASURE working with this group.  To witness the TRUE dedication of ALL INVOLVED, Director, Students, Teachers, Board Members, Parents - ALL VOLUNTEERS - is heart-warming. This year some of the Seniors, many of whom started when then they were in the Second Grade, are now graduating with the intention of doing something in the Music field, then returning to pass on their knowledge.  These children not only sing, but have learned to 'read music' & learn 'theory'.  They perform all types of music GRANDLY!!!  Their Director/Teachers work extremely hard @ their 'day jobs' then dedicate themselves to these kids for classes, rehearsals, & performances. NOBODY GETS PAID (except for a very small stipend the teachers get for the one week Summer Camp). To take 60 mainly non-singing students - 2nd - 12th grades - & turn them into Classically trained SINGERS is beyound belief.  You just have to hear them!!!! Their 'professionalism' is unquestionable. This group fosters 'family'!!!  Join us & you'll see. The MET Singers Honor Choir becomes the Celebration Youth Chorus each year for the annual MLK Celebration with the Nashville Symphony & have done so for the past 13 years & they DO MAKE US PROUD.  I am extremely delighted to be one of their small volunteers doing whatever I can to help make a difference, but the one's to be GREATLY HONORED are the TEACHERS/DIRECTOR/PARENTS/STUDENTS.

Our sweet Murphy (fka Ruger) is constantly by my side. He is so loved.  We also had the blessing of fostering 7 beautiful pups (we rescued their mama when she was starving to death and about a week pregnant).  We knew Proverbs 12:10 would help us find the best homes for Millie's puppies, and they sure did! We have moved from the area now, so we aren't able to volunteer any more, but Proverbs 12:10 will forever have a special place in our hearts.  So thankful for the love that is Proverbs 12:10.Pictures are of Rookie (Murphy's best friend) and Murphy, Millie, and her litter of babies who were placed through Proverbs 12:10 with amazing forever families

The animals that are lucky enough to join the Proverbs 12:10 family will NEVER know anything but love for the rest of their lives.  Once a Proverbs baby .... ALWAYS a proverbs baby.  Fur babies that have medical issues do not get refused or euthanized without every effort being made to save the fur baby.  I have to say .... Proverbs 12:10 have blessed me with knowing angels - both 2 legged angels and 4 legged angels!!!!!

And, since she doesn't have a Facebook account, I gave this group a 5-star rating for her. The 5 stars are from me too because I see for myself how happy Proverbs has made Kathy with her adoption of a young Choclate Lab girl named Sadie (new name). God surely had His hand in helping the Strunks & Proverbs find one another...  And since then, through Kathy's efforts, Sadie has gotten her certification as a therapy dog - Sadie goes to nursing homes and schools and churches and other venues to show her love to people and to also show how smart she is.  So, thanks to Proverbs 12:10, there is another smart, pretty, sweet dog in a home where it is needed, wanted and greatly loved.  God bless you all at Proverbs!

Proverbs vets them, gives them their shots, and loves them until a forever home can be found.

During this time we have fostered 3 adult dogs and 15 puppies (who were born in our home).  I initially thought that we were going to help these nice folks at Proverbs.  Wow, was I mistaken.  Our family has been blessed beyond measure by being a part of the many who work together.  Each time I've needed support (as a foster) I have been met with cooperation, answers, and what ever we have been in need of. The commitment of the coordinators and each person down the line has impressed me as heartfelt and sincere.  The care and love of the animals is the focus of this rescue.  Our family has gained so much more understanding of the true meaning of rescue and lifetime commitment to those rescued. Once a Proverbs baby,  always a Proverbs baby.  For anyone wishing to volunteer or support this organization, my advice is, "don't wait, step forward now."

They truly have the best interests of the animals  they rescue at heart. People don't always realize that this organization is run by volunteers, many of which have full time day jobs. Even so, the dedication is unbelievable. Once you experience for yourself the life changing work that is done for the animals that are rescued by Proverbs you automatically want to jump in and help keep it all going and be a part of the group. Further, these are people that I want to be around because of the kindness in their hearts related to how they live their lives generally.

Both experiences have been very positive. Proverbs is determined to find the best homes possible for the animals that have been lucky enough to have been placed in their care. No expense is spared when caring for a Proverbs baby---from heartworm treatment, to spaying or neutering, to more extensive medically necessary surgeries. Every penny that is donated or raised goes towards the care of the animals as Proverbs is completely run by volunteers. I am thankful for the hearts of this wonderful group of volunteers---keep up the good work!

No real explanantion was given but it was implied that we were denied because we had no vet references. ??? How would we have vet references if we had no pets? Furthermore, if we did, wouldn't that raise the question as to whether we altready had too many pets? I understand that applicants must be screened, and it is a good practice, but the nature in which our application was handled was horribly unprofessional. The individual who made the post identified themselves as the "director". The text and verbage was very condescending and patronizing, suggestiong that we go to a "kill center" where applicants are not screened as thoroughly. We were only trying to do the right thing. We had looked at buying a bred dog, but decided that there were plenty of animals that needed a good home that we are willing to provide. We would rather have spent our money on the adoption fee and make a donation to Proverbs pet rescue with the diffrence of what the bred dog would have cost us. There seems to be a self righteous, holier than thou attitude associated with this organization. As if they are somehow endowed with the moral authority the dictate to the rest of the world who is and isn't worthy of pet ownership. They have created some sort of private bueracracy that is not serving them or the animals very well at all. They claim to be non profit, but I just wonder if someone among their ranks isn't making some money.... No wonder there are so many homeless pets in the world, people like this are forcing them to stay in "foster" care.
Proverbs 12 10 Animal Rescue & Adoption	141260	2	/users/profile/187533	1Tori	Donor	5	11/19/2012	Proverbs 12:10 is an incredible animal rescue program that has held an adoption event EVERY Saturday since 2006 at a pet supply store in Bellevue, TN. They currently place over 700 dogs and cats annually. They are known locally for accepting sick or injured animals declined by other rescue programs due to the cost veterinary care. The animals are placed in foster homes so they are socialized and assessed before placement into their permanent homes.  They have 1 paid employee and the rest of the work is done by volunteers. That is simply amazing.

Not knowing who to turn to or where to start, I tried desperately to pick up the pieces and move on with my life. It wasn't until four years later that I realized just how much my TBI had affected me. Broke, divorced, jobless & on the verge of being homeless; I focused all my energy on searching for resources that could possibly help me. Through my lengthy, strenuous search; I finally came across an organization that specialized in providing aid for survivors with my condition and current situation. The Brain Injury Association of TN not only supported & provided me with a bundle of different resources, but also opened my eyes and helped me realize the vitality of TBI.   While attending a BIAT Support Group Christmas dinner at Vanderbilt, I was offered a Board Member position. Feeling overwhelmingly blessed and thankful for this wonderful opportunity; I immediately took action.   Recently becoming a certified BIAT Board Member, gives me hope that I can make a difference in the TBI community; by provding aid to other TBI survivors & spreading awarness.

The staff are professional and knowledgeable. The staff return calls in a timely manner and work to change the lives of individuals with brain injury on a shoe string of a budget. With more Veterans returning from the war with a traumatic brain injury from explosive devices, it is more important than ever that this program receive additional funding.  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States.  Each year, traumatic brain injuries contribute to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Recent data shows that, on average, approximately 1.7 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury annually.  A TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the normal function of the brain. Not all blows or jolts to the head result in a TBI. The severity of a TBI may range from mild, i.e., a brief change in mental status or consciousness to severe, i.e., an extended period of unconsciousness or amnesia after the injury. The majority of TBIs that occur each year are concussions or other forms of mild TBI. Thanks for your consideration of awarding this money to a very worthy cause and organization.  Cindy Murdock-Elliott, M.A., L.P.E. Former Board Member, Professional, and Family Member

Center of Hope (formerly Hope House, Maury County Center Against Domestic Violence)	167563		/users/profile/222429	April Thurman	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	Being a board member for Center of Hope is very rewarding and healing to me. This is the most organized and hands-on board that I have ever been associated with.  It's important to me to be a board member because my family has had personal experience with domestic violence. I think my mother would be proud that I have associated myself with such a worthy cause. I remember that she sought after an organization like Center of Hope for us.  Center of Hope has some of the best staff that I have ever come in contact with; they are very compassionate, educated in the cause and exceptionally trained.  Center of Hope is diligent to the cause!

Client Served	5	05/10/2012	I have utilized services from Hope House on numerous occasions. Each time was a desperate one in my life and each time I was treated with respect. Having left an abusive marriage several times I was ashamed to even speak to the wonderful staff at Hope House. Not only did they make me feel deserving, they also made me comfortable and supported. I know how difficult it is to "get away." I also know how wonderful life can be once you have. It is only though the selfless and caring people who helped me at my lowest that I am here, successful, and happy.  I thank Hope House of Maury County for being there for me and special thanks to Traci (Cook) Webb and Angela Slack for never giving up.

What they taught us during those times really enriched us and helped us work on things we would have never thought about.  Scott and I are so blessed to be a part of this Ministry.  I have been able to attend most of Rose's women's retreat.  I have to tell you, I look for them so much.  It is truly a time for Rest, Refresh and Restore.  Rose helps enables to find ourselves with God, as He has given her some great tools.  She is an amazing child of God, and she enjoys helping others find out who they are in God's eyes.  Thank you Rose, for all you do.  Her and Todd have blessed so many people with all the do, their ministry spans truly from East to West.

I love how Rose & Todd focus on changing the world one person at a time.  Meeting both of them has been a true blessing.  Rose has been counseling me by helping with my career & my relationships, but most importantly helping me from a bibical point of view. I have learned so much by their leadership, direction, determination, passion & love for God. This ministry is living out the greatest commandment...Love the Lord & love others!

She has such a sweet spirit and is not afraid of following where the Spirit of God leads.  She and Todd make a great team!  Their solid example of godly character is encouraging and up-lifting to others around them.  They are ready to get their hands dirty and help people in difficult situations.  My first experience with their ministry was attending a women's retreat.  It was both relaxing and an exercise in faith building.  I had the opportunity to experience Jesus in some wonderful ways because Rose was willing to let God have His way in that time.  She didn't feel a need to promote herself, but humbly let the Lord use her.  Thank you, Rose for your servant heart!  Blessings :)

She somehow is inspired to individually touch each woman.  Lots of this inspiration came prior to meeting us.  I was blown away at how personal the package she put together for each individual was.

I gave so much to this place and they took my respect and defecate on it! Go somewhere else! The pagan path is not full of bullies like these people
Temple of the Sacred Gift ATC	189546	1	/users/profile/247427	Sonya H.	Board Member	5	11/29/2013	I am sadly grieved that three people who resigned from the Temple of their own free will; who openly stated at the members meeting they would support and cheer the Temple on; have changed their tune.  2011 is about the year they were all with the organization; and they left to join the only other Pagan church in town (except in the case of Elizabeth Mccllelan who moved to Nashville).  In 2011 we worshiped at the Miller's personal house; and all moneys raised by the Temple went to rent in 2012 a small space.  In 2013 the Temple moved to a much larger space; and none of these people were on board to do this, they did not lay carpet, they did not paint, they did not put in ceiling tiles, they did not fix the plumbing, or buy sinks or toilets, or paint the parking lots for parking or even donate a dollar to that cause.  I guess this is why they feel, we ask too much of our "clergy and inner circle".  We expect the Clergy to serve the people; not the people to work for the Clergy.   We hoped, with them joining the only other Pagan church in Memphis that they would find happiness there; and whatever meat it was they needed spiritually to become fulfilled and blossom. We believe at the Temple that people come for a season, reason, or a lifetime...but no matter what we love them all.   We will refuse to slander ANY church organization especially the only other one in town to make ourselves look better; or to hurt them or their congregation in any way.  We pray that people who read these three people's review will realize that two of the three hold positions of authority at the competitors church and are slandering the only other organization in town to look better.  You cannot dim others lights by slander, it is only through sharing you own. Virginia, Allison, and Elizabeth I pray  you quickly find the peace, love and happiness on your spiritual path there are Summerland Grove.
Temple of the Sacred Gift ATC	176452	5	/users/profile/232868	Elizabeth122	General Member of the Public	1	10/10/2013	I left Temple of the Sacred Gift when they "accepted the resignation of" (read: fired - no resignation was ever submitted)  two clergy for nothing more than disagreeing with the High Priestess, Rev. Sonya Miller.  In the four years this church has been around they have lost no less than five clergy to firings or resignations, all resulting from conflict with the HPS. I have seen her behave badly at events she is invited to, including verbal abuse of event staff and vandalism of a rented site.  She has also given grievous disrespect to community elders.   TSG expects a whopping amount of financial support from all members.  In addition to their $120/year "dues" (compared to no dues asked from members of Neshoba Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans and $25/year asked -- but, at this time, not required -- from members of Summerland Grove) TSG holds a fundraising event nearly every week.  Even those contributing their time and skills to present a workshop or energy share at these events are expected to pay for the privilege, something I have never seen from any other Pagan or Wiccan organization anywhere.   TSG is run on the "coven model" -- all final say is vested in the High Priestess.  TSG, at least during the time I was a member, tried to cover this up by having clergy councils and member representatives, all for show as their decisions could be (and were) overridden by Sonya.  This is not a healthy model for a church and not one that I support. Once I found out that I had been deceived about the locus of control, I was no longer willing to be a part.  Worryingly, the church rewrites its own history every time clergy leave or are fired: names of founders removed from the church history, long-time clergy being told they were never clergy once they quit even though evidence exists that they were previously listed as clergy on TSG sites. This behavior reminds me of another problematic church -- Scientology. The Mid-South Pagan community is vast, but you wouldn't know it from asking TSG, which likes to pretend it's the only game in town. Please, before deciding to involve yourself with this money-focused and problematic organization, research  and see what other options the community holds for you.  Find a group that will value you as more than a pocketbook and sycophant.  Don't get burned.
Temple of the Sacred Gift ATC	176420	5	/users/profile/232833	allisonhancock	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/10/2013	I was a member and clergy for Temple of the Sacred Gift for 3 years. Most of the members of this organization are truly wonderful people. The leadership, however, leaves a lot to be desired. In the 4 years the church has been open they have elevated 8 people to clergy status, now only 2 remain clergy, the married couple who started the church. The rest of clergy either left because of personal conflict with Rev Sonya Miller or were forced to resign. Members don't tend to stay around long either.  TSG expects a lot of time and money from its members, especially those in the inner circle who are the only ones allowed to lead events or have roles of responsibility within the church. Memphis has several pagan groups and churches. TSG acts as if they are the only group in town. They do not support the other groups or encourage their members to become a part of the greater community. I recommend Summerland Grove Pagan Church or the CUUPS group at Neshoba Unitarian Universalist Church. Both of these organizations encourage practitioners to make and follow their own pagan path, they lack the dogma and strict adherence to Wiccan laws found in TSG. 
Temple of the Sacred Gift ATC	176073	6	/users/profile/232460	Virginia L.	General Member of the Public	1	10/09/2013	I would not recommend this "church" to any free thinking individual. It has numerous problems with keeping clergy and members. I attended for three years and in that time they lost 4 members of clergy and numerous members because they could not follow the high priestess without questioning her or agreeing with her. I have been involved in the Memphis wiccan and pagan community for 13 years. I have never had a more disappointing experience than I did with TSG.
Temple of the Sacred Gift ATC	176069	6	/users/profile/232456	Shadar S.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/09/2013	As a Clergy and Elder of the Mid-South Pagans and over 20 years experience in teaching, leading, hosting and counseling, I can honestly say that this organization is about as two faced as you can get. They love you while you give them money or praise their High Priestess, and stab you in the back as soon as you no longer have anything they want.It is actions like these (lies about being the first Pagan/Wiccan Church in Memphis, which they were not, rewriting their founding history to hide truths about the founders, attacking other clergy of other Pagan and Wiccan organizations, and falsifying personal credentials) that I left the ATC church as an active Clergy. ATC condines the 5 year pattern of this abuse and the hate mongering of the TSG High Priestes.Approach this group with caution, and avoid if possible the 'clergy' of this church.
Temple of the Sacred Gift ATC	174089	6	/users/profile/230302	MrMagickTN	General Member of the Public	1	10/05/2013	This is the worst organization that I have ever come across. They give Pagan's everywhere a BAD name. Some of the members are nice and seem to be good people but the High Priestess is very controlling and talks bad about other Pagan's and Pagan churches in the area. Her husband the High Priests acts like a whipped puppy and lets her do spells against people, their own members and others. She acts like she knows so much but all she does is try to get more money. I would not recommend anyone going here ever!

First Ladies Inc.	273602	3	/users/profile/362857	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	12/02/2015	I was a State of TN employee for 28 years 9 months. I started fresh out of high school being 19 years old at the time I was employed. You qualify for retirement after 30 years of service.  In Nov. 2004 I transferred to a different department. I was a pretty good employee. My personnel record had always been spotless. Nothing, not one mark in my files for anything negative. Jan 2011, we got a new supervisor. My nightmare began. I started getting written up and warnings and even a 3-day suspension. Every day was a nightmare. I hated going to work. I was stressed, overwhelmed and just no longer liked my job with the State.  Then in March 14, 2013, I was terminated. I was so shocked and just in awe. I calmly got my belongings and was escorted off State property. I knew within myself I did not deserve to be fired. I really didnt know why I was being fired. As I got down the street and pulled over to read the termination letter. I thought I was in a twilight zone with those accusations that I just did not do. Some things were the first of me hearing of it. Going through this time in my life was horrible. Some mornings I did not want to get out of bed. I had never been without a paycheck since I was 19 years old. The first time in my life I qualified for Food Stamps. I was denied unemployment because of reasons of termination. I was mentally being destroyed. Then I got in touch with a past coworker (one of the ladies of First Ladies Inc.) that knew God and how to get a prayer through.  When I told her of my troubles, she prayed for me, and encouraged me to go through this test, because it would be for Gods Glory. First Ladies Inc. encouraged me and prayed for me on many occasions. First Ladies Inc. gave me hope. I know God for myself, but sometimes you dont even know what to pray for. Life troubles can hit you so hard that you cant even think right.  But First Ladies Inc. and my Christian friends stood in the gap when I was took devastated to pray for myself. My last paycheck was April 15, 2013.  As of Aug 28th still no paycheck for me. My husband and my parents have been great but there is nothing like your own money. Having to depend on every dime I got, had to come from someone else. My husband has to carry all bills. This was such a trying time for my family.This supervisor had made his case and his paper trail so good on me that even my attorney had ask me to take a settlement. To just take a resignation and have termination removed. My attorney couldnt see the Board of Appeals overturning my termination in no way. I refused and said I was going all the way. If I took a settlement that meant I was agreeing with what this man was saying about me. I had faith that God was going to see me through this. On August 9, 2013, I had a hearing in Nashville. I was standing on God promise Matthew 18:19. I had a prayer chain from First Ladies Inc., from home all the way to Nashville, TN. So many friends, coworkers, church members and family were praying that morning. That supervisor was testifying against me and actually set there and lied in my face. I couldnt believe a person could actually purposely sit and lie on me and under oath. But to cut it shorter, I won my case. I was reinstated and awarded back pay.  Only God could have worked this out for me. The enemy had made his paper trail, and his entourage was also there on his behalf. Thank God for family, friends, and the ladies of First Ladies Inc.

I am a young lady that was in the church and just had experienced what I thought to be the end of my life. My church was closing down and I didn't have anywhere else to go.  This church was the only church I had ever attended. I had fallen into a state of depression, not wanting to go to church at all, not trusting people in the church. I felt like the church had deserted me by closing down, and by not showing any concern as to where I would attend church after closure.  So I contacted First Ladies Inc., and was encourage not to give up on God  because he is in me and not in a building. I prayed and asked God to help me find another church just as good as the first one. And God did!  I am very happy at my new church. Submitted By: Sister Didnt Give Up On God

Im learning to trust God, pray for my children and obey Gods word.  Although I am still struggling, God has blessed me with a part time job and a place to stay of my own.

It was the hardest thing I ever had to deal with.  First Ladies, Inc. was there for me every step of the way.  They came every day and ministered to me and prayed for me. I was fading fast.  My color was getting darker, my hair was falling out, I was losing weight and I was getting weaker and weaker. But First Ladies, Inc. would not let me give up or be alone or speak negatively. They kept telling me that "I shall live and not die" and "Jesus is a healer" until I begin to say it and believe it for myself.  When I caught on to the faith that they were teaching me about, I began to stop feeling sorry for myself and started feeling stronger. I started gaining my weight back, my color returned and my hair began to grow back.  Today my count is just like a normal person and the doctors say I'm in remission, but I know that I am HEALED.

Saving Case & Friends Inc	250786	1	/users/profile/338677	cherrstrom	Donor	5	07/31/2015	Hunter Syndrome is deadly.  It is a terrible disease that primarily affects boys, and sometimes entire families and generations of boys who if they are lucky become men.  Saving Case & Friends are our band of brothers.  This Nonprofit tirelessly supports our families, and continuously driving to save these kids through new treatments, research and scientific innovation.  Saving Case & Friends makes a difference in the lives of Hunter Syndrome patients every day by celebrating triumphs, supporting in times of disappointment, setbacks or grief, and in an even greater way by driving for change demonstrating that every boy's life has meaning and their lives are worth saving, and that they deserve the right to grow up and be something through all this adversity.  Thank you Saving Case, thank you!

Saving Case & Friends Inc	250291	2	/users/profile/338128	Geraldine R.	General Member of the Public	5	07/28/2015	saving case...what can I say about this chairty that can make you stop and take a look? It has, in my opinion, not only raised vital awareness for hunter syndrome but it has given the 2000 families worldwide; hope. It has shown me, personally,  that I am not alone. At the end of an Internet connection case and so many other boys are alive and fighting everyday just like my son. The awareness alone on 'Project Alive' has had and is currently have huge success....I live in Ireland, the Irish are getting involved! Melissa, Case's mom, the founder of this chairty; isn't a superhero,  she isn't any different from you or I-but, she has a mission within herself and it's not just for Case; it's for all our boys. I do wish I lived closer to help Melissa but to be honest I think she's doing a darn good job with the team she has.Melissa is every mom; every mom who's watching thier child die slowly before thier very eyes...she's a force to be reckoned with and without her and her drive there would be no Project Alive or Saving Case...which means for me; there would be no hope, no support. Saving Case is far more than a chairty...it is a community, a beacon of hope for families like Cases all over the world.Please I beg you help support us .

Like any parent terrified for their childs future I took to Google to see what I could learn. I found Saving Case and Friends, and was amazed at all of the information about this horrible disease, and the care that only another parent suffering with their child through this devastating disease could present. We are a small community due to the rarity of this disease, but Saving Case and Friends has managed to bring a lot of families together to try to save our boys.

When our son was first diagnosed with Hunter Syndrome we relied on the people at Saving Case & Friends for critical advice about treatment options, specialty care, and doctors versed in this disease. We also recieved tremendous emotional support as we coped with this devastating diagnosis for our son. Since then, Saving Case & Friends has been a great reseource for the latest medical research, healthcare indsutry news, and regulatory develoments. The group also does an amazing job driving advocacy for Hunter Syndrome. Saving Case & Frinds is truly an outstanding organization. 
Speedway Angels	322932		/users/profile/417034	Colton E.,	Client Served	5	02/09/2017	I was taken to a NASCAR Race in July 2015, and it was great. I got to meet drivers like Ben Rhodes and Kyle Petty. I also got to go into the infield and participate in activities they had there, like some games and rides. we also got great seats. We also got to drive around the stadium and look around, and got to drive inside the infield (which isn't always allowed). Going to a race with Asphalt Angels opens up a lot of doors that you wouldn't experience otherwise. I went back to Kentucky with my family in July 2016, and I got to speak with Ben Rhodes again, and he remembered me from the year before, so it is a great feeling to make that kind of connection with a driver, or really any athlete of one of your favorite sports. I recommend Asphalt Angels to anyone with a kid who may not get to experience this kind of thing otherwise.

If you have a child with special needs get them entered for one of the events at a track near you. If your one of the more fortunate this an honest to goodness cause to donate to.

Visible Music College	98710	1	/users/profile/55072	073110	Client Served	4	09/30/2011	I am a second year student at Visible Music College, and this year is even better than the first! The staff is so knowledgeable and friendly and caring, and it's great that we are in a new location in downtown Memphis. One thing I love about VMC is that, spiritually speaking, I am taught how to study and search and things like the theology of worship is taught and is correct, without the burden of different denominational rules. Truth is truth and that's all there is. The staff is also extremely talented at their craft; you won't find the same quality of staff anywhere else; from the teachers to receptionists to admissions counselors, this school provides a great atmosphere for learning and growing and helps you when you're struggling. It's amazing! 
Visible Music College	53913		/users/profile/55072	073110	Client Served	5	09/29/2010	I am currently a student in my first year at Visible School. I came from a city and college where I was just another name on a page. Here, I am more than that. The staff consists of the most amazing people I have ever met in one group. Every single one is very personable, personal, and transparent. They go out of their way to help us succeed, and they are great to be around. It amazed me how much time they took to see what my style and personality type was, and fit me in classes with professors that are in the same category. I was and am really impressed with Visible School's attention to detail and community vision. It has fully exceeded my expectations.
Visible Music College	56019		/users/profile/58298	student1	Client Served	5	10/30/2010	I am currently a second year worship leading student at Visible School. Visible is a very unique college that I don't believe any other college could be like. They specifically assign certain classes according to our learning type and personality which has seemed to be very beneficial so far. Honestly without Visible, I don't know if I ever could survive a typical college. The way the teachers and staff get on a personal level with the students is amazing. It would actually be quite an odd thing for a teacher or staff member to not know every student and vice verse, it's that close of a community. I also, love the fact that Visible is not just about academics and really not even just the school community growing together but to take all of that and spread it out to the Memphis community and beyond. Each student here, when they graduate either stays around in the community or goes elsewhere. Either way, they carry on what they have learned and pass it on to a lost and hurting world!So if you are a musician with a call in the ministry, check out Visible School! It may seem too good to be true at first, but it's really just the fact that we have a great God who cares about us to give us such an amazing place to grow. 
Visible Music College	53759		/users/profile/54907	ben7	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2010	I am an instructor at Visible School, and there is no other place I would rather be. The genuine humility and constant displays of servant leadership throughout the entire community find their source not only in the Lord but also directly from the top of the institution, the President of Visible School Ken Steorts. I have seen Ken tirelessly work - early morning after early morning - to provide the staff, the faculty, and most importantly the students of Visible School with the support they each need. As a faculty member, I have every opportunity to bring my concerns, my needs, and my prayer requests to the staff body and even Ken himself. I've never been in this kind of work environment; it is truly a blessing.Also, as an insider seeing the workings of this community, I can say emphatically that the wisdom, mercy, and love of God rest greatly upon the men and women that make Visible School happen. From meetings with prospective students and reviews of applications to senior recitals and graduation blessings, every student at Visible School is covered in prayer. And our heart is to see the city of Memphis and the world changed through God's healing power to His glory. That is why we specifically schedule outreach opportunities in shelters and schools, free public concerts, and other community events where staff and student work alongside one another doing His work and building His kingdom.I am blessed to be a part of Visible School, where I work, learn, and grow with the kingdom-minded, Christ-centered people that make the vision of a new generation of true worshipers totally sold out to Jesus a reality.
Visible Music College	53539		/users/profile/54680	andrew15	Client Served	5	09/27/2010	I am a student enrolled in my first year of the three-year program at Visible Music And Worship Arts College. I have only been here for a matter of weeks, and already feel like I am already at home. After attending a very impersonal community college back in my home state of Indiana for two years, I feel like I entered into a whole new world in coming to Visible. The staff here is incredible. They are beyond great at what they do, but they are also relational with us as students. Many of them are working on Masters and Doctorate degrees outside of being a full-time employee here, and yet they still find time to talk/listen to the students. I find myself considering the coolest people at Visible to be the staff and instructors.The student body is great. There are some students that are from around town (Memphis), but most are from out of town, literally coming from coast to coast. This provides a very diverse environment, even with the number of students just barely breaking one hundred people!Coming to Visible was the first time I was living in an area other than my hometown. This was hard for me because I was leaving behind everything I had known of more than twenty years. I was nervous that I would be away from everything I've ever known and walk into this new environment and not feel at home or welcome at all. But the more time I am here, the more comfortable I am. In a nutshell - I can't wait to spend the next three years as a Visible student.
Visible Music College	53510	1	/users/profile/54658	robert23	Client Served	5	09/27/2010	I heard about Visible School through a friend who taught me how to play guitar. Visible School had been in the back of my mind since then (I think that was 9th grade), but my parents insisted that I attend a traditional 4 year school; Visible School only offered a 9-month certificate at the time. Thankfully, our paths crossed later on when I discovered that the college I had been attending had an arrangement with Visible School, where their certificate program could satisfy my degree's minor studies requirement.In the months leading up to my first day at Visible School, I kept meeting Visible School students and staff members throughout the city. They all had a sincere and fun-loving spirit about them. I had considered other post-high school ministry training programs, but none of them exuded this sort of welcoming and hospitable spirit. It is hard to explain. The closest instance of this I can recall was when a friend I met at the first college (who, ironically, had gone to Visible School the year before) was showing me around Visible School's Lakeland campus. A student, who was carrying around a bag of chips, offered me some of his snacks. I know it sounds cheesy, but it was the random kind-spirited interactions with Visible School people that stood out to me. The other ministry programs were nice, but I didn't sense the same sort of transformation in their people. I knew this was where I wanted to be. My experience only got better once I became a student. Though I was only there to complete a certificate in music, I was drawn to their ministry and biblical studies courses and stayed two more years to complete a Bachelors of Ministry in Ministry Praxis (Visible School had completed the necessary requirements to offer a Bachelors degree in addition to their certificate while I was a student). I was a Biblical Studies major at my previous college--and I went back to complete that degree as well--but I found that the content, quality, and rigor of the instruction in Visible School's Ministry Praxis program was significantly better. In practical terms, I wholly attribute my success in graduate education to the time spent at Visible School.Over the course of time spent at Visible School, one theme that has constantly emerged was improvement. Visible School continues to improve its programs, faculty, and facilities. Programs have been improved through increased academic support from the Director of Academic Development to the leadership in each department to the faculty's commitment to the college's mission. Faculty have been improved as the majority of them have pursued further education to better serve the college's mission. Facilities have improved dramatically from the humble beginnings in Lakeland, TN; to the temporary location in midtown Memphis; to the future home in the iconic triangle building in downtown Memphis.

I can testify that they are totally committed to a great academic education with a totally authentic hands on experience, wrapped in a Christ-centered community experience. With full accreditation in hand and a new campus 8 months away, they are poised to be the leader in contemporary music, audio and business eduction for the near future.
Visible Music College	53469	1	/users/profile/54611	shannon9	Client Served	5	09/27/2010	When I came to Visible School, I had been completely broken by the traditional music education system and had actually quit music altogether.  I came to this school because I had timidly begun to lead worship again and wanted to go much deeper into theology and contemporary (as opposed to traditional) music and theory.  What I learned was to serve and be healed and free; many students have this type of experience of God moving powerfully through the staff and faculty of Visible School.  It's a great place to be real and to grow in the gifts God has given you.

The three years that I spent as a student of VS were life changing. As I was discipled, instructed and loved by the students and faculty I grew into confidence of who I was called to be. There is truly nothing like have the support and friendship of your professors, standing behind you every step of the way. I never felt like a number or just passing through. The community is unlike anything I have ever seen and inspired me to take that with me to whatever church or ministry the Lord calls me to.
Visible Music College	51665	3	/users/profile/52384	visiken	Board Member	5	09/03/2010	Visible School is a unique college that is based upon relationship and a decisively community based academic and spiritual environment. Young musicians who plan to use their talents for ministry or in mainstream music find an artistic community that supports their academic achievement through mentoring, their professional development in one of the great music cities of the world, and a truly accepting Christian community for long term life success in their field.

A young lady in Knoxville, herself a learning challenged young adult wants to improve her writing. Though that isn't often a component of VSA Arts Tennessee, Lori thoughtfully directed the gal to other sources in a detailed email. Leadership like that brings out the best in Lori's supporters, as well. Being a professor at Middle Tennessee State University, she teaches her students about community projects. All the while, her students take part and volunteer at the various workshops and events. What a winning combination! When a children are given a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder there can be feelings of isolation for the parents. But the non-profit makes quite an effort to reach communities throughout Tennessee. Additionally, VSA's link to the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center smooths the information routes, making the VKC research readily available to remote areas as well as urban ones.

Nashville Film Festival	28019	8	/users/profile/29086	moviegal	Volunteer	5	02/11/2010	I attend several film festivals each year (including huge fests such as Toronto) and the Nashville Film Festival is still my all-time favorite. The enthusiasm of the audience is contagious and the hospitality of the staff is terrific! There seems to be nearly the perfect balance of film-buff-to-film-industry people in attendance, the venue is comfortable, the films are very thoughtfully chosen, and it seems as though there's always a party or musical event going on. In fact, the music connection is one of the things that sets this festival apart from many others.I also love that NaFF has year-round activities for its members and does outreach in the community. All in all, a terrific festival!

The vibe is fabulous; low-key and friendly, with lots of film people and workshops in an accessible and nice location.  The people that work at the festival are top  notch.  I think that the quality of the festival FAR exceeds what anyone could expect from a city this size.

For those who have been Nashvillians for that long, it will be easy to understand how a movie lover might deeply appreciate the work of the Film Festival. I look forward each year to enjoying works by filmmakers whose distribution is limited or is not yet in place, and films which I missed in years gone by. As a singer/songwriter, I especially appreciate the exposure to movies about music and musicians. The staff have always been helpful when I've needed assistance. Opportunities to preview films throughout the year are another welcome feature of membership.

I knew this was a special festival when I saw the care that went into selecting the films.  I chose to stay involved with this festival from that point forward.  I had a film in the festival, was on the board and then became board president.  So I have seen it from many different perspectives.  I have been to numerous festivals and this one is awesome.  The filmmaker experience is fabulous and the outreach to the community is tremendous.  A+ in my book. I am also a professor of film and this festival has benefited my students by providing excellent workshops.

The quality of films offered year-round (especially at the annual Festival) are great and everyone involved in the group is an enthusiast and champion of the work they're doing and the films they offer.  A long-term advocate of the arts, e.g., sitting on arts boards, my experience with NaFF is always positive.  I only wish that I had the stamina to sit through the Festival films from mid-morning through late-night.
Nashville Film Festival	27553	1	/users/profile/28637	cbee	Volunteer	5	02/10/2010	The Nashville Film Festival is not only one of the most fun weeks of my year, but my monthly contact with the staff is one of my most cherish friendships! I was lucky enough to get an internship with the festival last Spring. I spent at least 3 days a week in the office and numerous hours at other events, I couldn't get enough. Not only is the staff amazing, but all the patrons, volunteers and attendees are great people. I am so fortunate to have had that experience and continued opportunities to meet so many people through the festival. Everyday I  get to keep working with the festival is welcomed with open arms!
Nashville Film Festival	27517	5	/users/profile/28600	kbird	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2010	The film festival rocks! We look forward to it every year and put it on the calendar a year in advance, buy an all-festival passes, and block out the week. Not unusual to view 20-25 films. This year our daughter is flying in from Chicago just to attend the "festie" for the weekend.
Nashville Film Festival	27491	4	/users/profile/28577	jane1	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2010	Having spent a couple of decades in Los Angeles I can appreciate the evolution of the Nashville Film Festival and it's growing impact on the community at large.  My Mom actually vounteered in the early years when our festival was known as Sinking Creek, thank you Mary Jane. I crave documentaries but enjoy all genres. 100% of my experiences with NAFF this past 16 years have been positive - from renewing my membership, to attending special screenings, to purchasing tickets online, to attending the festival...I could go on. Suffice it to say, I am a huge fan.
Nashville Film Festival	27471	6	/users/profile/28561	onasylum	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/09/2010	Nashville Film Festival provides one of the best venues to enjoy the full spectrum of film.  It has something for everyone (from the film lover to the film pro) and is an incredible industry forum.  Well organized, screenings are on time.  The staff is great.
Nashville Film Festival	27463	6	/users/profile/28554	ccharisma	Volunteer	5	02/09/2010	I have a had a great time every year I have worked for the Nashville Film Festival. It started with volunteering a few years ago, and then I was an intern in 2008. And I have always come back and helped anytime they needed me, especially a couple of months before the festival itself.Everyone there is nice and they love what they do. The Nashville Film Festival has been great and it keeps getting better.I can't wait until April when it happens all over again!
Nashville Film Festival	27457	6	/users/profile/28547	archervideos	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/09/2010	For the past four years I have had the honor of being the editor of the Nashville Film Festival's "At Risk" Youth Documentary.  Through this process I have seen the world change through the eyes of numerous teens that were given a chance.  A chance by the Nashville Film Festival to better themselves through film.  They expressed their creativity and were able to become a part of something bigger than they had ever experienced.  The amount of volunteering that goes into this project is astronomical and should be duplicated in every city in America!  Thank you to the Nashville Film Festival for being such a memorable organization and allowing me to be part of such a life changing project for these kids.
Project Return, Inc.	132429	2	/users/profile/178066	Willa V.	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	I volunteered full time at Project Return for a year.

I know with absolute certainty my life perspective was changed by seeing the resiliency all our clients possess.

Project Return, Inc.	131079		/users/profile/176617	jhowley	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I've volunteered with Project Return for about 4 months and have had an excellent experience. The staff are dedicated to providing high quality services to clients and really value the input and work of volunteers. I would highly recommend Project Return to eligible clients and volunteers looking to meaningfully engage with their community in important and often ignored work. 
Project Return, Inc.	129843		/users/profile/175269	dpgeorge	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2012	Nonprofits exist for the public good, and as the author and management expert Peter Drcuker asserted, "the bottom line for social sector organizations is changed lives"  Project Return is a standout as an organization whose work contributes directly to the public good and who achieves that critical bottom line of lives changed for the positive.  Project Return's impact is humanistic, they work with everyone who comes to them with such respect as they provide practical services that lead to real results.  Their impact is also economic, the people who Project Return supports are able to return to their communities as contributors through the employment Project Return helps them gain.  I have the privilege of working with many wonderful nonprofits who do good work in the world, there are some who do GREAT work in the world and Project Return is one of them.
Project Return, Inc.	129489		/users/profile/174854	PRIFan1	Board Member	5	10/26/2012	I am the Board President and have served as a volunteer board member for Project Return since 2004.  I was drawn to this agency due to its commitment to improving the lives of offenders returning to the community after incarceration.  I have worked with offenders since 1978 and this is the first agency I have found that the mission of the agency matches the passion of the staff to provide opportunities for offender success.  Offender success means fewer victims, lower incarceration rates, and money saved that can be used to help others in need.
Project Return, Inc.	129003		/users/profile/174324	Cturks	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2012	As a professional in the field of corrections I rely heavily on the services Project Return offers to the individuals leaving our facility.  The staff is always professional and willing to do whatever we request.  Their service is not limited to providing services at Project Return they also come to the facility and establish relationships with the individual prior to their release.  This non-profit is a valuable to the goals we are trying to accomplish.

Advance Memphis	26662	7	/users/profile/27674	pressurized8	Volunteer	5	01/30/2010	Advance Memphis is staffed with people who care about the neighborhood near downtown Memphis.  Residents in the community are eager to partner with Advance Memphis because they are exciting about the opportunities for jobs, soft skills development and spiritual growth that Advance offers.
Advance Memphis	26657	6	/users/profile/27669	nick	Board Member	5	01/30/2010	Advance Memphis is a wonderful ministry. Steve Nash and his staff have made a huge difference for the city of Memphis. They are changing lives with their financial literacy programs and job training classes. It has been a pleasure to get to know Steve and his fellow workers. I can't say enough good things about Advance!!!!!!
Advance Memphis	26642	4	/users/profile/27651	Meg	Board Member	5	01/30/2010	AdVance Memphis is a success story. Through the efforts and strong commitment of Steve Nash and his amazing and dedicated staff, AdVance Memphis is putting people in poverty to work and on the road to financial freedom. By focusing on the people in one neighborhood and their individual journeys, AdVance has achieved success that few economic development agencies can match. They have worked hard to get to know the neighbors and the neighborhood and their reputation there sets them apart. I cannot say enough good things about this amazing organization.
Advance Memphis	26164	5	/users/profile/27207	mitchellm	Volunteer	5	01/25/2010	I have seen and experienced the Kingdom of God advancing through Advance Memphis. As Advance seeks to restore dignity to men and women created in the image of God by training them in their Jobs for Life program, leading them in Bible Studies, sending them to work, or just being with them in their neighborhood they allow people like me to get caught up in what the Lord is doing through them. It is an honor and a privilege to be a part of what the Lord is doing through Advance Memphis as he brings his Kingdom to bear in this city.
Advance Memphis	25934	5	/users/profile/26941	nikaya	Volunteer	5	01/20/2010	I first learned about Advance Memphis threw the career center back in 2007.

I love the place so much that I got envolved with the classes that they have to offer. I graduated from thier Jobs for Life class with honors. I recieve G.E.D training from them wich helped me get my High School Diploma after being out of school for 9 years,and I reccomend people everywhere that I go to go and be apart of everything that Advance Memphis has to offer, they've been good to me and I love to give back. Good luck to Advance Memphis and Thanks...
Advance Memphis	25783	4	/users/profile/26785	rhodes1985	Former staff	5	01/18/2010	Advance Memphis provides a holistic, community-based resource center for low-income adults in the heart of inner-city Memphis. Because Advance puts personal relationships and a long term commitment to a single local community at the forefront of their ministry, clients from the most difficult demographics in terms of employment have found real success in their careers and in their financial lives. Advance provides top notch soft-skills job training and financial literacy classes in a small group setting, one-on-one budget counseling, computer classes, job referral services, Individual Development Accounts, and free pscyhological counseling. Graduates of Advance's program are proud to be a part of the work, and consistently return to volunteer and even to use their new found employment to help others from the neighborhood. Several graduates have gone on to become employees at Advance. As a former staff member, I saw single mothers and young ex-felons who had been to numerous large government funded welfare-to-work programs with little to no success find the relationships, the education, and the long term encouragement they needed to find and keep jobs.
Advance Memphis	25778	4	/users/profile/26781	danb1155	Board Member	5	01/18/2010	Advance Memphis is an established non-profit whose entire staff is devoted to advancing the kingdom one relationship at a time within the community. It is amazing to see the lives touched by Advance Memphis.  Not only are lives touched within the community but also those that volunteer to serve with Advance. The building of relationships with the people of the community has really begun to transform the community as they seek hope and purpose for their lives. It has been amazing to see and hear different people within the community tell their story of how their lives have been changed by something/someone from Advance. I'm excited to be a part of a program that stays focused on serving others and fostering relationships that mean something.
Advance Memphis	25777	11	/users/profile/26777	Tim Yagel	Former staff	5	01/18/2010	This past summer (of 2009), I spent three months working at Advance Memphis developing the GED program. Through this experience I got to observe the organization very closely. Perhaps one of the most noticeable and profound characteristics of Advance Memphis is it's love for the community and individuals in it. The programs that it offers are also very solid. It would be a difficult task to find an organization that loves any neighborhood (on organizational and/or personal levels) more than Advance Memphis loves the 38126 neighborhood and the people in it.
Advance Memphis	25705	11	/users/profile/26718	Stuart	Board Member	5	01/15/2010	When I got involved at Advance Memphis several years ago, I naively believed that I would have a lot to offer the organization. On the contrary, the organization ended up teaching me and offering me so much. The staff and participants have done wonders to change my perspective about injustice and how to love and serve our under-resourced brothers and sisters. In my opinion, the greatest thing about Advance is the high standards that are set by the staff and the example that they are for the participants. The result has been a culture of excellence. Everything they do, they do thoroughly and do it well. There needs to be more groups like Advance, chipping away at systemic poverty - one relationship at a time. Best of all, everything they do is through the grid of a Gospel worldview.
Advance Memphis	25696	4	/users/profile/26710	mike	Former staff	5	01/15/2010	I have worked with several nonprofits in my career, and Advance Memphis has far and away done the best job of actively seeking out community members and fostering deep relationships between staff, volunteers, and the community it is a part of. Advance does a masterful job of connecting its clients to excellent resources and people that truly bring change to the whole person, far surpassing its mission to provide the knowledge and skills to find work and save money. With a curriculum firmly rooted in the truth of the Bible and the good news of Jesus Christ, Advance is committed to lasting and holistic change.Furthermore, I am impressed with Advance's dedication to provide the community it serves with the best possible services. The organization is continually reviewing best practices and actively listening to the community it loves for input and direction.I have witnessed Advance change the lives of countless clients, staff, and volunteers and would encourage anyone to be a part of what the Lord is doing through Advance.
Advance Memphis	25686	4	/users/profile/26704	Cindy	Client Served	5	01/15/2010	As a result from being a rebellious teenager, I became an alcoholic/addict with a criminal record. I came to a point in my life where I just didn't want to live anymore. I eventually fell to my knees and asked God for forgiveness and guidance. After completing a drug/alcohol treatment program, I was faced with discouragement when I began searching for employment. Not having any skills, along with having a criminal background, I was getting nowhere fast. I was referred to Advance Memphis and the Jobs for Life/Financial Freedom program. I learned basic computer skills to produce my resume and find job leads through net-working and the internet posting boards. I went through mock interviews and was taught how to develop a spending plan. Throughout the program, I was inspired and encouraged to seek a closer relationship with God. I now have a job that I love and have the chance to practice my new ability to be a good steward with the income that I have been blessed with. I have also learned to not search for happiness, to search for right living and happiness will be my reward.  I thank Advance Memphis, the employees and all of the volunteers.
Women's Care Center of Sevier County TN	94404		/users/profile/109157	Dawn P.	Board Member	5	07/26/2011	I served on the Women's Care Center Board for three years after my life's schedule changed where I was unable to volunteer anymore.  This ministry is so giving to our community.  The volunteers and board members are dedicated to helping others and changing lives.  As a volunteer, it was wonderful to see expectant mothers come in and learn how to take care of their babies and take care of themselves while they were carrying their baby.  Ladies of all ages can come in without any chance of being judged for whatever may be going on in their life at the time but instead, have the opportunity to talk with someone who genuinely cares for them at desires to help them through what their trial may be by helping them make wise choices for them and their future.  This center is a MUST for our community.
Women's Care Center of Sevier County TN	94151		/users/profile/108758	concerned	Donor	4	07/21/2011	I am very glad that the Center is in our community and am proud of the work they have done to prevent abortion and help families and individuals.  The only negative I would mention would be the lack of leadership at the Board level.  There seems to be little vision and from what I have heard for several years, there is disention among the members, which keeps the Center from growing and fulfilling it's true purpose.  But the employees and volunteers continue to do a good job from my perspective as a donor.

We can help you with emergency items such as pregnancy test, infant formula, diapers, infant furniture and so many other things. We are the only organization in the Sevier County area that offers these services along with classes, and many other items free of charge. This is such a need in today's economic climate.

Volunteer	5	07/18/2011	I volunteer at the Center once a week and feel like I am doing an important part toward sharing the love of Christ Jesus with some that would otherwise not necessarily see that love or hear about it.  Some may need to know if they are pregnant, some need food, diapers or clothes for their children or their grandchildren or other relative they are now taking care of.  Sometimes they need to know how to take care of themselves or their children and we can help through our parenting classes or sexual integrity classes.  And sometimes all they need is someone to talk to or just to listen to them and we can do that by just being there.

Happy Endings Animal Rescue	297306	6	/users/profile/388089	DonorsBEWARE	Advisor	1	07/20/2016	Over 40 dogs taken from animal rescue group in Madison; Owner chargedMADISON, Tenn. (WKRN)  More than 40 dogs were removed from an animal rescue group Tuesday and are now being taken to a temporary shelter where they will receive medical care.The dogs were taken from Happy Endings Animal Rescue (HEAR), after police executed a warrant earlier in the day for the removal of the dogs.According to a release from American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the seizure is the result of numerous public complaints about conditions at HEAR, which has been operating for 19 years.David Gosselin (Courtesy: Metro Nashville Police Department)David Gosselin, the owner and operator of the rescue, is charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty.According to a Metro affidavit, Gosselin has been subject to numerous contacts with Metro Animal Control based on complaints dating back to 2009. Some of the complaints allege he routinely failed to provide basic shelter, food, water, and veterinary care to the dogs he keeps on his property.Gosselin has been cited for companion animal hoarding as recently as 2014 by Metro Animal Control.On May 9, MACC officers were called to Gosselins property in response to accusations of a large number of dogs living in deplorable conditions.When they arrived, officers found four dogs in the front yard that appeared underweight and with hair loss.Officers also visited the property as recently as Sunday and on May 23 and June 24.ASPCA and Metro Animal Care assisted in the removal of the dogs Tuesday.The rescued dogs include Chow, pit bull, shepherd mixes and other medium to large breed canines.We are glad to have the expertise and experience that the ASPCA brings to this case, said Rebecca Morris spokesperson for Metro Animal Care and Control. We are pleased that the animals will be receiving the necessary medical care and attention they deserve.The dogs are being held at a temporary location where they will receive medical care.

HEAR has been operating for 19 years and the ASPCA says the seizure comes in the wake of "numerous public complaints."According to ASPCA, the dogs were found living in feces and filth inside and overcrowded house and outdoor kennels. One room alone held 22 dogs with feces covering the floor. Some did not have access to food or water, others were suffering from medical issues and some were not spayed or neutered.ASPCA Investigations Director Kathryn Destreza stated This facility claimed to be a safe place for animals, but the truth is these dogs were suffering greatly, both physically and mentally."The dogs seized were Chow, Pit Bull, Shepherd mixes and other medium to large breeds. They will be taken to a temporary shelter to receive medical treatment.
Happy Endings Animal Rescue	251184	5	/users/profile/339094	ChristineBanks	Volunteer	5	08/02/2015	I have volunteered at this Rescue and met Cody, he has a compassion towards the dogs he cares for.  They all get plenty of food and water and play time.  When I see negative write-ups about his organization I asked him about it.  He says that when people don't qualify to adopt a dog because their fence doesn't meet their qualifications, some people lash out with negative responses and try to destroy our reputation.  People just have to meet Cody and see the dogs and make your own judgement.  For me, his Rescue is one of the top Animal Rescues in Nashville.
Happy Endings Animal Rescue	166329	3	/users/profile/175901	C.C.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/27/2013	Cody has the utmost respect for his dogs and is very careful who he adopts to. The 'Bad" reports he gets come from mostly "would be" adopters who have not met the criteria to be eligible to adopt one of his dogs. He is not unreasonable in his criteria and will not except less, which is why I support this rescue. His dogs are loved and well cared for, even if times are tough and he goes hungry himself.

Kore Foundation Inc	142990		/users/profile/189416	artemus1969	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	Kore Foundation taught me how to put focus to my idea of service by allowing me to participate in the chicken coop mission.  This mission is biblical in that it teaches both the Haitian people and the volunteers what it's like to put Christ's love in action.  You Lear what it really is like to teach a man to fish rather than give them a fish. This ministry allows the Haitian people to step out of poverty by teaching them life skills of running their own business that allows them to provide for their family and their future. They do this all while teaching and living God's will.
Kore Foundation Inc	141800		/users/profile/188188	fishministrieshaiti	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	KORE is an AWESOME Christian organization that strives to help the poorest of the poor in Haiti. KORE gives hope and oppurtunities to a place and people that often struggle day to day to meet the most basic of needs. Their motto is a hand up not a hand out. The enormous challenges that this country faces make it absolutely necessary to provide SUSTAINABLE solutions to the extreme poverty there. Please check out their website to learn how you can help to make a lasting difference!!!
Kore Foundation Inc	141780		/users/profile/188164	bament	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	KORE strives to provide impoverished families and individuals with an opportunity to improve their quality of life through building their own business.  KORE embraces the concept of sustainability by providing "a way out, not just a hand out".  Through strategic partnerships with Fish Ministries and other mission groups throughout Haiti, they have made great strides in the fight against hunger and poverty.  I believe they are changing the way mission work is done.     
Kore Foundation Inc	141778	1	/users/profile/188161	carternd03	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	KORE Foundation is a wonderful organization helping many people in Haiti.  Through its efforts many Haitian families now have their own small poultry businesses to help support their families, churches, and communities.  This sustainable solution will help these families and communities become self sufficient and no longer rely on outside support.  It's great to give a hand up instead of a handout.
Kore Foundation Inc	141562		/users/profile/187917	Randyh	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	Kore foundation exists to help impoverished individuals find a sustainable solution to chronic poverty. Every effort is made to provide ongoing support for the people who are helped. Kore has developed strategic partnerships with other ministries serving in Haiti in order to effectively deliver a hand up to individuals who are seeking opportunity to better their lives and not be dependent on others for their sustenance. Their micro-loan approach gives individuals in Haiti the means to start their own business and achieve the dignity that comes from financial independence.

Kore Foundation Inc	141351		/users/profile/187647	Gtm44	Board Member	5	11/19/2012	KORE seeks to help Haitians to build a life for themselves and their families not by just giving them a handout but by helping them to support themselves. KORE is seeking, through the coloration with Fish Ministry and Christianville, to equip the people to make a better life for themselves to impact the people around them.
Kore Foundation Inc	141329		/users/profile/187623	mstein005	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	Kore is an organization that gives hope to those who need a hand up not a handout.  The work being done in Haiti is groundbreaking.  Partnering with Fish Haiti Ministries, Kore allows the people of Haiti to provide for their families and prosper by being responsible for their own livlihood.  We have built several chicken coops and now the recipients of the coops will have their own businesses.  Kore & Fish have everything figured to the ounce, from feed to the amount of protein a child need daily to develope.  Visiting Christianville is a high point of the trip that will leave you amazed.  The people of Haiti are kind and gracious, I am humbled and grateful for the oportunity God has given me to serve with this outstanding organization for His glory.
Kore Foundation Inc	141326		/users/profile/187618	jrobin18	Donor	5	11/19/2012	The underlying principals of the Kore Foundation just make sense.  Provide people with a way to sustain themselves rather than only meeting their immediate needs.  And the fact that KORE can teach people to manage a small business and then purchase a portion of their product to feed hungry children is an added bonus.  God is truly working in this ministry to save and improve Earthly lives, but also to protect the eternal lives of God's children.
Kore Foundation Inc	141310		/users/profile/187601	Carolyn39	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	KORE is a fantastic organization that is putting God's word in motion.  Not only are they helping to feed the children of Haiti, they are helping families to become self-sustaining by teaching them how to raise chickens .  This foundation is definitely making a difference.
Kore Foundation Inc	141308		/users/profile/187599	dfarber	Donor	5	11/19/2012	My wife and I donate monthly to KORE Foundation.   For $6.25, a child is given animal protein to supplement their rice and beans diet to improve their physical and cognitive development.  We are able to feed several kids each month and have been to Haiti and seen the program working.  KORE also provides opportunities to Haitian families by helping them start their own small holder poultry business (chicken coop).  They truly go Beyond Relief!!!
Wolf Paws Inc	301641		/users/profile/392619	Azabeth L.	Volunteer	5	08/27/2016	It would be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to find a sanctuary in which the director and the staff care more about the physical, emotional and mental well-being of the animals in their care. Jennifer, the director of Wolf PAWS Inc. Positive Awareness Wolf-dog Sanctuary, is full of both passion and compassion for these creatures and that is evident in how she runs Wolf PAWS. As an intern I had the privilege of experiencing the amazing wolf-dogs first hand with the guidance of Jennifer. With such a laudable focus on the education of the public, of her staff and the continued education of herself the director has created a paradise where abandoned wolf-dogs can live out their days in an environment that they truly deserve.If youre on the fence about experiencing Wolf PAWS Inc. Positive Awareness Wolf-dog Sanctuary, whether it be as an intern, a volunteer, or simply for a tour, get off the fence, you wont regret it.

Wolf Paws Inc	297924		/users/profile/388748	Little F.	General Member of the Public	5	07/25/2016	What magnificent animals. If not for this beautiful sanctuary, these wolves would be gone.  This sanctuary is first class and an excellent example of how preserves/sanctuaries should be built and run. Thank you, Wolf Paws, for your amazing energy and preservence in keeping these animals in their natural environment.

Wolf Paws Inc	297635		/users/profile/388443	Tyler S.	Donor	5	07/21/2016	Wolf Paws is a very unique charity benefiting wolf-dogs in a beautiful location. The wolves are noticeably happy in their contained habitats and vary in their preferred levels of socialization with humans, with two displaying very distinctive traits of wild wolves. Our volunteer, Hannah, was very knowledgable about the wolf-dogs and very gracious to us. I strongly recommend seeing the Wolf Paws wolf-dog sanctuary as not only a unique and helpful non-profit, but also one of the most interesting sights in this part of Tennessee. 
Wolf Paws Inc	294861		/users/profile/385628	Cheif1234	Volunteer	5	07/07/2016	WolfPaws is one of the best places I've ever volunteered. To work one-on-one with Wolves is very eye-opening. Each one of the wolves has their own personality. The wolves are healthy and all have large enclosures where they can live out their lives. I highly recommend WolfPAWS for anyone that wants to learn about wolves and have experiences that will last them a lifetime.

After numerous communications with Jennifer Ackley, the administrator and person in charge,  our daughter landed an internship at WolfPAWS for summer 1995.   The people are warm, caring, and knowledgeable, the volunteers are the best and friendliest , (probably because it is in the Volunteer State of Tennessee!)   Not to mention, the facility is in a beautiful location and well worth a visit!

Wolf Paws Inc	288451		/users/profile/378648	Lee Ann M.	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2016	My Wolf Dog Experience at Wolf PawsAll of my life I have had this fascination and love of wolves. They have a special beauty to them. I have always wanted to spend time at a wolf sanctuary to be with these beautiful animals. It has been a dream of mine for a long time.I had the opportunity to visit Wolf Paws in Dandridge TN. This is a beautiful sanctuary owned and operated by Jennifer and Gordon Ackley. They rescue wolf dogs and provide a safe environment so that they may live in a comfortable setting and not be harmed by human population.Most of us are inclined to love animals, including me. But cross breeding has made it very difficult for wolf dogs to be domestically tame pets unless they are handled at a very young age. Therefore, people find that they can't care for them the proper way and can not keep them as pets. Jennifer and Gordon take them in and care for them with a lot of love and care. Visiting this sanctuary has made me realize that I need to do some research on wolf dogs and I would love to come back and volunteer some of my time to this cause. We need to be a voice for the wolf dogs. This is a non-profit organization that depends on donations to care for these animals so that they are not euthanized.I appreciated the time that Jennifer spent with us and hope to return.You may go to Wolfpaws.org to see some of the wonderful things that are being done, or to donate to Wolf Paws. There is a Facebook page that you can check out as well.Lee Ann Mason  
Wolf Paws Inc	285788		/users/profile/375818	Hannah41	Board Member	5	04/13/2016	I was the first intern at Wolf PAWS in the summer of 2015.  I had such a great time here learning to train and care for the animals. I learned so much about both domestic and wild canine behavior and so much enjoyed getting to know the resident wolf-dogs.  The director is 100% committed to the well-being of the animals at Wolf PAWS, and she continues to educate herself and the others who work there on the best care practices for the animals.  The enclosures are VERY spacious and full of enrichment.  Each enclosure has a small cabin structure for protection from the elements and a pond for cooling off in the summer.  Every animal receives regular socialization and training. The biggest moment I had working here was when Leia, the highest wolf content animal there, finally ate out of my hand.  I had worked with the director all summer helping to train and desensitize Dakota and Leia, who are very fearful of people.  It was a HUGE moment for me when, towards the end of the summer, each of them finally trusted me enough to take food out of my hand.  
Good Samaritan Ministries, Inc.	219577	2	/users/profile/283189	wellsvmw	Volunteer	5	10/03/2014	Good Samaritan Ministries provides assistance to the poor through food, rent assist, and counseling to help them improve their situation in the long term.  Each client is interviewed by a qualified, degrees Social Worker.  To prevent duplication of services every interview is documented through Charity Check, an internet based service used by other non-profit agencies and churches. In Fiscal Year 2014, Good Samaritan Ministries did over $4.6 million in benevolence with only 3.8 percent going to operational expense, that is 96.2% in benefits going to the clients need assistance.  
Good Samaritan Ministries, Inc.	155908	1	/users/profile/108553	Norma K.	Volunteer	5	04/24/2013	New life is born at Samaritan Ministry. Some years ago, a group of churches in the Greater Washington Areanow 45 parishescame together out of a common concern: The jobless, homeless, hungry who knocked on their doors seeking help, needed more than a handout. They needed a hand up to break out of the cycle of poverty, the hopelessness that engulfed them.  Out of their common concern, Samaritan Ministry of Greater Washington came to be. At Samaritan Ministry not only is their immediate need addressed, they also are introduced to Next Steps and a path to life.  Next Steps is a unique self-help program for participants in need, promoting change, dignity, and self-reliance by assisting in accomplishing their goals. Goals involve employment, housing, family life, and medical or addiction issues. At the Samaritan Offices in Northwest and Southeast D.C. and Arlington, VA, program participants receive counseling, develop job skills, construct resumes, practice interviews, are helped with business attire and in finding housing. While these supports are essential to making the transition to a new life, perhaps even more important is the counseling and support participants receive from skilled caseworkers in self-reliance and their responsibility for changing. Participants testimony about Next Steps and transitioning to a new life truly reflects that a new life is born.
Good Samaritan Ministries, Inc.	62113	2	/users/profile/67896	Michelle N.	Client Served	5	02/01/2011	I have been personally helped by this ministry. During very difficult time for my family, they have assisted us with food, and helped me with our power bill in the winter when I did not have enough to pay it. My heart goes out to this ministry because Good Samaritan cares deeply about our community and the people who live here. I have seen them give clothing to the needy, and provide a place for the homeless to take a shower. I know that they help those less fortunate to have better clothing to go to job interviews, so that they can better their circumstances. I try to donate any extra clothing, shoes, household supplies, or really anything of value to them so that they can either give it to those in need or sell it in their store to benefit the ministry. This ministry has been a blessing to so many people. I know I thank the LORD that HE sent them to help those who need it.

GSM is one of several benevolent agencies in Johnson City but fills a spot that is not being filled by any others.  When someone loses a house by fire, they can come to GSM for dishes, furniture and food.  When there is need for help with the power bill, there is a budget for that.  Clothing is available.  The breadth of the help is unique.The founder of Good Samaritan, Sarah Wells, knows what it is like to be on the street without help.  She survived that with dependence on God and is now committed to helping people as a life mission, not a job.GSM is not good but great!

Good Samaritan Ministries, Inc.	23279	4	/users/profile/23906	vet	Volunteer	5	12/02/2009	I  have seen up close the work of Good Samaritan Ministries (GSM).  They provide a multi-faceted ministry for those who are on the edge or who have fallen off the edge financialy. And in other ways as well such as health, food, medical and dental care.  GSM is an agency of kind people who take great measures to share with those who have little to sustain themselves. For example, GSM provides help in paying rent and other housing costs, provide help with utilities costs, offer fod to the hungry through feeding programs daily with hot cooked meals as well as supplemental food boxes each month to those who can afford to purchase some food.  The GSM also has facilities for the homeless to take showers every day, to stay clothed in clean and new clothing and to get/stay dry.  The staff sees their clients as Jesus or the people whom Jesus helped when he walked the earth.  Kindness and love are evident throughout the day every day.

A Step Ahead Foundation Inc.	303351	1	/users/profile/394510	Writer,	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	One of the best organizations in Memphis. I was in college, on my super-conservative parent's insurance, and had no viable access to birth control. Not only did A Step Ahead help me get the most effective birth control available, but every staff member  I interacted with was kind, supportive, and nonjudgemental. A Step Ahead is helping me to finish my education and get into medical school before having kids. It rocks!
A Step Ahead Foundation Inc.	308898		/users/profile/400268	Ali Faye	Donor	5	10/07/2016	A Step Ahead Foundation is changing lives. They have helped thousands of women in Memphis. If you have the most effective birth control that's oops-proof (nothing you have to remember to take every day, week, etc.) then you can plan to accomplish as much as you dream to without the worry of an unplanned pregnancy disrupting your goals. That is amazing! Clients pay nothing out of pocket, so it levels the playing field allowing women of all incomes and backgrounds access to the methods of birth control female doctors most often choose for themselves. A free well-woman checkup is included at the appointment and transportation is available for those who need it. Not just a bus voucher but a cab ride, so the client can be comfortable and can get in and out and on with her day. Everyone I know who works there is incredibly passionate about the cause and I would give them 10 stars if I could!

It happened that we both worked for the Methodist LeBonheur system, she as a public health nurse going into the homes of very young pregnant women, teaching and assessing and I as a day surgery pediatric nurse. When I mentioned that I volunteered for ASAF and told of its goals, she was well aware of the positive work of the foundation and we continued a most enjoyable discussion about how she always gives ASAF literature to her patients as a way to begin planning for postpartum contraception.When appropriate, I also am able to teach teenagers who are at risk about ASAF. We learned about each other's stories and our dinner was a success.
A Step Ahead Foundation Inc.	306471	1	/users/profile/397731	edithdavis111	Volunteer	5	09/25/2016	I have spread the word about and volunteered for this organization for years because I believe so fervently in the mission. A child deserves the best possible upbringing and it is so important to wait to have children until both parents are ready. ASA offers an easy choice for responsible women to prevent pregnancy in a climate when many other clinics are shutting down. More birth control results in fewer abortions obviously. Claudia Haltom comes at this issue head on after working in the Juvenile Court system as a judge for 17 years who understands the burdens and responsibilities of having babies as a single mother often without child support from the father. Avoiding pregnancy with LARC methods allows women to focus on their education, character development and goals. ASA has proven success in Shelby County and the model should be replicated all over the country.
A Step Ahead Foundation Inc.	306463	1	/users/profile/397723	Writer	Client Served	5	09/25/2016	I am very grateful for the services provided by A Step Ahead Foundation. Their hard work and  dedication to the women of Shelby County is inspiring. I was in my second year of graduate study when I first heard of this organization. I had been suffering extreme nausea with my habitual birth control method, and had heard great things about the low-dose hormone IUD Mirena. I would never have been able to afford an IUD on my own, with a work-study budget and no health insurance. Since that time, I have graduated and begun work in my field - and I haven't had to worry once about nausea or remembering to take a pill. I truly believe ASAF was a key component of my success. And for that I cannot thank them enough!

Thanks to their professional work (aided by volunteers), these trails have been improved more than any time since the work of the CCC.  And thanks to the Friends of the Smokies for securing the funding to enable the Trails Forever crew to do their work.   Surely this is just one of many examples of how Friends of the Smokies is making a significant impact on our dearly loved Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  
Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	245330		/users/profile/332465	HikerGuy	Donor	5	06/15/2015	This is an organization that is so amazing words can not describe the benefits is has done for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  Over the many years we have been associated with The Friends of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Inc, they have been as professional as forthright with the millions of dollars that have been donated to the park.  They has used their funds to help establish the Trails Forever program which has provided for a permanent crew to work on the rehabilitation for various trails that have fallen into disarray of the many years of hard use and weathering.  This program had a challenge grant to raise $2,000,000 which was matched by a local organization and the Friends turned this into reality. Having visitor friendly trails has made the rehabilitated tails become safer and brought new visitors to the park as well.  Further programs have been to establish new exhibits for the new Oconaluftee Visitor Center on the North Carolina side of the park near Cherokee, NC.  The previous visitor center was very old and extremely small. Each year the association coordinates the Evergreen Ball in Knoxville, TN to raise money for the park as well as holding other outside programs that do the same.  There are days whereby volunteers take hikers on special trail hikes and this continues to support the efforts of the association to raise and make the hikers more aware of the park and their surroundings. The staff of the association work endlessly to speak with individuals about their donations and the importance of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  You have never seen such passion and unselfish employees that continue to dedicate their time for one and only one reason, The Park. As a final note of to show the associations dedication to the park, each August for over 20 years, the association has run a telethon on two television stations, one in Knoxville, TN and the other out of Asheville, NC.  These stations dedicate one hour to the telethon and believe it or not, the telethon raises approximately $240,000 in very kind donations from individuals that all have the love for this park and the association's work for it.  If you believe in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you should become a member of the Friends.

Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	245012		/users/profile/332093	SJMcGroom	Volunteer	5	06/10/2015	I live very close to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and visit the Park frequently.  I am an avid hiker and fly fisherman.  Friends of the Smokies plays a vital role in funding significant activities and projects in the Park.  FOTS is a very professional organization with passionate, enthusiastic and skilled staff.  I had the opportunity to work as a volunteer with The Trails Forever crew on the Chimney Tops Trail.  This is an amazing program that FOTS facilitates and the improvements made to the trails they have rehabilitated will last for generations to come.
Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	93546	1	/users/profile/107686	Peggy W.	General Member of the Public	5	07/07/2011	The financial figures for Friends of the Smokies for Fiscal Year 2008 do not reflect $916,924 raised in 2008 for three internally-managed endowments that will all benefit the Smokies 800+ miles of recreational trails. This data on internally managed endowments is not currently included in the Charity Navigator ranking system.  Visitors to Charity Navigator should keep this information in mind when looking at this data and determining the true level effectiveness of the organization and its total impact on park resources and visitors. Additionally, the information below can help provide additional perspective on Friends most recent financial reports. In 2010, the organization added more than $1.218 million to the internally managed Trails Forever endowment, but based on current accounting standards, those funds do not show up as an official park support expense, even though those funds are clearly restricted for improvements to park trails (as shown on page 13 of the 2010 audit).   At the parks request, Friends of the Smokies also spent more than $782,000 in 2010 to buy a 20-acre inholding (as summarized on page 12 of the 2010 audit).  That purchase will not show up as an official park support expense until the land is transferred to Great Smoky Mountains National Park, a process that takes several months to finish, probably sometime in 2011.  The two above-mentioned efforts total more than $2 million in 2010, which paints a very different picture of how Friends really supports Great Smoky Mountains National Park.   
Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	93424		/users/profile/107455	Crystal B.	Volunteer	5	07/05/2011	The Friends of the Smokies organization is by far one of the greatest organizations related to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The FOTS staff are some of the most passionate and dedicated folks I know, and I have proudly volunteered alongside them with much enthusiasm and pride.  I must say, I have always been amazed at how every Friends event runs smoothly and no loose ends are to be found.  This organization knows what it means to cross their ts and dot their is.  As a lover of the mountains, I will support them at every opportunity and continue to encourage others to do so as well.      
Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	93077		/users/profile/106861	leslie reeves	Volunteer	5	06/30/2011	I've volunteered for Friends of the Smokies for 4 years by working on their annual Evergreen Ball, telethon, and programs that they assist such as the Gatlinburg Spring Wildflower Pilgrimage.  Many wonderful programs and projects that the Great Smoky Mountains National Park provides would not be possible without the support from the FOS.  The money they raise helps fund the Hemlock Protection program, Parks as Classrooms, and Trails Forever. These are critically needed projects for the future environmental health of the park and the enjoyment of the millions of people who visit.I've enjoyed being a volunteer for the Friends of the Smokies due to the dedicated, hard-working, and fun staff at their office. 
Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	92923		/users/profile/106676	Smokies H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/29/2011	The Smokies have become my home. They would not have attracted me so, nor kept me here if it were not for the unbelievable work and accomplishments of Friends of the Smokies. I first really understood what goes on behind the scenes in the Great Smoky Mountains national park (GSMNP) as a member of media.  Past the press releases, events and hoopla, in my research I saw what it took to educate the public, protect the cultural and natural resources and make the park a place where more than 9 million visitors a years are drawn too.  Working as a volunteer in the park in various programs, I see firsthand how Friends of the Smokies has responded to the needs of the park, forever positively influencing its resources and visitors. For example, I volunteer in the parks Elk restoration program. The all electric vehicle I drive along with the elk would not be here without the Friends. Less obvious to any visitor, but crucial to science, is the GSMNPs  All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI) project where scientists with the help of citizen volunteers such as myself, have found more than  7,101 new species previously not known to be in the Park, and 910 species new to mankind.  This ATBI project could not have happened without the years of support offered from Friends of the Smokies. Scientists will be forever grateful for what has been found as a result of this program. Hike on a trail that has been, or is being restored, visit the cabin in Little Cataloochee that was vandalized and completely rebuilt, marvel and learn from the displays in the new visitor center in Oconaluftee, fish in a stream that has had its native brook trout restored   it is all because of the Friends of the Smokies and those that support this great organization.   The park service cannot do what needs to be done alone, and it is only going to get worse. Every day more species are disappearing from the park even before we can find them, historic buildings need bats removed along with other restoration work performed in order to protect them for future generations, and through public education, a visitor experience will improve as well as resource protection. With the Friends support, this can be done. I know at anytime that the great staff at the Friends is just a phone call or email away. I cant imagine my life without the Great Smoky Mountains national park, nor can I imagine the park without Friends of the Smokies. It just wouldnt be the same.  Christopher HibbardOwner YourSmokies.com
Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	89344		/users/profile/101459	Robert T.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/01/2011	As the President of PDS Web Development, I have worked closely with many non-profits.  It is incredibly rare to see a charitable organization accomplish so much good, in a way that impacts so many people, with such a small staff, and so few financial resources.  Their sincere love of the Smoky Mountains is ever present as the staff endeavors to preserve, protect, and provide for the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.  The Millions of park visitors benefit from Jim's leadership by example, Lauren's "Midas touch" in event planning, Holly's strategically pushing the technology envelope in non-profit marketing, and Nan's timely and professional financial navigation, not to mention the passionate and tireless efforts of Sarah or Kathyrn.  The plants, animals, environment, and visitors enjoy the fruits of your many labors.  You make such a difference!
Friends of Great Smoky Mountain National Park Inc	88492		/users/profile/99670	Nancy Anderson	Volunteer	5	05/09/2011	I have the greatest regard for Friends of the Smokies organization and have had opportunity to interact with staff in the office setting and at special events where I've worked as a volunteer, including Spring Wildflower Pilgrimage each April and Wilderness Wildlife Week each January for last 5 or more years. All of the staff seem to love the Smoky Mountains and appear to be super-dedicated to making everything they do help the GSMNP Park Service.  It appears every event they put together turns out to be a 5-star, 1st-class endeavor.   One particular event I found awesome was the way they were able to help the GSM Park Service pull the "Once in a Lifetime" Cades Cove Loop Lope together on such short notice when it was learned the contracted service to resurface roadways was going to be complete earlier than planned, and it turned out to be such a tremendous success!!!   I felt honored to get to work as a volunteer for that, too, and hope they will be able to make it an annual event, perhaps on the first Saturday of April or May.  It is always great to read about the Evergreen Ball each year, and in 2009, they did such a great job for an entire year of events for the 75th Anniversary and Rededication Ceremony.   I realize that FOTS' primary role and biggest achievements are in relation to the donations that support so many programs for the GSM Park Service, but they are so much more personal than just fund-raising folks, and I feel honored to have had contact with them over the years.   I strive for the day I can provide more financial support, but 'til then, will have to enjoy the privilege of the volunteer hours I can give.   Nancy AndersonFairhope, Alabama
East Tennessee Children's Hospital	224371	1	/users/profile/288127	annaleichuchu	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	I have volunteered with the East Tennessee Children's Hospital for a few years now and I have always found it to be one of the most rewarding experiences. I really enjoy helping the children out and seeing them grow. It is probably the best place that I have ever volunteered at. I feel as though the staff really appreciates me being there and all of the help that I have been to them. I also think that the parents of the children are appreciative of all I do. I will continue to volunteer at the East Tennessee Children's Hospital because the experience continues to be rewarding and I enjoy it thoroughly.

East Tennessee Children's Hospital	216812	1	/users/profile/280331	gravesl	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2014	I volunteered with staff of Children's Hospital at a summer camp for diabetics this year and shadowed an educator in the Diabetes Clinic.   I am a school nurse and work with children and families that rely on Children's Hospital when their kids are first diagnosed as well as follow up visits to help them manage their condition.  They are excellent at helping kids and families through such a difficult transition and show continued care and support as the children and their family transition through many stages.  They are also a wonderful resource to the community.  I receive their newsletter which helps me get reliable health information out to the families I serve at my school, and I plan to attend one or more of the educational classes they offer soon.  I am very thankful and appreciate the wonderful care kids receive at Children's Hospital.  As one more thing to add, my daughter spent a week in Children's ICU when she was born due to complications and the staff were wonderful and caring--that was 16 years ago but I still remember the loving care she got at that time, so I can speak as both a parent and an invested community member on their behalf!
Christian Counseling Center of Cumberland County	187355	1	/users/profile/244354	Sal t	Board Member	5	11/01/2013	The center is one of the most valuable service organizations I have ever been involved in. By providing counseling for children, teens, and adults in dire need of help, the staff makes  a difference in lives broken by many mental problems.  And best of all, fees are on a sliding scale according to families'  ability to pay.

After my first session at the CCC I felt extremely positive, I knew they could help.  Ms. Donalson was extremely inviting and understanding.  Everything was conducted in a professional manner, but with a great deal of care and compassion.  I looked forward to my sessions and I have seen the results from them.  I feel that I have overcome a period of sadness and despair and I know I couldn't have done it without the help of Ms. Donalson and for that I am ever grateful.

Christian Counseling Center of Cumberland County	43631	11	/users/profile/44503	charles7	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/11/2010	The Christian Counseling Center of Cumberland County provides a vital service to persons who are struggling with life in a multitude of situations. Because of the diversity of the County Population, Director Carol Donelson and her staff find themselves, variously, ministering to wealthy retirees and some of the poorest people in Appalachia. Ms. Donelson has great expertise in many areas of counseling, and finds herself increasingly dealing with people with suicidal tendencies. She and her staff also counsel persons who are struggling because a spouse or other family member is sinking into the valley of Alzheimers. As a Stephen Ministry Leader, through her local church and other area churches Ms. Donelson helps prepare lay people for pastoral caregiving roles.The Counseling Center operates on a sliding fee scale. Because of this approach the Center is limited in its staff size, and consequently its ability to reach more people with its services. Currently the counseling staff consists of Ms. Donelson and one other counselor.
Theatre Bristol	309225		/users/profile/400589	Xander H.	Volunteer	5	10/09/2016	Theatre Bristol is amazing. I love every show I've seen there. I've also had the opportunity to be in two shows with Theatre Bristol (played Gavroche in Les Miserables and Peter Cratchit in Scrooge the Musical). Theatre Bristol is an important part of Bristol's history and we're lucky to have it. Go see a show there and support Theatre Bristol. You'll be glad you did. 
Theatre Bristol	305224		/users/profile/396471	alanasimmons	Volunteer	5	09/17/2016	My daughter has been involved with Theatre Bristol for more than 4 years. She absolutely loves being on stage, bringing characters to life! She also loves the lasting friendships that she's made being part of Theatre Bristol. Theatre helps to build self-confidence and reinforces pro-social behavior especially amongst young children. Thank you, Theatre Bristol, for all that you do to enrich the lives of child actors and audiences. 
Theatre Bristol	303000		/users/profile/394162	David371	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/08/2016	I grew up with Theatre Bristol. As a child in elementary school we would take field trips to see their shows. I was always awed and inspired. I wanted to join them. When I was in sixth grade I had my chance. Terrified, I auditioned for Beauty and the Beast (before Disney adapted the film for stage), I was cast as part of the rose bush (or as my father said "the thorn"). Being on stage was like nothing else. It would be 5 years before I did a show again, but it was Theatre Bristol's Grease. Over the next 3 years I would perform or work backstage on over 25 shows. Working backstage caused me to see my interest in painting and love of color, I was taught scenic design and lighting design. Fast forward 10 years, I have changed and grown, but so has Theatre Bristol. I hold a college degree in theatre design and a minor in advertising. Theatre Bristol taught me leadership, organization, and harnessed my creativity. Some of the friends I made during my youth at Theatre Bristol have gone on to Broadway, the West End, major Hollywood films, and regional professional theatres across the county. I still keep in contact with them today. I have a energy for working with children and an ability to react in situations because of the lessons I learned from the people at TB. They are my family. The organization has gone through its shares of troubles but this has grown it and made it stronger. I am proud to say Theatre Bristol shaped my life. 
Theatre Bristol	302976		/users/profile/394134	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/08/2016	What makes TB a great theatre is that all groups are welcomed. Kids and adults, newbies and veterans, actors and setbuilders and viewers.

Theatre Bristol	302904	2	/users/profile/394059	James205	Volunteer	5	09/08/2016	Theatre Bristol is a fantastic family theatre that not only gets families together to see shows, but also gets them together to be in them. During my time volunteering at Theatre Bristol, I've seen kids in shows while their parents work on set or help costume, I've seen parents in shows with their children, and I've seen families from past shows come back to the theatre to help with a show, even if they're not in it. But one thing more, members of a show become a family, forming friendships that last for years beyond the last bow. That's what being a family theatre is.
Theatre Bristol	302886		/users/profile/394039	Writer	Board Member	5	09/08/2016	Theatre Bristol has been changing lives for more than 50 years, all because Cathy DeCaterina believed in helping children gain confidence. I have not only enjoyed Theatre Bristol's shows for nearly 15 of those years, but I have watched my own children benefit from Cathy's vision--whether helping backstage or performing on stage. Theatre Bristol is an integral part of our downtown Bristol community as well as our region because of the work of many dedicated volunteers. I'm honored to serve on the board at this time and help keep the legacy going for more children and adults to have a chance to gain skills and confidence, and to shine on the ARTspace and Paramount stages.

We were amazed at the transformation that God was doing in the lives of these children, which went on to change entire communities.  Every one there was like a drop in the bucket of Living Water, overflowing into the lives of each one they came into contact.  What a blessing to all who come to know and participate in what the Lord is doing there.  
Hope Unlimited For Children	134976		/users/profile/180845	HarryH	Board Member	5	11/07/2012	I was introduced to HOPE in 2008 by the new President of the organization. I went to Brazil where the facilites and children are located, toured all of the facilites, examined the management, and asked to be of service on the Board. I have been a Board member ever since and am now also an officer of the organization. HOPE has the best record of success of any non-profit I have ever seen or heard of. We deal with children at mortal risk of death so we start with human disaster and produce success stories, one child after another. Every single person who goes to our facilities gets amazed by our program and our success. I urge you to visit if you can!! If not, just go to our website (HopeUnlimited.org) and take a tour by computer. 
Hope Unlimited For Children	134965		/users/profile/180832	carolwhodgson	Advisor	5	11/07/2012	Since I first heard of Hope Unlimited For /Children in 1991, and visited their residential school in Campinas, Brazil, I have been fully involved as a donor, director, and now as an advisor.  I have visited the schools and residences in Campinas and Vitoria several times, witnessing the transformation of children in the wonderful programs of Hope Unlimited.  The program features residences set up as homes with houseparents, academic education, vocational training courses, counseling, Christian worship, music, athletics and more.  Hope also operates a preschool in a  Campinas favela (or slum), aiming to be a positive and inspiring influence on little children before they turn to the dangerous life on the streets.  The high moral standards of the leadership of this organization recommend it as trustworthy.  The experience in the rescue, transformation and equipping of children recommend it as a program that achieves success in it's mission statement.
Hope Unlimited For Children	134730		/users/profile/180611	MotherOfAFew	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/07/2012	Hope Unlimited for Children has a website that explains what they do.  I highly encourage everyone to start there.  It will open your eyes to how the street children in Brazil were getting treated.  And how Hope Unlimited got involved and took the children off the streets and CHANGED their lives.  These children's only crime was that they are poor.  So sad that adults were murdering them.  Hope Unlimited for Children stepped in and they don't just rehabilitate for a few years and then cut the kids loose.  They work with them and TRANSFORM their lives.  This organization changes lives and I am all for supporting Hope Unlimited for Children.  Great people are working in this organization who actually care about making a difference! The name of the organization says it all!  HOPE UNLIMITED FOR CHILDREN!
Hope Unlimited For Children	134423		/users/profile/180259	Kmuneca	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I've had the great honor of traveling to Brazil and working with the children at Hope Unlimited. Over the two years I've been going, I've seen great transformation in the lives of children who have been abandoned, neglected and abused by their own family members. These kids, given the proper care and love they need, can blossom into who they were meant to be, but also into young adults with servants' hearts. It amazing how they help each other be accountable and encourage integrity. One of the GREATEST things I've seen was a mother and daughter reunited in a healthy relationship, one centered on Christ as well as focused on helping others and being better together. That's the amazing work of Hope Unlimited: striving to transform lives as well as breaking the cycle of poverty and helplessness in the street kids of Brazil.
Hope Unlimited For Children	134316		/users/profile/180136	vantuinenb	Donor	5	11/06/2012	I visited their orphanage in Brazil several years ago and it was amazing.  They take kids who have experienced unbelievable hardships and trauma and give them a home, an education, and a family who loves them.  They are producing transformed young adults from children in the most dire of situations.
Hope Unlimited For Children	134259		/users/profile/180049	dznsln	Donor	5	11/06/2012	I have supported Hope Unlimited for Children for many years and have seen firsthand the transformational work they do with children at mortal risk.  Former street children now gainfully employed and contributing to society.  Young girls once forced into prostitution now living happily and safely in families of their own.  It's really amazing!  The organization provides kids with family who love them, food/clothing/medical care, education, vocational training, and spiritual Hope.  What I love most about Hope -- and what makes it different from every other orphan care organization I've ever known -- is that they don't "drop" a child when they graduate.  Instead, they provide a period of transition for young graduates, continuing to help them budget their money, set up housekeeping, buy groceries, adjust to their new job -- all the things most of us would do for our own young adult children.  Ministry leaders even say that, although they want to offer Hope to every child in their care, it's only when the cycle of poverty, abuse, and hopelessness is broken for THE NEXT generation that they consider their work to be a success.  That's a really big goal -- and one that Hope Unlimited is reaching child after child.  Great work!
Dare for More Ministries	42594	8	/users/profile/43300	rford	Client Served	5	06/01/2010	I live in the Chattanooga area where this ministry is located and I heard about them just in time.  My daughter was struggling with many issues and I had no clue where to turn.  I needed honesty and answers from someone who would be biblical.  Dare for More was there for me and my daughter.  Reba met with us and patiently talked us through so many issues.  She connected us with other help in the local Chattanooga area and I really started to see positive change.  She is honest and she doesn't beat around the bush but that is what my daughter needed.  I am so grateful that this ministry is in my community.
Dare for More Ministries	39953	9	/users/profile/40899	sweaver8	Client Served	5	05/21/2010	Dare For More Ministries has helped influence me to trust God to help me be all that He wants me to be.

Dare for More Ministries	39841	8	/users/profile/40800	zach3	Board Member	5	05/21/2010	Dare For More Ministries Inc. is a ministry I am proud to be associated with.  I have seen the impact it has in both reaching the mass as well as one on one.  The ministry has a true desire to reach ladies and teenage girls where they are, baggage and all, and see them grow from within through a stronger relationship with God.  Every dollar spent is prayed over and used to impact more ladies for Christ.
Dare for More Ministries	39746	8	/users/profile/40714	michael30	Donor	5	05/20/2010	One of the most worthy women and teen-oriented ministries around.

They are very conscientious stewards with their funds thus providing future donors the assurance that this work is truly....for the greater good! I highly recommend you consider this cause.  -Michael W. Cartwright, CFP
Dare for More Ministries	39676	6	/users/profile/40640	mom2boys	Board Member	5	05/20/2010	When I first heard Reba Bowman speak, she brought such a fresh approach to God's Word. She can make the Bible come alive and be practical to your everyday life.  Her walk with God is an inspiring example of what we as Christians can be. It has been a privilege to be involved in recent years as a Board Member of Dare for More.  Getting to know Reba on a more personal level has just strengthened my opinion of the Dare for More ministry.  She lives what she teaches.  Her desire for women to walk in a close relationship with God shines through in every event.  Her book, Bible study, and conferences are top notch.  This ministry has certainly helped me grow in a closer relationship with God.
Dare for More Ministries	39648	10	/users/profile/40604	amazed1	Volunteer	5	05/20/2010	Being personally involved with DFM has had the most powerful impact on my life! God has definitely blessed and is using Reba and her team in the lives of many women and teens. I have watched them in ministry and in their personal lives and they seriously desire others to know Christ in a personal way. Dare for More is a great description of what they desire for the people they serve.  I can't wait to see what God does through them next!
Dare for More Ministries	38129	8	/users/profile/38992	rlb	Client Served	4	05/06/2010	We had such a great, meaningful, life-altering experience.  Several of my ladies went back to our church, with materials in hand to start a class for the teens ladies.  They had been inspired to step in, step up, and step out for GOD.  I appreciate the way Reba uses her gift of communication, spiritual depth, and humor like a magnet to encourage ladies to be all that they can be for GOD.  It grows more and more obvious that she has been raised up by GOD 'for such a time as this'!

Habitat For Humanity International Inc	61834		/users/profile/67562	steve	Volunteer	5	01/31/2011	Rutherford County Habitat for Humanity provides houses to poor families. Houses. Moreover, the new homeowners have helped build the houses they will live in, working alongside of members of the community. This is an extraordinary mission when you think about it. I first became involved with Habitat in 2006, having wanted to do something more active than simply write a check. When I visited the Habitat office, I was struck by the friendliness and enthusiasm of everyone there. Within a few weeks, I was laying baseboard, my first job. In the years since, I have helped with insulation, siding, framing, and painting, often with the future homeowners doing the same thing. The Habitat staff members I've had the good fortune to work with are incredible: Beth and Megan in the office, and Roy, Terry and Jacob on the work sites. Some of the best people I've ever met.  
Habitat For Humanity International Inc	61639	1	/users/profile/67321	Maggiej	Volunteer	5	01/29/2011	Rutherford County Habitat for Humanity is the absolute best non-profit organization I've ever had the opportunity to witness. Of course the goal is to provide affordable housing for those who need help, but in the process they also help these home owners to succeed not only in maintaining the home, but also in maintaining their personal finances. It's a holistic approach in not only making the home available to those who qualify but also in keeping the home and well-being of the families long-term. I can't say enough about the quality of the people who work for habitat and who volunteer. Great skill and pride are put into every aspect of construction: purchasing the properties; choosing functional house plans; designing the homes to fit into the neighborhoods where they're built and giving surrounding homeowners the inspiration to improve their own homes. The skills and knowledge of the crew are expert and are wonderful, respectful teachers. Most of all - for me, anyway - they make hard work FUN! Fundraising events are creative, well-planned, and involve activities that can be done by people who aren't old enough or physically able to work on job sites, which works very well in helping children learn how important it is to give to our community. I cannot imagine any other organization more deserving of the Winter 2011 GuideStar-KIMBIANonprofit Giveaway. 
Habitat For Humanity International Inc	61548		/users/profile/67206	lollyswork	Volunteer	5	01/28/2011	I have had the opportunity to volunteer for Rutherford County Habitat for Humanity for a couple of years now.  The staff and crew are amazing.   It is obvious when working with Roy, Terry and Jacob that they are truly dedicated to  building perfect homes.   They make all the volunteers feel welcome and are very patient when teaching us new skills.  Working with RCHFH has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.

I can not say enough good things about that day. I left so inspired and very impressed with the work that the staff does. I will certainly volunteer again and support this organization any way that I can, and hopefully even recruit some others who have not volunteered before to join me next time!

They shine as a model to other Habitat affiliates who look to them for ideas on building their volunteer and donor base.  This great team deserves the $5,000 prize and I know it will be spent well!

I will definitley volunteer again and support this organization any way that I can.
Habitat For Humanity International Inc	61338		/users/profile/66951	Joe Herrud	Volunteer	5	01/27/2011	We're starting our 7th year of partnering w/ HFH Rutherford County (HFHRC) by building the storage sheds they provide for each one of the homes built in Rutherford County.  At General Mills, we have a large number of talented individuals who have the skill to help construct the sheds.  We have organized a core group that helps organize the events and execute the construction in less than 1/4 of the time it originally took several years ago when we first started.  We also used our project engineering experience to source better prices for the material used in the builds.  We also wanted to help them raise funds for the sheds and we began an annual charity motorcycle event (with their help) that we hope will completely fund the sheds as the participation grows.  They are a great organization that does a lot of work w/ a small group of people.
Habitat For Humanity International Inc	61330		/users/profile/66943	Jeanice M.	Volunteer	5	01/27/2011	I volunteered with Habitat for Humanity in college with my business fraternity about 3 1/2 years ago and the experience was phenomenal. I was moved by the fact that we were making someone's life long dreams come true by not only building a house but also making a home for someone. Seeing it being constructed from the ground up with blood, sweat, and tears not only moved the family moving in but the volunteers and everyone in the process as well.  I was in charge of cutting paneling/siding for the house and for a girl with no construction experience, I think I did a pretty good job. I recommend working with Habitat for Humanity to everyone, literally. Habitat is a wonderful organization that helps make dreams become reality.  If I could give any constructive feedback to Habitat is that I wish their was a community calendar to see where individuals could sign up and work on homes that is easily accessible. 
Habitat For Humanity International Inc	61287	1	/users/profile/66889	irishbookworm21	Volunteer	5	01/27/2011	Last year, I was offered the opportunity to work with the Haibitat for Humainty of Rutherford County through my company on two women's builds.  Essentially, this meant that most of the volunteer staff was comprised of other women.   I will be the first to tell you that I know little to nothing about construction.  If you want me to paint, fantastic.  Anything more involved than that, and I am a willing student. Roy (a full time staff member) was SO fantastic!  On the first build, we learned we would be siding a house.  To ensure proper placement to prevent later weather damage, it's important to make sure it is done correctly.  Roy walked us through the process and made sure we were comfortable with what we were doing.  He was respectful and didn't make any of us feel badly for not knowing what we were doing. The second build, I was working in a house nearing completion.  This activity was my forte: painting.   Still again, Roy checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed and made sure we didn't have questions.    That day, I was even lucky enough to meet the owner of the house.  It was such a nice feeling to know I was volunteering for an organization that is directly impacting our community.  You don't have to wait to see the fruits of what Habitat does.  The results of their work is very tangible. 
Mid-South Food Bank	150647		/users/profile/200889	Nadeem Z.	Board Member	5	03/06/2013	I am a board member of this wonderful collegial organization which works for the food-insecure like no other. Besides the executive leadership, the board of directors are proactive and take an active interest in the the well being of Midsouth Food Bank (MSFB) (previously Memphis Food Bank). We as board members strive to link the MSFB with potential donors and also help the organization link up with diverse population groups. Because of the diverse leadership background of the board, the MSFB is able to get support for its administrative growth and is increasingly becoming even more transparent despite its Charity Navigator transparency rating of 70/70. As partners, the volunteers and workers, executives and board members work in tandem in a true team spirit to alleviate hunger in 31 counties of MS,TN and AR. We help kids, seniors and Midsoutherners of all ages and backgrounds. Help us fight hunger and we will continue to be be very frugal with your valuable donations. Nadeem Zafar, M.D.

The executive director, Mrs. Estella Greer reaches out constantly to various organizations to give in support of this worthwhile community effort.   Because of her expertise, many organizations are making The Food Bank part of their charitable giving and fundraising.
Mid-South Food Bank	57161		/users/profile/60053	dpwestbrook	Volunteer	5	11/17/2010	I have had the incredible experience of going to the Food Bank as a volunteer.  The service to our community is simply amazing.   Imagine not having food on Thanksgiving Day.  The Food Bank strives to help this happening to many families.  God Bless those who work and volunteer at the Food Bank.  They work miracles.   They go the extra mile.
Mid-South Food Bank	57088		/users/profile/59951	CDWatson	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2010	The Mid-South Food Bank has ALWAYS done an excellent job of serving Memphis, TN and the MId-South. Their passion to see hunger eliminated is infectious. I am so grateful that we have an organization that operates with such excellence.
Mid-South Food Bank	57004		/users/profile/59811	Linda W.	Volunteer	5	11/15/2010	In 2009, I helped The Food Bank with their work on a national food survey. We interviewed people at local food distribution centers around the Mid-South area: local food pantries get food from Memphis and give it to peopl e in need. In talking with the clients, I learned how great the need really is in this time of economic hardship. One question on the survey was, "What was your total family income last year?" I was shocked when one woman responded, "$62,000." There was no money coming in now and she was feeding her family any way she could: food stamps, food pantries, soup kitchens, etc. The Mid-South Food Bank was helping to keep her children fed, the most basic of human needs. The food pantries we visited all had nothing but praise the The Food Bank. It was great working with them.
Mid-South Food Bank	56654		/users/profile/59293	Embeedubya	Donor	5	11/10/2010	Mid-South Food Bank is a valuable organization in our community.  This area was recently named the "Hunger Capital of the Nation", according to a recent poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for the Food Resources Action Center.  Mid-South Food Bank distributes food and other groceries to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other agencies that feed hungry people.  They operate efficiently and are very good stewards of the donations they receive.

Mid-South Food Bank	56600		/users/profile/59201	julie	General Member of the Public	5	11/09/2010	The Mid-South Food Bank is definitely a GREAT nonprofit.  Under the leadership of Susan Sanford, they have helped to feed countless hungry people in the Mid-South, and have done a wonderful job creating and sustaining valuable relationships with businesses and citizens in the community who contribute to the Mid-Souht Food Bank's efforts. They have also created fabulous programs for needy children and adults.  The Mid-South is lucky to have such a wonderful organization that is so committed to helping the less fortunate. 
Mid-South Food Bank	56578		/users/profile/59150	Susan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2010	I am biased, since I am the CEO of Mid-South Food Bank, but we are a Great Nonprofit! Our mission is to fight hunger by collecting and distributing wholesome food and through education and advocacy. Our vision is creating a hunger-free Mid-South. Our programs all focus on our mission and include our warehouse distribution, produce delivery, Kids Cafe where children receive a balanced meal in a restaurant-like setting, Food for Kids BackPack program that provides a full back pack of easy to open and prepare foods for the weekend, the Mobile Pantry that takes trucks of food to underserved counties where the agenices are too small to serve the growing number of hungry people and the retail pick-up program.  The Food Bank is the only organization, public or private, that does what we do in our region.  As a Feeding America food bank we serve agencies and churches in 12 TN counties, 18 in MS and 1 in AR.  We save them between $15 and  $20 million a year in food costs to help people solve their problems and become productive citizens.  Each year 186,000  different people rely on food from the Food Bank for their very next meal; 62,000 of them are children.  The Memphis Metro area that includes 8 counties was reported to be the hungries area in the country, and the food and dollars we receive are essential to feeding hungry adults and children.
Alpha House Inc	153616	1	/users/profile/204437	lowepipes	Volunteer	5	04/08/2013	Revelation 12:11 They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.       Born into addiction, neglect, abuse and love is the best way to describe my family. My father was married with a wife and two daughters when he met my mother. She had a husband and eight children. They both abandoned their families and ran off together. Six years and four children later they divorced. He left she remarried another man and had two boys. That is 16 kids in all.      My mother was addicted to   alcohol, pills, and abusive men. How to put into words all the physical, sexual, and mental abuse I experienced in my childhood and young adult life is a challenge. Neglected and abused by my mother, and very often by some of the men she brought into my life. Abandoned by my father, I never understood that because he often kept my sisters and brother just not me. Even before I knew about God I was thankful for my siblings because if not for each other love would not have been part of our childhoods. Education was not something that was of any importance. We moved from state to state. I was in the tenth grade but I could only read at a 6th grade level. My mother moved so many times that I ended up going to 22 schools in ten years. I was so far behind in school that I FELT as if there was no point to continue. So I gave up at age 17 after failing the tenth grade.      I had no one to teach me the things of God not who He was, or what He did. I had no one to teach me the love of Christ. They did tell me about hell, fire, and damnation and that it was sure to be my destiny. What few times my family did introduce God to me was not good. All they taught me about Christ. Was when someone took His name in vain or at the kingdom hall. Teaching me, who He was not. Never was I, told the truth about God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit. However, I now know somewhere deep inside I knew.      Raised in a family of addiction, neglect, and abuse. Led me to trading in my marriage at age 28 For a lifestyle that was against God. I assumed the role of both my parents and abandoned my children. I fell into a deep depression and started using alcohol and drugs by age 30. My using was so out of control by age 35 it started a chain reaction of arrest after arrest. I did not see it then nor could I recognize what was really going on. However now that I can see, I see the reason for every arrest. Gods thoughts and Gods ways are higher than ours.      Matthew 25:36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me. For the first time in my life 35 years old seeds starting to be planted. Each, and every time I went to jail the Lord put it on some womans heart to come in, and share with me what He had so freely been given to them Grace, Love, and Mercy. I would get out of jail spiritually strong with all good intent to move forward. For weeks sometimes-even months at a time I would do well. Then before I knew it fears, anger, resentment, bitterness, hate, pride. All of it would somehow creep back into my life and into my heart. I truly did not understand it. I FELT as if God just did not care. The last ten years of my life in and out of jail with Gods words being planted. Jail ministry after jail ministry was planting seeds. I tried but I could not figure out why God was not working for me. I would go to Church, I read my Bible, I did not understand it but I read it. About a week before I got to Alpha House, I fell into a deep depression. Almost the worst I had ever felt. I had fought depression for years. This time it was different. I was tired. I did not want to go on.      But God, What I now know as His (Divine Interventions). God reviled Himself to me in a jail cell. He showed up and showed out. In an instant, I realized what I had been doing. In an instant, I realized who I had been hurting. I hurt God. The only One that was there for me as a child. The One that gave me a loving husband and three beautiful children. So that I would know what true love felt like. God was the only one that ever truly loved me. In spite of myself He loved me. I had been tearing His Heart out little by little. In an instant, I felt His pain. All the hurt all the sorrow and all the wrong that people had done to me in my life could never add up to the real physical pain and hurt that I caused God to feel. In an instant, I realized that once again, I had assumed the role and abandoned abused and rejected the only One who ever truly loved me. He loved me in spite of myself. I praise God. I thank God. He is a God of Mercy a God of Blessings a God that loves us in spite of ourselves. A God whom delivers and rescues us. I will Praise His name forever. He will deliver us out of all situations. There is no heart too hard for God to break through.      Now it was time. The seeds that all those Ladies planted needed to be watered. God sent me to Alpha House. However, the Bible teaches that unless those seeds fall on good soil, the enemy will come in and take them away. Because some of those seeds fall on a hard heart, they have no root and cannot grow. Others choked out, by the ways of this world. Now it was time for those seeds that fell on good soil to be watered.      How many of you know Jesus never sinned? I never knew that before I got to Alpha House. That came to me one morning during prayer and praise. That is why the Bible called Him the Lamb of God. He was Gods spotless sacrifice to His self, for us. We cannot do it. We can never be good enough. I never understood that before I got to Alpha House.      How many of you know that when we accept Jesus He comes to live inside of us? I never understood that either. Well then, that means. If He is in us then we are in Him, and He seated at the right hand of the Father. Well then that means we are already there.      How about 2 Timothy 1:7? Did you know that God did not give us a spirit of fear? I did not know that. I thought God made me afraid. I thought He made me that way. God gave me a spirit of power, love, and a sound mind.      These may seem like childlike revelations to you, but that is what I was. A child, Gods child. In need of love shelter and protection. Needing discipleship to be equipped to live like Christ. Needing a family to take me in and teach me the ways of the Kingdom of God. One more, The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? Did you know they are One? Actually, God gave me that one in jail, through some Church Ladies. Ladies I did not even know praying for me. His laborers came in and planted, they labored for the Lord 10 years. Now it is time for all those seeds to be watered.      God has anointed the women that labor at Alpha House. Evidence of His Holy Spirit is there. That is the love of God; 1 Corinthians 13:2. Although I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing. The only way a person can get a revelation of Jesus is from God. Matthew 16:17 Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. All the women from Alpha House pour so much love into the work they do for the Lord. For the first time in, I do not even know how long. I started seeing hope. God was reviling His self to me. He was giving me revelation after revelation of Jesus Christ. While Alpha House, was proving group studies. Teaching and showing me the ways of God. Diana, taught Battlefield of the mind. Carolyn, brought in a lesson showing me that I could renew my mind. Pastor Tony from House of Worship coming in and providing a study called freedom in Christ. Jeanette Debaets with Bible study teaching me the power of Gods word. The power of prayer and His promises. Jeanette took special time out of her life praying with me. I was learning how to take old thoughts captive, and replace them with new ones. I was learning about pulling down strongholds. That kept me in bondage. I was learning that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. And having full understanding of just what all that meant.      Now I thought since now I can understand the Bible. Because to me that was the hard part. Understanding what I read in the Bible. I thought the easy part of Christianity It would seem to me like the easy part of Gods word. Would be sharing it with others. Now that I have the revelation of Jesus living inside me. The easy part should be applying it in my life. All I can even think to say to that is. God Bless Alpha House. All the mighty women of God, that works there. All the volunteers, that comes in for Bible studies. It takes a special anointing from God to be able to embrace all the fruit of the Spirit of God and Share it every day with others. Galatians 5:22-23 Love, Joy, Peace, Longsuffering, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, Self-Control. Since sharing my new revelations of Jesus should be the easy part. Now go out unto the world and preach the Gospel. I should be able to right. Let me ask you. What do you think would happen to a person who had the revelation of Christ however had no social skills? My social skills at the time of my arrival to Alpha House consisted of manipulation, lying, gossip, and sarcasm. God had changed my heart, now it was time to renew my mind. Time to show me how to leave yesterday at the Cross. And how to leave tomorrow up to Jesus. Living at Alpha House was not easy for me, it was hard. I was starting to want what God wanted. Now it was time for someone to show me how to live like Christ.      God sent me to Alpha House. I will thank Him every day. Taking someone like me out of a mindset of survival mode and helping me develop the mind of Christ. Taking someone like me out of the mindset of fight or flight and teaching me how to trust in others. Showing me the love of God not just saying it not just teaching about the love of Christ but actually living it. Taking me from being a social outcast. To helping me develop my giftings and talents to become a productive member into the Kingdom of God. Teaching me how to step up and step out. With the knowing, that when we step out in faith we never walk alone. Teaching me how to live in this world and how not to be of this world. God uses every teacher every volunteer and every resident that comes through Alpha House as a vessel for His Glory.      Today I call my time at Alpha House my training. When I am in any given situation I know to focus on Jesus. I know to pray without ceasing and meditate on Gods word. Often times when I am frustrated and beginning to feel over whelmed. I can think back to my training and most of the time, I see what is going on around me, and apply the same principals and tactics that I learned at Alpha House to any given situation that I am presently experiencing.      I brought up my education at the beginning of my testament because it is important to share. Every individual that comes through Alpha House is exactly that, an individual. We all have individual needs and care. Teddy allowed me special time and special tools that helped me learn,  and helped me comprehend that which I was reading. She gave me and showed me compassion and understanding, which in return boosted my confidence. While at the same time knowing, when not to extend too much time. I now know without a doubt, it was not without long-suffering on her part. I brought up how I FELT at the beginning of my testament because that too is important. I now know it is not about how we feel, it is about whom we know. Jesus Christ. I now know, God will show me how to get through. Jesus will show me and Jesus will grow me. I brought up not understanding why God was not working for me. Not knowing His promises and calling for my life. God uses the women from Alpha House as vessels to teach me how to accept and receive the promises He has for me. Isaiah 41:13 For I, the Lord your God, will hold your right hand, Saying to you, Fear not, I will help you. Hebrews 13:6 So we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?       Alpha House is, a House of God, a House of Worship, a Sanctuary, a school but most of all to me it is my family. They are advancing the Kingdom of God one woman at a time. The most important thing                                                           I have ever learned is give God the Glory, for apart from Him we are nothing. Alpha House works together with God, in promoting the purposes of His Glory, and the salvation of precious souls; 1 Corinthians 3:7 neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.      This is just the beginning of some of the things God has done for me. He is faithful and He will do the same for you. When we set your minds on things above, and not on the things on the earth. For we died, and our life is hidden with Christ in God. The Christian faith is that God has made peace through Jesus 'by the Blood of His Cross' When Christ who is our life appears, then we also will appear with Him in glory.      If youre listening and you dont know Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior, I would be well blessed and honored to pray with you. Always remember, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.My most favorite thing that the Holy Spirit gave me when He wrote this testament is To Be Continued..
Alpha House Inc	153536		/users/profile/204335	Marsha S.	Client Served	5	04/08/2013	I first found out about Alpha House, Inc. at a probation appointment.  I was lost and addicted to pain killers and very depressed.  I began the program in Feb. 2010 and have been better for it.  They really do change lives one woman at a time.  The experience I had while I was there came through to my whole family.  Addiction hurts everyone involved, not just the user.  I was lucky enough to have a family, but lots of the women don't have anyone to turn to and have lost their kids and are in desperate need of a second chance.  It is something that you have to want. You have to work towards it. It is about healing the entire body. Household chores, volunteer work, team work, and learning how to manage money are only the base of what they teach at Alpha House. So much goes into they recovery process.  I have been clean for 3 years and owe it to God and Alpha House.  I am now a wife, new mother, and back in college.  I couldn't have done it with out Teddi and the crew.
Alpha House Inc	153506		/users/profile/204305	Patty24	General Member of the Public	5	04/08/2013	My daughter was a client at Alpha House when it first started.She had been in alot of programs before going to Alpha House that I really didn't have much faith in but this one was different.The first time I walked through the door I could feel the unmeasurable love and desire by the staff to change lives.The people that run this place do it for one reason and thats to share Gods LOVE and help hopeless and sometimes heartless women find peace and a promising future by cleansing them spiritually,mentally,physically and giving them the tools to not live in the past but to live for the future.I have personally witnessed broken women change and become productive,successful,powerful women of God.One thing that really stood out in my mind was the first conversation that I had with the director when I talked to her about my daughter getting into the program and she said WE always pray about who we take into the program and to me that speaks volumes about there faith in God to lead them in the right direction with everything that they do there.My daughters life was changed forever and eternally by going to Alpha House.My daughter was there 4 years ago and by being there she was lead to God !Alpha House works with women to keep them out of jail and hell.They are transforming women's life for their future but also for eternity.My daughter died suddenly a year ago but because she was in this program and gave her life to God , she now lives eternally.The people that run this program were not only there for my daughter but they have also been there for more over the last four years.Thats what they do..they help others,the clients,the community and even the families of past clients.They Give !!!I would love to see them win so that they can continue to grow and change lives forever.This is a small non profit group with a HUGE heart and alot of desire to see others succeed.I can not put into words what a blessing and great place Alpha House is.I think almost every family has someone that is struggling with drug addiction and I can in all honesty say that I would tell them to call Alpha House if they really want there life to be forever changed.I hope you will 2104...I  hope you will pick them too !!!
Alpha House Inc	153498	1	/users/profile/204295	Tracy41	General Member of the Public	4	04/08/2013	I have been around Alpha House since the first day. They give women individual care and attention. They are fully relying on God to lead them in the direction they need to go. I've witnessed many women graduate the program and lead productive lives without the help of any substance. As someone who has battled addiction I know how hard that can be. I also know how much it helps to have a group of people around who are willing and able to answer questions and help you make important, sometimes hard, decisions in life. I personally would like to thank all the people involved in helping to make the lives if others, and their children, better. 
Alpha House Inc	59673		/users/profile/64599	Joella	Client Served	5	01/08/2011	My name is Joella Evans. I graduated Alpha House in November of 2010. As soon as I walked in Alpha House I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit. I was an addict for 10 years. My drug use made me lose everything, including my self dignity, self-respect, and having any kind of love for anyone. At Alpha House I learned that I am not alone. I learned that I have a God that loves me, and is with me at all times. All employees and volunteers at Alpha House have become some of my closest friends. I adore them. They all gave me so much love. I gained so much back in the short time I was there.  I hope some of you will make the choice to go to Alpha House. They will become your sisters in Christ, and they will love you just when you think you can't be loved. God loves us, and He will lead and guide us sometimes through others. Thank you Alpha House for believing in me. I love you.

Alpha House Inc	58340		/users/profile/62030	Diana	Board Member	5	12/01/2010	Alpha House was born of a vison while my sisters and I worked in jail ministry in Anderson County Tennessee.  We saw the incredible need in the community for a place that ladies could go when they left jail to help them get themselves prepared for inclusion back into the community.  We ultimately desired to minister to the spiritual, physical and emotional needs of women through the saving power of Jesus Christ.  The women that come to Alpha House learn skills that enable them make correct decisions.
Alpha House Inc	57931		/users/profile/61397	Kathy F.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/26/2010	Alpha House is an incredicle transitional home for women who have been incarcerated. These women often  have substance ,and/or, alcohol abuse issues, that have led to illegal activities  that  have resulted n them spending  time in jail. They have  often burned bridges with their families  and friends and find themselves in a very bleak situation---one that does not offer hope. Alpha House teaches healing  the inner brokeness  and breaking the bonds of addictions -- through the love of  our Savior, Jesus Christ.  Jesus is the way to end the  cycle of the addiction process and the   bondage that satan has created. Jesus provides restoration to many women through Alpha House.  In a world where the enemy is ever so present--it is ever-so humbling  to be allowed to  see  the miracles performed at Alpha House! Alpha House is a place well worth looking into, visiting, and supporting. Thank You,Lord for such a home in our community!

The House teaches these ladies life skills to enable them to function in society, and grounds them in faith in God.  They have been a blessing to me every time I have been there to teach or just to visit the girls.  These ladies have overcome some dire circumstances to even be alive right now, and it is wonderful to see how God has moved in their lives.

Cumberland County is so fortunate to have so many partner agencies that work together to help children, elderly, low income individuals, abused, and the list goes on & on.  I also serve on the allocation committee and have had the opportunity to speak with most of the agencies United Fund contributes to.  We do this in order to make sure there is no overlapping in services or funding.  We evaluate the service the agency provides, the number of individuals it is serving, the specific use of the funds they are requesting, and much more.  The best part about the United Fund of Cumberland County is that the funds donated to the organization stay in Cumberland County and go to help the people right here at home.

They are highly motivated and their selfless dedication to reach out to those in need is a wonderful "pass it on" experience. How could anyone not be impressed by the personal dedication of Denise Melton of the House of Hope or the mentors and leadership of Kids on the Rise, to name only a few examples.

The history of this community is one of strength, commitment, and dedication to making a better life for the future generations who will call this area home.  Amazingly, during the past 2 or 3 years of extreme unfriendly economic climate, where our economy is based on agriculture, moderate industry, tourism, etc., this community has come together to meet exceptional goals of giving back..to those who have suffered from unemployment, medical catastrophes, and all the backlash that follows and directly affects the families.  Children with parents who cannot find work ( or have abandoned the children and left them in the care of grandparents, etc.) are taking home food in backpacks each Friday afternoon as they leave school to insure they eat over the weekend, elderly folks who live alone in rural areas of the county and try to exist on meager monthly social security checks receive hot meals delivered by smiling, caring faces daily, who receive assistance withuftilities to insure they are protected from the severe weather, those with special needs have access to facilities for training, learning, those who are impacted by catastrophic weather and need emergency shelter, food, etc.   Neighbors helping neighbors, caring, giving...this is what the United Fund of Cumberland County is about!

Tennessee Death Row Dogs	239271		/users/profile/324940	thecalmcanine	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/15/2015	As trainers we have worked with Rescues from all over the US. Without a doubt Tennessee Death Row Dogs is a rare find. They go above and beyond in every way to help save the lives of dogs that no one else will.  These dogs are the ones that other rescues will not even think about taking, and are then  left to die in the shelter.  This Rescue takes these dogs and provides not just basic needs, but finding the best possible home for these dogs in order to secure the future that they deserve. Once they pull a dog they make a commitment to them to do everything in their power to ensure them a warm safe loving environment, and one that will not put them in a shelter the way that their last home did.  A lot of the dogs that are brought into TDRD are not in the best shape  physically or mentally. Some of the dogs have taken several months for them to get back on their feet from their ailments, yet TDRD never gave up on any of them. It is often the opposite, they rally around them. This is to ensure that even though they are in the hospital they feel the love from the the rescue and the volunteers.   They have put different programs in place to help the dogs through this transition period. My favorite program is The Rescue Buddy. This is where the dogs that have been there longer are paired up with a volunteer that will take them out and come see them. It is such an amazing experience to watch these dogs come to life when they are able to get out and just be  dog! Tennessee Death Row Dogs also works with several different trainers based on their needs to help with anything that may need polishing before being placed into a new home. The great thing about this is that you get a different variety of training that is tailored to the dog, instead of just a cookie cutter response. They go to a whole different level to secure the best for these dogs. Every single person that we have been in contact in the rescue has been extremely invaluable with their time, and responses to anything that we have brought to them. They are dedicated to saving the lives of the ones that were forgotten and left behind!

TDRD has done exceptional work since beginning in 2011 and continues to be a reputable rescue in the Middle Tennessee area.  TDRD is an amazing organization to support whether through donations, fostering, volunteering or networking.  They make sound decisions regarding the welfare of the dogs in their care and they have saved hundreds, if not thousands, of dogs from euthanasia and undesirable circumstances.  I also adopted 2 of their dogs that they put through extensive training so that they could be appropriately re-homed and I could not be more pleased with my TDRD fur-babies.

Girls Incorporated of Memphis	84464		/users/profile/93702	pjmask	Client Served	5	03/31/2011	I was a smart young man at Mitchell High School, that really didn't know alot about college. I became an Allstar with Girl Inc. and my life took a turn for better. I learn that it was out their in the world than just Memphis TN. I attended a Math/Science Program at Morehouse College. When I first got their in the summer of 97 I was scared and didn't know what to expect. I took several classes with kids acroos the US, and I felt like I wasn't smart as the kids coming from the other states. I felt my little school Mitchell didn't prepare me for what I was about to experience at Morehouse. So I became a problem child, wouldn't do my work in class because I was afraid to fail. I didn't have the confidence in myself so I just shut down and caused problems. I had to talk to all the administration over the program at Morehouse and I had to talk to William Mathew Jackson who all told me to give it a try for a week or two doing my work and see how i come out. After a week or two I saw that I was just as smart as all the other kids in the programs. I finished the program with 7  awards and a good attitude about myself. I thank Girl Inc. for given me the confidence I needed to say that I'm going to college. I now have a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from Lane College and working on a Master's in Education from the University of Grand Canyon. I would like to say THANK YOU GIRLS INC. and I LOVE YOU ALL.Patrick Jerome Mask

Bright Horizons Foundation for Children	286929		/users/profile/377001	Randy_N	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	In my work in early childhood education I am regularly reminded how fortunate the children who attend our schools are.  They attend beautiful centers where they are taught by wonderful, nurturing teachers, where their classrooms are filled with educational materials and toys and their families are involved in their educational journey.  One day on my way to work, I was stopped at a traffic light where a man and a woman were holding signs asking for money for food or anything that could help them and their children.  It dawned on me that in the very cities where our beautiful schools are located, there are children who through no fault of their own, cannot experience what we have to offer, for they are homeless.  I quickly came up with my idea of The Power of Change.  I went home and emptied the pockets of my pants, searched the bottom of my purses and very quickly came up with more than $25 in spare change.  I made a quick video where I explained my belief that spare change will not be missed, but when amassed together it can truly make a difference.  In a very short period of time The Power of Change raised almost $5,000 for The Bright Horizons Foundation for Children and this money was able to positively impact the lives of homeless families.
Bright Horizons Foundation for Children	286930		/users/profile/377002	Yvonne_L	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Whats more heart-warming than the sight of a small child enjoying the simple pleasures of play?  Think of a toddler laughing endlessly at a pop-up toy, or the quiet joy of a preschooler being read a favorite book.  For 2.5 million homeless children in the U.S. there is little or no opportunity for playtime; a familys belongings have been pared down to what can easily be carried  there are no toys, no books, not even a safe place to play.  The Bright Horizons Foundation for Children (www.brighthorizonsfoundation.org) recognizes that every child deserves to have a safe, warm place in which to learn and play.  These environments are called Bright Spaces, and the Foundation has created hundreds of them all over the U.S., and in the U.K. and Ireland.  I got involved with the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children in the same way as so many of my colleagues did; because the work of the Foundation is woven into the fabric of corporate life at Bright Horizons, there is no way to avoid it!  FUNdraising for the Foundation is a wonderful way of bringing more than 25,000 employees together in a meaningful way  across countries and continents  with a single purpose: To help children and families in crisis.  My first involvement with the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children dates back nearly 8 years ago when my team at work decided to fundraise to create a Bright Space as a team-building exercise.  We have a large team spread all across the country, and it was a wonderful way for us to collaborate on something outside of our day-to-day jobs.  We worked hard on fundraising over a period of about 6 months, and Ill never forget the weekend we all gathered together in Somerville MA to work on the space  clearing and cleaning, painting and unpacking, building and cleaning again.  It was two solid days of hard work, made entirely worth the effort by the pure JOY on the faces of the children the night of the Grand Opening.  We repeated the exercise a couple of years later to create another space at a homeless shelter in New York City, and are currently working on yet another in Colorado! I have two children of my own, 10 nieces and nephews.  I cant imagine what it would be like for them to be homeless, to not have their toys and books, or even a safe place to hang out.  More than anything, THEY are the reason I have, and will continue to support the work of the Bright Horizons Foundation for Children.  
Bright Horizons Foundation for Children	286928		/users/profile/377000	Matt_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	'100 miles for children's smiles' www.brighthorizonsfoundation.org.I signed up to run 100 miles to test the limits of what my mind and body could accomplish. After I signed up for this race, I thought I could really challenge myself to make this a way for me to help others. My company sponsors a foundation, called the Bright Horizons Foundation, that is focused on brightening the lives of children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness and other crises. They do this by creating and supporting Bright Spaces; warm, safe, enriching spaces in homeless shelters and other agencies for children and youth to build caring relationships, heal from trauma through play, and experience the joy of childhood. I was 90 miles into the run, and I wanted to give up. The longest distance I had attempted up to this race was a half-marathon (13.1 miles). As my mind went to that negative place, I started to think about why I had started on this quest and what I was trying to accomplish. I needed to finish this race, not just for myself, but for all the people who believed in me and what I was running for. Many of the kids that use the bright spaces don't have many comforts, and need to have a safe place to just be a kid. I was able to raise $1100 through donations from friends and family, and I was awarded an additional $4000 for a grant that I applied for. That thought powered me through the last grueling 10 miles. I knew that I had to finish because the discomfort I was feeling was nothing compared to what these kids go through. The least I could do was to finish this race and make sure that I could convey the message that, 'if you put your mind into something, that anything is possible!' I want the kids that are able to spend time at our bright spaces to feel uplifted and know that anything is possible.....just like I felt when I crossed that finish line 24 hours and 54 minutes later.
Bright Horizons Foundation for Children	194392		/users/profile/254023	Katie.Cutlip	Volunteer	5	02/17/2014	As a Bright Horizons employee the Foundation is well known and talked about from center to center to classroom to classroom to team member to team member. we know what the Foundation is but until you are involved with the organization of creating a Bright Space you don't truly understand their value and commitment to those less fortunate! I had the opportunity to plan the logistics of a Bright Space we did in the Akron, OH area and it is an experience that has changed the way I view volunteering. The Foundation opened my eyes to the need not only for nurturing and caring as you volunteer in programs but the need to support programs in how they manage, reach out to their community and simply make their programs a success by expanding on the resources available to them. Often times the staff members of these Bright Spaces are simply trying to get through the day by making sure families are clothed, fed, nurtured and safe!  There is not too much time to walk the halls make lists of repairs needed or funds needed or education needed for the children and mothers in crisis. That is where we come in and share our resources, knowledge and "go get it attitude."  So, Thank you Bright Horizons Foundation for supporting me  in my journey to support the Haven of Rest as they grow as a Team, Organization and Community! Katie Cutlip

Bright Horizons staff were thoughtful, helping and supportive throughout, were excellent at using their previous experience to anticipate roadblocks and steer our team around these.

The Bright Space program dramatically impacts  lives by supporting children and families in crisis through the development of caring, inviting, fully stocked play spaces in homeless shelters and in social service agencies serving people in dire need. While supporting the development of six Bright Spaces, I found working with the Foundation staff to be a collaborative and creative endeavor that allowed me to contribute to my broader community in a significant way. With their guidance, my local team and I established play rooms for children waiting in long lines at a local food pantry, a homeless shelter, an agency serving mothers in substance abuse recovery and an agency committed to supporting immigrants in need of social services. The Foundation was with us every step of the way. The Foundation has a very unique vision for serving a very fragile demographic. It is my prilvilege to serve the Foundation!

I saw a need for an afterschool program for at-risk youth in Gallatin/Sumner County, TN -- a place for students to work on homework, get help with their studies, receive a nutritious meal and stay off the streets and out of trouble.  Today, we serve 65 students in grades K-12.  Our services are offered free of charge to the families that we serve. We could help more students but we are limited by the space in the building we occupy.  Our organization is volunteer-based and we do not take any governmental funding -- federal, state or local. My formula for success is  DESIRE + AMBITION + PERSISTENCE = WORK ETHIC.

For CAP no children are left behind, every child is given love, attention, and academic instruction. Each and every child is shown that they are capable of achieving great things through hard work and perseverance.  I cannot think of a better organization to be apart of or a more positive way to effect a child's life than to enhance their educational experience. 
Children Are People, Inc.	86375	2	/users/profile/96686	Prior Bookkeeper	Volunteer	5	04/19/2011	I drove Fred Bailey, Director of Children Are People, INC, on Tuesday nights for 3 or 4 years.  He is blind.  He lives in a different town than the program and used his own money to get to and from his students for several years until volunteers became aware of his mission and drove for him.  He now pays for that service. During that time I became the bookkeeper for Children Are People, INC.  I saw the expenses of running the facility, purchasing adequate vans to transport the students, the cost of a snack and dinner for the students, massive hours donated by van drivers, teachers, specialists who taught professions to Seniors, office help and kitchen workers.  There was an army of volunteers.   When they were not available, Fred was the stand in, mainly in the classroom.  Fred spent non-classroom time out in the community seeking funds to keep his program going and to seek volunteers. Expenses were needed to cover insurance for directors, key man, auto, general liability plus gas for vans, repairs to vans and the facility, meals and snacks and supplies for teaching including desks, chairs, other furniture.  The summer programs required money to send each student to Y camp for a week,  pay students for reading books one summer, and to pay for art classes at the local community college.  Fred gives the students a full spectrum of learning to include the real world.  The Camp staff and the Rental Bus driver who drove the kids to camp all claimed Fred's students were the nicest and most well behaved children of all they had ever worked with.  The graduates are successes due to Fred's strict discipline and accountability teachings. Everyone is responsible for his own future no matter what obstacles cross his path. My husband and I support the program financially now and have helped a CAP graduate enrolled in pre-med at a local college.   Fred used all volunteer teachers until they were burned out and then was able to get grants to hire one or two.   He needs to hire many more. CAPs shortcomings are lack of facility to accept all students on the waiting list and  lack of funds to hire certified teachers to do the tutoring and teaching in this after school program.  It is geared to the less fortunate student who has limited funds and/or limited help at home. I encourage all who are able to give even $10 if that is what you can spare.  I saw for myself how every dollar was appreciated and used wisely to better this generation of children to be productive and mature citizens.   I admire and respect Fred Bailey completely.   His Assistant Director is a marvelous asset also.  She relates to the students, gives a stern but motherly influence, and keeps the fires burning under volunteers and donors to make sure CAP maintains its goals.        Please help CAP survive, especially in these hard economic times.  Your money will not be wasted.

Random Acts of Flowers	244973		/users/profile/332046	PattiMichaud	Volunteer	5	06/10/2015	My name is Patti Michaud and I became a volunteer to this wonderful place.    In December of 2014 my best friends husband passed away suddenly on Christmas day.  Several months went by while I watched her suffer in pain.   Unfortunately,  for my friend because of the stress of her husbands death she herself was admitted to Trinity Hospital.  She was extremely depressed and badly dehydrated ( she said too many tears) .  I called her the 3rd day in the hospital and to my surprise she sounded so good.  She was so happy someone sent her flowers.  I asked her who, she read the card and it said RAF and was signed by the volunteer who created this beautiful arrangement for her.  Ironically, when I went to visit her I spotted someone who was delivering the flowers and asked about volunteering.  From that moment I decided I wanted to do something that made people happy, I do other volunteer work but some of it is very sad - helping to feed the poor.  This type of volunteering makes me happy,  when I walk out I know I made someone happy and let them know there are people like those volunteers at RAF are out there and do care

Something as simple as a flower and a minute to say hello can bring an important ray of hope to someone.  
Random Acts of Flowers	244825	2	/users/profile/331844	colleenham	Volunteer	5	06/08/2015	At first, I wondered why I was going to volunteer working with flowers. I have zero experience arranging flowers. But, like most people, I love them. It took no time for other Random Acts of Flowers volunteers to share their knowledge & various tips. Within minutes of arranging for the very first time, I was in Love! I loved all the flowers, I loved making arrangements, I loved the other volunteers, and I especially loved knowing that my attempts at creating arrangements were going to bring such joy. I've volunteered over the years at area assisted living facilities, so I know that in Pinellas Co., FL, there are so many elderly living alone in asst. living, having lost their spouse, and with no family in the state or nearby. I thought about some of the elderly I've known over the years & I could easily imagine how genuinely thrilled they would be to receive flowers, especially if they were in the hospital or recovering from an illness without loved ones to soften their heartache. I never imagined that I would become a recipient of a marvelous bouquet of Random Acts of Kindness Flowers. 6 months after I began volunteering for RAF, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  One of the most stunning floral arrangements, and filled with so much love & support, was from RAF Pinellas. I will always remember the power of that feeling, when you are suffering & scared, to know that people are thinking of you & sending you positive thoughts. I'll always remember RAF Pinellas & our volunteers for thinking of me.  I've now returned to volunteering arranging with RAF. A few weeks ago, my teenage daughter & I delivered to an assisted living home where we've volunteered for 12 years. To be able to witness the thrill & true joy of the residents when they saw a floral arrangement was made & delivered just for them, well, I can't wait to be able to spread that kind of joy again soon by delivering more RAF!!! My volunteer time at RAF Pinellas is always my favorite time of every week! Colleen

Random Acts of Flowers	244612		/users/profile/331563	Mikig20	Client Served	5	06/04/2015	I am a single mother of 3 who has spent the last 15 years fighting for my life. I have battled 3 rounds of cancer- surgeries and treatments and major lung problems- including MRSA pneumonias and asthma. I spend 2-3 weeks in the hospital at least twice a year. In Feb of 2012 I was hospitalized with a MRSA flare and severe bronchitis and was struggling to recover. I had been in the hospital for over 2 weeks and was pretty lonely. 2 of my daughters were off in college and the last one was in high school- and I was there alone. I wasn't bouncing back the way I normally did, and was getting discouraged. I was looking out the window on a pretty bleak February day when my nurse came in with the most beautiful vase of peach and yellow roses, and there was a card that said "courtesy of the Brewer family" on the back and an explanation of the mission of Random Acts of Flowers.  I can't begin to tell you how much those flowers lifted my spirits and revived my "fight"...the flowers continued to brighten up my home for over a week after I was discharged- but they have continued to brighten up my heart for much longer than that. It's hard to explain how something so simple as some brightly colored blooms can create a complete attitude change in someone who is tired and physically in a place where they are no longer in charge of their own care. I learned that Random Acts of Flowers takes donated flowers from events, weddings and funerals and recycles them to bring joy and encouragement to patients in hospitals, nursing homes and rehab centers. As someone who has been a recipient of that joy and encouragement, I can't thank them enough- and am so grateful to Larsen Jay and his army of volunteers for bringing hope to my heart!

Almost Home Animal Rescue Of Rutherford County	322864		/users/profile/130906	Almost Home	Board Member	5	02/08/2017	Birkhead53, your account is simply not true, nor does it make sense.  Your initial contact was made how exactly?  It sounds as though it was either in person or via email, because you later state you called to "ask her what the problem was and was cussed out."     Almost Home does not have a published number, so this is not possible, nor do we have any reason to curse at someone who is simply making a request.   Use of the terms DNA and DNR don't exactly apply here, as we are an adoption agency, we are not looking to adopt.  Interesting use of terminology though.   I suspect you to be one of the individuals who was found to be trying to adopt under false pretenses.  We do utilize several methods to verify adopter information as well as legal residence, so it is likely you are one of our applicants from this summer who was denied adoption due to a fraudulent application.  It's unfortunate that just anyone can come on the internet and make such claims, but our reputation is stellar.  
Almost Home Animal Rescue Of Rutherford County	101663	1	/users/profile/130906	Almost Home	Board Member	5	12/05/2011	The above reviewer was denied adoption based on the facts she presented in her initial email.  Neither her current residence (no fence) nor her proposed future residence (outside adoption area) met our adoption criteria.  Her disability was not disclosed, so it is impossible to have used that in making a decision.  She continued to ask irrelevant questions, which had no relevance or bearing in the adoption decision.  This is simply a disgruntled individual with a bit too much time on her hands.

Almost Home Animal Rescue Of Rutherford County	202526	1	/users/profile/264239	horsemac1	Client Served	5	06/11/2014	I adopted a dog from Almost Home in 2011 and have followed them since that time.  I am impressed that a group of volunteers has been able to accomplish all that they have.  They are by far the most professionally run rescue I have ever encountered.  Thoroughly impressed with all that they do!

Almost Home Animal Rescue Of Rutherford County	162092	2	/users/profile/215114	HopeO	General Member of the Public	1	07/05/2013	On or around 03/05/13 I signed up for the Almost Home Animal Rescue plate and submitted a payment of $38.00, hopefully to help bring about this plate because it is a wonderful cause.   I have since phoned and sent emails to this company to try and find out what is going on with this plate, as they have absolutely no information on their website that states the status of this plate.  They will not return my phone call nor will they answer my emails.  It makes me think that this is some type of scam and that I will never see the plate nor my money.   All I want is someone to return my call/email and let me know what is going on.  Have they reached the 1000 plate max yet?  Are they close?  Are they going to give me my money back, which I did request if the plate does not happen?   All I want is some courtesy and a response.  If they don't want to be bothered with me then give me back my money and I'll just go my merry way!  As it stands now, NO! I would not recommend this company to anyone!  Not when they treat me as though I do not exist.  I hope they treat the animals in their care better than they do humans. They have  A LOT TO LEARN when it comes to customer relations!   Hope Ogden
Almost Home Animal Rescue Of Rutherford County	101642	4	/users/profile/130770	his_sexy_beast	General Member of the Public	1	12/04/2011	I was extremely disappointed and in some ways disgusted with my experience with this "rescue". The person who responded to my e-mailed inquiry on a dog was very rude and insulting. She clearly has issues with disabled individuals. I have dealt with dozens of shelters and breeders in my life time, and never have I met somebody so arrogant, hateful, and unprofessional. Some of her responses reminded me of an ill-tempered 12 year old. They may have a fancy website, and pretty write-ups on their animals, but clearly the people running this place have issues and do not have the best interests of the animals in mind. I will never seek them out for a future adoption, nor will I ever recommend them to anybody else.
Book'em	302332	2	/users/profile/393458	MASPilcher	Volunteer	5	09/01/2016	I worked for Book'em and am now a volunteer. Book'em is a very small nonprofit that is making a big difference with children in Metropolitan Nashville. We give books to children who don't have books of their own to have at home. Research shows that children with books at home are better readers. One special program of Book'em is giving 5 books to every child who moves into a new Habitat for Humanity house. The books are wrapped up with ribbons and bows with a gift card and are waiting in the house for them. What a wonderful surprise for them! I love helping to pick out the books for these children.Martha Ann

Through its Reading is Fundamental program, as well as collaborations with other national and local organizations, Book'em is able to distribute thousands of books to underprivileged children -- many of whom would otherwise not have books of their own. An enthusiasm for reading is a lifelong gift that Book'em gives to countless children each year.
Book'em	53366		/users/profile/54488	mcs1	Volunteer	5	09/26/2010	RIF is a fine organization, and RIF Nashville's chapter is a truly fabulous one in that our approach is to build a relationship between a reading volunteer and a classroom that involves 5 visits during a school year and the chance for kids to not only hear 5 stories (just for fun) but to choose 5 books with which to begin building their personal library.  Because the children we serve often do not own ANY books besides the ones we give them, this is very exciting for them.
Book'em	53298	1	/users/profile/54386	reading-lady	Client Served	5	09/24/2010	The Book Em organization has provided many opportunities for the students in my school building to receive books for each student's birthday.  This organization send reader/volunteers to my school throughout the school year to read to students in grades K-2.  After the volunteer finishes reading the students are able to select a book of their choice to take home.  Our students have such wonderful libraries at home due to Book Em promoting literacy.  Book Em is a great organization and I have enjoyed every moment of the four years of working with them.

Reading to 2nd graders is very rewarding and they are always so happy to see you and the books that you bring them.  I would encourage anyone with a love for children and reading to volunteer.  It is only about four hours a month and is very rewarding.
Book'em	53247		/users/profile/54328	aynot	Volunteer	5	09/24/2010	I highly encourage anyone who is looking for a rewarding way to give back to the community to consider Book'em.  I do not have children of mine own yet, however I have always loved reading and feel that all children should own books. In the fall of 2009 I was assigned my first reading classroom. I was nervous at first, but the Book'em staff was supportive and provided me with lots of training and contact information so that I never felt alone.  I read aloud to the class of 20 children 5 times during the 2009-2010 school year.  At each visit I would bring a variety of brand new books from the Bookem library, so that each child could select a book of their very own to take home. The children were so sweet and excited to see me everytime. They enjoyed our story time together even if they already knew every word of the book that I was planning on reading to them.  It was a lot of fun and I look forward to reading to another class this year.

However, after repeated deployments, no one knew just how damaging. But one organization was prepared and forward thinking in the fight to help our military community. That organization is Courage Beyond. From counseling services for my entire family, to online support, to in-person interaction, Courage Beyond is at the front, leading. There is not other organization I would rather work with.

They suffer from all sorts of issues because of their time spent at war, ranging from PTSD and anxiety to just the struggles of transitioning to home life after a deployment. Courage Beyond is working hard to be a free and confidential place where military and their families can come to get counseling and other services to support them and help them cope with the issues they face as a result of military service. It's always great to work at an event hosted by Courage Beyond and know that it is helping to raise awareness and funding to serve our troops. I encourage anyone interested to get involved!

The staff excels at pairing the right counselor with each person that needs services. The online moderators work around the clock to make sure the community is taken care of with dignity and true support. The peers are always willing to listen or to offer support, even if the support ends up coming from another nonprofit! I've loved being a part of the movement to destigmatize the hidden wounds of military service.

Faces Of Hope Childrens Therapy Center	85967		/users/profile/96083	Kathryn G.	Volunteer	5	04/15/2011	I entered Faces of Hope one afternoon in August two years ago, looking for a non-profit where my oldest son and I could volunteer. My son is on the Autism spectrum and needed to resocialize, after spending the last 2 1/2 years of high school in home-bound, due to health issues. Thanks to their open welcome, my son has once again bloomed into the gregarious person he was before jr. High. We've seen miracles happen for other families at Faces of Hope; Many from Just Knowing they weren't out there ALONE any more, and being different IS OK. Celebrate differences and encourage strenghts!They need greater exposure in the media, so other families know that the center is OPEN and AVAILABLE to help them.

We're a small organization with big aspirations and we're learning as we go! Our staff and volunteers are compassionate, genuine individuals.

This is exactly the kind of Koolaid DU gives it's volunteers. If you really want to find out how bad DU is, go talk to someone that used to work for them. It does not bode well for an organization when all former employees bad mouth the organization. DU has become the laughing stock of the "critter" non profits. There are so many better, ethical organizations for you guys to volunteer for and support. It's a miracle that Charity Navigator even gave them 2 stars.
Ducks Unlimited Inc	148116		/users/profile/154823	jack reynolds	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/15/2013	As a former employee of DU, I would bet that Ducks Unlimited is the most corrupt non-profit in America. All of their good employees and lead volunteers have left; their membership nationwide has dropped so low they will not publish the numbers; they cook their books so hard it would make the former CFO of Enron blush and  their biologists understand that, because their projects are so small in scope, they have no impact on helping waterfowl - They simply can not handle "landscape" size initiatives like The Nature Conservancy. The only reason DU exists is to provide salaries to 6 executives, 50 support employees and about 40 biologists. Anyone who thinks DU really has a mission that involves waterfowl and wetlands conservation is just kidding themselves. It is so sad and unfortunate how the volunteers are duped. If any of the hunting magazines need information on waterfowl numbers or conservation, they go to Delta Waterfowl - DU has disappeared as an authoritative source. DU is truly a despicable and unethical organization. 
Ducks Unlimited Inc	149694	1	/users/profile/199593	Ducksupporter1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/20/2013	Referencing the highly inaccurate/deceptive review by Jack Reynolds on this site: Per my research, there is no former DU employee by that name. DU is very proud of their 544,086 adult members found across the U.S., and does publish that figure quite regularly. DU financials are carefully audited and verified each year. Further, DU's staff, supporters, partners and thousands of volunteers have conserved more than 13 million acres of wetlands and associated habitats in the organization's 76 years. DU is among the largest, mort effective and most respected conservation organizations in the world, and the more than 1/2 million members of DU couldn't be more proud. Those facts are accurate. Mr. Reynold's review is so inaccurate and misleading that it should be removed immediately as a false review.

They accepted $500K in funds to help people but they only will accept 3 or 4 people a week in Johnson City and are currently closed due to "lack of funds."  They are known to have close ties to Kingsport Housing with Board members being from Kingsport Housing which appears to be a conflict of interest since most of their services seem to go to Kingsport Housing.
Appalachian Regional Coalition On Homelessness Inc	22787	11	/users/profile/23782	WHT1c	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/17/2009	ARCH has been a godsend to our area of Northeast TN. Before its inception, there was little consistent regional advocacy, and coordination of services for the homeless and others in need. Since coming on the scene, ARCH has been the catalyst behind bringing a diverse group of concerned individuals, community service providers, government agencies,area churches and schools, and others together, on a routine basis, to passionately and creatively address the needs of the homeless and others. To highlight: ARCH has provided leadership with identifying and a variety of complex problems related to homelessness, both at the local and regional level; ARCH personnel and volunteers have written and coordinated the writing of many new successful grant proposals. The funds from these grants have led to the creation of/and expansion of housing programs,and many community services for the homeless and others at risk; and, ARCH routinely coordinates HUD-mandated point-in-time count projects and makes the data collected available for use by member agencies. Our region benefits in so many ways from the efforts of ARCH.
Appalachian Regional Coalition On Homelessness Inc	22760	18	/users/profile/23763	melissa	Volunteer	5	11/16/2009	Hello, I would like to share a story about a woman I once knew. Her name is Missy. Many years ago, she was living on the streets, addicted to drugs and alcohol. She wasn't always homeless and did not choose the life she was living. In her previous life, things were much different. Missy was a single mother raising her 8 year old son, working full time as a certified nursing assistant. Things were pretty rough at times but she always seemed to manage and figure out a way to get by. Unfortunately, things changed drastically in her life. Missy lost her job and sebsequently lost her home, therby forcing to make some of the hardest decisions she would ever have to make. Because her relationship with her parents was always strained she was forced to leave her son with them. Nothing seemed to matter to Missy after that day. Missy ended up living in 6 states, just surviving. She lived on the streets, sleeping in aisles,parks, cars, tents, and rest areas. She ate out of trash cans and even stole food. After some kids had been taunting her and throwing rocks at her. She suddenly had no reason to live, no purpose. She had planned to bring it all to an end. As it turned out, God had other things in store. I can share this story with you because this woman I once knew was "ME". I told you this story because God gave me the opportuntiy to be blessed. I don't feel like a victim. "I feel victorious because of people like Arch and other agencies that have been such a big part of my like. That cared about that hurt person, instead of closing their eyes to it! I got a second chance to be a productive citizen because of people like you who care about people like me, just "Ordinary me". I don't have to say, PLEASE GOD WHY! anymore. I know why: Because I am fearless and wonderfully made!! Since then I have earned my bachelors degree in criminal justice,and social work. I am now employed working in the helping field as a case worker. I also recently purchased my first home with the help of Arch and eastern eight. sometimes All you need is someone to believe in you! Thank you, could never be enough. Melissa

My knowledge was limited at the time but I have since, in recent years, become much more aware of the wonderful impact they are having, not only in the local community, but throughout the northeast Tennessee region.  In 2007, I was appointed to attend monthly ARCH meetings at the request of my supervisor at Tennessee Community Services Agency. Through these meetings,my volunteer work with point-in-time and the 2008 Gala planning, I have witnessed an organization brimming with passionate and concerned leaders who have unified in one accord to bring hope and relief to those suffering from homelessness in our area.  I am amazed at how far the organization has come and at how many lives have been impacted since the inception. I hold ARCH, the Board and members in highest regard and look forward to seeing many more individuals and families set free from the grip of homelessness through the mission and efforts of this wonderful organization.

I was lost and helpless after trying so many ways to make my husband take me back. One day at work, i was absent minded not knowing that my boss was calling me, so he sat and asked me what its was all about i told him and he smiled and said that it was not a problem. I never understand what he meant by it wasn't a problem getting my husband back, he said he used a spell to get his wife back when she left him for another man and now they are together till date and at first i was shocked hearing such thing from my boss. He gave me an email address of the great spell caster who helped him get his wife back, i never believed this would work but i had no choice that to get in contact with the spell caster which i did, and he requested for my information and that of my husband to enable him cast the spell and i sent him the details, but after two days, my mom called me that my husband came pleading that he wants me back, i never believed it because it was just like a dream and i had to rush down to my mothers place and to my greatest surprise, my husband was kneeling before me pleading for forgiveness that he wants me and the kid back home, then i gave Happy a call regarding sudden change of my husband and he made it clear to me that my husband will love me till the end of the world, that he will never leave my sight.

I knew the leader of this organization for about 20 plus years. She's is confident in what she does. For the 8 years I have been part of this organization, it has grown tremendously. In 2008, at a young lady's home-going celebration, she brought in about 17 young men and women at one time. This organization gives you a better look on life decisions and how to maintain them without having  evil and fatal thoughts. Vision Temple will feed homeless people and actually let them be a part of the organization without any stipulations. I have learned how to inner-act with different kinds of people because the organization is built on LOVE, FRIENDLINESS, AND HAPPINESS. I knew I would become a better person because within 20 years I knew the leader, she has always gain a lot more than she has lost. The funny thing is that the things she lost, it was for the better as we saw later on down the road. The results of this journey is that we have gain better attitudes, better hearts and souls, better understanding, traveling to show others how to operate in love, friendliness, and happiness...
Vision Temple Ecumenical Church	12003	1	/users/profile/13985	Lolitha Barbee	Volunteer	5	10/05/2009	This is a wonderful church to attend in the Raleigh Community.  Pastor Pearl Lurry is very spontaneous.  You never know what direction she'll be coming from with her sermons.  She's preached in semi-cheerleading attire, cheering for the lord.  She's also dressed as a ragged bag lady teaching the congregation to leave the baggage behind.  She is a pillar in the community with Programs such as The Agape Feast for The Homeless, The Vision Stars of Christ, and Christian clothing and shoe give aways to the needy.

Challenged Athletes Playing Equally	136921		/users/profile/182870	Lisa175	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	Both of my kids play sports with CAPE.  My son has autism, and daughter has Aspergers, and both love CAPE!  They look forward to their Saturday sports - They've played bowling, soccer, hockey, and basketball.  Both of kids had tried sports previously, and rather unsuccessfully.  At CAPE, everyone is accepted and met at their level - and it's amazing how much these kids can do when someone believes in them and gives them the opportunity!
Challenged Athletes Playing Equally	136916		/users/profile/182865	Rick R.	Board Member	5	11/10/2012	Opportunities.  That is what CAPE is all about.  When children have spent years watching on the sidelines while their brother, sister, friend and classmate play on the field.  When they spent hours watching on television and wishing they had a chance to play.  Now is their chance.  Now is their opportunity.  Now is the time for children with special needs to show that games are for playing and they can have just as much fun as any other child.
Challenged Athletes Playing Equally	136898		/users/profile/182848	Suzanne31	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	The CAPE organization has helped my daughter, who has autism, make friends and learn how to play basketball, baseball, soccer and she just won a CAPE bowling tournament!

All About Women	47836	5	/users/profile/48621	melissa901	General Member of the Public	5	07/07/2010	I went to the All About Women event last year, thinking that I was a very healthy 54-year-old woman. I decided to take advantage of all the free tests that Vanderbilt Medical Center was offering since my cousin had been diagnosed with osteoporosis. The good news was that all of the tests were good, except that my blood sugar was through the roof at 490! I couldn't believe it - and neither could they since I felt fine. They said I could have easily gone into a diabetic coma and immediately got me signed up at the Vanderbilt Eskind Diabetes Center where I was officially diagnosed with type 1 diabetes! I don't think I would have gone in for blood sugar testing, as I felt good and no one in my family has had diabetes. So the All About Women event saved my life! It's a wonderful event that I will forever be grateful of!

I wanted to be more prepared so I went online for support groups... and found Tiny Handprints.  Stephanie and the rest of the team are AMAZING!  They kept in touch with me during that first year, sending me little cards and books to help me journey through my grief... and read my rambling middle of the night e-mails.  To be brutally honest, if it wasn't for Tiny Handprints, I don't know that I would be a stable individual today... they keep me grounded still and are always there when I need them!

I lost my job of 24 yrs due to being by his bedsideDuring this time my daughter was pregnant and gave birth to a beautiful baby boy Logan Raymond Gould. Logan was our saving grace from this terrifying event we were going through with my son. 8 months later my daughter got the call while at work her son Logan was blue and was transported to the hospital.

In a time of darkness and personal despair, I found Tiny Handprints. They sent me printed materials about things I could do to cope, stories of others who had been in the same situations, and information on what was going on, even though I didnt have all the answers. They have provided so much to my family in my time of need, so I actively try to promote it to others who are in need, and I have plans of someday trying to help donate to this charity, to try to bring it to every family that needs a little faith, hope, love, and support.

Tiny Handprints found me, and went out of their way to make sure I had everything (reading material, people to talk to, etc) I possibly could imagine to help me begin to grieve. I haven't done much more than read the information given to me; but would recommend them anytime to someone who just needs some support, and isn't sure about anything. After my son died, it was a day at a time with going forward with life, and everytime I get to read the book and information I've recieved FREE from them, without asking- I know I have as much support as I could want each day.

Mental Health Association Of Middle Tennessee	311102	1	/users/profile/402440	Annavija	Board Member	5	10/16/2016	Mental Health America of Middle Tennessee is a top notch organization. I was fortunate enough to be introduced to them over two years ago by a colleague, and have been continually impressed with their resources, professionalism, and welcoming attitude. When I began suffering from excessive anxiety and panic attacks in 2015, I called them directly for help. I didn't even know what I needed, I just knew I needed help. They were able to direct me to several qualified psychologists, helped me with insurance resources, and followed up to make sure I got the care I needed. On a personal note, the staff is the most hard working, dedicated, and authentic non-profit team I have ever worked with. They truly care about what they do and go above and beyond everyday to find new and greater ways to help people, whether it's getting a multi-year grant, or just sending flowers to someone who needs a little extra support. I am honored to be a part of this organization.

Global Village Institute	36209	4	/users/profile/36897	solar-smith	Board Member	5	04/20/2010	In ways obvious and subtle, Albert has provided a golden compass in identifying, creating, and promoting key technologies, both new and ancient, necessary to the survival of species in the coming Post Anthropocene era. GVI is a nonprofit focused on appropriate technologies that are as low-tech as possible, using local materials and labor, durable, multi-tasking, cost-effective, and with the lowest ecological impact. As such, AT embodies the ideals of permaculture at its core. As an amateur tinkerer in this kind of AT, GVI has been a home for my soul for several years. There I have found comradeship, guidance, help, and a sounding board / laboratory with kindred spirits. In particular, Albert Bates is a world-class polymath, one of the most brave and generous people I have met. Albert doesnt dispense millions of dollars which have an effect today and are gone tomorrow; his tireless efforts for decades are dedicated to the natural rights of the planet and its less fortunate inhabitants, through the Ecovillage Training Center and frequent travels teaching and exemplifying permaculture, natural construction, solar and biomass technologies, conflict resolution, ecovillage design, and sponsoring the creation of myriad ecovillages worldwide.One thing I have learned by associating with GVI-AT: beyond merely surviving, we can recreate a paradise on Earth, one piece at a time. Indeed, thats the only way we could make it, because the Earth is reverting to paradise, with or without us.
Global Village Institute	36186	4	/users/profile/36972	lioraadler	Board Member	5	04/19/2010	My first connection to GVI was when I was co-coordinating a project in South America beginning in 1996.  GVI was totally supportive of our work and several times donated much needed money to enable us to organize workshops, conferences and large gatherings for people who were hungry for knowledge and experience but short of economic resources.   GVI acted as the fiscal sponsor for the first Women's Peace Village gathering in Ecuador, bringing together 40 women leaders from every corner of the country. GVI was an early supporter of Gaia University, now in its 5th year with both financial support and mentoring.  Now as a member of the Board I can testify to the excellent work and leadership of GVI in the fields of the development appropriate technology, the building of authentic community and the dissemination of the important information contained in permaculture design.  Top of the charts!

The second visit lasted for several weeks, and in that time I came to a deeper appreciation of the unity and integration of the site planning. The GVIFAT provides a much-needed standing example of community design principles that will allow for an increased quality of life for people living in a future marked by contracting access to energy and the economic and industrial activity that cheap fossil fuel energy makes possible. The value of this tangible exemplar cannot be overstated.
Global Village Institute	35474	5	/users/profile/36305	screenname1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/11/2010	My long background in energy, going back to the early 1970s, allows me to appreciate what "appropriate technology" is or should be.  The other part of the name of any group recognizing the need for villages globally, while we are all connected, also reveals the worthwhile vision of the organization.My direct experience with GVIAT is that of a supported nonprofit leader who needed understanding and assistance.  This is exactly what has been provided, and I hope I have provided support and positive exposure in return.
Global Village Institute	35421	5	/users/profile/36215	albert1	Board Member	5	04/10/2010	As a co-founder of this organization, I can only say why it has stuck around for more than 35 years -- because it continues to stay relevant to changing circumstances. Our original vision was "Out to Save the World." That has never changed. What has changed is our strategy, tactics, and how we comprehend the non-linear, transgenerational, trans-species lifeform we call "the world." It ain't about us, the humans, any more. It is about the existence of life in this corner of the Universe. What stupidity could make much worse, could, with intelligence and creativity, be made much better. As we say in Permaculture, "the problem is also the solution." GVI is solution-oriented.

These Plenty Projects took place in Central America (Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Nicaragua) and the Caribbean (Dominica). This organization is extremely dedicated to helping the less fortunate with food and nutrition programs as well as medical assistance and training.   Understanding that development projects may take years to become established, several of the senior staff have devoted their lives and livelihoods to see these projects through to fruition.

It operates on a village scale and typically stays with a project for many years. It is supported by just a few thousand donors and family foundations who value Plenty for its track record of hands-on commitment and integrity. Plenty has developed a special expertise in introducing vegetable proteins, especially non-GMO soybean agriculture and food processing to populations experiencing under nutrition as well as in working with children and indigenous cultures.
Plenty International	164678		/users/profile/218871	gaylagroom	General Member of the Public	1	08/12/2013	Peter Schweitzer, director of Plenty International, stole my house!! For details go to indiegogo and search for "help me take back my house" and see info below: What happens when a nonprofit corporation decides it wants to change its mission but poverty-level old people have built homes on the corporation's land, in accordance with its original mission? The corporation evicts the old people  without compensating them for their houses.  Stephen and Ina May Gaskin are both counterculture heroes, both recipients of the Right Livelihood Award and the Counterculture Hall of Fame Award. He's known for being the charismatic schoolbus caravan guru who started the Farm in Summertown, Tennessee, in 1972  the longest lasting of all the intentional communities to come out of the 60s  and for his dozen books on spiritual and political topics, including Cannabis Spirituality. Ina May, author of the classic Spiritual Midwifery and a popular international lecturer, has been called "the most famous midwife in the world."  I served as Stephen's assistant for eight years, ending in 2011, spending hours every day with him, often in his and Ina May's bedroom/workspace, where he worked from bed like a king. I also helped Ina May with her midwifery projects, and the three of us enjoyed an intimate and steadfast friendship.  Stephen was deposed from leadership of the Farm in 1983, although he continued to live there and be revered by most members. In 1992, he aimed to relive his ruling status by starting another community next door on 100 acres, setting up a nonprofit corporation called Rocinante (where I lived) with the intention of creating a place where old hippies could retire and eventually experience high-quality deaths. The project made little progress over the years, partly because of provisions that residents would build their own houses (or have them built) and then donate the houses to Rocinante upon their deaths. Over the years, only five houses were built, and Stephen assured residents that if they needed to sell their houses, they could.  Since residents more or less worshipped Stephen, and since Stephen was supposed to be infinitely trustworthy (an "ascended master"), no one ever asked for anything in writing, until some new folks arrived in 2010.  When I left the Farm in 2011 (a story in itself), Rocinante was in the process of drawing up deeds and community regulations to formalize the unwritten agreements that had been operating for years.  Concurrently, Stephen began dropping into senility.   The Rocinante Board of Directors at that time included Stephen and Ina May, Stephen's daughter Dana Gaskin Wenig, and Pamela Hunt, head of the Farm Midwifery School, and Peter Schweitzer, executive director of nonprofit Plenty International.  With residents demanding their rights, and with me now living in Mexico and Stephen losing his memory, the Board circled their wagons and stopped talking to Rocinante residents.   I had induced my friend Rick to build a house at Rocinante, and he spent six years doing so. In 2011, he became disillusioned with Rocinante and wanted to leave, as did the new folks who'd arrived in 2010. The Board went to extraordinary lengths to keep them from selling their houses. Apparently, the Board had decided, without consulting residents, to "stop doing the old people thing" and to instead use Rocinante for the Farm Midwifery School (thus avoiding liability issues on the Farm). Unfortunately, there were a few old people cluttering up the place, and they wanted to be paid for their houses.  By May 2011 I was back at Rocinante squatting at Rick's house through the summer, trying to help resolve the hateful situation that had developed, but since I had taken the stance that the Rocinante residents had a right to the property they had built, no one on the Board would talk to me. Stephen and Ina May reportedly told some mind-blowing lies blaming me for their errors (for instance, saying I had hidden a lawyer's letter from Stephen, when in fact I had read it to him (he's mostly blind) and we'd then had a two-hour meeting with the lawyer to discuss it). As Stephen's senility increased, he made things up out of whole cloth, and believed them, and those around him chose to believe him also,  when it suited them.  There was a lot of drama over the summer, including a heated protest outside the Farm store and a contract signed by Stephen and then torn up in residents' faces by Dana Gaskin Wenig. One resident was nearly driven to suicide by powerlessness in the face of Rocinante's refusal to deal with critical issues.  Finally, in August 2011, Rick was able to sell his house, despite some world-class skullduggery from the Rocinante Board of Directors. The BOD signed a separate agreement with the buyers (specifying that they could not sell the house and that their interest in the house expired at their deaths).  But in May 2012, the Rocinante BOD sent Stephen and Ina May's son Sam Gaskin  a super-buff Brazilian street fighting champion  to evict Rick's buyers. They left, with the impression that it had been Rick who evicted them, and still owing $17,000 on the house purchase contract.  Rick found out about the eviction only when he hired a collection agency for nonpayment from the buyers. He then wrote Peter Schweitzer of the Rocinante BOD, who replied he had nothing to say to Rick.  I recently learned that on Christmas Eve 2011, Sam had similarly evicted Donnie Rainbolt, one of the earliest Rocinante residents, who was returning, after successful surgeries, to the cabin he'd built there. He was told that his cabin was going to be used to house students of the midwifery school. When he requested compensation, he was told absolutely not. He is trying to get permission to live on the Farm, but without reimbursement for his house he didn't have enough money to qualify. Donnie died in fall 2012, heartbroken.  Only one Rocinante resident remains. Her house is contractor-built (worth maybe $70,000), unlike the houses of the folks who were evicted (worth an estimated $10,000 and $25,000). She is afraid to step out of line lest she too be evicted.  The deeper you look into the Rocinante massacre, the more jaw-dropping it becomes  everywhere you look, there is level after level of deceit and hateful, self-serving, egomaniacal behavior on the part of people who were supposed to be the purest, kindest, most evolved and humanitarian of what Earth has to offer.  Meanwhile, the Farm continues feeling good about itself as it works to better the plight of the oppressed around the world, utterly ignoring the corporation that stole everything old people built with their own sweat, the only assets they had in the world, the plank in its eye next door.
Plenty International	60711		/users/profile/66101	danielarmendariz	Volunteer	5	01/22/2011	I am a volunteer with Plenty Austin, a local arm of Plenty International.  Plenty is a wonderful organization that finds its roots in the well known hippie community known as The Farm.  As their website states: Plenty believes "that all life is connected and how we live affects the world [...]". Plenty helps establish nutritional programs in Latin American countries where, often, the poorest peoples do not enjoy an adequate daily food regimen.  As i understand it, Plenty is based upon the simple proposition that there is "plenty" of enough resources for all to enjoy.  They work to realize this worthy ideal.

Beyond Bars Animal Rescue	272998		/users/profile/362163	Writer	General Member of the Public	2	11/27/2015	HEARTBROKEN New to the area, I found a puppy online that I wanted to adopt. I was directed to this website, downloaded the application, and waited to hear back. About a week later, a volunteer (Heidi) brought the dog by for us to meet each other. I assumed she was leaving the puppy and I offered to pay her for it. She said I would receive a bill; if I paid the next day, she would bring the dog by, since I seemed suitable. I work from home, had no other pets at the time, own my house, have a large back yard.I tried phoning the director  Whitney the next day, and several times since I left messages for both of them. I also left an email message for the shelter.I was hurt, disappointed and heartbroken. At the very least, I feel I deserved an explanation.

I've seen their work in Thailand and was impressed with the quality of their care for orphans.  Their care includes meeting the physical, mental and emotional needs of the kids in their homes.  DI is great about updating donors regarding their work and I've found them to be very accessible to any questions I've had.  They are really on the cutting edge of serving in SE Asia in that they work in areas where most can't or won't.  It has been a privilege to be involved as a donor!

I think Kim and I may just be kindred sisters at heart!!  She has the most amazing spirit and I am just in awe of the way she touches so many lives by assisting in their healing process.  I recently learned a child I fostered last year had been through a group therapy program at Mane Support and guess who her instructor was...

Its really such a small world.  I am just beginning to learn what Mane Support does and who they serve but I know they fill a need that can't be found anywhere else for hundreds of miles.

Mane Support offers a unique approach to improving the lives of people by integrating wonderful equines into their programs. The people who come together and provide the structure for the organization are experienced, open, friendly and very understanding individuals.

I would help during the year, but I have to go to my school out of state. Anyways, I enjoy volunteering for Mane support because it fills a special place in my heart. I know I am helping the community even if it is scooping poop and filling water buckets. My job creates a clean and inviting atmosphere for the patients who interact with the horses. Therefore, I intend on volunteering in any way I can as long as I can. By the way, The Mane support stables are the cleanest stables I have ever seen!!!

The staffs kindness and encouragement also circles around you.  And then their are the magnificent presence of the horses. Being a city girl, this was new to me.   Horses pick up on your inner emotions and while working with them you begin to feel healing.   Amazing,  all that is weaved together within  " Mane Support " that gives out so much healing and safeness.     Eventually I became a volunteer and I am so grateful to be part of Mane Support and all they give, with their hearts, in helping others....Please donate what you are able, to help this organization continue to reach out to hurting people.

While I expected to be treated nice and professional, I was blown away by the kindness of the staff.  It is as if you become family, you can see the care, concern, and compassion that they put into every project.  Kim Henry does a wonderful job of balancing her various roles and keeping a well educated, respected, and motivated staff.  Not to mention the respect given to the clients, volunteers, and horses.  While interning here I have experienced several deaths in my own family and at each time my well being and needs were evaluated.  At Mane Support it is what is best for the person(client, staff, volunteer, or otherwise), what is best for the family, and what can we do to help!  An organization that may be small in number, but big in heart!!  Five stars all the way, I have never volunteered with an organization who believed its mission and cared so much!
Friends of Literacy	234078	3	/users/profile/298174	heather202	Volunteer	5	11/20/2014	I came to Friends of Literacy as a volunteer - I was attracted to helping people with something I loved... which was reading. As I worked with the adults who were attending GED classes I also came to appreciate how important FOL is in providing the outreach, classes and awareness so that adults can get a second chance to be more successful by getting their high school equivalency. For some of the population we serve just increasing their literacy skills to the point where their daily life is enhanced by being more knowledgeable in reading and math has a great benefit to them and our community. I now work part time for Friends of Literacy and find it very rewarding, we are small but effective and we get to see the results of our mission and efforts in our community.

York VA Hospital when Andrea Lawrence spoke to the Noon Exchange Club of Murfreesboro. Americanism is one of the pillars of The National Exchange Club so this message drew me closer to the project. Not only did I make a financial donation, not as much as I wanted, I then arranged with Ms Lawrence to be able to post 3 foot by 5 foot American Flags on 8 foot poles from our "Healing Field - Flags of Remembrance" over Memorial Day weekend as a pathway for the groundbreaking ceremony. A beautiful site as you entered the area, and much more of a image when photos were published of the flags. Any time we can help those who served and abided by their oath to defend this country, I try to help. Knowing Fisher House has the same approach makes me want to support more.  Don Wright, 2013-2014 National President, National Exchange Club

All are professionally furnished and decorated. Families will share common areas that include a kitchen, communal living, dining and family rooms, a patio and library  and toys are available for children.  It is a honor to help the men and women who have sacrificed so much to keep us safe and free.   Anne Kyle, Blue Star Mom and Tennessee Fisher House Board Member
Tennessee Fisher House Foundation, Inc.	133480	2	/users/profile/179206	Andrea51	Board Member	5	11/04/2012	The Fisher House Foundation is by far the best military focused charity.  They received A+ ratings from the American Institute of Philanthropy and four star Charity Navigator ratings because the money donated goes to the focus of the charity, and not to salaries and overhead.   I was first introduced to Fisher House through the recommendation of a soldier returning from deployment in Iraq.  Once I was briefed on their mission and visited a Fisher House, I was totally sold.  The veterans and their families of these recent conflicts are facing years of medical treatments, and they deserve a warm, compassionate environment where the families find support and encouragement from others in similar circumstances.  Offering free lodging in a beautiful, safe place while a loved one is receiving medical care is what we should do for America's service members, veterans and their families during the stressful times of illness or injury.

It's unfair to hold a rescue accountable for an illness that shows up a year later.I've visited many animal rescues, both public and private, and Mewtopia is one of the most cheerful, clean and well-run facilities I've ever seen.

We're torn between adopting an adult vs a kitten and they walked us through the pros and cons of each.   The shelter location is well kept and all of the animals were well cared for.  The staff didn't try to pressure us into choosing right away and I cannot say enough how passionate these wonderful people are about helping cats find forever homes.

Mewtopia Cat Rescue	169060	1	/users/profile/224075	Amanda96	Client Served	1	09/11/2013	Me and my husband decided to get another cat so the one that we already had could have a companion. When we adopted the kitten, the owner kept trying to push another cat on to us. At $100 a cat, we told her we can't afford it. We did not even have the kitten a full year before she died of a fatal blood disease. She was a year and a week when she passed away. We did some research and found out that all cats are susceptible to this disease, but it really effects kittens. This disease is spread through saliva most effectively. Plus, it runs rampant in no-kill shelters. I am sorry, but I will not get another cat from them or recommend them to anyone. For this to happen and not be told of the consequences of getting a cat from them, is just monstrous.

I walked through the entire Mewtopia shop, petted every single cat, but the ones that reminded me of my sweet Grady were my favorites.  I fell in love with a 1 year old gray cat named Quincy.  Filled out an application (even checked the box that I would be willing to volunteer for them), during the time I was filling out this paperwork the woman who ran the shop put Quincy away in another room.  I asked her if I could pet her again and she said no. I told her that I wanted to adopt this cat, then she told me that I have only been interested in "gray" cats and she did not feel that is what I needed.  She felt concerned that I would compare the two cats and therefore did not want me to adopt Quincy.  The first priority of this shelter should be finding homes for all of these cats- not running people off by psychological judgements.  It is not a bizarre idea that someone would be partial to a particular breed (or color) over others, regardless of whether it is  aesthetical or sentimental.  The way I see it... this non profit turns away good homes while taking donations.  I will find another GRAY cat- and hopefully he will look a little like Grady. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that!
Mewtopia Cat Rescue	110698	1	/users/profile/150676	sus12	General Member of the Public	1	04/25/2012	The Overseer of Mewtopia is abusing her 501c non-profit status by selling cats for a profit.  She dont have up-to-date records for all the cats and kittens.  Most of the time, there is a bad order lingering outside.  Not sure but The human society may need to pay her at vist.  Too many cats in one location.
U Turn For Christ Greeneville	261220		/users/profile/349817	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	I have the privilege first hand to see this ministry in action and to see lives of men and women changed forever! I serve in the ministry when I can helping with worship and technical arts, serving alongside other servant hearts, and have had the chance to listen to many testimonies of folks attending U-Turn. I also know first-hand because my son attended and U-Turn for Christ has helped him in amazing ways! The ministry can only help you if you want it to help. The Lord will speak to you only if you want to listen. We need to continue supporting and praying for this ministry, the folks attending, and for the Pastors serving these men and women battling with these strongholds. Mark 4:9

A place where i became useful to the Lord and to my family which had given up on me. The daily bible study and hard work helped me become productive. I hated it at first but came to realize i was fighting against myself and the Lord
U Turn For Christ Greeneville	260732		/users/profile/349319	JohnB12	Client Served	5	10/01/2015	I love Uturn it is a helpful ministry that showed my how to be responsible and be held accountable for my decisions, how to get up and become a productive member of society instead of the wasted space I use to take up just going through life.  I have purpose now and I am thankful that Uturn showed me how to be respectable.  I have confidence today and know who I am and where I am headed all because I have a relationship with Jesus.
U Turn For Christ Greeneville	258882		/users/profile/347415	JasonB	Client Served	5	09/22/2015	Finally!!! A place where I fit in. U Turn as a whole...there's nothing great about it - you clean n do chores, work detail and 3 bible studies almost every day - on top of that your held accountable for what you say or do and your surrounded by junkies 24-7 BUT I GOT ME HERE!!! I found the program/routine to be subtly helpful, almost by osmosis - it gave me a better work ethic and more. I was put in situations daily where i could apply what was taught from God's word the night before or that morning. I was given the opportunity to fail or succeed and the room to grow. I have become faithful - someone who can be trusted and depended upon and that feels better than any high. Most of all Jesus is there, God has his hand stretched out to help everyone who goes there - unfortunately I saw many just pass it by. I thank God for the imperfect men running the program, for giving me an obtainable goal and reassurance that that He can use even me.

Men sleep (or try to) in unairconditioned upstairs.  Turnover rate is VERY high.  They require 2 months (cash) pre-pay and you lose if they don't stay (very unlikely that they will).  This is supposed to be a Christian rehab center. Sure there is Bible study but their practices seem very unChristian - ask those who have left.  Punishment is very inconsistent - just whatever the leader wants to do for that day and depends on if you're one of their "favorites".  Very little accountability.  Your loved one WILL NOT make it so you're wasting your money.  Ask them for a list of those who have left for a reference.  I know, they'll tell you you'll just hear from a disgruntled person but that person will tell you what it's really like.  Trust me, NOT a place they'll want to go.  Writing this in hopes of saving others from the "experience" (it will be a bad one). Offered as our opinion.  PLEASE check it out for yourself.

Of One Accord	248509		/users/profile/336242	Anonymous36	General Member of the Public	2	07/14/2015	I think it is one of the most unorganized organizations I have ever seen.  Their thrift store is filthy; their community room is cluttered with so much junk.  The outside of their building in Rogersville is an eye sore.  If you asked questions about their services, some of their staff are rude.  Although they do a lot for their community, I think they try to do too much and should focus on only a few things so they can get organized.

Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee	24246	9	/users/profile/25348	Bruce	Volunteer	5	12/16/2009	I volunteer with a local Christian Radio Station that takes donations at events for Second Harvest, I also volunteer AT a local Pantry that gives out the donated food. There have been events I have worked to collect cans from the public, driven my fathers truck to pick up for the pantry and packed boxes for folks whom come in. The Lord has blessed me to give, collect, distribute and even receive. Second Harvest of Gray GREATLY impacts our area in the TriCities and beyond. In 3 hours today we served 31 families of 114 people at our local Pantry. Carrying their boxes to their cars I ask how they heard about the Pantry and how they are doing. Times are hard and good people are hurting. Recently I made the trip to Sneedville with Second Harvest after the WCQR Thanksgiving Project where we raised funds for a food box and we delivered over 200 boxes into a hurting town. To see the folks at Gray work to fill every box was amazing. God bless you Second Harvest and EVERYONE who donates.
Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee	23481	6	/users/profile/24587	moira	Volunteer	5	12/07/2009	I am a youth minister and I took a group of teens from my church to volunteer at Second Harvest.  It was a great way for them to see first-hand the need that exists in our community.  They could not believe how much food was in the Second Harvest warehouse.  It was very impressive to the students that all the food they saw stacked to the ceiling and all the food they were sorting that had been donated, was still not enough to meet the needs of the hungry in our community!  The coordinator who worked with us gave good instructions to the teens and answered all our questions.  It was an incredibly positive experience and our youth learned so much about the world around them by working with Second Harvest.  We will be back to help in the future!

I have shared with my 8-year-old daughter about the backpack for kids program and what a blessing it is for so many children.  Explaining it to her also made her cognizant of her own blessings.  Since then she has helped a child at her school, who takes a backpack home, feel more comfortable and less embarrassed about his need.
Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee	23232	1	/users/profile/24307	jallensteele@gmail.com	Donor	5	12/02/2009	My experience with Second Harvest Food Bank is both warm and sobering. They have a back pack progam for kids in school. They fill the backpacks with food and give them to kids on Fridays to hold them over for the weekend. This one child who participates in the program told us what they endure weekly. The child has to hide their food in there room from the parents. The child can only take the food out after the parents go to sleep. The reason for the child having to sneak and hide the food is they will take the food and sell it for drugs. If this doesn't touch your heart and show you how if it was not for Second Harvest this would be another hungry child.

Some rescues only take in siezed horses from the county. Horses are used on trail rides. SO do get some evaluation on personality before being placed up for adoption. Keep up the good work.
Mustang Alley Horse Rescue	99671	3	/users/profile/120462	LadyA	Volunteer	5	10/24/2011	I've volunteered at Mustang Alley for the past 3 years and I absolutely love what they do and what they have done! What a great place to go to unwind and help out with the care and maintenance of the rescue horses. And to watch the love they put into the care and welfare of the horses. I've seen them go from a primitive state to a nice fun looking facility. I also like the way they make sure that the adopted horses go to a good home by inspecting them and keeping tabs on them...I was fortunate enough to be able to go through one of their adoption processes with one of their horses.  There is a lot of love in there and dedication.

There are 50+ horses out there that have been nursed back to health and have a much improved quality of life because of this place.  Taking care of the horses and maintaining a safe environment for the volunteers are the top priorities.  The owner is very supportive and appreciative of my efforts.  There are several paddocks, and all are well maintained.  It's hard work, often in inclement weather, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
Mustang Alley Horse Rescue	93787	3	/users/profile/108115	horsecarer	Volunteer	2	07/13/2011	Overall, I find this to be a legitimate horse rescue. However, many things caught me off guard. The rescue founder was extremely scatterbrained, which was evident in the operations of the rescue. Volunteers of little skill level were turned loose to "evaluate" and train green horses. Fencing contained many long, loose wires, which could have easily cut the horses. For the twenty or so horses in the large pasture, there was only one two-room walk in shed, which was surrounded by manure. The smaller paddock, for "ICU" horses, had one small rinkydink run in shed for the seven horses in the field. Another peeve of mine was the hay quality. The large paddock was FILLED with hay strings from round bales. When asked to feed square bales to the trail riding horses, I was told to "find the good hay among the moldy parts." there were only five or six bales in the shed.  One mare had been sent to an outside trainer, and had come back completely damaged. She was terrified of all humans. Also, trail guides were sent out with paying customers on overgrown trails that they were not at all sure of. Last but not least, the water troughs were in desperate need of scrubbing and refilling.

I have never felt like an organization where I have volunteered in the past has more adequately matched what I am good at, with a nonprofit organization in need of my particular strengths. I volunteered in the WorkReady program and taught Office Etiquette/Skills... I loved the group I served. They were engaged, asked questions, and truly benefited from the content I was covering. It was amazing to see the difference I was making in just a two hour workshop. I can't wait to do this again! Anyone with skills/job experience/office knowledge/etc. can volunteer with PhilanthroTeach!

First, the executive director was diligent in providing a variety of materials to support my teaching of the class. He was quick to respond to my questions and very appreciative of the work of the volunteers. During the volunteer session, I had an incredibly engaged group of young men. They were not held back by their limited language skills nor were they shy to ask questions. I was struck by the sincere respect these young men had toward the PhilanthroTeach team. To add, seeing the executive director engage with and relate to the youth was inspiring for his team. He knew all of the participants by name and spoke with them one on one, volunteering to work with them outside of the time allotted for the workshop in order to really affect their understanding of the content. I could not be more pleased with my experience with PhilanthroTeach!

I'm a professor from Vanderbilt University and since I entered higher education over 15 years ago, I never felt there was a place in the community specifically designed for me to use my skill sets for positive social change outside the Acadamy of higher ed. PhilanthroTeach allowed me to use what I know to make a positive difference in the community for those who need it most. Giving a hand up rather than a hand out. I plan on volunteering again soon! When I looked into the faces of those I was teaching during my workshop, I saw pride. Pride in the fact that they have the talent within to advance and excel. They just needed someone to align those talents toward a path of success!

However, when my sister's setter died, I contacted SOS.  Alissa was wonderful!  After months of talking to my sister about her needs and the profiles of a number of dogs, an adopting was arranged.  Samantha could not be more perfect for my sister if we had created her.  They are truly a match made in Heaven at SOS.  Reading this site over a period of years has shown me how truly remarkable these people are.  Accepting the elderly and the infirm, SOS makes an incredible effort to give each the best quality of life possible.  Sometimes this involves huge medical bills.  Sometimes it involves hospice care.  Whatever the need,  SOS does its best.  It is truly the" Superman" of setter rescues.Joan in California
All American Dachshund Rescue	240036	1	/users/profile/326058	Dneely	Client Served	5	03/27/2015	As a foster mom and "foster failure" for AADR, all I can say is that they are an amazing charity doing amazing things! They take dogs that have been tossed away like garbage and rehab them into loving family pets. They give dogs that otherwise would have never had a chance at life the opportunity to live the life they deserve! We have fostered 13 dogs for them and have adopted two of our fosters. We have driven countless transports and even rescued a few mistreated dachshunds in our community. Diane Irwin has nothing but the best interest of these dogs at heart! Only the very best homes get approved for adoption and if that hurts some feelings along the way, so sorry! Don't let your dog off leash, keep them UTD on shots and heartworm, don't give dogs away and treat them like your own kids. That's the simple road to being an adoptive dachshund parent. 
All American Dachshund Rescue	200723	1	/users/profile/262062	Joyce442	Client Served	1	05/22/2014	I adopted a blind dog from them that was sweet from the beginning but after awhile started attacking my other dog.  I tried for 3 months to make it work and it did not.  Finally the last straw was when the dog had its teeth clamped around my other dogs throat and I had to slap her to get her off and she then went after me.  Per their contract, I returned the dog instead of trying to adopt her out to someone else.  I checked their website and noticed that they had the dog listed for adoption again and it said that she could be with other dogs.  I emailed the president of the rescue organization and told her they should not place the dog with a home that has another dog.  She came back at me with horrible emails that I can show to anyone that would like to see them.  She said instead of slapping the dog I should have gotten a spray bottle and filled it with water and sprayed the dog instead.  I did not have time to do anything like that as the dogs teeth were around my dogs throat.  She had also bit her a couple days earlier on the ear and drew blood.  My emails to Diane Irwin were very nice and I was very concerned.  Her responses were awful.  It was a very bad experience.
All American Dachshund Rescue	195193	3	/users/profile/255135	RLARN	Volunteer	1	03/04/2014	An open letter to all rescuers and drivers,  It's with the experience of trying to get the hours I spent driving/ transporting rescued doxies from this rescue signed-off on that I requested that I be removed from all volunteer and contact lists from AADR (aka SSDR). I have spent well over 200 hours on the road, many of which were pulling, transporting, rehabilitating, and vetting non-purebred dogs or dogs that had been put on euthanasia lists, all on my own dime and not with any accredited rescue organization; I've done it because it's the right thing to do.  Over the course of the last 9-12 months I have rescued (and placed in fantastic, third party 501c3 approved homes) 14 animals, driven over 5 transports for AARD,  some at totally unreasonable hours,  having met drivers in TN, and throughout Florida, to get rescues to rescue and forever homes. Of 5 runs that I volunteered my time energy and gas mileage to AADR,  only 15 hours and 40 mins. were accepted as a result of the nit picky, neuroticism of the sign off process. At a certain point I stopped volunteering. I jumped through every hoop just to get those hours signed off on, sending and resending documents that had already been sent. The power differential between my position as a volunteer driver in need of community service hours and between the position within the organization was made quite evident to me in several email exchanges.  For the time and energy it that it took to scrutinize my integrity and the volunteer hours on my service sheet, several dogs could have been networked or fundraised into rescue from both my end and the end of AADR.  I've had a horrible, shaming, and very demeaning experience. Having asked the AADR president to sign off on the community service hours (for a personal and traumatic situation that resulted in a legal action against me by a pet insurance company from the state of California in purchasing pet insurance for my own beloved animals, without absolutely zero financial or other gain) I have been made to feel dishonest, ashamed, and belittled as a volunteer and fellow rescue-worker. I have and continue to drive for many other rescue organization across the U.S and have had similar experiences, having worked in a high kill shelter in Mississippi, as it comes to the control and marginalization of other rescue workers and volunteers in the rescue world.  Perhaps we should all take a moment to reflect what it might be like to walk a mile in the shoes of another. Perhaps in the shoes of a woman already traumatized by an unjust legal and judicial system in the state of Florida, to be further traumatized and belittled for the energy she spent trying to continue to do what she felt morally right to do, and at great personal and financial expense to her. INSTEAD of taking the easy path volunteering in the high kill shelter as the state prosecutor had proposed she do, she instead dedicated herself to making sure her service hours meant something; that lives were saved and that her time was spent wisely.  I do what I believe in and I live by my integrity. I withdraw from participation with a group that seems, through the scrutiny and judgment that I encountered,  not to believe in the tireless efforts, the value of volunteered time, or in the compassion, honesty, and dedication of their volunteers. I'm not defined by a brush with the law or any one thing. None of us are.  Your time, as mine, is valuable; please extend your networks to drive with other well deserving rescue organizations. And by all means continue driving and rescuing because the animals of all breeds and mixes need us.

Shepherds Heart Ministries Inc	207751		/users/profile/270433	hoylecare	Volunteer	5	07/30/2014	As an expat from California now living as a permanent resident in Jalsico, Mexico I learned of the HOPE HOUSE at my church.  This state authorized refuge for abused boys aged 6-18 was founded in 2008 under the name Casa Hogar Una Esperanza en el Corazon, A.C.  It is a community outreach of Shepherd's Heart Ministries, Inc in Jonesborough, TN USA.  The tax deductible donations for HOPE HOUSE goes through Shepherd's Heart, and with each donation, the donor receives an email as their receipt.  HOPE HOUSE is able to keep the wood shop staffed while the boys learn a vocation due to donations received through Shepherd's Heart Ministries, Inc.  I thank God for all the generous donors that help give these boys HOPE.
Shepherds Heart Ministries Inc	116307		/users/profile/158341	DrSpyPhd	Volunteer	5	06/23/2012	I began by building various shelves and cabinets to help the boys keep organized.  Shortly after, the Rotary Club of Ajijic and Langley, BC, donated funds to purchase high-end carpentry power tools.  This resulted in me becoming the director of the workshop, a volunteer position.  The workshop now fulfills two objectives, train the boys in carpentry skills and build projects to help offset operational expenses in Hope House.  Now I have extended my responsibilities to plan for future projects, such as the aquaponics system and transition house.  This heavy involvement have earned me a place on the Hope House board of directors.

Shepherds Heart Ministries Inc	100476		/users/profile/122703	abbssc	Volunteer	5	11/10/2011	Every time our family visits Shepherd Heart's Hope House in Mexico we are more blown away at the impact this organization is having in the lives of these boys. To hear their stories and to see them now, they are truly new men! One boy who's life was on the streets at 5 years old, eatng out of garbage cans and unable to speak is now a smiling 11 year old who has learned to read, write and even speak some english.  Another boy who spent most of his life in homes choose to leave as a teenager. It was a year later he showed back up at the door hungry, dirty and tired. He asked for forgiveness and for the chance at a life again. He is now entering high school with plans of graduating. These are just 2 of the amazing stories we have witnessed.

She spoke very condescending and degraded my business because it is a home based agency.  I contacted her for support and help reaching seniors but this company is clearly NOT in the business of treating people with respect.  I doubt very seriously they're operating efficiently and/or ethically.

Tennessee Aquarium	107845	1	/users/profile/146457	ohsusannah99	Donor	4	03/12/2012	My contributing membership to the Tennessee Aquarium is incredibly valuable to me. I know that my membership helps to sustain this organization's strong future. The Aquarium has already done so much for the Southeast, I'm glad to support future endeavors and provide funding for current programs. The Aquarium's work to restore streams and reintroduce imperiled species are both very important programs to me. But what truly inspires a gift from me, is the inspiration that the Aquarium gives to its students and guests. The only way the public will want to work harder to keep our earth clean, healthy and biologically diverse is if they can see these animals/habitats up-close and learn about them in a unique and engaging setting. The Aquarium does an amazing job of doing this.

This magical place is a natural haven for tourists, musicians, locals and folks looking for an authentic place to hang out.

The music the Center presents is the REAL thing, be it Gospel, Blues, folk, bluegrass, jazz or Klezmar.  There is no other organization that I know of in the South that presents such a rich variety of cultural experiences.
Mental Health Centers & Clinics Of Tennessee	187677	1	/users/profile/244712	cream cheese	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/03/2013	These people do not have scheduled staff meetings.  When they do, cases are not staffed.  There is a total disconnect between the programs as the management has no clue what each program is doing or not doing.  They hire freshly graduated people and offer NO training whatsoever.  They use and use their staff until they are broke down.  When the staff submits a resignation and is working out that time, they are escorted out of their office and sent away prematurely.  I have 2 colleagues this happened to and there are many more.  If this is not enough let me enlighten the feds just in case they get bored and need someting to investigate.  Lifecare is a "non-profit" but prays at the few meetings they do have.  It is a very sad state of affairs with these large companies as they fall into the black hole of greed at the expense of the broken clients, not to mention the taxpayers. It is all about the family that "runs" things there.  Money and greed.  If their bible reads like mine, they had better watch out!

My daughter & family (and several other families),  very recently completely lost everything thing they owned in an apartment complex fire . Truth Be Told Ministries immediately offered their assistance and provided financial resources to both my daughter as well as another family who was displaced and had lost everything. Their generosity and quick response made it possible for my daughter to replace immediate basic needs such as food, clothing, medication etc during this very traumatic and stressful event. We are forever grateful for all of the assistance and love they provided.

Truth Be Told Ministry	293817		/users/profile/384481	Linnypenn7	Client Served	5	06/24/2016	I can honestly say the 'truth can be told' about this wonderful ministry. In an age where many churches and organizations are going selfishly astray, this ministry,(which I stumbled upon listening to Blogtalk Radio) was, and is, a pleasant surprise! There are not many places where one can go to receive both spiritual food and monetary blessing all at the same place! Ms. Myers is a sincere and dedicated person who desires to help others with a helping hand. Many of us are not looking for a handout, but rather are seeking just a little 'lift' when times get a little rough. I am sure we come from all backgrounds and economic status. I know what it is like to raise children while having to work for temporary agencies. I know what it is like to have limited or no family or friends to help you. I know what it is like to grow older and yet have a desire to continue working, but society will not hire you because of your age. However, I now know what it is like to come into contact with a ministry that cares and can teach us to also 'pass the love forward' as TRUTH BE TOLD MINISTRY has helped us.

Lighthouse Ministries	95656		/users/profile/111122	dwd_25	General Member of the Public	5	08/13/2011	Lighthouse Ministries is a great nonprofit organization. I attended two of their workshops - one dealing with drug and substabce abuse prevention, and the other, helping to reduce violence and crime in our community. There were over 60 young people in attendance at each workshop. As a former drug abuser myself, my life was changed just by attending the drug workshop. At the other workshop on crime prevention in Memphis, TN, over 25 young people agreed to relinguish violence and work towards mutual tolerance, peace, and good citizens. At each workshop, food and drinks were provided freely to all attendees. Today, I am telling other young people about the dangers of substance and drug abuse. Thanks to this fine charity  - I am a changed man from drug abuse.

Why? So many reasons... the staff are warm and personal yet highly competent (they simply know every hero, every ministry, every resource and every need in the city); the director (Grant Standifer) is a friend to most pastors in our city; the methodology adopted by the Coalition is asset-based versus needs-based - which means people are truly helped and not hurt; multiple "specific ministry" networks have grown out of this "mama bear" including some focused on internationals, single parent families, and stopping human trafficking; the courses taught actually LIFT people out of poverty and help churches give dignity versus take it; the quarterly meetings are happy meetings, bringing a whole city of believers in Jesus together to learn and grow; the youth touched by the Restorative Justice are forever changed; the hundreds of struggling people connected to ministry and churches are brought to a new place of hope and life; and my favorite... Jesus is lifted up! He is talked about. He is given the credit. He is the HEART THROB of this contagious group of Jesus people.  Do I love this group? You betcha I do. May Jesus pour out His spirit on every person who is involved.

As a Case Manager who works with the Homless I remember the disconnect before Compassion Coalition.  Now there is a coordinated effort in Knoxville/Knox County to show love, discernment, compassion and accountability to those who work to help others move towards a better future. The classes, especially BRIDGES,  taught by Compassion haved completely refocused how I work together with the homeless families that I see. And then there is the wonderful fellowship of being with a group that share the belief that we should always be available for those who, due to whatever circumstance, need a hand up to regain their dignity, self sufficiency, and move forward in their life.Barbara Disney

Number 1: it is a local agency designed to support the local people of the Murfreesboro area..Number 2: the agencies and people receiving the food, drink, cleaning items and health aids are receiving the best that local distributors are producing for the general public..and Number 3: Feed America First's staff  truly has a God centered heart to provide the freshest, most healthy food that it can secure for distribution at the lowest possible cost for all.  Without the work of Feed America First, not only would this community suffer, but many others in and around the Murfreesboro, TN area.

Feed America First of Tennessee	112822	1	/users/profile/153558	dvg1	Volunteer	5	05/23/2012	Feed America First sets the bar very high for outstanding stewardship.  The concept is simple and the results are profound; distrubuting 18 million pounds of food thus far (which would have dumped into a landfill prior to expiration) AND those most-in-need get it free of charge via 160 partner charitable organizations in their local area.  Wow!  I was privileged to serve at the gala event, with my wife in November 2011, "Dancing With The Nashville Stars".  The caliber of the entire event was top-notch.  We've also volunteered at Tennessee Titans games in the Logan's Roadhouse concessions - and you know an NFL team is not about to risk their reputation on a fly-by-night charity.  I pray that you consider volunteering your time, talent, and donations to FAF.

Goodwill Industries of Middle TN, Inc.	26508	6	/users/profile/27537	Martha	General Member of the Public	5	01/29/2010	My mother and I both absolutely love shopping at Goodwill. We have found really good deals there. I recommend the chain to anybody.
Goodwill Industries of Middle TN, Inc.	26363	8	/users/profile/27402	gmbirdy	Donor	5	01/27/2010	When I was a kid, I would go to Goodwill to find the perfect addition to make my Halloween costume that year authentic.  During my early 20's, I worked as a news reporter.  Many stories I covered had tragic endings.  The only good that came out of these awful situations was the kindness of stranger's hearts. Complete strangers would donate items that could help what was so wrong become right again.  Some people didn't know how they could help, they didn't have their own possessions to give up or the money to spend on brand new items. Goodwill was a constant resource for those that wanted to contribute.  One man I interviewed said he went from Goodwill to Goodwill location trying to find a couch big enough for a family of four, who lost their home in a fire, to be able to sit on as a family.  He couldn't afford a new couch, but this is what he wanted to give the family and he found that gift at Goodwill. I remember the last thing he said before we wrapped up was, "What's better than being able to sit on your own couch?"As highly as Goodwill stood out in my mind, it wasn't until my late 20's that I saw the benefit of shopping at Goodwill to decorate my home, my wardrobe and my heart. It's a good feeling when someone compliments a lamp or vase in your kitchen or a cashmere sweater you got for $7.99. When I donate to Goodwill, there is a satisfaction in knowing the items you bought for whatever reason, that no longer hold value to you, will become of value to another.  That's how Goodwill decorates my heart.The only thing about Goodwill that I believe would be a neat, interesting and beneficial addition, would be to have, on specific items, an explanation of where they came from, the background of how that particular piece got into your hands. I realize not all items carry this sort of history.  I recently donated a red and white polka dot, strapless dress with red crinoline to the East Nashville Goodwill.  I couldn't have paid more than $25.00 for that dress when I purchased it off the clearance rack at a New Jersey Macy's 5 or 6 years ago. When I dropped it off, along with many other random items that no longer have a place in my life, I wanted to attach a note to the dress that read:"Every time I wore this dress, I had a great time. Please have fun when you wear it too." - Gina B, Nashville, TN.Yes, individuals go in and buy personal items at Goodwill and people get a paycheck to work there, but I see Goodwill's main goal as giving back, paying it forward and putting others first.

Therefore, the students are in need of college/career exploration, preparation, and application.  Vanderbilt Students for Students has been this kind of tremendous resource at Pearl-Cohn since the fall of 2006.  Members of Students for Students come to Pearl-Cohn and provide the students one-on-one tutoring, ACT prep, college application guidance, and the opportunity to interact with role models close to their own age.  I applaud the Vanderbilt Students for Students organization for being a real-life example of the value of serving your community by giving a hand-up as they give a hand-out!

Arts Council of Williamson County	32225	7	/users/profile/33013	chaosglass	Board Member	5	03/02/2010	This group of volunteers has produced some incredible annual events ranging from retail art shows for its members, to an informative evening artists' lecture series, to a art show for disabled adults, to a monthly informative lunch group, and to recycling materials into art calls to artists.  There is so much offered to their members and to the community at large as well.  It is a true pleasure to be involved with this group.
Arts Council of Williamson County	31704	1	/users/profile/32553	laurenh	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	The Arts Council of Williamson County is a lively involved organization seeking to make a difference in the lives of those actively participating in the arts through providing venues in which artists can show their creativity and gain recognition for their successes. On the other hand, their efforts to educate the community about the arts are drawing new people into experiencing what it is like to be an artist in whatever medium.As a business owner, I have a limited amount of time for volunteering with nonprofits, but with The Arts Council of Williamson County, I found a group of volunteers who work as a team to promote the works of their colleagues as well as educate the community. Each week I see more and more results from the efforts of the organization, and that makes it all worth the time and energy I volunteer for the group. I am excited to see the group grow with involvement from members throughout all parts of the county as well as those in neighboring communities. To me, this means The Arts Council is enhancing the quality of life for its members and the community.
Arts Council of Williamson County	29868	1	/users/profile/31758	linda-mclaugh	Board Member	5	02/22/2010	As a 2nd term board member, I have watch this all volunteer non-profit continuously grow, not just year-to-year, but month to month.  The Arts Council offers so many opportunities for artists as well as the community. It has truly filled a void in the arts in Williamson (TN) and surrounding counties.  For a young organization to offer so much is just amazing to me.     Their programming includes Art Fusion, an annual two-day fine art & craft festival, including two stages of music and a Friday evening reception.  Another annual event, An Artists Window, is a collaborative art show highlighting the abilities of adults with disabilities. A new event has been inspired from the Landfillart Reclamation Project that the Arts Council did in 2009, where artists created art out of hubcaps that were destined for the landfill. Their exhibit is now a part of a permanent collection in Pennsylvania.  The new 2010 event, which culminated from this project, is called Encore! Reclaim the Sound. A collaborative effort between the Arts Council and the Steinway Piano Gallery of Nashville, will have art made out of unusable piano parts which will be auctioned off at a grand event in October. Proceeds from the event will go towards the Arts Councils art education programs and the Steinway Society.       They also have monthly programs. The Brown Bag Lunch Bunch is a casual get-together with entertaining and educational guest speakers. A great camaraderie of artists and community members have formed that would most likely have never met before this program. Art: Up Close & Personal is an evening Powerpoint  presentation that gives a personal glimpse into the lives of various artists. The series is being videotaped with plans to distribute copies to local libraries and schools.    In addition to all their programming, they have an extensive and informative website which includes an artist directory as well as art related news. Their bi-monthly E-newsletter reaches close to a thousand viewers. All of this could not be achieved had it not been for such a strong, hard-working, dedicated Board of Directors. Each board member has specific talents that has helped grow this organization and has kept in on the path of their strategic plan.
National Banana Pudding Festival	179962		/users/profile/236606	Granna1	Volunteer	5	10/19/2013	This was the 4th annual National Banana Pudding Festival and by far, the best one.  The new location was much larger and better suited to all the activities.  The National Cook-off and Puddin' Path were big hits. The expanded children's area featured a wide variety of activities...many of them free.  The entertainment was great with everything from bluegrass to puppet shows.  A wide variety of food and craft vendors had something for everyone.  This truly is a family event.  And, best of all, about 25 local non-profit organizations benefited from the festival.  Combined with the other area activities (quilt show, car show, etc.) makes Centerville the place to be the first weekend in October.

We had hit a rough patch with money a while back but still needed to get my two large dogs fixed. They did both of my dogs and their vaccinations for a very low cost. They were very nice and I felt my animals were cared for. My old dog kept biting and licking his incision and it began to bleed slightly. They had no problem with me bringing him back in to be looked at. I would definitely recommend them. In fact, I liked them so much that my two newest pups are going to get fixed there next week! 
Sumner Spay Neuter Alliance	177636	1	/users/profile/234206	PupLove	Client Served	1	10/14/2013	I was very unpleased with the quality of conditions in this business. First, you walk in to a line of people waiting to sign papers and pay. The workers simply do not put any effort into making you feel comfortable with leaving your pet with them. I walked out in tears I was so upset with how they treated my animal. They simply acted as if she was just another spay but I believe that is an indication that these employees do not have a passion for what they are doing. Well, turns out I ended up paying a $120 vet bill because three days after I had my dog home (I did everything the instructions said ex. no running or jumping around activities) her incision began to open and bleed. When I took her to her primary vet he was baffled of how careless the surgery was done. My puppy had to be on antibiotics and pain medications after being spayed at this clinic. Now, I have found a lump on my puppy's incision that started out small but it growing in size so I am assuming it is just another surgical mistake. I understand this organization is extremely helpful for people because I for one was not expecting to turn around and have to pay a larger vet bill than it would have cost to just get her fixed by a caring veterinarian. I strongly urge whoever is considering getting their animal spayed her will weigh the pros and cons.

Recently I was proud to file a state income tax form and send the money to Nashville. We should all want to send our tax monies to Nashville rather than Washington D.C..

I didn't know what to do so I called SGDR and was told to take her to be checked out at the vet's office. The dog was treated very well and they tried to save her life but after several weeks she passed away. This dog was treated as if she had always been a family pet and lived with a volunteer who seems to have a way with senior dogs. She was loved and treasured up to the end of her life. The CEO of this rescue is all about the dogs. I also have a senior dog that I adopted from SGDR and she too was treated to excellent health care and preventive health care until the day I brought her home. This organization is the best anywhere.

After seven rounds of chemo therapy, she was not improving and was referred to the City of Hope for a bone marrow transplant.  The transplant took and my daughter is now in remission, however the cost of the transplant, pre-transplant chemo and radiation, follow up doctor's visits, and over 35 different medications, along with the previous four hospital stays and chemo treatments was astronomical.

Basenji Rescue And Transport Inc	120577	1	/users/profile/163995	Ronbar	Client Served	5	08/13/2012	Over the years, I have adopted 4 Basenjis from this organization.  My first was from a group of over 100 removed from a home in Kansas City.  She was extremely shy and it took her almost two years to come around but she turned out to be very sweet and loving.                                                        I was contact a year later about a woman who was having problems with a male Basenji.  It bit her husband and was growling at her 3 year old twins.  When I first met the dog he tried to bite me.  I told her I would give him a try.  He is now my best friend.  When my K.C. girl had to be put down due to mouth cancer I adopted Heather.  Her was another shy girl who is now very loveable.  My latest is Daisy.  She is the smallest of the three but thinks she is the queen of the house.  I donate to BRAT whenever I have a little extra money.  They are a great organization.
Basenji Rescue And Transport Inc	10513	1	/users/profile/12397	Linda	Client Served	5	09/18/2009	Having had experience with BRAT, I feel I am qualified to make an accurate statement concerning the organization. Not only does BRAT provide foster care, medical care, which is often much more than a few vaccinations, and placement into qualified homes, it's members also do follow-up with every adoption, offering any needed assistance to help the dog settle into its new home. Every person working for the placement of the unique and often difficult to deal with Basenji is an experienced Basenji owner or former owner. All work is done with the help of donations and only one fund raiser each year, that being calendar sales.  No person receives a salary, and many purchase supplies themselves so BRAT can use funds for the dogs. Dogs often need extensive stays for re-hab in foster homes and some also need extensive medical care, sometimes running into thousands of dollars.   For example some dogs come into BRAT suffering with Fanconi, an incurable disease. It is up to the foster home to get the dog tested, and onto the accepted protocol for that disease. Dogs come with hip displasia and surgery is needed. All care is given to assure that a dog is in the best of health before placement. If a dog is difficult to place, it remains with BRAT as long as necessary. If follow-up medical care is needed, that is provided by BRAT.No matter what amount is received by BRAT in a years time, it goes right into the care of Basenjis needing homes. Often those Basenjis come in large numbers from puppymills and as expected, those dogs need extensive care and rehabilitation w.ith costs again running into thousands of dollarsIt is easily seen where any funds that are donated to BRAT go. Any volunteer is willing to discuss that use of funds with anyone to assure that there is never a surplus. All donations, no matter the size are welcomed.

My Leading Young Lady Inc	203536		/users/profile/265506	ilovemlyl	Volunteer	5	06/23/2014	My Leading Young Lady is my primary community involvement, since 2010 when I was introduced to the founder.  I'm convinced that more is being done with less by this organization to nurture the growth of inner city children. The measurable outcomes, such as more young ladies identifying with their gifts and capitalizing on them, is a great testament to the devotion and competence of each volunteer member. My Leading Young Lady is a highly impacted, positive force in our community.   Karsha Kimball

Catholic Charities Of East Tennessee Inc	200980		/users/profile/262407	MaryAnnH	Volunteer	5	05/27/2014	As the mother of a son who was adopted through Catholic Charities, I felt a strong desire to give back to this wonderful organization. I have learned so much about the tremendous array of services offered to people in our community regardless of creed. The word Catholic truly means"including or concerning all humankind; universal" as defined in the dictionary. The scope of services offered by CCETN is vast and thorough. Not only do they support pregnant women in need, but they offer education to them and the baby's father regarding needed life skills. The elderly are not only housed, but loved and cared for with compassion. The children in need of protection are nurtured and kept safe. These items just touch on a couple of issues CCETN addresses.
Catholic Charities Of East Tennessee Inc	162035		/users/profile/214974	Diane P	Volunteer	5	07/03/2013	CCETN helps so many needy people. That is why I got involved with Catholic Charities. Catholic Charities provides support for many people. They serve the elderly, homeless, immigrants, and children. Most importantly, only 10 % of revenues go toward administrative costs. It was named by Charity Navigator as a Top Ten Charity for fiscal responsibility. The organization reaches out to everyone. Fewer than 5% of those served are Catholic. I know my time and money is helping others.

Awesome volunteers help two paid staff members at the shelter, run a thrift store,  foster, rescue runs,  roadblocks, donate time and money...everything!!
MONROE COUNTY FRIENDS OF ANIMALS	160776	3	/users/profile/213159	Beau C.	Volunteer	5	06/16/2013	Wow, where to start!I first became aware of MCFA through its thrift store run by an all volunteer staff and offering goods that have been donated by the community. As we are animal people we inquired about their mission and goals. We were hooked when we learned what was going on behind the scene concerning adoption and the efforts to reduce euthanasia in Monroe County.Volunteer staff take litters of animals home to "grade" them for adoption purposes.  Frequently trips are made to no kill shelters in need of adoptable pets. They range from puppies needed in New York to mature pets for a retirement community in Florida. The goal to build a no kill shelter along with a thrift store to support it is a great step towards helping the communities animal control and education, but that is not all it does.The quality of items offered at such a reasonable offer helps those less fortunate in the community. Clothing and furniture is routinely given to people who have a need due to fire or natural catastrophes that affect communities in the area. When cleaning the clutter from your home or business please consider donating to MCFA.
Mental Health Centers & Clinics Of Tennessee	286608		/users/profile/376678	Polly_J	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Thanks to Frontier Health I know how to keep it simple today, and I have the opportunity to give back what was freely given to me! I sought treatment for alcoholism and my co-occurring Bi-Polar disorder with Frontier Health in Johnson City, TN during the summer of 2012. There I was given the compassion I desperately needed, the education I could use to build a foundation, and the tools to create a life for myself I never thought possible. I was inspired by their program to get involved in the community and was hired a year later as a Residential Technician in the same women's program that saved my life. I regularly share my experience, strength, and hope with hundreds of women each year. I enjoy learning about the disease of addiction, researching and making 12-step literature available, as well as arranging community support for the clients in my facility. Today, I humbly serve as living proof that miracles do happen! It's extremely important that I do my part by helping to create an atmosphere of recovery and positive change in my work environment for our clients, as well as the community we serve. I think the most meaningful way that I give back is by continuing the fight to erase the addiction and mental illness stigma from people who suffer from a treatable disease. Setting a positive example, and helping people achieve their full potential by offering compassion, resources, and opportunities brings light and purpose to my own life. There is nothing more meaningful than giving, in whatever form that may be. I routinely share my personal recovery story whenever asked, because I believe that I can only keep what I have when I give it away. While I haven't been able to give money, for the last 3 years I have given my heart, time, experience, and love to a program that did the same for me. I look forward to many more years touching the lives of women seeking help in my area regardless of age, race, sexual identity/orientation, religion, financial status, criminal record, mental or physical disabilities, or any other barrier they might face elsewhere. Thanks for letting me share my story! To conclude, I feel this Mark Twain quote is very appropriate - The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. I'm grateful that I found out why. Clean, sober, and in recovery since July 4, 2012.  *Founded in 1957, Frontier Health is the regions leading provider of behavioral health services, offering treatment for mental health, co-occurring, and substance abuse problems, recovery and vocational rehabilitation, and developmental and intellectual disabilities services.* - from the website frontierhealth.org
Mental Health Centers & Clinics Of Tennessee	286607		/users/profile/376677	Joy_M	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I am inspired to support by the unfaltering commitment Frontier Health has for the mentally ill in my community. Frontier Health is a local nonprofit that serves upper east TN and south west Virginia. When people come to Frontier for help, regardless of if they have insurance or the money to pay for the treatment they need. I specifically love that the Frontier Health staff go above and beyond every single time with every single person they serve.  I've had the great fortune of working for Frontier Health for several years and could tell thousands of stories of why I believe in the work we do. One in particular is when I went to a local First Assist clinic on a Saturday night with what I suspected was the flu and I saw a Frontier Health case manager sitting with an adult client and her children. The case manager didnt know that I worked for Frontier Health (there are over 1000 employees spanning 14 counties and 2 states) but I watched as she took like out of her evening to help this client who was in obvious pain from a dental need. It was easy to see this was a woman with little resources and she was in need, and may not have had someone to help with her kids so she could see a doctor for help. The case manager played with the womans children, sang songs with these probably 4 and 2 year old kids; braided the little girls hair, and wiped juice off her younger brothers face. This case manager was there with these kids when I left about 8PM. It is dedication like this that has built the foundation of service Frontier Health provides for those in need. The staff fights every day to break the stigma of mental illness, offer compassion and help our community find hope. 
Tennessee Valley Golden Retriever Rescue	194460		/users/profile/254116	goldenretriever24	Volunteer	5	02/18/2014	I would like to give Tennessee Valley Golden Retriever Rescue a 5 star rating and a thumbs up. They have been very professional and timely in finding me the right match for my situation. It is important to note they are out to find the perfect dog for the situation. In the beginning, I let them know I was not in a huge hurry to get a dog. My main objective was to get a dog that would do well with another male retriever and cats. They assured me they could find me a really good match and they did. It took a few weeks and they gave me a call to let me know they had a perfect match.  I have no other experience with other rescues but I think it would be hard to beat Tvgrr.com because of my experience with them. If you are wanting a dog that will fit well in a family setting I definitely recommend a golden retriever.  
Tennessee Valley Golden Retriever Rescue	141013		/users/profile/187240	darylrd3	Client Served	5	11/18/2012	Hi! I am Daryl Driscoll! i would like to tell you the story of how we got our precious baby, Lulu.  We lived in Birmingham, AL and we wanted to get a golden retriever and found their website. Someone came and checked out our house and said we could get one. They later told us that we actually needed a real fence and not electric like we had and we were devastated.  We later moved to Knoxville and heard that they were coming to Petsmart in Turkey Creek and so we went. We found a little boy and while we took him on a walk the same lady that rejected us went on the walk with us and remembered us! She told us that they were way to harsh on our family and that they were sorry. We went on the website and found a little girl named Penney. We went to get her and her foster parent started crying which told us that we picked the right dog. we named her Lulu cause my aunts name is Penney. She is about six years old and we love her so much! She is full of energy, she is beautiful, sweet, gentle, and loves people and our cat, Chester. I couldn't imagine our life without Lulu. She completes our family.

CASA DE SARA	236405		/users/profile/320299	mzitt	General Member of the Public	5	01/07/2015	We worked with Casa de Sara during their Great Llama Race at Worlds Fair Park last April.  The US contacts for this organization are phenomenal people who work hard for this worthwhile charity.  The work they are doing in Bolivia is just a preview to the great things they are planning for the Knoxville community.  They are already serving our community by helping other charities and churches behind the scenes, taking no credit for themselves but instead, focusing on their mission.

The organization does a fantastic job of working not just on one specific issue, but rather on all issues driving generational poverty. After 14 years in the community, they are trusted by everyone they work with and very effective in the work being done. Casa de Sara has recently started giving back in the Knoxville area as well, and is developing a program for the area. I look forward to seeing just how great an impact they can have here!

Lynnville Area Arts Association Inc	153920		/users/profile/204737	Concerned Citizen 38478	Donor	1	04/09/2013	This organization goes by the name of Southern Tennessee Area Arts Repertory or STAAR. They have wonderful plays but there is no transparency. There is no account of where the money goes and when asked about it, I heard one of the principal officers said he didn't have to explain himself. Supposedly, money is being raised to restore the building they are in but it is owned by one of the principal owners listed in the IRS records. I also heard that parents were required to pay for the costumes the kids would use during the play, purchase tickets then were sent an email after the play was over letting people know they could purchase the costumes from STAAR. I wish someone would look into the details of this organization and put a lot of people's minds at ease. May God bless you all.

This is the case with the foudning of the Cervical Cancer Coalition of Tennessee. When cervical cancer came into the life of this young women she knew it was time to ACT! By telling her story of survival to as many women that she could. The battle is still going on concerning cervical cancer and as long as it does she will be there standing in the gap to try and save as many lives as possible.
Cervical Cancer Coalition Of Tennessee	188979	3	/users/profile/246653	Glenda99	General Member of the Public	1	11/20/2013	The devastation of cancer  changes lives forever.  Most individuals are very sympathetic to the cause.  The Cervical Cancer Coalition is an operation of one person soliciting money for personal gain.  While Ms Gunter is a  charming seemingly dedicated champion of cervical cancer, she uses others in attempt to find grants and donations that go directly in her pockets.  There Is No Cervical Cancer Coalition.  There is no board except on paper and the named individuals no longer are affiliated with the organization.  It i s amazing that people like this woman can get away with such a scam.  Donations go to PayPal and directly in her coffers.  I hope others do not give to this scam.  I have personal knowledge, it is a name only entity.  No roles for the individuals called a board.  Only one has hung in there with her;   here may be a personal relationship there.  There are no documented members other than that one.  No accountability for any donations and she becomes visibly angry when asked about structuring a board.    The I R S  would have a field day with the free money she is pocketing.

No real consultation with the patient ..The 3 doctors Ive dealt with I bet didn't consult w/me 3mins. I know they have other patients to see but they should try and build a rapport with patients and not make it seem like business as usual demeanor when comes to people health.  They dont don't look over your chart to see what annually exams need to be done. We are just tokens to keep reeling in that fat government money.

Bridges	250198	1	/users/profile/338030	LErvin	Volunteer	5	07/27/2015	I have been a front desk volunteer and office intern for a little over a month now, and I have absolutely loved the experiences I am gaining through my work. I have been able to expand my knowledge and use of American Sign Language as well as work within and for the deaf and hard of hearing community. The staff is friendly, personable, and understanding of any additional work related commitments I have outside of Bridges. This will be my first "job" in a formal business, and I am pleased of the amount of office experience I am gaining. Recently, I have been contemplating the possibility of getting an interpreter certification. I know this is because of the positive interpreters Bridges has on staff and the opportunity I've had to work here. I'm looking forward to closing my summer with Bridges and I thoroughly recommend volunteering for anyone who wishes to engage in ASL as well as the deaf and hard of hearing community. 
Bridges	246757	1	/users/profile/334196	keagan6111	Volunteer	5	06/30/2015	I started volunteering for Bridges about 7 months ago when I decided that I wanted to get serious about learning sign language (ASL). On my first day I was given a tour of the facility, introduced to most of the staff, and felt very welcomed. As these months have gone by I have not only been able to learn ASL, but also get involved in the deaf community, take classes, and learn new skills that have helped me in my personal work life.  You can do anything you feel comfortable doing, whether its doing paperwork or greeting people at the front desk, or helping kids with homework in the After School Program. Bridges also hosts many different events throughout the year that are always in need of volunteers. Whatever is it, you will always be welcomed and appreciated.

Their plea is for help and Global Tribe is doing just that!I have watched firsthand as GT has worked to get Mother 2 Mother off the ground.  It has truly been a labor of love, and a calling for all who are involved.  There have been times where I have felt hopeless and desperate as I raise my son alone, yet I realize how blessed I am when I see these young moms in poverty.  Give today, and give generously.  Save a mom, save her family.

I absolutely enjoy spending time in their office and love working with their patients. Many times working in different setting is much like cooking in someone else's kitchen, where it can take time and patience to get yourself organized. The staff members at Interfaith make volunteering easy and enjoyable.

I am proud to volunteer for a selfless organization such as Interfaith, which is dedicated to servicing uninsured, low-income, and working Rutherford County residents who might otherwise go without. Everyone at Interfaith is very dedicated and works very hard to bring an incredible level of care to every patient.

Mountain T.O.P.	23517	1	/users/profile/24626	AFLI, inc.	Volunteer	2	12/08/2009	The ideals of the organization were very very good and christian service oriented, the organization was highly structured and well planned but the leadership lacked "compassion". The way that they interacted with the staff was heavy handed and authoritarian at times. They did however, make a great effort to listen to feedback. They valued performance over motive which I could not reconcile with my own spiritual beliefs. They demanded a great deal from the staff. We worked 17 hour days for ten day stretches. In that time we often drove long distances. During the summer that I was there (2000)- there was a major car accident. The leadership did not seem to realize that it was due to exhaustion of the staff.I hope that things have changed since then.
Cherokee Forest Voices Inc	305294		/users/profile/95373	Gloria	Volunteer	5	09/18/2016	Almost a decade ago I became a member, donor and volunteer with Cherokee Forest Voices. I like their spunk and unwavering enthusiasm that effectively protects this big special place that I call home.  Current public land management practices, most notably clear cutting and road construction pose a serious threat to regional biological diversity by destroying habitat, causing forest fragmentation, and degrading water quality. The Cherokee National Forest, escaped glaciation during the last Ice Age, so these forested mountain ranges have harbored plant and animal life continuously for as long as 200 million years longer than any other region in the United States. Well worth protecting, The Cherokee National Forest includes remote areas as wild and remote as any and some of the most isolated and non-fragmented lands in the eastern US. It is the contiguous companion to the Great Smoky National Park, and is home to more than 2,000 plants and animals. Tennessees only National Forest, the Cherokee encompasses 640,000 acres and stretches from Chattanooga along the North Carolina border to Bristol along the Virginia boarder. It is the largest tract of public land in Tennessee and well worth protecting.

Amazima Ministries International Education And Empowerment For East	196141	3	/users/profile/256429	knip	General Member of the Public	5	03/21/2014	I would beseech any and all who look at our world with frustration and disappointment, wondering how there could be so many suffering, so much disappointment, so much needless pain, and so much needless death of our little ones to read "Kisses from Katie". Even if you would never offer a donation to this incredible God moving effort, you can't help but come away with a renewed confidence and hope, hope for a better tomorrow one child at a time through one willing person.  You can't help but feel a twinge within yourself to "step up", to be inspired to do something to help promote this hope, even if you never will. if this young lady is willing to do this much, then shouldn't we a well...
BRIDGE REFUGEE SERVICES, INC.	19471	1	/users/profile/20684	1000amet	Volunteer	5	10/23/2009	I was helped by Bridge when I came to the U.S. as a Political asylee 8 years ago.

On The Go Ministries	30222	9	/users/profile/31224	pattyh	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/23/2010	After working with the On The Go staff for over 15 years I have to say that no where have I found people so dedicated to helping others.  From Inner City Outreaches, crusades, Festivals, Women's Conferences and more they reach out to heal and help.  Volunteers learn from each situation that giving is a gift that can not be replaced.  On The Go provides training and direction to those that want to help others.  As a volunteer we have built churches, fed and helped house many without and lost.

REMOTE AREA MEDICAL	141833	4	/users/profile/188231	mezzopazzo	Donor	5	11/21/2012	I first was made aware of RAM some five years ago by watching one of the television  news shows. I was taken by the thought that they [RAM] were able to bypass the the medical machinery out there  and just plain give help to those who really needed it, at no cost to the people they help. Doesnt matter where.  I dont see any religious or gov't  affiliations or any agenda other than  direct , volunteer straight to the heart  good work. RAM sends me emails, only to inform me of their current projects  and the next mission. Never to solicit money. I only wish I had more  to give them. Great Organization!!!

Love One Another Embassy, Inc. / Joseph's Storehouse Food Ministry	237961	2	/users/profile/322949	____738	Board Member	5	02/12/2015	LOAE/ Joseph's Storehouse Food Ministry provides food, toiletry items and miscellaneous household goods to the needy in the community.  Every month we serve around 500 families, loading them up with an overflowing extra large wheelbarrow full.  Many that come are elderly, trying to survive on a small social security check that sometimes doesn't meet the bills, much less the food. Others are single parents and disabled.  Each person is cared for, and if they want, they have opportunity to sit with a prayer counselor who is more than happy to listen and pray with them.  Many say they come for that as much as they do for the food because it lifts their spirits and gives them hope.  We have over one hundred volunteers that help make the food distributions successful.  The last Saturday of each month is the primary distribution day.  A few years back we added the Thursday prior to the last Saturday for the disabled (who have a doctor's note on file), thus allowing them to not have to wait as long.  The heart of the ministry is to share God's love with everyone and fulfill his command to help others. "Inasmuch as you have done it unto the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto Me." (Matthew 25:40)   Truly, the love for the people shines through.

There is never enough to go around to meet the needs of families. This organization helps families by filling in some of the  gaps. How do they do this? FOT Library, Hearing aid Loaner Banks, Respite Days, Social activites which give parents a chance to meet others who are struggling with rearing a child with special needs. This organization is top notch and uses all resources to help children and families. Oh, if only we could say the same for all non-profit.

I walked with Sean and his family and friends through his battle with Ewing's Sarcoma, and was forever changed. I am so happy that the Sean Karl Foundation has been started to carry on his legacy; his willingness to push and to never give up, his positive outlook that absolutely radiated from his core, and his deep and intense heart for his family and friends. The road to a cure is a long one, but the Sean Karl Foundation is determined to fight to the end just like Seany did!

Knowing the importance of volunteers, End Slavery TN has educated and continues to educate people in the community about the existence of slavery in our state, advocacy, support and fund raising. While this is such a sensitive area for me, I really admire those who can volunteer hands on. I love to help market them when I can.  LL Mendelson
Southeast Tennessee Human Resource Agency	213102		/users/profile/276231	DisabledVet72	Client Served	1	09/02/2014	I can't speak on all of SETHRA's services they offer. But I have 3 yrs of up close experience with one particular Representative Payee named Karla McDonough. She starts out appearing to do a good job. But her attitude quick;y changes and she appears to care more about how much money is saved instead of whether the client has their basic needs met. She appears to enjoy the control she has over other people's money and seems to enjoy making you "beg" for her to release money for basic needs like winter clothes, gloves, etc.  That was bad enough, but now she has deliberately withheld a disabled vet's social security check for the past 3 months. She has sent a small amount of personal money each week for things like shaving cream, etc. But she has not sent 1 cent for my bills ( rent, water, cable, or buy food, or gas to get to the doctor appointments, or pay for medication, etc..) since May 2014. This is September 2, 2014. I have called twice and asked her to send my check for bill money, but was ignored.  I wrote a Certified Letter to Karla directly asking she send my money for bills. But still, no response whatsoever. I should NOT have to "beg" for my money. She doesn't like the fact that I recently moved. But she has the address, knows I need bill money, yet seems to be withholding it because she doesn't like that I moved. An agency is NOT supposed to try to manipulate their clients lives by withholding their money. Control issues and being  very prideful are not two characteristics  that compliment the position she holds. I do NOT recommend Karla McDonough for anything.  Also, if the agency SETHRA does not make her correctly and dependably do her job, then I wouldn't recommend them for any "so-called charity service".  Therefore,  I recommend if you hear the name Sethra, you run far away while you still can! There's no other agency I know of that is so cruel, immoral, and abusive as to make a disabled vet go hungry while they sit on his money for 3 months just because they can. I wish someone had of warned me ahead of time. It's my prayer this helps someone avoid what I'm being made to go through by this irresponsible cold heart person, Karla McDonough, a Representative Payee at (Sethra) Southeast Tennessee Human Resource Agency.

David Campbell Memorial Park	272376		/users/profile/361407	Marty10	Former staff	5	11/18/2015	This is a legitimate small community park, Its located in Rhea County in East Tenn. It is named after the first supreme Court Judge of Tenn. appointed by President George Washington Judge Campbell is buried here  with one of his son -in-laws. The non profit was gained to help require money to revitalize and  rejuvenate the park. Most etnies require you be registered as a non profit with a 501 c status before they'll donate. It was a  up hill battle but with persistence on my part we accumulated  the needed credentials to be just that. After a short time I entered in a business adventure that removed me from the community for some 3 years and in my absence all my hard work was neglected and  as far as I know IRS striped us of our 501 c status,I'm still trying to check with the State because we were registered with them as well. I would think something as admissible as a park  wouldn't need to be so accountable my gosh our budget was probably  $500.00  a year and that's really generous !
Second Harvest Food Bank Of Middle Tennessee Inc	274218		/users/profile/363587	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/10/2015	I have volunteered at this program before and I just so happen to work for the public schools. When you volunteer, sometimes you don't get to see the end result or see the people you have helped make a difference for, but I was lucky enough to see the end result. On Wednesday nights (I believe it is) they have a family night where they pack food into a plastic bag for school children who need it for the weekend. It is food that is easy to make or snack on that will last them through the weekend until they are able to go back to school and eat a meal there. Well, while at work one day I noticed that there were several children who happened to get a package from the office (they try to be discreet so not to embarrass the kids) and just so happen I saw what was in one package and it was the packaged food for the weekend. It was good to know that every volunteers' work was actually going to real people. Sometimes I wonder who really receives this or does my work make a difference, but I liked knowing that the food went to someone who really needed it.

Exchange Club-Carl Perkins Center For The Prevention Of Child Abuse	301150		/users/profile/392034	trucktrader007	Donor	5	08/21/2016	Children need somewhere to turn when they're being beaten, neglected, or sexually abused. They are scared and don't know who to trust. Fortunately, the staff at the Exchange Club and it's members, who I might add are some of the most professional, warm hearted, God fearing individuals you'll ever meet, can be of assistance and are trained in getting the children through these times of need. I'm so thankful for each of them and my wife and I will continue to support them every way we can. They are a God send and Pam Nash, the director is a sweet lady that oversees the place. They cover many counties in west TN and there's always a need for financial support. Whatever you have to spare, the Center would be more than accepting as it takes time and resources to rehabilitate these innocent little children back into society. Just think of the kids.

Love Worth Finding Ministries Inc	150257		/users/profile/200383	rosie4dogs	Donor	5	02/28/2013	Adrian Rogers was one of the best Preachers God has ever sent to this Earth.  He is now in Heaven serving his Savior there.  His radio ministry and daily email devotionals continue through Love Worth inding.  I look forward to the email every morning as a great way to start my day.  This man had a gift that goes on even after his death.  You can still hear him on Christian radio and get a daily message to lift your spirit.  I believe this charity is definately worth supporting.
Tennessee Prison Outreach Ministry	277314		/users/profile/367102	MelN	Donor	5	01/20/2016	I'm so thankful for these volunteers who do something most of us wouldn't even think about. The difference they make in the lives of the incarcerated is so important. I believe that teaching them about the Bible and how their lives can be transformed is the best hope for a better future. It also affects their families for good. Thank you to all the volunteers!
CHRISTIAN MEDICAL & DENTAL SOCIETY	278372		/users/profile/368307	the333333	Client Served	1	01/29/2016	It is with a heavy heart that I leave a negative review for this organization which exists, ostensibly, to provide medical and dental services to the world's poor.  Our staff and partners hosted a team of more than a dozen doctors and dentists from GHO in Yangon, Burma. For 14 days our personnel provided transportation, lunch, and guide services for the team at considerable expense of time and money. Our staff of national leaders operate on a shoestring budget as they provide a home and education to 33 abandoned and orphaned children. Imagine our surprise when this large team of professionals from America left the country after 14 days and provided only $850 to their hosts. This amount was not even enough to cover the expenses of food and gasoline, to say nothing of the man-hours involved in hosting them and, which is more egregious, to say nothing of the shameful act of refusing to participate in the daily ministry of providing for the needs 33 orphans! We felt used and exploited to provide touristic services for the benefit of a wealthy American nonprofit at the expense of their in-country hosts.  I feel sure that the doctors and dentists involved would be horrified to learn that the little orphanage they visited actually lost money on the GHO team and footed some of the expenses of their trip. The orphanage is in dire need of so many things and yet none of the team members or any of the leadership from GHO cared to even ask. Their purpose seemed focused on getting served, not serving and to pay as little as possible for those services. I hope the leadership of GHO will reevaluate the exploitative nature of the paltry remuneration and support they offer to their hosts. For out part, we are developing a "minimum support policy" to protect our partners and friends in Myanmar and elsewhere from being exploited by team-sending organizations in the future.
Humane Society Of Lincoln County	281796		/users/profile/371863	Sharon173	Board Member	4	03/06/2016	For several years I have volunteered with the Humane Society of Lincoln County (HSLC) that operates the only certified Animal Shelter in Lincoln County, TN. I have watched the HSLC transition from an animal pound to a true shelter, a haven for stray and unwanted cats and dogs. Our live release rate in 2015 was 84% for dogs and a whopping 95% for cats. HSLC occasionally receives grant funding that enable them to offer discounted spay/neuter surgery at a local spay/neuter clinic. Funds are used for feral & stray cats and for pets belonging to low income Lincoln County residents. The HSLC is truly a model shelter.
The Norris Area Basketball League	193116		/users/profile/252233	Brittniewilson12	General Member of the Public	1	01/25/2014	The woman who is over this basketball league will cheat to make sure her husbands team wins. Some games she does the score board and time, the next game she will be helping coach his team. The person who is over the league should not have any affiliation with coaches especially if she is going to keep score. We have caught them not giving the correct points and not stopping the clock when it needs to be stopped. They make up the rules as they go along, especially if it will benefit her husband team. There are many parents who have seen her do this. Cheating is unfair for the children who play this game to have fun. I don't recommend this league to anyone who wants their kids to play basketball.

They are nice at first until there true selves come out. I find these people very persnickety and rude. There light does not shine and they don't act like Christ would.  There are times they twist the Bible to suit there own purpose. There is legalism in the church. If they don't like what you are doing there will be a sermon directed toward you. This church does not practice what they preach.

Chattanooga Rescue Mission	101711	2	/users/profile/131061	Nancy2345678910111213	Volunteer	5	12/05/2011	In 2010 as part of a class assignment, I went to the Chattanooga Rescue Mission for a tour and to sit in on a chapel service led by the Director of Women's Ministry. It was an awesome experience that opened my eyes to the needs of these ladies who rely on the Chattanooga Rescue Mission. As a result of that tour, I now go to the mission on a monthly basis to speak to these ladies in their chapel service. It has been a very rewarding experience for me personally and I hope to the ladies with whom I interact with at the mission.
Cookeville Rescue Mission, Inc.	223255	4	/users/profile/286998	Ryan51	Client Served	5	10/15/2014	This will be more than a review of the Cookeville Rescue Mission.  There are too many personal details to cover in this format; so, I'll cover the main points. This is my story; and it's not unlike the hundreds that pass through these doors each month. 	On June 5, 2014 I was released from prison; only knowing that going back to Knoxville was not an option. My plan consisted of no more than going to Nashville on a hope and a prayer. Upon my arrival at the Cookeville Greyhound station; I learned there were no buses for Nashville until the next morning. The TDOC driver's supervisor told him to drop me off at the mission. Fate would have it that Kim England just "happened" to be standing at the front door of the mission office. I instantly felt a connection to Mrs. England and we had a lenghty conversation. I decided that night to make Cookeville my new home.	As a resident of the mission you are given everything a person may need: food, clothing, hygiene items and most of all a Bible. There are church services and twice daily devotions; headed by caring and obviously devoted staff and volunteers. If you have the drive and ambition to change your life; the Cookeville Rescue Mission just may be, the manna in the wilderness, for you. The staff may at times be spread thin; however, they do care and will do all they can for those leaning on Christ while helping themselves.	There so much potential for the growth of this ministry; and, the programs/services it offers. With the current leadership and staff support; I see no reason that Cookeville and the entire region can benefit from this ministry. This mission would fail if weren't for the continued prayers, financial support; and, donations of food, clothes, and household items from the community and surrounding area and people like you.	Matthew 25:35-40	I'd like to thank God for His many blessings seen and unseen. A special thank you to Kim England and Roger Minard for the opportunity to serve, learn, and grow. Not only in my Christian walk; but, also in my calling to social work.							Thank You,							Ryan Henry
CAT LOVERS ALLIANCE FOR WELFARE AND STERILIZATION INC	260613		/users/profile/349186	Tracey25	Client Served	5	10/01/2015	C.L.A.W.S. is a first class, true no kill shelter.  I first met these ladies, in 2005 when I needed some assistance (and loaned traps) for TNR of 23 cats at my disabled neighbors house.  In 2009, after working together to get all but one cat through the TNR process,  tragedy struck and my neighbor burnt up in his house.  17 cats remained (many had panicked with the fire truck pulled up and ran into the burning house).  C.L.A.W.S showed up and gave me food to feed the survivors for 2 years and sent an email with the story. almost $400 in donations and a big dog house were given to help me care for these survivors.  These ladies do everything they can to save the lives of their rescued cats (and a few dogs).  One cat had paralysis in his lower body.  They massaged his back for months, all the while keeping him clean and finally he was back to moving around like the others kitties.    The first sign of an ailment, years of experience kicks in to maintain the health of every cat.   If you need photos of the fire, let me know.  This is a dedicated GREAT non-profit.  Small but making such an impact.

Music lessons, vocabulary lessons, and literature classes done weekly were a joy for the children.  I loved working as a literature teacher in the program weekly for a summer. It was wonderful to talk with children about American and English Poets and discuss the history of the times the writer lived in.  Children would then draw or write to reflect on the work of the poet.  Thanks to Art for Life's Sake for such a beautiful opportunity  to help children gain a better appreciation of literature!

Best Friends Sanctuary	148303	1	/users/profile/196365	BEST FRIENDS SANCTUARY INC	Board Member	5	01/20/2013	Best Friends Sanctuary (Community Pet Advocates) is a 501 C3 (not for profit) organization dedicated to helping to reduce the unwanted animal population in Fentress County. Our mission is to assist in placing abandoned, unwanted, or abused animals in loving, responsible homes, promote spaying or neutering of the dogs and cats and to provide humane education. There is no shelter or county run dog pound in Fentress County thus there is a great need for this service.  Our rescue program is designed to help cats and dogs who are homeless find permanent homes.  Most of the animals have been abandoned in rural areas. They are not considered adoptable until they have been spayed or neutered, and have their immunization shots brought up to date.  We always have puppies, dogs, kittens, and cats available for adoption.  Our adoption fees are less than our costs.  Since April 2006, we have been working with a no kill shelter out of state. As of January 2013, we have transported 4225 dogs and puppies to the SPCA organization. They have placed all that we sent in loving, indoor homes. This has been a blessing. Without this outlet, these animals would have been put down, hit by cars, or roaming the streets as there are not enough homes in Fentress County to support the unwanted pet population. It costs a minimum for shots, worming, flea medication, etc. of $20 per animal taken to Ohio plus the cost of gasoline and maintenance to our van.  We have no financial support from the city or county.

Carter County Humane Society	285973	1	/users/profile/376016	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	04/15/2016	I tried to help out by taking some cats out of a house under construction and because we could not catch the mother to these cats I was criticized for bringing them to the Animal Shelter. Why bother getting involved and trying to help when you are insulted and belittled for doing something you did NOT HAVE TO DO TO BEGIN WITH!!! They told me I needed to try to catch the mother but yet they would NOT donate a trap to be used ... I had to put a deposit down .. and then I was still treated like a piece of trash by one smaller slender bleach blonde. I understand now why people don't want to get involved and try to help any longer when people treat you like trash for trying to do the best you can to help an animal. I was told I should have left them but if I had left them there was risk due to construction of them being injured of killed so Damned if I do and Damned if I don't and from now on due to this experience I won't any more!!!!

Ducks Unlimited Inc	151561		/users/profile/202353	Sharon062	General Member of the Public	1	03/24/2013	I'm not sure why Ducks Unlimited, Inc., is listed here. I'm not so sure it's even a non-profit. I've lived in this area all my life and know a number of 'hunters' who are avid members of this group. This is nothing more than a duck hunters delight; individuals who can't wait for DUCK SEASON TO GO SHOOT AND KILL DUCKS. Perhaps Great Nonprofits should rethink having them on this particular ANIMAL WELFARE, RESCUE page! You want to kill ducks, join Ducks Unlimited...INCORPORATED! This is a fair and valid 'review' of this group! Again, GREAT Nonprofits, this is NOT a group of members who care about animals; it is a group of 'killers of animals'....have you checked their supposed 'non-profit' status? Perhaps you should!
Tarp Inc	243391		/users/profile/330118	Donna3Kay	Volunteer	5	05/21/2015	TARP Center for Independent living has been wonderful for me.

Companion Pet Rescue And Transport Of W Tn Inc	220917		/users/profile/284611	Kelli A.	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	Companion Pet Rescue is wonderful to work with from a rescue standpoint.  They use their resources to their full pontential and they follow through on their commitments. They are professional, polite, respectful of the work of other rescues. When they rescue a litter of puppies they rescue the mom too, regardless of her health. They never hesitate to give sound advice to smaller rescues, they are always approachable and generous. The officers who make all of the decisions in terms of governance are hands on with the animals so their decisions are made with knowledge and with concern for each animal as an individual.

Tennessee Christian Academy Inc	223775		/users/profile/287524	wenben5	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	Our children have attended Tennessee Christian, which is now called Tennessee Christian Preparatory School, for the past 13 years.  Our daughter is a senior and has excelled academically, athletically, socially, and spiritually.  This school has not only prepared our children for college level courses but also instilled in them leadership qualities that will help them thrive in all areas at the collegiate level.  Our daughter has been dual enrolled since her junior year, at our local university, and is making A's in her classes.  The level of the academic curriculum is extremely challenging but has given our children the advantage they need to be successful in college, which will afford them greater opportunities in their chosen careers.  We wouldn't think of attending any other school.  
Moore Memorial Cogic	138984	1	/users/profile/185076	beard1026	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	I am writing you on behave of Moores Memorial COGIC.  We are a small church in the Klondike community in Memphis, TN. This community is surrounded by violence, drugs, prostitution, limited education, and many other elements that are plaguing the lives of people in the Memphis area.  Our church seeks to eliminate many of these barriers by giving back and reaching out to the people of our community.  We feed the neighborhood during the Thanksgiving Holiday; give baskets during Christmas, Clothes Give Away and other outreach programs throughout the year. We also prepare food for the homeless every month. We have purchased a home beside our church that our Pastor would like to have as a place where the people in the community can come and receive tutoring, food, clothing, start a GED program, and counseling.  These are just some of the things he has in mind.  In order for that vision to take place, the house has to be up to part.  When we brought it, it was a drug house and it has been destroyed in more ways the one.  If you could donate anything for our cause, it will be used in a fundraiser to raise funds for the rebuilding and remodeling of this home which will be for the Klondike community.  Anything you can do will be greatly appreciated.  Please check out our website to see what we are about and the efforts that we are trying to do to make our community and city better.  The website address is www.mooresmemorialcogic.org.  In closing, please know that we do not do what we do to get recognition.   We do it because we love God and we love people.  We all have a story.  No one knows anybody elses story until they tell you.  We all have had trouble and tribulances, but it takes caring people who are willing to look beyond what they see and desire to help someone in need.  We do not know where I journeys could have left us, but someone paved a way of escape for many of us.  This is our desire as a church.  We can not do it alone though.  We understand that we are in a recession, but I know that the smallest of gifts can amount to something extraordinary.  Please consider donating into this ministry.  It is good ground to plant a seed and when that seed grow, you will be a reason for its growth.

Hope Works Inc	276561	1	/users/profile/366359	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/14/2016	HopeWorks is a wonderful nonprofit working with those who are chronically unemployed or underemployed. They do classes for been incarcerated and GED preparation, but their main effort is a 13-week soft job skills class to equip people to enter the workforce.There is a faith component to the organization. I have been and continue to be impressed with the work they do. That's why I volunteer.

WEST TENNESSEE HEALTHCARE FOUNDTION	124769	1	/users/profile/169781	Childress4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/08/2012	There is an account entitled Injured Athlete Fund at the West Tennessee Healthcare Foundation.  I cannot tell you how many athletes have been able to finish their high school career with the help of this fund.  Many times, insurance will take care of surgery or MD visits but it will NOT take care of the specialized bracing needed to keep our players safe.  We have been able to present each case to the committee and return these ladies and gentlemen back to the sport they love.  It is a huge asset to the WEst Tennessee community and we are so proud that our young people can get the support they need without burdening their parents with even more bills.

Wilson County Community Help Center Inc	196037	3	/users/profile/256316	Sizzilin	General Member of the Public	1	03/21/2014	Most of the employees are very rude and treat you like trash. I have never in my life felt so worthless as I did when I went here for help. They talk down on you, sigh loudly, and roll their eyes at everything you say. I don't know why they even offer emergency bill payment help because you've got to literally donate a kidney to actually get that help. I understand they have limited funds and they have rude people come in all the time expecting the world to be handed to them, however there are people like me who just have bad financial luck sometimes that just need a break and they don't care if you've got freezing children in the middle of winter and no electric at home they'll still make it nearly impossible for you to receive help. They also are very annoyed by children DO NOT TAKE YOUNG CHILDREN WITH YOU when you go because they act like you brought a monkey into a library and left it by itself. Every single person I've ever asked about this place has said how horrible they were treated how rude most every employee was and how when it came to help paying bills it was non existent. Then there furniture is so over priced it's ridiculous. Honestly the place needs to be shut down and reopened by complete different people with complete different rules and regulations.

Love Without Reason Inc	156301	4	/users/profile/207337	Susan206	Board Member	5	04/25/2013	When I was five months pregnant, I was told that my son had a cleft lip, palate, hole in his heart and facial abnormality.  His stomach was not visualized during the scan, and a diaphragmatic hernia was suspected.  I was told the best medical option was an abortion, and this occurred 13 years ago.  Through prayer, God did a miracle, and what was initially not see on the ultrasound, was seen in the follow up study.  He was born alive. Though he has been through 22 surgeries, his strength is in knowing the Lord, and believing for miracles.  Our hope is to help more children and adults with craniofacial defects in underdeveloped countries by providing them free surgery, therapy, counseling and other services.  We have reached over 800 rural villages in India so far, and close to 50 surgeries.  Keep us in prayer. it's 'because every child matters'!!   God bless you !Susan Mathews

Memphis Thoroughbreds Track Club Inc	90658		/users/profile/103472	Memphis	Donor	4	06/13/2011	An excellent track club!  This coach is one who is not only dedicated to teaching children the fundamentals of track, but the fundamentals of being a winner in life.  This track club like alot of track clubs isn't financially rich by any strecth of the imagination, however is increasingly wealthy with hard working inner city kids and supportive parents.  Parent who are looking to break that "sense of entitlement  bond." This was the reason why I chose to donate to this organization.

Nashville Rescue Mission, Inc.	277309	1	/users/profile/367102	MelN	Donor	5	01/20/2016	I think this is a great local charity, which I donate to every year. I've been to one of their events where they provided a meal and live music for the people staying in the shelter. Not only do they help with immediate needs like food and shelter, they are Christ-focused and that's why I support them.
The Community Fdn Of Middle Tn Inc	82538	4	/users/profile/91056	Steve Cope	General Member of the Public	1	03/18/2011	As a victim of the Nashville floods in May 2010, I approached the Community Fund several times about getting assistance. They were worthless. They've taken in millions in flood-specific donations, but I don't know of one person in my flooded area of Bellevue that received a penny from them. They way they've mismanaged this has changed the way I will give in the future. Going forward, if I know of someone personally affected by disaster, I will give to them directly. I may not get a tax deduction, but I will at least know for sure that the money went to someone that needed it, and needed it now. Lord only knows what the CF is doing with their stockpile of cash.
Loudon County Habitat for Humanity	72455	1	/users/profile/79215	luvzlabs	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	Habitat for Humanity helps build housing for partner families.  I originally signed up to help paint.  Through their Women Build program, I have learned so much more.   Volunteers are encouraged to try different construction skills within their own comfort zone.   I have learned to build porches and stairs, install  baseboards, build sub floors and walls, install insulation ,windows, and doors, build walls and apply foam insulation.  And yes, I have even painted.  I have made new friends and seen the great joy the family experiences when they receive the keys to their new home.   I have gained the confidence to make repairs in my own home that have saved us a few dollars.  This has been a definite growing experience. 
Walden's Puddle	175495	2	/users/profile/231842	stasiaholdren	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	Walden's Puddle is Tennessee's largest wildlife rehabilitation center. Every day, WP is contacted by people who need help with injured or orphaned wildlife. As a volunteer, my role is to support the animal care staff in any way I can. Many people mistakenly believe I spend my time cuddling baby animals and bottle feeding fawn. Nothing could be further from the truth. Caring for wildlife is hard, dirty work. I scrub tanks, cages, and dirty dishes. I hose off dirty blankets and towels. I haul pallets of donated groceries and supplies. But, as hard as this work is, I love every second.  I love it because it gives me the opportunity to see amazing animals, as close as I'd ever hope to be. I can watch baby barn owls grow up, until they are released. I can marvel at how tiny the youngest fawn are, and at the many species of turtles.  As cute as many of the animals are (like the baby bobcat), there isn't  any cuddling, because the whole point is to release them back to the wild. But if you love animals you can't beat Walden's Puddle.
Rise Up Inc	202662	1	/users/profile/264404	kollegekid	General Member of the Public	5	06/12/2014	This organization came to my son's school and gave a very informative talk on STDs and realities that come with sexual contact. Their talk has caused my son to remain a virgin, and he is now 18, and thank God, is not a father at his young age! The talk on STDs from this organization made my son look at sex, as more than a casual "hip" thing to do. Sadly, our society, especially our younger folks, have turned sex into nothing more than a fling or "hooking up" with whoever, or as many as possible, just because you can. Boys To Men helped explain to my son's classmates that there are severe consequesences that can come with casual sex. Thank you for speaking the truth to our youth! There is NO such thing as safe sex; and I am grateful to this organization for teaching the truth!
A M G International	56415	2	/users/profile/58883	Theodora	Donor	4	11/05/2010	My family has been involved with donating to AMG for sponsering children on and off for many years. My father was the relief director of this organization for most of his adult life, and volunteered until his death. I have seen first hand the impact AMG has had, especially in Greece, and I am especially impressed with their healthcare ministry (for example, St. Luke's hospital in Greece). Because of my father's direct involvement, from when I was born, I know that AMG allocates the monies to the causes that they promote. For this reason I feel comfortable donating to AMG, in a day and age where we are bombarded with solicitation by non-profit organizations through the Internet and other mass media.
Chattanooga Area Food Bank, Inc.	319594		/users/profile/411269	Ann_147	Donor	5	11/29/2016	I feel it is very important to give on the local level. I give to this organization several times a year. The money is spent filling the food bank to feed out local homeless and needy. What can be better than that. I believe 90% of every dollar goes to the food bank, but I don't know for sure.

He has the story and history of the organization on one of the monitors. It's a very touching story. His family lost a child to cancer and he became aware of some needs families have when they first find out the diagnoses and that is where they come in. I would highly recommend supporting them. My company donated a web site to help them out.

TENNESSEE HUMANE ANIMAL LEAGUE	249493	2	/users/profile/337314	mlit	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	The Pet Placement Center is a true no-kill shelter on Dayton Blvd in Chattanooga.  Animals remain there until they are adopted out.  The center is clean, the cats and dogs are well cared for, and volunteers give the animals lots of attention.  Because the PPC receives no government funding, I enjoy helping them with fundraising events.  The added bonus for me, sitting in the various cat rooms and having the cats sit in my lap and purr.

Shelby Residential And Vocational Services Inc	38982	8	/users/profile/39914	irfa-karmali	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/14/2010	Shelby Residential and Vocational Services, better known as SRVS, is an impressive provider agency which stands apart from the other providers in West Tennessee. Geared toward fostering individuals, SRVS provides a comprehensive package of services that enables conservators to remain "in-house" I began working for SRVS as their Clinical Coordinator for Behavior Supports approximately 7 years ago. My analysis of the people working at this agency changed over time from "It's a job!" to "Satisfaction comes from service" Not all however. Over the next several weeks a sense of family values was observed, not only in the homes of the people supported, in the agency itself (there are close approximately 1000 employees). People were helpful and caring, eager to provide a shoulder to cry on or an ear to listen. Over the years I have seen much progress with the people we serve. The nurturing spirit many of the Direct Support Staff show to the people they assist has amazed me. As with most large agencies there will always be some who are frustrated or not satisfied. I observed this as well over the years. "So why continue to stay on when you can work at other agencies?" This has always been a question that emerges when I come across a frustrated employee. The answer is clear for most - they love what they do and are attached to those they assist. We are servants, and when we portray this characteristic we show the best in us and bring out the best in those we serve.   -Irfa Karmali, EdD, SAS, CABAS(R) Certified, DIDS approved Behavior Analyst

Partners For Christian Media Inc	113733	7	/users/profile/154743	safetysolutions4u	Donor	1	06/04/2012	My wife and I have supported this group with thousands of dollars over the years.  When I research organizations, I try to determine what their priority is:  their passion for Christian Ministry OR their passion for Christian Busine$$.  I'm sad to say that I have found the Partners for Christian Media (J103) has allowed their passion for busine$$ (money) to rule their ministry.  This is coming from someone who's supported this group for years and years.  I will not share the details (cause they will be picked apart by others), I will simply tell you this group's agenda has become more and more clear (revenue).  If you enjoy listening to their station (J103) or their annual music festival (JFest), then great!  I like that part too! But understand (like any mainstream media station) this group is A BUSINE$$ and your donations are going TO A BUSINE$$ not necessarily a ministry.  I am only charged with supporting God's work, I am not charged with supporting a specific ministry/business.  Therefore, I will be pursuing other ministries to support who has the correct priorities.  I can only hope this group figures out what they want to be (a ministry or a business) and not try to dupe their supporters!
Autism Foundation of Tennessee DBA Autism Education & Therapy Center	321608	1	/users/profile/415062	Rena4	Client Served	5	01/19/2017	We have two boys on the Autism Spectrum. We began services with the Autism Foundation of Tennessee DBA Autism Education & Therapy Center when the boys were in Preschool and Kindergarten.  We have had the best experience ever with the staff and services.  Our children are thriving.  When we began services, we were just surviving.  Our caring BCBA Casey Bateman Chauvin saw the potential that I had as a parent and the work that we had done as a family and suggested that I take a class. I took her advice and joined a DBT therapy skills group.  When I started  I could barely concentrate. Now I am an Adult Degree Student at Belmont University studying to be a social work advocate for special needs families. I have made straight As.  My children are so well adjusted and we get compliments all the time how well behaved that they are considering their disabilities.  We have received social skills services, ABA therapy, turoring ,  special summer programming, and so much more.  Our boys and I were led threw Food therapy training and they eat a variety of foods now.  Our boys potty trained at ages 7 and 9.  Oh, happy day!  The Autism ETC team has been there for us the entire way.  in 2010, we had 4 1/2 feet of in our home by way of a flood. The transition from being displaced and finding a new home and a new school system couldn't have gone any better. We have received free services when grant monies have come available.  I just can't say enough about our experience with Autism ETC.  We are so very grateful.  Our family would not be where it is today without Dustin Ellis, our Behavior Specialist for 8 years+.  Karen and Steve Blake put their heart and soul into founding  this organization and it shows. It would be an honor to work for them someday.  I hope to be involved in grant-writing to help not for profits like this reach more families. And Bethany Holton, the BCBA that went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate our family's growing needs.  She inspired me to keep trying when we were so new at this Autism life.  She connected with me on a personal level and is a friend to this day even though she moved on to another place of employment.  Forever grateful...

Besides the joy of watching her improve, it's also interesting for me to learn about her country and culture, which I've never had exposure to. If you enjoy helping people in a very tangible, personal way, NALC is the way to go.

Alzheimer's Day Services of Memphis, Inc.	142648	1	/users/profile/153202	Lynn21	Board Member	5	11/26/2012	Alzheimer's Day Services offers a program that is both critical to Caregiver respite and is unparrelled in offering the participant a safe place to enjoy actvities and peer socialization.

Always focused on helping participants maintain integrity, many are called volunteers and some even believe that they are on staff.  And the staff respects and embraces this concept! No where are Caregivers more welcomed and honored.  From support groups to Caregivers Holiday Luncheons and seasonal cookouts, the family of participants are loved and cared for, just as participants are.

Vietnam Veterans Restoration Foundation And Ministry Inc	99442	1	/users/profile/119561	Old pops	Volunteer	4	10/19/2011	I have had many good times of fellowship and encouragement workingwith David Litteral and the Vietnam Veterans Restoration Foundation. On one special occasion I was invited to assist in the construction ofa cabin at the foundation's camp on the lake near Smithville, Tennessee.David and his wife Gail have made extreme personal sacrifices in orderto further the mission of this foundation.   I am a veteran who was blessed with support and stability when I returned from the army; butthat is not always the case.   David's needs are multiplied more and moreas we see veterans lost from society and without honor.   It has been my pleasure to serve.

Brightstone Inc	192656	1	/users/profile/251574	friendofbrightstone	Board Member	5	01/16/2014	I have personally witnessed the amazing joy of families and their family member who has an intellectual challenge when BrightStone accepts them as a student.  One dad was seen pushing his adult daughter in a wheel chair down the BrightStone hallway with a huge smile and skipping as he went!  One mother cried tears of joy when she received the news!  One adult cried when he had to leave after the interview because he thought he was there to stay.  Another adult jumped up and down with excitement while her caretaker sister smiled with tears flooding down her face!  This overwhelming joy is because they find a place that not only provides for their adult with a developmental disability in a loving, caring environment, they find a place that treats them with dignity and personal value.  This is because BrightStone provides post secondary education classes in such areas as: vocational training, functional academics, art, music, social skills, nutrition and cooking, physical education, community awareness --- all with a full time nurse and a variety of therapies offered as well.  Wow!  The value of the lives and skills of the adults who have special needs is obviously the primary issue, not babysitting!  What a great place!  What a great blessing to the families and their adult!  What a great ministry!
Spirit Of Life Healing Wings Fellowship International, Incorporated	108048	3	/users/profile/146766	saint	Client Served	3	03/19/2012	Great church. Pastor is very knowledgeable in the scriptures. He caters the services to the younger and older members. He is a giving pastor. He is available for counseling, when in my experience with other pastors there aren't many that have the people at heart. Most just preach and take offerings. Afterwards they don't want to be bothered. He has help with food, shelter cost, utility bills, clothing and anything that the ministry can do to help he and his family are available. I am more knowledgeable in the bible and have exercised greater faith because of his teaching. He has a real Holy Ghost on fire service but is not stuck in old traditions. The youth department is allowed to express in ways that attract this generation. His wife and children are all saved and active in the church ministry. All of them are great teachers of the Word of God and I love their sense of humor, so much fun to be around. There is so much more I can say that's good about Spirit of Life, but most of all this pastor is a true man of God. He lives the bible. So many people get healed in every service. Tell you it is so powerful at church all the time. He encourages use to pray and fast and grow in the spirit. I love how he explains during his teaching about having freedom in our spirit and not a form of godliness, but no power. Must have a holy life to carry Gods precious anointing. Really I haven't found another ministry in this metro area that has Signs following, like the bible speaks about. If you are serious about salvation and deliverance SOL is the place to be. Life changing for real. Shout out to Bishop Eric D. Farmer and the entire SOL family. :-)

Mi Techo Inc	286578		/users/profile/376648	Carolina_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	The earth moved and it moved me.Everything began the night of Saturday, February 27th of 2010 when I was living in Santiago de Chile. The night was calm and very warm. I was enjoying the visit of a close friend from Buenos Aires. I was sleeping very comfortable in my bed when suddenly I woke up with a very lousy noise followed by a strong movement. I got up from the bed and tried to walk towards the door but realized that I couldn't move forward. Everything was moving. My friend and I managed to reach the apartment's door and got to the building's emergency stairway. I remember going down the stairs and pieces of wall falling down in front of me. I had to make a huge effort to avoid them and not hurt myself.Finally, after what it seemed an eternity, we got to the building entrance down the stairs and manage to get out of the building safe and sound. Down there, we met with the rest of the neighbors that were escaping from the building as we did. It was then when we realized that we had experienced what it seemed one of the worst earthquake that hit Chile in its history. Santiago de Chile is a very modern city, probably the most modern in Latin America, where buildings are prepared to face these type of events. Therefore, what I saw in the following days were only some cracks in buildings but nothing so bad. Especially in my neighborhood, which is a high-income neighborhood in Santiago. However, it took me a few hours before I realized that outside Santiago, many extreme poor communities had been extremely affected by the earthquake. Many families had lost the few things they had and some had even lost a relative during the catastrophe. The following Monday, I was at work when a colleague approached me and told me that he was volunteering for TECHO, a non-profit organization that transforms slums into sustainable communities, and whose housing program was perfect for emergencies such as the one Chile was facing at that time. TECHO was fundraising and massively mobilizing young volunteers in those days to build transitional houses in two days for families that had lost everything during the earthquake. I didn't doubt it for a second, and so the following weekend I was traveling with a group of colleagues to an extreme poor community four hours away from Santiago.We arrived to the community Friday night; we had to sleep in sleeping bags at the local school. We woke up very early in the morning and went to meet our family, who will spend the following days building the transitional house together with us.A couple in their early 70s and their son who was in his 30s comprised the family. The old couple had lost their small house made out of mud and had been living in a neighbors car for the last week.It took us two full days to build the transitional house. During those days, we shared our stories with them, and they told us about what happened, and how they ended up with nothing. We realized they had worked really hard their whole life to achieve very little and they lost that little in one night. They had nothing. Not even a home to survive the winter. We created a deep bond with them, we experienced first-hand their reality, and we were able to change it together with them.When we finished, we had a house warming and Luis, the head of the family, thanked us with tears in his eyes, saying that now he would be able to sleep at night knowing his family had a safe house to sleep in and get through the winter. The house we had built was a transitional house, meaning it was very basic, but even so it meant everything to them.I went back home that day with tear in my eyes, I couldn't stop crying. The earth had to move so that we all could see this reality. The earth moved so that we all could move and change this reality.  But I never expected the experience to be such a moving one for me, enough to change my life forever. Now I am so grateful that I have a home, a family, and a lot of possibilities. I realized that it was by sheer luck that I was born in a family with endless opportunities, that we could have just as well, been born with none, in fact, worse yet, with the odds against us. And that is exactly, what inspires me to give. TECHO gave me the opportunity to experience the reality in which many families live in the world, and be able to change it. I will be grateful for ever.(I'm currently living in the US, I am a US resident)

MANNA PROJECT INTERNATIONAL	54742	2	/users/profile/56513	hudsonbaird	Volunteer	4	10/13/2010	I first volunteered with Manna Project during my freshman year of college at Vanderbilt University.  They were offering short-term service trips to Nicaragua, and I was lucky enough to join without knowing what I was getting into.  From there I was hooked on international development.  Seeing people just out of college working full-time in Latin American countries inspired me to get more involved in service back in the States, and eventually led me to Guatemala, where I now work full time for Manna.The organization gives its employees a significant amount of early responsibility, and has a good volunteer development program in place that pushes us to put the communitys wishes first in our work.  Instead of strict protocol theres flexible dialogue, and instead of consultants and oversight, theres encouragement and freedom.  On the ground we provide dedicated service to the communities where we work and push ourselves to create sustainable initiatives that utilize existing strengths, work through partner organizations, and highlight positive deviants to motive other residents.

The Family Action Council Of Tennessee Inc	100680	7	/users/profile/124000	Aaron23	General Member of the Public	1	11/15/2011	The Family Action Council of Tennessee (FACT, an oxymoronic acronym if I ever heard one) is travesty of an organization. They claim to stand for family values and improving family functionality, health and safety and all that, but my experience of them is that they are deceitful, intolerant, exclusive, and most of all, promoters of hatred. Recently, FACT teamed up with David Fowler to lobbied against a piece a legislature that requires vendors to the municipal government in Nashville to sign a non-discrimination affidavit (towards LGBT folk). FACT with other silent organizations to get TN state legislators to ratify a blanket policy, articulating that individual municipalities in TN (like nashville or any other city) cannot diverge from state regulations for small business; in other words, since the state doesn't have a non-discrimination policy towards LGBT folk, neither can Nashville.  Ostensibly, this policy was passed to help small businesses adhere to state regulations, if that was actually the case, why was FACT involved at all? What do they have to state regulations? Nothing. Absolutely, positively nothing.  From what I've read and talked to people from FACT, they're main concern is that people of alternative lifestyles aren't corrupting their children or business. That basically, LGBT folk are degenerates of society.  How can they call themselves a Family Action Council when they promote hate for other people, instead of love and acceptance? All I can say is that I will never, ever give a dime to these people, recommend volunteering for them or do it myself. While I believe they do some good with food drives and other charitable givings, I would also be able to, in the same breath, bless Stalin's dictatorship  for taking care of people who agreed with him - forget the hundreds of thousands of people he killed. Promoting hate and intolerance, in my mind is the same.  Until FACT seriously revamps its message, I will campaign against them, and continue to advise anyone who reads this review to please think twice before offering your time, talents or capital to these people. 
Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition	107923		/users/profile/146587	Nancy Allen	Board Member	5	03/15/2012	TBCC is truly an organization apart from most others in that it is "grass roots" which means all money collected remains in the state.  Volunteers are a vital part of what TBCC accomplishes as is the generousity of all supporters.    From the largest fund raiser, the Celebration of Life TBCC Classic golf tournament held in August  to the garage sale proceeds given in honor of a breast cancer survivor, every dime is welcomed and wisely spent.  This disease doesn't want to go away but the quality of life for those who battle is enhanced by all that TBCC provides to the communities in Tennessee.
Tennessee Hemophilia & Bleeding Disorders Foundation	286927		/users/profile/376999	Cody_B2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I have Hemophilia B and I didn't know any other hemophiliacs personally until I went to Camp Freedom when I was about 6 years old. The camp is sponsored by the Tennessee Hemophilia & Bleeding Disorders Foundation. Camp Freedom is a place for kids with bleeding disorders to come together to learn and to become part of the community. The bleeding disorders community is large and it becomes your extended family. Kids get to participate in fun activities in a safe environment because many of the staff members are medical professionals. The camp teaches you about teamwork and responsibility. The staff shows you how to care for yourself (learning how to infuse, understanding your disorder) and how to care for others. They show you how to enjoy life safely and not live in fear. For those of us who didn't know anything about their disorder and felt alone, this camp is a life raft in a sea of confusion. Im in college now and I am a volunteer counselor for the camp. Im studying biology and Im going to be a hematologist so I can continue supporting this community that has been so good to me and my family. I recently learned that I also have von Willebrands Disease and a platelet function defect. I have three bleeding disorders, but Im prepared to handle that thanks to Camp Freedom and THBDF.This is why I give.Wont you please support the Tennessee Hemophilia and Bleeding Disorders Foundation to keep this camp going and to help other kids like me? They dont have to be alone.

The other employee is late and claims hour that he do not work also client claims he gets picked on by him and hit at times. I informed management nothing was done. This is not professional.

Shalom Foundation	150349	1	/users/profile/200493	Eric Hobson	Board Member	5	03/01/2013	For more than 15 years, The Shalom Foundation has been committed to serving children in Guatemala. In addition to long-standing efforts in creating educational opportunities, securing housing, and improving nutrion, in 2011, TSF built and opened a pediatric surgical hospital (The Moore Pediatic Surgey Center) in Zone 1, Guatemala City. In 2012, 500 children received life-changing specialty surgery from surgical teams out of many of America's leading children's hospitals. Each surgery was performed free of charge by dedicated teams of medical missions volunteers. By 2014, the hospital will be functioning at full capacity hosting 36 surgery teams each year. 1,500 children will receive care each year and, then be able to lead lives with less pain, less social stigma, and more joy. I started volunteering with TSF with no intention to get deeply involved. Now, three years later, I find myself more amazed by the work that can be accomplished through careful stewardship of gifts of talent, time, goodwill, money, and prayer. TSF accomplished a hard task: it passed my cynical, questioning-of-motives informed test for believing in the "pitch" made by non-profits. The TSF team is a dedicated group of humble, but amazingly talented, professionals who believe that by affecting the lives of "the least of these," they are repaying the many blessings that have been bestowed on them in their lives. The Shalom Foundation is a trustworthy steward of the gifts it receives. Eric H.

The horses do the real work, the volunteers have the privilege of cheering and supporting amazing transformations in people.  Those horses love their job.  We have seen language barriers torn down, opportunities not otherwise offered to "different" children, self esteem grow, and bodies become stronger, walks more upright and correct, and relationships form.  There is a camaraderie among families whether their child is 4 or 40.  We have seen abused children learn appropriate ways of dealing with challenges on horseback that translate to everyday life.

Mid-South Lions Sight And Hearing Service	68609		/users/profile/74960	angel72653	Client Served	5	02/15/2011	When I was younger I was the kid everyone picked on and bullied. Why? It is because I had very bad eyes. My glasses were very thick and only got thicker over the years. "Coke bottles" and four eyes were a part of my daily life.When I got older I found out that adults were no better with the taunting remarks. I was even married at a young age to a man who used to hide my glasses when he to work. I am of course no longer with that one, but it just goes to show that kids are not the only ones who can belittle or bully someone just because of a disability. I went to see my family eye doctor about 12 years ago and he told me at that time that along with the astigmatism and myopia, I also had cataracts in both eyes and pin holes in my Retinas, and if left untreated my Retinas would detach, and  he said they could no longer find a viable prescription for my eyes and that I definitely needed surgery as soon as possible. I could not afford the surgery at that time as I had no insurance and no money. Someone told me to talk to the local Lions Club in the town where I worked, they introduced me to the  President of that Club, He told me that their Club could not do anything on their own to help me but that they knew of the Mid-South Lions in Memphis that maybe could. So with that he contacted them and within a week I was at one of their 8 satellite clinics being seen by one of the top Doctors in this state. I found out that the Doctors volunteer their services to the patients, this Doctor told me he had never seen eyes as bad as mine and he wanted to my case personally. That was the beginning of a 2 year process that included four procedures on each eye and today, now, I have near perfect vision.  Mid-South took care of everything for me at no cost to me even for the yearly follow-ups since the beginning. I would never be able to re-pay or thank them enough for giving me the future that they have. Without them I am sure I would be blind today, with no hope of a life without blindness. I wish I could do more to help them help others. I used to cry tears of sadness on a daily basis now I cry tears of joy daily, for the sight they have given me and the love, caring, and concern that they have shown to me over all these years. Thank you Mid-South Lions.

I met the creators of this non-profit community theatre way back in college in the Theatre Department of what was then Memphis State University. These ladies (Jenny Odle Madden and Alice Rainey Berry) went on to create Voices of the South and lead very creative lives. I went into sales and into the business world. A very determined young woman, I set my goals on career, love, and then offspring. I created a successful career in sales. I met and married the man of my dreams, Tim. But God had other plans about the offspring. Tim and I discovered that we would never be able to have children. I was broken. I had a hole in my heart. About that time I reconnected with Voices of the South and began donating my time and money to support them. I attended a writer's workshop lead by Rebecca Fisher. With Jerre Dye as my writing coach, I created a script named JACK that chronicled my adventures with infertility. And, as theatre does, I was transformed. I was healed. My heart felt whole again. As a matter of fact, six weeks after my final performance of JACK, Tim and I discovered that we were naturally, accidentally pregnant. Five years ago we had our daughter, Lola, and she makes the world a better place. I BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF THEATRE TO TRANSFORM. I BELIEVE in Voices of the South's mission to create original theatre with a unique Southern perspective. And I BELEIVE in supporting this one-of-a-kind theatre company that TRANSFORMS THE WORLD...INTO A BETTER PLACE.

Everyone was so open with their stories and how they felt about different situations. Being in that kind of environment just made us all fell at ease. It also helped the fact that Christy was just as open as the women who came to the session. I am sure that the women that had different things happen to them in their lives felt really comfortable knowing that it is not just them that this has happened to, I am not alone. This REAL TALK Session was Uplifting for me and I look forward to more. Thanks.

Rocinante	164694	6	/users/profile/218871	gaylagroom	Board Member	1	08/12/2013	This organization is beneath contempt. Rocinante board members stole my house and the houses of several other old and disabled people. For more info, see below, or go to indiegogo and search for "help me take my house back". What happens when a nonprofit corporation decides it wants to change its mission but poverty-level old people have built homes on the corporation's land, in accordance with its original mission? The corporation evicts the old people  without compensating them for their houses. Stephen and Ina May Gaskin are both counterculture heroes, both recipients of the Right Livelihood Award and the Counterculture Hall of Fame Award. He's known for being the charismatic schoolbus caravan guru who started the Farm in Summertown, Tennessee, in 1972  the longest lasting of all the intentional communities to come out of the 60s  and for his dozen books on spiritual and political topics, including Cannabis Spirituality. Ina May, author of the classic Spiritual Midwifery and a popular international lecturer, has been called "the most famous midwife in the world." I served as Stephen's assistant for eight years, ending in 2011, spending hours every day with him, often in his and Ina May's bedroom/workspace, where he worked from bed like a king. I also helped Ina May with her midwifery projects, and the three of us enjoyed an intimate and steadfast friendship. Stephen was deposed from leadership of the Farm in 1983, although he continued to live there and be revered by most members. In 1992, he aimed to relive his ruling status by starting another community next door on 100 acres, setting up a nonprofit corporation called Rocinante (where I lived) with the intention of creating a place where old hippies could retire and eventually experience high-quality deaths. The project made little progress over the years, partly because of provisions that residents would build their own houses (or have them built) and then donate the houses to Rocinante upon their deaths. Over the years, only five houses were built, and Stephen assured residents that if they needed to sell their houses, they could. Since residents more or less worshipped Stephen, and since Stephen was supposed to be infinitely trustworthy (an "ascended master"), no one ever asked for anything in writing, until some new folks arrived in 2010. When I left the Farm in 2011 (a story in itself), Rocinante was in the process of drawing up deeds and community regulations to formalize the unwritten agreements that had been operating for years. Concurrently, Stephen began dropping into senility.  The Rocinante Board of Directors at that time included Stephen and Ina May, Stephen's daughter Dana Gaskin Wenig, and Pamela Hunt, head of the Farm Midwifery School, and Peter Schweitzer, executive director of nonprofit Plenty International. With residents demanding their rights, and with me now living in Mexico and Stephen losing his memory, the Board circled their wagons and stopped talking to Rocinante residents.  I had induced my friend Rick to build a house at Rocinante, and he spent six years doing so. In 2011, he became disillusioned with Rocinante and wanted to leave, as did the new folks who'd arrived in 2010. The Board went to extraordinary lengths to keep them from selling their houses. Apparently, the Board had decided, without consulting residents, to "stop doing the old people thing" and to instead use Rocinante for the Farm Midwifery School (thus avoiding liability issues on the Farm). Unfortunately, there were a few old people cluttering up the place, and they wanted to be paid for their houses. By May 2011 I was back at Rocinante squatting at Rick's house through the summer, trying to help resolve the hateful situation that had developed, but since I had taken the stance that the Rocinante residents had a right to the property they had built, no one on the Board would talk to me. Stephen and Ina May reportedly told some mind-blowing lies blaming me for their errors (for instance, saying I had hidden a lawyer's letter from Stephen, when in fact I had read it to him (he's mostly blind) and we'd then had a two-hour meeting with the lawyer to discuss it). As Stephen's senility increased, he made things up out of whole cloth, and believed them, and those around him chose to believe him also,  when it suited them. There was a lot of drama over the summer, including a heated protest outside the Farm store and a contract signed by Stephen and then torn up in residents' faces by Dana Gaskin Wenig. One resident was nearly driven to suicide by powerlessness in the face of Rocinante's refusal to deal with critical issues. Finally, in August 2011, Rick was able to sell his house, despite some world-class skullduggery from the Rocinante Board of Directors. The BOD signed a separate agreement with the buyers (specifying that they could not sell the house and that their interest in the house expired at their deaths). But in May 2012, the Rocinante BOD sent Stephen and Ina May's son Sam Gaskin  a super-buff Brazilian street fighting champion  to evict Rick's buyers. They left, with the impression that it had been Rick who evicted them, and still owing $17,000 on the house purchase contract. Rick found out about the eviction only when he hired a collection agency for nonpayment from the buyers. He then wrote Peter Schweitzer of the Rocinante BOD, who replied he had nothing to say to Rick. I recently learned that on Christmas Eve 2011, Sam had similarly evicted Donnie Rainbolt, one of the earliest Rocinante residents, who was returning, after successful surgeries, to the cabin he'd built there. He was told that his cabin was going to be used to house students of the midwifery school. When he requested compensation, he was told absolutely not. He is trying to get permission to live on the Farm, but without reimbursement for his house he didn't have enough money to qualify. Donnie died in fall 2012, heartbroken. Only one Rocinante resident remains. Her house is contractor-built (worth maybe $70,000), unlike the houses of the folks who were evicted (worth an estimated $10,000 and $25,000). She is afraid to step out of line lest she too be evicted. The deeper you look into the Rocinante massacre, the more jaw-dropping it becomes  everywhere you look, there is level after level of deceit and hateful, self-serving, egomaniacal behavior on the part of people who were supposed to be the purest, kindest, most evolved and humanitarian of what Earth has to offer. Meanwhile, the Farm continues feeling good about itself as it works to better the plight of the oppressed around the world, utterly ignoring the corporation that stole everything old people built with their own sweat, the only assets they had in the world, the plank in its eye next door.

The people who work their receive very little pay, they want you to basically forget you have a life, family or kids, and God forbid you have a family emergency the one lady will be rude and ugly and belittle you for an emergency. The employees are not  respected or treated well, they act as if you should be thankful for minimum wage, a 10 raise once a year, and to work every major holiday. My coworkers we great and I loved my clients and that was the only enjoyable part of that job because they rest of the enterprise show no respect or gratitude for all  you do and not one bit of compassion for you if you have an emergency situation with your family.

Jackson Madison County Humane Society	208250	2	/users/profile/270931	MadResident	General Member of the Public	1	08/01/2014	When I visited the facility it was a beautiful day and yet no dogs were outside in the fenced area. All of the dogs were inside in concrete kennels. The smell from the kennels was overwhelming. As I walked through the kennels I saw that there were typically two dogs to a kennel, I assume for socialization purposes, but no toys, no chews, no beds, no blankets. Just a water bucket and two dogs whose only entertainment is to jump up to try to see out the opening of the kennel. The lightbulbs were in need of changing and the whole place was dim and dreary. Some of the dogs behaved aggressively towards me as I walked past their kennels. All in all, it was a heartbreaking experience and we did not adopt a dog that day. There was no way to really evaluate personality in such a stressful environment.  I know that they raise very large sums of money throughout the year and yet, it looked as if the dogs were not receiving any benefit  from this. 
Lakeshore United Methodist Assembly	57422		/users/profile/60657	Kathy K.	Volunteer	5	11/19/2010	Lakeshore is one of those amazing places where I experience God in a profound way.  As a volunteer, I have served as a counselor, as part of leadership teams, and as a board member.  Each experience humbled and inspired me.  One night while doing pottery with a Girl Scout troop, I invited a disruptive restless girl to help me glaze my favorite piece of pottery.  I didn't really want her help but I felt obligated to keep her busy and out of trouble.  She began painting and as she painted she told me her story.  She was her dad's last birthday gift.  He was dying on his birthday and wanted to see her one more time.  Her mom couldn't provide her a home so she was living with an aunt and uncle.  She relaxed into painting and the disruptive and restless behaviors disappeared.  I sat there in awe of God.  He had used this place and this girl to make me a more compassionate person.   I grew up a little that day and am thankful to Lakeshore for being a place that brings out the best in us.

Country Music Foundation Inc	99077	2	/users/profile/118481	Stacy Harris	General Member of the Public	1	10/07/2011	The Country Music Foundation has sold Charity Navigator a bill of goods. While supposedly "The mission of the CMF is to identify and preserve the evolving history and traditions of country music and to educate its audiences,"  nothing could be further from the truth! I am a print and broadcast entertainment journalist of 40 years' experience.  I am the sole author of three published country-music books and have been a contributor to several others.  No one working in the field today can match my credentials nor is better positioned  to tell the CMF's story. During my earliest years in Nashville. writing for Country Song Roundup,  I had a very cordial working relationship with the Country Music Foundation,     That relationship ended suddenly for no apparent reason.   Were the CMF a private entity, its blacklisting could perhaps be justified.  As is, as a Section 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Foundation not only refuses to invite me to its media functions and thereby "educate" my audiences by reporting whatever positive news it generates,  it has refused to stock my books in its gift shop (despite the fact that the Hall of Fme gift shop prides itself in stocking all manner of country-music titles, including the most obscure\). It has always been my desire that my 40-year collection of priceless recorded interviews with country-music legends, one-of-a-kind photographs of these folks (many of which have never been published),  and various limited-edition memorabilia find a home with the Country Music Foundation.   Incredibly, the CMF has rejected these donations! Further, it has put obstacles in my place when I ask that its 990s be made available for public inspection and encouraged its attorney to harass me. Where it would have been pragmatic to perhaps ask for an apology, if warranted, accept one if received, forgive, forget and move on,  the CMF chose the low road, culminating in my being physically assaulted by one of its officials.   Because my physical injury was minimal and because the perpetrator agreed to mediation, I did not press the criminal charges that would have resulted in her arrest after documenting the particulars with a CMF security guard.   However, when other Foundation officials joined the assailant in refusing cooperation with the mediator I was forced to press civil charges.   I regret that this action was necessary but as, I have chronicled on my Web site, these actions are part of pattern of behavior that should not only concern donors, it should result in a loss of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum's accreditation by the American Association of Museums and in the CMF's privileged tax status being revoked. Links in support of my statements and the CMF's other appalling, nonprofessional behavior  may be found at: http://stacyharris.com/iveykyle.html http://stacyharris.com/adultery.html http://stacyharris.com/ronnie.html http://stacyharris.com/horsnell.html

When my son started to have problems it's the first place I thought of. As the year went on, the turn around rate on therapist were horrible, he had a new therapist about every month. You leave them voicemails, but they will NEVER return your call. There is supposed to be someone in the Mooresville office but they are not, and when you speak to the Martinsville Office they will tell you "o she only comes in when she wants to, and if she doesn't feel like coming in, she won't". They will tell you, you have a balance but between Bloomington, Mooresville, and Martinsvill they have no idea how much you owe or even if you own anything. They lie to you and state they cannot mail, email, or fax you a receipt and yet you call and ask make a payment on a different day and they all of a sudden are able to mail you a receipt. The office staff do not know their supervisors names or titles, they refuse to give out extensions, they refuse to give out anyone's name. and they will make sure to tell you that the person you are looking for is never available, and will return a week later because they are always out in the field or vacation.

I wish I lived in Memphis so that I could attend this church more regularly. I will definitely be coming back. 
Whatever It Takes Ministry Inc	251905	5	/users/profile/339901	Docbeaker	Professional with expertise in this field	1	08/06/2015	W.I.T.- Whatever It Takes MinistriesCharity Scam? So far, almost all of my new experiences in the Chattanooga area have been pleasant. The ones that werent just werent that bad, because I understand that not everything goes perfect all the time. Ill give you some background. My 8yo son is a runner. He absolutely loves running. As a matter of fact, one of his claims to fame is that in our last 5K race he beat me by over 30 seconds. One of the things I was most looking forward to with our move to Chattanooga was entering races with him. It was all flat back home, so I figured the elevation changes in this area would give him a new challenge. Were not rich and races arent cheap, so I waited until I found a race that not only fit our schedule but would also be fun.  I finally found one. It was a superhero run sponsored by and supporting the Whatever It Takes ministry. This was going to be some much fun. He and would throw on some superhero costumes and have a blast. The race information in the Chattanooga Times Free Press also mentioned kids activities at Coolidge Park. Even better! The rest of my family could also go and have fun while we run. I signed us up on Eventbrite with no problems. I even received an e-mail reminder the Wednesday before the race. Then the problems began. The race was supposed to be on Friday, but the Thursday paper gave a Saturday date for it. I called the number listed on the race page to ask about it Yeah, this is Dave. I signed up me and my son for the 5K, and I just wanted to confirm the date for it. Oh, thats been cancelled for a while. I didnt even know the page was still up. Man, thats a shame. My son was really looking forward to this. How do I go about getting a refund? I dont even know. I guess youll have to call your credit card for that. One of the other volunteers was in charge of the race, and Im not involved with it. You realize your name and phone number are listed on the website for it, right? Yeah, Im not really involved with the race. Thanks for calling. I started the process of trying to get a refund, which was made even more difficult because the race entry page on Eventbrite was never shutdown. As of the writing for this post, its still there. My second act was to walk into the family room and break it to my son that, due to a big screw up by people who didnt have their act together, hes gonna not be able to dress up like a superhero or run. Thanks for the welcome to the area! After this kind of a mess up that I lump into the people sure are stupid sometimes, I decided to look into the Whatever It Takes ministry a little further. Im pretty familiar with races being run to support small ministries and charities. Its a common practice and a fun way to do fundraising. Im also pretty familiar with the fact that a lot of charities are nothing more than for profit scams. What I found when I investigated the WIT was disconcerting. At this point, Im not even sure what they do.  Heres what I found There are two WIT (Whatever It Takes) ministries in Chattanooga. By all appearances, both seem to know each other. Im not sure what the Uncle Grandpa type relationship between the two of them is. Both of them had something to do with the race. Both of them blamed the race issue on other volunteers who apparently worked for them but they had zero control over. They also seemed unwilling to take responsibility for actions done by these volunteers under the auspices of the ministry name. Both of them seem to be having a lot of internal troubles as evidence by Facebook posts, phone calls, and this race. One of them claims to be Christian and the other appears to have an Oriental focus with a yin yang logo (although theres a Facebook thread where even this seems to have caused problems). Both of them have Facebook sites.   One of them has a basic website, and I could not find a website for the other one. I checked on the TN state website for registered charities to see if either was there. Neither one came up. A Google search for Whatever It Takes Chattanooga took me to a Guidestar page where one of them was listed. Im not sure which one, though, as they dont seem to have shared any information with Guidestar.  In the hopes that youll learn from my mistake, heres a few suggestions I would make1.Dont ever sign up for a charity race unless they also have a big name sponsor attached to it as well. If nothing else, this implies legitimacy and added safety during the race. By big name, Im talking about a grocery store, fitness store, hospital, or something along those lines.2.Pay for your races with your credit card and not with Paypal. Its easier to seek a refund through your credit card than the lengthy Paypal resolution process.3.Check out all charities before you donate or participate in any way. No evidence of legitimacy or actual charitable work means you should not donate or volunteer.4.Dont equate a bunch of Facebook likes on a charity page to any form of legitimacy.5.Dont let this keep you from running races with your kids or donating to real charities or your church. 6.Dont upset my kid again. Heres my advice to both WIT charities1.Give me a refund on the race that never happened.2.Apologize to my son.3.Get your house under control. From the outside it looks like someone pressed self-destruct buttons on both organizations.4.Fix the issue of having two ministries with the same name in the same city.5.Establish some legitimacy in your organizations. Maybe partnering with a church or other organization would help you learn how to run a charity.

Scary place with highly unstable leadership. They have tried to develop a marketable program for churches and make their "spiritual system" more christianized by inserting some scripture references. This place is a sham. They talk you into giving them all your money to "save" you, run you through a low quality program where they scream and swear at you to break you down and work with you to "discover your feelings." They push you to cry and tell them all about your failures so they can build you back up in their teachings. Cult-like and dangerous. Another guy that went through them for help wound up taking his family and moving states away to try and rebuild and heal his family and his marriage. They have destroyed more than one person and turned family member against family member. Stay far away.
Music And Your Memory	89731		/users/profile/102158	donreed	Volunteer	5	06/07/2011	Goodlettsville TN 2009Don Reed was performing in a physical room, in which there were 6 or 7 patients. One was an elderly woman about 90-95years of age. She was sitting in a wheelchair with no expression on her face. She hadnt been responding to the therapy given by the therapist. Don was performing a song from the decade of the 20s with a twist beat. The song was, When Your Old Wedding Ring Was New.  Don recalls when he came to the line, what a beautiful picture you made as my bride he playfully took his guitar and pointed it at her taking a step toward her. She responded by looking up and smiling at him, then struggled to get up out of her wheelchair. At that moment, the staff ran to her side, fearful that she may fall, and assisted her. Once she got her footing, she did a little dance (much like the twist), walked up to his side, and kissed him on the cheek. Blushingly she covered her face and remarked oh my God what did I do!?  Then she turned around and with assistance from the staff, happily twisted all the way back to her wheelchair. What you have read is a testimony to the Healing Power of Music.

WRT seems to be really hung up on adoptive parents having a fenced yard even though they have not spoken to the perspective, adoptive parents to find out their method of care for their Westie.A fenced yard is great, but dogs can get out of the fences at the blink of an eye if you are not watching them.  Good parents should be watching their dogs and making sure they are safe whether in be in a fenced yard or on a leash. Not everyone wants a Westie, but those of us that do,  should have the chance to adopt and give these dogs a good home.  
EAST TENNESSEE SPAY & NEUTER INC	191764	2	/users/profile/250265	S. Heiden	Board Member	5	12/28/2013	What started out as a small "taxi service" to and from the nearest low cost clinic has blossomed into one of the most wonderful non-profits I've ever had the pleasure of being a part of. With over 2000 pets having been spayed or neutered via the shuttle bus and vouchers, thousands of homeless animals have been spared from entering the shelter system or having to be euthanized.  ETSN is growing and the outreach to our local communities couldn't be more appreciated. Weather it's the pet food pantry, help with spay & neuter or just some simple training tips, all roads lead back to home for these pets and their families. ETSN allows people to keep their cherished pets in time of financial crisis rather than surrendering them to area shelters or posting them on Craigslist.  Branching out to hold hands & paws with other local organizations, ETSN can now offer low cost veterinary care at the Paws of Hope Wellness Center and TNR services for feral cat colonies through Appalachian Feral Cat Allies.  ETSN is supported solely on volunteers and donations. If you or your pet would like to help and/or get help and you live in the Tri-Cities area I highly recommend this Non-profit! (423) 289-5548

Because the residents of The Manna House have accepted the powerlessness of their addictions and have made the conscious decision toward recovery, a high level of accountability and security exists at The Manna House.

2 Million Dogs 2 Miles	199022	1	/users/profile/259860	deannefortson	Volunteer	5	04/26/2014	Finding a cure for cancer is important to all of us!  Where 2 Million Dogs steps in is that it provides grants to places that research comparative oncology in dogs and humans.  Dogs get many of the same cancers that humans get.  In dogs, the cancers metastasize faster, which makes them easier to study and the benefits can be studied for human use.  On a personal note, my father died from lymphoma on January 11, 1997.  My dog Marshal was diagnosed with lymphoma on January 11, 2012...exactly 15 years after my father's death.  We lost Marshal just 9 months later on October 24, 2012.  This was my cousin's birthday, who died from lung and bone cancer.  Before Marshal, we had also lost 2 cats and a rabbit to cancer.  This horrible disease affects more than our species.  Because of the impact cancer has had on us, we volunteer for 2 Million Dogs at the Puppy Up! Canine Cancer Walk  seeking to raise money for cancer research.  We need to end this disease NOW!

They now build orphanages, feed thousands of children, drill clean water wells, and support single moms who are at risk of surrendering their children by training and mentoring them, employing them and giving them a path out of poverty. They not only address immediate needs, like hunger or the need for medicine, they also look at holistic solutions to the problems. I've worked with them for many years and gotten to know all of the members of the team and they are really great people that truly care about the causes and people they are assisting. They are a SMALL family-run  organization that works in a shoestring budget and they fundraise for their own needs separately from the organization, so your money really goes to the people who need it most, not salaries and overhead.

Nashville Soccer United	267013		/users/profile/355765	BryanL	Client Served	1	10/24/2015	I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt and have never written a negative review like this. I generally don't think it's my place to punish businesses and organizations through reviews but instead use Yelp and related sites to reward good ones.  But parents should know what they are getting into with this league. It is terribly disorganized and unprofessional. The person who runs the league has sworn at parents in front of second graders. His response to any concern is "That's not my problem" or "I don't give a #$@&." Their Facebook page promises to "advance your soccer skills with professional coaches," but the ratio of trained coaches to children at practices is 60 to 1 at my son's school and zero trained coaches present at games for the in-town league. They cancel scheduled games in the middle of the season for no reason without providing a make-up to allow players the opportunity to participate in the promised number of matches. Avoid this league, unless you want your children exposed to a rude league coordinator who makes false promises, can't provide necessary staffing, and openly acknowledges that he doesn't care about the well-being of children.

Oakland Patriots Youth Football	297776		/users/profile/388590	Concernedparent3	General Member of the Public	1	07/23/2016	this Youth Organization is very unfair they do not evaluate the children properly they will take your money and will not play your child the whole season they only show interest in their own children trying to give them the spotlight they do not give the other children an opportunity and do not listen to parents concerns they are very unorganized! this year 2016 5 days into practice without any gear they already got their teams made up because they already know who they wanted they didn't even give the other children an opportunity to see what they could do they knew they wanted their kids in the spotlight being quarterbacks running backs and leaving the other kids on the sidelines as they do every year the President and Vice President very bad attitudes very unprofessional and very unfair they need some real coaches out there that evaluate those children properly and give the kids a great opportunity to show what they can do or have tryouts instead of taking everyone's money and not letting their child play Chesney take your money elsewhere do not waste your money on this league
Smyrna Heart Of Grace	286846	1	/users/profile/376917	Tracy_W2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Smyrna Heart of Grace has Giving Tuesday every week! I love being a part of this nonprofit. We deliver food, toiletries, clothes, and other needed things to local families in need, most in transient housing. So many children are happy to get something so simple, like a new toothbrush, from us, and it makes me just want to just do more.  These families look forward to their visit each week, and they are made to feel important and loved.
Proverbs 31 Finishing School & Freedom Stars Programs	258305		/users/profile/346791	Gail58	Volunteer	5	09/18/2015	This non-profit service is changing women's lives that most people have forgotten.  The women in the Knoxville missions and ministries want to be productive and hopeful people in our society, they just don't know how.  Proverbs 31 Finishing School is telling them HOW and giving their lives HOPE where there was NONE.  
American Cancer Society-Making Strides Against Breast Cancer	309984	1	/users/profile/401315	Karen-70	General Member of the Public	1	10/12/2016	American Cancer Society is not publicly respected and they are not trustworthy because of their poor reputation and shams. All they are interested is to get your money. Here are just a couple of public record links about them:  http://naturalsociety.com/100-page-report-american-cancer-society-scam/  http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/05/24/american-cancer-society--more-interested-in-wealth-than-health.aspx
