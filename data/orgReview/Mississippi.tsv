Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	312013		/users/profile/403365	lohra	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	I spent a little over two months working at SpayPanama and had a blast. As a Pre-Veterinary student this opportunity offered a great way to gain experience and will set my self apart from other applicants to vet school. While working there I learned how to prepare animals for surgery as well as take care of them afterwards. I became very proficient at shaving, expressing the bladder, giving SQ and IM injections, as well as tattooing and clipping the ears. Aside from just the hands on experience I was able to watch as many different types of surgeries as I pleased. It is a Pre-Veterinary student's dream. I  understandable so, did not perform any surgeries because of my lack of education, however, many students from all over the world in veterinary school were able to and gained a great deal of valuable surgical experience. It is my goal to return once I am in vet school to follow in their footsteps. Not only did the clinic offer a great deal of hands on experience they also did so in a very welcoming and encouraging way. They always were quick to share a laugh and never hesitated to pull me aside and show me an interesting case. I made some really great friends and have created wonderful relationships that will remain for years to come. I recommend SpayPanama to anyone that is interested in Veterinary Medicine or just to those who desire contribute to the continuing effort to help improve the welfare of thousands of animals. 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	302936		/users/profile/394094	Laurie709	Volunteer	4	09/08/2016	My time with Spay Panama was really great! I volunteered with a fellow vet student for three weeks. Everyone at Spay Panama made me feel very welcome and helped teach me many things during my time there (e.g. the quick spay method). I feel I gained many helpful skills that will prove useful for my future veterinary career and I have gained more confidence in my surgical skills. As well as getting veterinary experience in the clinic and at spay events, I got to experience different aspects of Panamanian culture and the team were great at showing us different parts and tourist sites in Panama City. Thanks to everyone who made my time at Spay Panama so wonderful.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	302388		/users/profile/393518	Endthesuffering	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/02/2016	I met Patricia Chan over 20 years ago and was struck by her intelligence, focus and readiness to work.  Her work over the past 20 years has been phenomenal and tireless.  She gives her all.  She works with many people to end the suffering of strays and street animals in a number of ways, the most effective of which is the spay and neuter campaigns to cut the numbers of unwanted animals in Panama.  There are other much larger and well-funded organizations that do far less than SPAY PANAMA, and we hope that people will choose to support SPAY PANAMA - which is right there, on the ground, in action all the time.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	301548		/users/profile/392495	Phyllis30	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/25/2016	Dear Reader, I am W. Marvin Mackie D.V.M. retired.  I wish to send my support to SpayPanama as an extremely worthy and effective organization that is and has been addressing pet over-population in Panama for 10 years.  Their success and effectiveness is outstanding!  Any way you can help their efforts benefits animals in so many ways.  And there is great benefit for the owners and caretakers as well as the communities in which their work is done.  
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	300479		/users/profile/391335	Writer	Volunteer	4	08/14/2016	I had an amazing experience with Spay Panama as a vet student. I did over 100 cat castrations and was also taught the quick spay method in cats. The experience has really increased my confidence in these surgical procedures. As well as improving my surgical skills, everyone at Spay was really lovely and took me and the other vet student with me on excursions all over Panama City. Thank you for the experience!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	300452		/users/profile/391304	Yuan H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/13/2016	I donate my professional services to Spay Panama.  I feel that I am making a contribution to help the less fortunate animals because I see results.

Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	300436		/users/profile/391287	Gloria38	Client Served	5	08/13/2016	I had the opportunity to observe and participate with the work done by spaypanama. This has helped tremendously to control the population for unwanted dogs and cats in the streets who suffer at times terrible cruelty. I've also adopted 4 cats from spaypanama, all spayed and neutered. Seeing them grow and play is an extremely gratifying feeling.  We help them and they give us joy. A big standing ovation to Spaypanama's work.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	299561		/users/profile/390479	kimh15	Client Served	5	08/07/2016	Its great to know there are people who care for animals.  For example in Panama, it was not until now that there is a noticeable percentage of people who are fond of cats so because of this many cats were victims of maltreatment.  Now there's some hope for our human-defenseless furry friends.  I personally had the pleasant experience of adopting my cat when he was only a kitten that had been rescued from the streets and was in a life-threatening physical state. The team was very helpful and cared for him until he was fully recovered.  And today we can look at him at home every day smiling and thinking how far he's come thanks to SpayPanama who saved his life.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	299230		/users/profile/390137	Chris230	Donor	5	08/04/2016	SpayPanamas work throughout the Republic of Panama is remarkable.  I am sincerely glad to collaborate as a donor with such a reputable organization.  One can sense that the team is genuinely committed to its mission and vision.  Most important, their operations are financially transparent and linked to a solid work plan which is monitored and evaluated constantly.   A truly exemplary nonprofit, that is making a great difference serving the community in this public health matter.  Hats off to their team of dedicated professionals and volunteers.  Keep up the great work!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	296322		/users/profile/387089	Writer	Client Served	5	07/14/2016	It broke my heart to see dogs run over on the side of the roads or dogs with no home starving. We adopted a three legged abused dog from Spay Panama. From the beginning, Penny has been a blessing. People say to us nonsense like, how wonderful it is that we took a three legged dog in. NO!! WE are the ones that are the grateful ones! Penny is wonder full in every way. Daily we watch her growing in confidence and although she has never known anything but brutality and cruelty from humans, she greets everyone with her tail wagging  waiting for a pet. The people in our building call her, "Love on Three Legs." Don't make the mistake of passing over the not so pretty or handicapped dogs, you will be rewarded with a loyal,loving and devoted family member.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	295804		/users/profile/386586	Sheila70	Volunteer	5	07/12/2016	Spay Panama is making a huge difference to lives and welfare of stray dogs and cats and those owned by low income families.  They offer very affordable,  they accept not just cash but also fruit and vegetables, for the sterilization.  As an expat living in Panama I was shocked and horrified by the number of dogs hit by cars at the side of the highway.  After 3 visits by Spay Panama to local community the number of street dogs was greatly reduced.  There were very few dead dogs.  As a local volunteer people would come up  to me to ask when is the next clinic.   They understood the benefits of sterilizing their pets.  At the clinics you could see the love they had for their pets and how happy they were knowing there would be no more babies.Spay  Panama is amazing and Panama is very lucky to have such a dedicated person at Pat Chang and her fabulous support staff.  I feel honoured to have been a volunteer with them.Sheila Scott
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	293918		/users/profile/384593	Megan119	Volunteer	5	06/26/2016	SpayPanama has been doing incredible, life-changing work throughout Panama for several years now. They have a dedicated team of veterinarians, volunteers, and staff that truly care about making a difference for animals in the country. I have been volunteering with SpayPanama for a few years, and am seeing a difference not only in the number of animals on the street, but in the mindset of people and how they treat animals. People are learning the importance of sterilizing their pets, which will ultimately make a difference in the long run. I would highly recommend working with SpayPanama for anyone who has a passion for cats and dogs and who wants to make a direct impact on improving animals' lives. 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	293905		/users/profile/384577	Tra S.	Donor	5	06/26/2016	Spay Panama is an excellent organization. They are a very professional and well organized group. The staff are very kind, caring and easy to work with. They offer an amazing service to low income people that could otherwise not afford this type of service.Their work helps to end the suffering of unwanted and homeless animals in our communities. These types of programs are great for the community and a great way to help our animal friends live longer, healthier lives. In my area alone Spay Panama has help over 400 animals live a better life. They have also educated the community on the importance of these types of programs and how to better care for your animals. Spay Panama is making a difference!!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	293900		/users/profile/384571	galibuber	Volunteer	5	06/26/2016	The organization is managed by wonderful people that are making a real change in the world.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	273763		/users/profile/363055	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/04/2015	I spent 2 weeks at Spay Panama, and took part in a mega spay event as a volunteer (4th year veterinary student at Nottingham Uni). I would definitely recommend Spay Panama to anyone is that is thinking of volunteering, it is very well organised and I learned a lot of new skills over my time there. In the future I hope to return to Spay Panama and volunteer again, as I found the experience to be so beneficial and positive. 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	253072		/users/profile/341222	Victoria55	Volunteer	5	08/16/2015	I am a final year veterinary student studying at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, and I volunteered at Spay Panama for 2 weeks duration. This was singly the most rewarding work experience I have ever done during my time at veterinary school. The reason for this was because it was incredibly positive and wholesome.  Although I spoke virtually no Spanish, I was made to feel included in all aspects of the clinic, and information/procedures were explained to me clearly. Everyone there was friendly, and the atmosphere was that of a large extended family working together as one efficient unit with the sole purpose of improving the welfare of these animals. Support, immediate assistance, and positive reinforcement was consistently available to me if I ever needed help when I was working. My main objective was to practice my surgical technique and spay/castrate as many cats and dogs as I could. That expectation was surpassed immensely as there were hundreds of animals that I had the opportunity to work with. As an added bonus, at the end of each work day local volunteers would take me out for dinner and tourist excursions  Thanks to Spay Panama, I now feel incredibly more confident as a soon to be veterinarian, and gratified that I helped so many cats and dogs. Once I graduate as a veterinarian I will one hundred percent be returning to volunteer again, and contribute towards Spay Panama's Mission Statement! 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	252698	1	/users/profile/340798	CLomas	Volunteer	5	08/12/2015	I am a Vet Student from Edinburgh University and I volunteered with Spay Panama for 2 weeks in July 2015.  I can honestly say that the team at Spay were the most hard working and dedicated people I have ever met.  During my stay I helped out on one of their Spay Drives and I could not believe the skill and effort that went in to that weekend - from the organisation to the volume of operations carried out by the vets and the assistance by all the volunteers.  Everything was so efficient and animals were moved from preparation to surgery to recovery seamlessly.  The vets carried out back to back operations in the heat for 9 hours each day - very impressive! I was very impressed with the quality of care provided to each animal, at Spay the animals really do come first.  Even though the aim of the organisation is to help control populations, every animal is treated with the utmost care. The highest priority is the well-being of each animal (Even getting their ears cleaned and vitamins at the end of the operation!). We helped out with the operations at the clinic in the mornings and then were taken out sightseeing in the afternoons.  We were taken all over the city and learnt all about the history of Panama City by visiting areas like Casco Viejo and the ruins of the original city. I wasn't expecting to see so much during my brief time there! I would like to finish my review by saying that everyone I met at Spay were so lovely and kind and I genuinely felt like part of a big family during my brief time there.  Even  though my Spanish is limited to a few badly pronounced words I felt honoured that people tried to speak English with me despite me not being able to speak Spanish! I want to thank everyone for making my time at Spay so special and I cannot wait to come back in the future if you'll have me!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	252686		/users/profile/340788	JKerr	Volunteer	5	08/12/2015	Spay Panama has been true to their position in helping communities all over Panama. Patricia Chan and her very dedicated team are the most awesome and caring people we in El Valle have had the opportunity to work with.  They are to me, the most heart felt community dog and cat caregivers on the planet.  I have viewed first hand the love and care Spay Panama brings to many communities within our country of Panama.  We applaud all of you.  You Rock!! Hugs Jacqueline Kerr
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	251553		/users/profile/339508	Julian J.	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	It is a pleasure to be part of this wonderful team. I have volunteered for almost three years. I feel the satisfaction of helping hundreds of animals with my two cents every weekend.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	250534		/users/profile/338393	Drjsgrimes	Client Served	5	07/29/2015	Spay Panama is always willing to help stray animals in any way necessary. On multiple occasions I have brought stray cats or dogs in need of care. They are spayed/ neutered then expertly cared for until their condition improves. Spay Panama tirelessly cares for any animal off the street as long as it is spayed or neutered before it leaves. Spay Panama also cares for abandoned kittens and cats until they can be adopted. They are an amazing group!!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	249542		/users/profile/337368	Jcv3	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	Spay is a great organization that promotes the true well being of the animals they care for. i enjoyed being able to help out in any way i could, whether it be cleaning cages or feeding the the multitude of cats and dogs.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	249537		/users/profile/337363	Catslol	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	i socialize with the kitty cats at Spay Panama. I care for them and play with them at every opportunity i have.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	249534		/users/profile/337360	Parkinson	Donor	5	07/23/2015	I have been a supporter of Spay Panamas for at least 10 years and have seen the fruits of their work.  I have also adopted three dogs that they have spayed/neutered and treated.  
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	249530		/users/profile/337356	Texas2	Donor	5	07/23/2015	Spay Panama is a well organized group of caring individuals in pro of the dogs and cats. I have been a witness since the start of the amazing work they accomplish in Panama.  They help and support other cities and towns within Panama where stray dogs and cats have become an issue.  I urge all organizations out there to support the work of Spay Panama.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	249529		/users/profile/337354	Surfergirl30	Donor	5	07/23/2015	I first became familiar with Spay Panama 10 years ago, we had found several cats were told to take them to there to get Spayed/Neuter. Since then, we have continually donated to the organization. This organization is amazing!! Their efforts are tireless and through the years we have seen a continual decline in homeless and stray animals on the streets of Panama. Spay Panama is 100% comitted to the animals working 24/7 to save lives via spay/neuter, medical treatment or even trapping / picking up.  100% of the donations go to the animals. Panam is blessed to have this group of people working in their country.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	247682		/users/profile/335275	CanadaVetstudent	Volunteer	5	07/07/2015	I am a fourth year vet student and I went volunteering 1 week with a friend in Spay Panama and I met the most amazing volunteer and vet team there. Everybody was so welcoming and very passionated about animal care and about helping the community. I really enjoyed my time there.  I did a lot of pre-op in the clinic: that involved the shaving, injections, scrubbing, emptying bladders. I had also the opportunity to do some surgeries, including approximately 15 male cats and 2 female cats. The vets are very patient and they supervise you if you need any help. I recommand to stay 2 weeks if you want to have time to do more surgeries. We also went on a blitz and we spayed and neutered 250 cats and dogs in a poor areas that day! It was really cool to see how these people care about their animals and want the best for them. 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	246456		/users/profile/333819	alli0856	Volunteer	4	06/26/2015	I am a 3rd year vet student from Canada and I traveled with three other classmates to volunteer for a week with Spay Panama. We had a great experience and were grateful for the generous hospitality and accommodation to ensure we learned veterinary skills as well as appreciation of Panamanian culture. The mentorship from other veterinarians was a highlight of the trip and we were excited to see how successful this well run and organized clinic was in Panama City and in surrounding communities. I would recommend volunteering with this organization for future veterinary students and new graduates as it is a supportive and enthusiastic environment to learn and develop confidence!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	246221	1	/users/profile/333493	GillJ2015	Volunteer	5	06/24/2015	I have been living in Panama on and off for the past 2 years. When I first arrived I knew I wanted to make good use of my time, so I researched some of the different animal organisations. Although I had no previous experience of working with animals I was welcomed into Spay Panama as a volunteer. I work primarily within the Pre-Op station, preparing the cats and dogs for surgery. This has given me the opportunity to perform tasks that were new to me and allowed me to have hands on experience with the animals. Spay Panama has a main clinic in the city centre, however, they reach out to communities by doing regular blitzes/street clinics and these blitzes are done with community involvement. The blitzes can involve intense, long hours in the sweltering heat but the feeling of elation (and exhaustion) at the end of the day is well worth it !! ( in one day that i was involved in, over 400 animals were spayed/neutered).The boundless ambition and fundamental values of Spay Panama culminate in the contribution of reducing the number of stray cats and dogs in Panama, as well as aiding those in less than fortunate conditions.I would highly recommend Spay Panama to anyone with  a love of animals looking to get involved in purposeful work as a volunteer.I have found the whole team of staff and volunteers organised, friendly and passionate and their team working skills are second to none.When I leave and return to Scotland for good, I will leave with many joyful memories of great experiences. Added to that, friendships made and knowledge gained that will remain with me throughout  my life. Volunteering has been a truly rewarding experience.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	246074		/users/profile/333306	Celineward14	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Spay Panama and the team in Panama City is incredible. We didn't know what to expect, but as soon as we arrived we were welcomed with open arms. The whole team showed nothing but patience and kindness towards the animals. As volunteers, the teaching we received was amazing. I would absolutely recommend Spay Panama to any future volunteers and donors as a place worthy of your help. It is an organization doing incredible things and I would love to continue work with Spay Panama again one day.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	214720		/users/profile/278013	drkatieholmes	Volunteer	5	09/11/2014	Spay Panama is a passionate team of staff and volunteers which is effectively reaching out to communities lacking access to veterinary care.  Their well-polished system is impressive, capable of operating on hundreds of animals in a single day.  They work in both their clinic for individuals who are nearby or are able to travel, and in off-site events whereby the team goes out to the communities requesting help.  It is truly a collaborative effort, and the community requesting veterinary care takes the forefront role in surgical site selection, advertisement and engagement of its members.  No pet is turned away for lack of money, but donations are requested, as the programs success is built upon sustainability brought through sharing both the costs and rewards of their service.  I am a veterinarian, and was sent to Spay Panama for two weeks by Humane Society International, not only for high volume spay/neuter training, but also to observe and emulate Spay Panamas program due to their success at community engagement.  This time was quite worthwhile. The veterinarians are excellent surgeons and good teachers.  The volunteers and staff are extremely dedicated with an uncommon zeal to their work.  While in Spay Panama, two large off-site community events were conducted whereby 321 pets were spayed/neutered one day and 458 were spayed/neutered another day.  Another off-site event involved a small portion of the team in which we trapped and spayed/neutered a feral cat colony.  I left Panama with not only stronger surgery skills, but also an ideal model for turning an individuals idea into work that becomes the communitys heart beat.  I highly recommend this organization to veterinarians, technicians, students, and anyone else who is looking for meaningful work
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	190384		/users/profile/248561	MatthewPochebit	Volunteer	5	12/11/2013	It has been almost two months since I was in Panama helping Spay Panama and it is still something I think about everyday. From the moment I landed in Panama I felt that my decision to volunteer with Spay Panama was the right one. Spay Panama far exceeded any prior expectations that I made before my arrival. Just at the beginning of my career as a student of Veterinary Medicine, I feel as if the knowledge that I have gained from my experience in Panama will help me become a more valuable Veterinarian. The most important thing that I took away from volunteering at Spay Panama is this...Although we are all unique and different in our own individual ways, there is a common bond and goal that we all strive to obtain. It is within this moment in time that I realized how similar that we all truly are. Thank you to the Spay Panama team for giving me the experience of a lifetime!! It is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life!!!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	164485		/users/profile/218610	Linda202	Volunteer	5	08/08/2013	I did not know what to expect from Spay Panama because the organization is relatively new and none of my colleagues have ever volunteered for Spay Panama before. However, it exceeded my expectations. The director of the program, the veterinarians, and other staff members are very kind and extremely accommodating. They make sure that you are well taken care of during your time of stay in Panama. Working in the clinic as well as the blitz can be physically exhausting, however, knowing that you have made a difference to decrease the animal population in low income areas is rewarding. The veterinarians make sure that you learn something, whether it be surgery, medicine, or client communication-related. After long days of hard work, the staff at Spay Panama make sure that you can explore the country and truly experience the wonderful culture.  
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	162586		/users/profile/215790	Erinc1	Volunteer	5	07/13/2013	I had a great volunteer experience at Spay Panama. I am a pre-vet student and was given an opportunity to perform tasks that I have never done before. I worked in both pre and post op giving injections, tattooing and clipping the animals ear, shaving and cleaning the incision area, and cleaning their ears. I was very impressed by how well organized everything was. Everyone was very welcoming and always there to help with any questions I had. It was an awesome experience to be able to help so many animals in need. I took pride in being able to give these animals treatments like dewormers, vitamins, ear cleanings, and flea spray that they may never be able to get again. I recommend this program to anyone who would like to gain more experience not just in the veterinary field but also a great cultural experience.  
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	161377		/users/profile/214033	Christine80	Volunteer	5	06/25/2013	I had been aware of Spay Panama for several years though a very good friend who is a Board member, but it was not until January 2013 that I really got involved after going to a spay blitz event out in Las Tablas and Tonosi. With that experience I had no doubts THIS was the organization I wanted to dedicate my time with.  You would have to know me better, but I am very critical of how mony is spent and how time is utilized - BOTh are such critical resources.  Spay Panama surpassed even my very TOUGH standards.  I can not imagine finding any organization that is more efficient in terms of time and money.  The bonus is the vets and volunteers are the best people you will find anywhere on Earth.  I have found my forever friends and family.  In 6 short months I have traveled the country doing blitzes, I now write their newsletter, am the new coordinator of special events and FUNdraising and am writting a children's book. about Spay Panama.  My past experience is with animal rescue groups in Ohio and Key West and I bring their fabulous ideas along with me!  Successful FUNdraising events take time and planning to get up in running.  Watch for our events in the future - THESE will be events EVERYone will want to be a part of!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	122094		/users/profile/166229	kate malter	Volunteer	5	09/09/2012	spay Panama is the only high volume high quality group in Panama. Once a month, spay panama has a blitz- they spay neuter at a location around panama. We had the opportunity to participate in one of these blitz. For 2 days, we went to San Manguelito where we sterilized 421 pets total. The organization, professionalism, and dedicate to their mission is remarkable and admirable. I left the blitz saying everyone worked so hard today, I hope I was able to help out in anyway possible.  This group is absolutely amazing!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	122092		/users/profile/166227	Stipe Vicente J.	Volunteer	5	09/09/2012	I acquired lots of valuable experience during my time at Spay Panama; such as vaccinating, tipping ears, etc, which will help me for my career. Spay Panama is  such an incredible organization that helps to neuter/spay dogs and cats from families with low resources. Everything is well organized and I was personally amazed at how quickly and smoothly everything goes. Also, all the people that volunteers is very charming and welcoming and made me feel like I was home. I really enjoyed my time in Panama and will definetely come back in the future to volunteer again. Well done!  
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	118460		/users/profile/161119	vets	Volunteer	4	07/15/2012	Spay Panama is a wonderful program. Not only did they work patiently and consistently with myself and the other volunteer from the USA, but they were always trying to show us new skills and better techniques. It is a good program with someone that has minimal experience with the veterinary field, because a lot of the work is pre op and post op. That being said, I got to observe several very interesting surgeries and a couple of necropsies. Overall a wonderful experience, that I would highly recommend for anyone interested in veterinary medicine. 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	117883		/users/profile/160310	CheeseAndRats	Volunteer	5	07/08/2012	I had an excellent experience volunteering! I was surprised at the number of spays/neuters done within the one week I volunteered there. The clinic worked quickly and efficiently. Another great thing was the amount of teamwork involved. The team accomplished so much is such short periods of time thanks to everyone's willingness to help each other, no matter what the task was. As a pre-veterinary student, I enjoyed being able to get so much hands-on experience especially in handling animals before and after surgeries (shaving, tattooing ears, giving injections, etc). It was also great watching many surgeries (not just spays and neuters). I was able to learn so much about veterinary medicine from the doctors and other veterinary students. Also, this was my first time traveling to Panama. I am so happy that I got to do some sightseeing while I volunteered! Great experience for future vets!
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	117780		/users/profile/160141	Piera LoMedico	Board Member	5	07/05/2012	Before I joined the board to SPAYes USA in 2008, I  was just an animal lover looking for help for the animals near my Grandmother's home in Santiago, Veraguas.  I researched non-profits, and discovered Spay Panama.  Pat, director of Spay Panama, responded to my email quickly, for plea to help the less fortunate animals.  I was invited to volunteer at a blitz, and witnessed first hand the wonderful work that Spay Panama is doing to change the lives of  MANY dogs and cats, and guardians.  The Spay Team is a fast, smooth, oiled machine, that does not miss a beat.  The organization is VERY organized, dedicated, and "The Best."  After I joined the board, I travel there through out the year from Georgia, USA, and am always excited for an off-site Blitz, and clinic volunteering.

The organization is one of the most efficient that I have ever had the pleasure to work with.  I will be returning to help again, hopefully before the end of this year.  I would ask everyone reading this to please donate to help this organization.  It is rare that an organization uses their money so wisely.  40,000+ sterilizations in 11 years is amazing.  I doubt that there are many other groups that could claim the same success rate, certainly not on the shoe string that this organization operates with.   They do good work, take very good care of the animals and the president of the organization is tireless in her efforts to bring about a better life for as many dogs and cats as she can.  Looking forward to seeing all of the wonderful people in Panama soon.

Volunteer	5	09/05/2011	This was my first time travelling to Panama as well as my first time witnessing such an overwhelming stray animal population! Spay/Panama is doing a wonderful job at not only directly targeting the overpopulation problem but also working within the community to raise awareness about the importance of getting owned animals spayed or neutered. It was really interesting to experience different aspects of veterinary medicine within the context of the Panamanian culture. I am extremely grateful to all the wonderful staff and volunteers - they were all incredibly welcoming and very helpful when I asked any questions. I feel like I've gotten much more than a simple volunteer experience because in addition to hands-on work with the animals, I've gained a real appreciation of the challenges faced by veterinarians and animal caregivers/owners/feeders on a day-to-day basis. I would definitely recommend this program to anyone looking for a positive volunteering experience that involves working with animals and/or that is simply wanting to donate some time to a fantastic cause.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	93805		/users/profile/108158	jej56	Volunteer	5	07/13/2011	I traveled to Panama last summer and enjoyed it so much that I went again this summer!  Not only did I get to travel to a different country and broaden my horizons, but I was able to help these animals that are overpopulated and often in unfortunate conditions.  Helping Spay Panama allows volunteers to see the direct effect of our efforts, by seeing the animals the have already been spayed or neutered by this organization on the streets.  I also gained experience observing many surgeries and hands-on experience giving injections and preparing animals for surgery, and attempting to communicate with locals in Spanish!  I definitely recommend this trip whether you aspire to become a veterinarian or simply want to help animals!

However, there was a lot of downtime that i feel could have been put to good use. overall, i would definitely recommend this trip to anyone who is interested in helping animals and volunteering.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	90845		/users/profile/103756	Jule S.	Volunteer	5	06/14/2011	I spent a week volunteering for SpayPanama in may. I had a great time, and it was a wonderful opportunity to experience a different country. Everyone there truly cares about the animals, and they receive great care. It was really different seeing so many homeless animals on the streets, so the work they do is very important to control the dog and cat populations. This is a great organization and I would recommend it to anyone.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	90715		/users/profile/103572	Lauren D.	Volunteer	4	06/14/2011	I had such a great experience as a volunteer here. It wasn't the easiest seeing the condition of some of the animals but what spay is doing is great. Despite the awful conditions these animals they are given a fighting chance. Not only are they given their basic need; like vitamins and vaccinations, but they are spayed or neutered to help improve the life of future generations of animals in this area. Not only are the animals well taken care of the other volunteers and vets are great to work with. They are all welcoming and helpful. I would recommend anyone to help out, visit, or come here. 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	67975		/users/profile/74285	andrea	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I got in touch with spay panama through the internet.  i can honestly say i was so shocked when i arrived and it was such a well run established organisation clean and with comfortable surroundings, it felt like i had joined one big family.   I learnt so much from working with them and they were very supportive of me.   they also went the extra mile and took me out and showed me around.   The organisation is run so well and the welfare of animals comes first.  what really interested me was the Blitz programmes that are set up and organised where out reach work is done in remoter places so they take the care to animals where they can, that is really impressive.   I was told always to treat an animal as if it was your own and this is a very good philosophy to hold on to.   All animals were given a chance and all people were given a chance to treat their animals.   A fantastic organisation to work for.   i will be back soon i hope.

Their facilities are nearly first-world standard, and the quality of low-cost surgery and care was better than expected. Help support this organization so that they may continue their important work in Central America. 
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	48197	1	/users/profile/49161	ecr9e	Volunteer	5	07/15/2010	I didn't exactly know what I had signed myself up for when I first arrived in Panama. But after spending a week traveling around Panama with the full-time volunteers, I cannot think of a more enjoyable way to spend my time. I wanted hands-on experience, and that is exactly what I got! There was not one moment spent without an animal by my side. Yet, one cannot compare Spay Panama to volunteer work in a typical, domestic practice. Spay Panama offers a look into a completely different side of Veterinary Medicine. Every single task must be completely quickly, efficiently, and above all, for the welfare of the animals. I now believe that one doesn't fully understand Veterinary Medicine before they spend twelve straight hours on their feet in 100 degree heat surrounded by defecating and vomiting animals whose lives you are trying to improve through spaying/neutering them. Spay Panama is comprised of the most compassionate, intelligent people I have ever met. I can only hope to see them again soon.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	47878	3	/users/profile/48695	kelsie-diehl	Volunteer	5	07/08/2010	SpayPanama was by far one of the greatest experiences of my life.  I learned so much about working with small animals and experienced so many different things, I would never have gotten to experience otherwise.  One of my favorite parts of the trip was the spay blitz over the weekend and getting to meet the people living in Cerro Azul.  I was completely exhausted, but so happy I was there and helping out; I felt so accomplished because I worked so hard for such a good cause with so many amazing people.  I've already started saving money for a trip back to SpayPanama.
Spay Panamas Animals Yes USA	36708	4	/users/profile/37500	sylvie1	Volunteer	5	04/23/2010	Spay Panama provides sterilization in order to stop the misery of cats and dogs caused by overpopulation. The wonderful team of volunteers takes care of registration, preparation of the animal and post operative care. The veteranarians use the quick spay method. As part of the team, I do post-op: inject vitamins, clean ears, deworm, use anti-flea spray. The dogs get a rabbies vaccination.It is a great team, doing great work, and we can always use some extra help: www.spaypanama.org

We are very fortunate to have them in the state of Mississippi helping children and adults with diabetes. At the age of 37, I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. My husband and I had no idea about diabetes and how this was going to change our lives.  I got involved with the MS Walk for Diabetes for the Gulf Coast and met their wonderful staff.  I am amazed daily at what amazing things the staff of the Diabetes Foundation of MS provides for people.  Whether it is having Camp Kandu or mailing out a care kit to those recently diagnosed. They are always helping.  The staff is very knowledgeable about diabetes, medicine, equipment, insulin and more. I have been recently having challenges with my medicine and insurance only wanting to cover a certain amount. The staff was able to provide me extra insulin until I was able to get my perscription filled. I could not have gone with out having my insulin. It was  huge blessing and life saving to be able get additional insulin. I am committed to continuing to support, volunteer and help in anyway that I can to repay the assistance and support they have given me. Thank you Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi.

It was awesome, and my son had the best time going through everything.  It even had information on diabetes camp, fund raising marathons and different insulin pumps.

When your a parent and your child is diagnosed it can be scarier bringing them home from the hospital than it was when they were infants. The wonderful people at this organization reach out in so many ways with information, check in calls, introducing you to other families and making sure you have every tool they can help you with to survive and thrive after your diagnosis. Simply put they are amazing.

My precious little miracle has many diagnosis including type 1 diabetes mellitus. At the time of diagnosis, the DFM reached out to us and offered their support and lifelong friendship. They spoke with me and sent my baby girl a backpack full of educational tools to help us understand and manage her diabetes which also included an amazing teddy bear that not only gives comfort but is also designed to teach the kids how to give insulin and finger pokes. The support is amazing. If I have a question or a need, all I have to do is call or message. It's such a comfort. The greatest blessing to me is that we are struggling with issues with our supply company. My baby did not receive her supplies for almost 2 months. The test strips are costly. I was so worried about what I was going to do. I had only 7 strips left. We test 5-8 times a day. I called DFM and told them what was going on. They purchased strips for my baby and overnighted them to me. I cannot put into words how much of a blessing this was! Took such an extreme burden off me! The DFM is more than an organization. They are loving, caring people who go the extra mile to support and help families. I thank God for them!

I was shown such compassion and interest in how my daughter was doing.  I was invited and encouraged to attend  Camp Kandu, the diabetes camp they sponsor.  The camp was a perfect place to meet other parents of children with diabetes.  It was also a great opportunity to get more education on diabetes management from the top medical professionals in the field.   The Diabetes Foundation has been a godsend to me for support and continued education on the latest advances in diabetes management.  Every dollar that is raised in Mississippi stays in Mississippi to help those affected by this disease.

Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Inc.	251879	4	/users/profile/339876	SageAdviceMS	Volunteer	5	08/06/2015	I have been a board member of the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi for 20+ years.  I have worked with the staff and other volunteers closely on various projects through those years. This organization does amazing work for many Mississippians with somewhat limited resources.  It is able to accomplish this primarily through the dedication and hard work of its staff and volunteers and a supportive board of directors. You can see a list of the DFM's accomplishments in the other comments on this site or on the DFM website.  What is not readily apparent is the work in the trenches, so to speak, for individuals on a daily basis, those people who need help and really haven't been able to get it anywhere else.   Then, there is a constant sense of advocacy from the staff for diabetic community in general, manifested in many ways.  In my lobbying work, we have been able to affect some changes that positively affect in a permanent way the lives of those with diabetes.  These include diabetic 504 plan guidelines, a sales tax exemption for DFM, meaning more money for services, and insuring Medicaid coverage for continuous glucose monitors. In a nutshell, this organization is all about serving Mississippians with diabetes.

Never have I seen such dedication to the goals if an organization.  In addition, administrative cost is kept extremely low to ensure that funds raised are available to help diabetic citizens.

Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Inc.	249957	6	/users/profile/337808	Shanikat	Volunteer	5	07/25/2015	I have learned from volunteering at the DFM that if each of us were to do SOMETHING, we could make a monumental difference, one by one, step by step, heart by heart. My work as a volunteer at the Diabetes Foundation has been encouraging, to say the least. There is great satisfaction being a part of something larger than myself, knowing that in some small way I have contributed to helping to educate and provide resources to those that are struggling to live with diabetes successfully.  Access to and distribution of printed materials has allowed me to share encouragement with others who are facing such a difficult, life altering diagnosis. When I started volunteering my thought was simply to go and help out with some "office work".   Never could I have imagined that I would personally gain so much!  From day one I was meeting people whom I knew were expressing a genuine interest and concern with others well-being.  Both physically and emotionally.  I know what that feeling is all about!   A good friend, who works for the organization, suggested that I consider doing some volunteer work that would use the abilities I already had and at that time they were incredibly short handed. The seed she planted gave me the desire to reach out and discover there was something I could do that might make a difference somehow... and in a very enjoyable work environment!  The new personal relationships with employees and other volunteer workers has been an unexpected blessing! It has allowed me to also use my abilities to educate and aid folks in the diabetic community, whether they be caregivers or patients. I was born with Juvenile Diabetes (type I), as well as, a heart condition and had recently found myself somewhat mobility challenged due to the long term effects of the diseases.  I couldn't drive or work a regular 9 to 5 and was feeling confined and depressed.  By teaching me to reach out effectively to others they have helped me to enrich and better my own life! The staff at DFM are some of the most caring and generous people that I have ever met!  I hope to continue to volunteer with the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi as long as I am able... and encourage others to volunteer with this most worthy organization!

Not only were they there for us right after my son's diagnosis, but they continued to be a wonderful support system over the years.  I always felt that I could pick with the phone and call them with any questions.  Even after we moved out of state, we stayed in touch, as I felt like they had become part of the family.  Every single person in the office is knowledgeable, kind and helpful.  I just wish they would relocate to Virginia!

Its' team of highly skilled professionals goes above and beyond to help people and their families with diabetes.    Their compassion, understanding and passion for service is extraordinary.   The programs and services offered are tailor made for the various needs throughout the different parts of the state. Highly networked within the medical community, they have a referral network that is unsurpassed.  Mississippi is lucky to have such a unique organization to serve its' citizens.
Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Inc.	214577	6	/users/profile/277852	aks318	Client Served	5	09/10/2014	Hi, my name is Kaitlan Sudduth. I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at age 9 and will turn 21 this month. Dealing with this disease in general is tough enough, but having a support system and people who actually know what it means to have Type 1 makes the journey a little more bearable. The Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi has given me both and continues to be a special part of my life. One of the best things about this organization is that the staff genuinely cares about the people it helps. DFM is special in that it also cares about people being educated about diabetes, and much of the Foundation's efforts goes toward this. This emphasis on education is important because it is what helps those with diabetes and their families to know how to battle this disease in daily life. Another thing DFM gives is the opportunity to make connections with others who have diabetes, and this is especially helpful to the newly diagnosed. A certain peace of mind comes about when one can relate to another about something as physically and emotionally trying as diabetes. Although I could never fully express my thankfulness to the Diabetes Foundation of MS, I do extend my thanks. Thank you for giving me and so many others hope in knowing no one is alone in this journey.

The diagnosis was initially so overwhelming, I could barely breathe.  I was fortunate to be referred to the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi.  They provided education, support and a shoulder to cry on.  In addition, I was given info on the camp they do, Camp Kandu.  The camp was incredible.  My son felt "normal" there for the first time since diagnosis. The Camp includes activities and education for the entire family.  I cannot say enough about what a great job this group does.

When my daughter was diagnosed 13 months ago, they immediately stepped in to help us and have been like family ever since. They truly care about everyone and there is nothing they will not do to help out. My daughters school had never had a diabetic child until her and the DFM came out and trained them on how to care for her. Twice a year they have Camp Kandu which is a phenomenal event that we look forward to each year! I have worked with many organizations, but none top the work and care that Mary and Irena do with the DFM and we are forever grateful for them!

They have helped us train day care staff with their Sweet Subjects Program, provided us with the information we needed to care for my DD through the Diabetes Super Conference and Camp Kandu, they helped make sure we had test strips while fighting with insurance for coverage, and have given my DD a chance meet other kids and watch them live life to the fullest. I cannot imagine having to go through this journey without them! 
Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Inc.	137159	6	/users/profile/183116	Kristen17	Client Served	5	11/11/2012	We were overwhelmed when our then four year-old daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes several years ago, but the Diabetes Foundation of MS came to our rescue.  They helped provide test strips when we had to pay out of pocket while we got insurance to approve additional strips and have trained multiple day cares and summer programs so that they could properly care for our daughter. In addition, we love Camp Kandu and the Diabetes Super Conference which gives my daughter a chance to meet other kids like her and us a chance to benefit from the experience of other parents and other experts.  I am not sure I would have the confidence I have in dealing with my daughter's condition if it wasn't for the programs and help provided by the DFM.

It was a tumultuous time for our family, to say the least.  I was put in touch with the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, & almost from the moment we brought Reagan home from the hospital they have been an invaluable resource.  The DFM mailed Reagan a backpack full of diabetic supplies, information for parents, & a neat cookbook that's come in handy.  When we were ready to switch from daily injections to an insulin pump, the DFM mailed me information on various pump options, & they opened their facilities to us when we met with the pump trainer.  The past eight months have been an incredible period of adjustment for our family, & the support we've received from the DFM has been amazing.  Anna Zeigler   
Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Inc.	139786	7	/users/profile/185919	Dr. Steve	Advisor	5	11/15/2012	Mississippi is inundated with diabetes. The Mississippi Diabetes Foundation is a locally run, locally funded non-profit organization which aims to improve the lives of all Mississippians struggling with diabetes of any type. All monies raised are spent within the state and not siphoned off to a national office. This group is a model for how other states and communities should organize themselves to combat chronic diseases in the 21st century. I have been involved with the group for over 4 years and could not recommend them more highly.

The lives they touch daily are blessed by their caring spirit.  To know that the funds raised by their tireless efforts stay in MS is truly what sets them apart from others.
Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Inc.	133371	6	/users/profile/178893	Frank C.	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	I've been a volunteer with DFM for several years.  Diagnosed with Type I in 1960, I've witnessed many benefits provided by DFM to individuals with diabetes and their families also.  DFM provides educational information to families after being diagnosed, many times while still in hospital.  Each year DFM provides a camp for children with diabetes which is staffed by drs and nurses so the parents know their child is being cared for.  Annually, DFM hosts a "Super Conference" with experts from all over the USA making presentations to everyone interested in learning how to improve diabetes management.  Vendors are on hand to show new items and answer questions.  Also, annually they provide one or more continuing education programs for diabetes health care professionals.  Throughout the year, diabetes educations programs are conducted to schools, colleges, fire departments, law enforcement and civic groups.  DFM assists the needy in securing insulin and testing supplies and has recently added the allert dogs to this list.  DFM is made up primarly of volunteers which enables about 90% of funds raised to go directly toward benefiting people with diabetes in Mississippi.  Thank you for allowing me to provide a review.

Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi, Inc.	131288	8	/users/profile/176845	Dr. Jones	Board Member	5	10/30/2012	I am from a family where diabetes and cardiovascular disease runs rampant. I moved to Mississippi 11 years ago and saw the tremendous burden of Diabetes in communities across the state. Both adults and children were affected.  I later went on to lead the Medicaid Program for the State of Mississippi as Executive Director. When I needed additional resources for my beneficiaries, the ONLY entity in the state that I could consistently count on was the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi.  After leaving the Medicaid Program, I joined the Board of Directors of the Foundation.  I returned to the University of Mississippi Medical Center and founded an Institute focused on eliminating Health Disparities across the state. Through the Institute, we have funded many successful projects with the Diabetes Foundation. The most significant project is the Annual Superconference which brings together hundreds of lay people from across the state to find out what is new on learning to prevent and live with if necessary Diabetes.  In addtiona, I've found that the Diabetes Foundation of Mississippi is the ONLY organization addressing Diabetes in which 100% of funds remain in the state to help the people of Mississippi.  As a funder, I've found that critically important. Finally, the fiscal prudence of the Diabetes Foundaton's staff is beyond reproach!  I will continue to support their tremendous efforts in any way I can.

As a sponsor of orphans and widows, I feel so connected with their positive and relevant programs. My favorite pictures are of the volunteers loving on the kids. The most special moment was seeing a young girl with the sewing machine my daughter donated as a part of her Christmas present. Imagine American teens asking for things like that for someone else instead of the latest in electronics for themselves?!?

Show Mercy offered a safe and loving place to stay while in Uganda. The trip was well organized and offered a variety of outreaches including hospital visits, village outreaches, teaching English to local children, etc.  The outreaches challenged me to get out of my comfort zone and my faith grew tremendously because of it. I'd highly recommend Show Mercy to anyone looking for short  or long term missionary opportunities!

They were helpful in answering my questions and easing my fears of going overseas. I trust Show Mercy and appreciate how they value the people of Uganda as well as those who are stateside supporting them. SMI operates with integrity and is a trusted nonprofit.

Words really cannot express what an experience it was. I was blown away by show mercy's vision for both Ugandans and all those who partner with them. I saw tangible change in the lives of hundreds of Ugandans while working alongside show mercy. Not only did they invest in the Ugandans but during my internship they invested in me. I came away from my summer internship with a greater belief in who God created me to be & a desire to take advantage of every moment, living life on purpose.

I am still blown away at how Mike and Lori, along with their team both in Uganda and in the states, dare to dream of the impossible and believe in it and nourish those dreams till their flourish. While working alongside, I learned what it looks like to live my life on purpose, the way the creator intended for us to. I cannot begin to brag enough about this amazing and unique organization. I have seen it change lives, my own included.

They loved on us as if we were family members. They took time out of our their day to even minister to us, when they saw the Lord moving on our hearts.  SMI is an incredible place. So structured, yet so spirit led. Never once felt unsafe. And God used Show Mercy and their staff to show me a different side of God that I had never understood fully. And that was, that Love, literally transcends language.  Love is a language breathed by God Himself.  The people of Uganda are incredible. They moved my heart in more ways than they can even believe. I'm so honored that they allowed me to even minister to them, that they allowed me into their homes, that they allowed me into their hearts. Seriously. It was amazing.  I cannot wait to go back.  Thank you Show Mercy team!

What was once a beautiful outreach to orphans has become a community with a medical clinic and well water for the surrounding population and the promise of a school being birthed. The land boasts a farm, animals and an incredible staff made up of locals. They reach out to villages around them taking care of senior citizens and children alike.  My husband and I have been partners in ministry with SMI since 2008 and have been to Uganda and Field of Dreams to work side by side with Mike and Lori.

What they do is utterly amazing and beautiful. I went on a trip with Show Mercy in the summer of 2015 which happened to be the summer after I graduated high school. As many people know, graduation is fun and exciting but leads to many questions about yourself and your future. My trip to Uganda with SMI helped me form plans for my future and really made me question what God's purpose was for me. I will always be grateful to them for that. My trip was amazing and filled with so many blessings. The staff are the most kind and loving people I have ever met. I would recommend a trip with Show Mercy and even more highly recommend sponsoring a child in their program.

Show Mercy International	232536	1	/users/profile/296075	kaceparks	Donor	5	11/01/2014	I have had the privilege and honor of being able to help support Show Mercy since 2009, and was able to take a trip with them to their The Field of Dreams in Uganda in 2012. The trip was life changing! Show Mercy focuses on creating spreading the Love of Christ to all people, and helping instill in others the plan that God has for their lives.  On my trip I was able to partake in many of their programs such as the "Say No to Hunger" program, which provides a nutritious meal to children once a week in the the surrounding villages, many who are malnourished, the HERO program, which supports many of the elderly in the village along with school and orphan outreaches. This is very touching to be able to interact with so many people who literally have nothing, and be able to see the joy and life they have. Not only are we able to help them, but they are also teaching us what it means to be thankful and full of life, trusting and relying on God. Mike and Lori Salley, the founders of Show Mercy have a heart for the people of the Uganda, and in the past several years they have seen many dreams come to pass. One such dream was building a Medical Clinic that is in the heart of a village, open to Ugandan's in the surrounding villages, providing much needed medical care, along with teaching others how to properly take care of themselves. I could go on and on about the wonderful opportunities and dreams that Show Mercy has pursued and is planning. However, what I would most like to emphasize is the belief that many people can partake in this organization, whether by prayer, finances or volunteering, but most importantly it is not just the people of Uganda that benefit from the services, but anyone who is involved. We are encouraged to pursue the dreams that God has given us (whether he has given us a heart for the people of Uganda or elsewhere) and to become stewards of the talents, gifts, and finances that God has blessed us with. There are so many ways to become involved I personally sponsor a child who is now able to go to school and receive nutritious meals, this has been amazing because it is so worthwhile knowing that the support given is giving a child an opportunity for health and a better future. Anything given to Show Mercy, whether it is time, prayers, or financial support will go to a good cause. I would strongly recommend going on an "Awaken to Love" trip which gives you the opportunity to see firsthand the heart of Show Mercy and the resources and services they provide. I have not come across a better organization! I am excited to see what the coming years hold and see how God continues to move and shape several thousand people as he is stirring up the passion and love for Chris, both in the people of Uganda and worldwide.  
Show Mercy International	229245	1	/users/profile/292894	richardsong	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I've had the privilege and honor to go to Uganda with SMI 4 times the past couple of years. It is amazing to see what God is doing through Mike and Lori. Everything they do is with love, excellence, and wisdom. Mike and Lori have an incredible ability to immediately put legs to a vision. I've witnessed so much growth and impact in just a short while. As part of leading teams to SMI, I've seen many people encounter God.  Whether local Ugandans or team members, people have seen God move powerfully in them and through them.  SMI fosters an environment that allows Holy Spirit to move and encounter individuals during their stay at Field of Dreams.  The field of dreams is designed to allow visitors to have a nice place to rest, spend time with God, dream, and fill up and then go out to the village and pour out.  SMI empowers people to live life with purpose and gives people the tools to bring change in their own lives. We have also led 2 crusades in the nearby villages in Uganda with SMI and have seen so much fruit with the local pastors and local Ugandans.   I have had many personal life-changing moments with SMI and would highly recommend for anyone, wherever they are at in their relationship with God, to go on a missions trip with SMI.  God will meet you there, and you will be His hands and feet to change peoples' lives. Also, the SMI staff are incredible, world-class leaders.  I'm very proud to know them.
Show Mercy International	229114		/users/profile/292777	jessielipp	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I was blessed with the opportunity to serve as a Show Mercy Intern in 2012. I am not exaggerating when I say this experienced changed my life. My perspective was changed, the way I look at others, the way I interact, how I show and receive love, the way I pray.  After a short three months in Uganda, I was so moved, I knew my life would never be the same again. By partnering with Show mercy I was able to reach out to the forgotten, and find joy where I least expected it. The founders, Mike and Lori Salley, are remarkable. Their passion and vision for helping others is contagious. They are supportive, kind, generous, and have a strong desire to see others walk into their destiny.  I was given so many opportunities to try new things. I helped in schools, I developed programs, I offered hope and joy to the sick, delivered necessities to those less fortunate, I witness the sick being healed, I went on crazy motor bike rides, saw a beautiful country, and loved like I never had before. If you make the decision to partner with Show Mercy, you will be changed, you will help others, and become part of a family that serves together.

I love Show Mercy and I am thankful that I get to play a part in the great things they are doing!
Show Mercy International	227663	1	/users/profile/291393	Lina4	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I met the founders of SMI through a mutual friend and I was so impacted by their passion and vision that I decided to ask to have a coffee with them the next day. That conversation resulted in me packing my bags a few months later to come to Uganda for 3 months to see more of what this life they are building looks like. It has by far exceeded my ideas about change of worldview.. Knowing the story behind it, where and how it started, and seeing what things are evolving into is mind- blowing .. If you just hear about bad reports from all around, go here and get the antidote for that. Not joking! See what dreams, faith, passion, diligence, great vision, money and laughter can do ... It changes the world all around it and and crashes hopelessness for good. This place will get your heart, hope and  priorities in the right place for sure :)

Show Mercy has inspired me to live on purpose everyday.  They are very trustworthy and respectful of their donors! What they are doing in Uganda is amazing and I plan on supporting them for years to come.
Show Mercy International	227429	2	/users/profile/291159	Mike1968	Donor	5	10/27/2014	I have been working with Show Mercy for many years. They really care about both the people in Uganda and those that travel with them from the west. This is a great organization that does a lot of great things in Uganda including working with orphans, widows and mission team members. Go with them on a trip. You will love it!
Show Mercy International	226606	2	/users/profile/290337	Laura224	Volunteer	5	10/25/2014	I had the opportunity to spend this past summer at the Show Mercy base in Uganda.  I can tell you that from the Show Mercy base, Show Mercy Clinic, staff, to the outreach in the community, all were amazing! And With the added benefit of being located in the "pearl of Africa," you will get to see some of the most beautiful foliage, sunsets, and people, on the continent. I have also had the opportunity to work with Show Mercy staff stateside as well, and I can tell you that this is not just something they do to pass time, but it is their heart to truly Mobilize, Inspire, and Empower people to live on purpose, while reaching out in LOVE. It has truly been  a life-changing experience! I am thankful, grateful and blessed for knowing Show Mercy! 
Show Mercy International	225963	2	/users/profile/289713	Laura222	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I visited Show Mercy Field of Dreams for 3 weeks on the Awaken To Love trip in 2012 and have longed to be back there ever since. Mike and Lori make every single individual feel like a family member. They respect, train, and challenge their volunteers/missionaries so well- I felt more encouraged to try things I've never tried before and to reach out in compassion in a new and deeper way. I can not wait to return to the second home I found in Uganda.

The mission of SMI to love, mobilize, and inspire exemplifies perfectly what this organization is about. All in all it was about Jesus. Life changing experience no doubt. 
Wingard Home Ministry	98570	7	/users/profile/117096	Linda King,	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2011	I want to say thank you to the ministry known as The Wingard Home.  Four weeks ago, my daughter and I came upon a young mother and her two baby girls, who were in a desperate situation. They were homeless, hungry and tired.  All they had were the clothes they were wearing and an empty diaper bag.  Their needs were met that night and 2 days later my daughter was told about the Wingard Home and took the young family to talk with Mrs. Wingard.  Mrs. Wingard immediately accepted the family and gave them a  home.  I visited the home later that week and saw smiles on the babies faces and hope in Kayla's eyes.  What a ministry this family has! God is using them to provide for His children in need.  I must also say thank you to the MISS 103 radio listeners who responded in such a heartwarming way.  GOD'S HANDS WERE ALL OVER THIS SITUATION.  Thank you, Lord, for your blessings on me......."For I was hungry, and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in, I was naked and you clothed me........when you've done it to the least of my children, you have done it for Me".  Matthew 25:35-40
Wingard Home Ministry	306037	1	/users/profile/397302	Avery4	Donor	5	09/22/2016	The Wingard Home in Jackson MS is a great opportunity for the homeless and those who have hit rock bottom. They are loved emotionally and physically feed spiritually and physically and are taken in as family to help with kids clothing needs medical needs and most importantly start over or rebuild. I proudly support the Wingard Home due to the fact they receive no assistance as a ministry from the state or goverment!!! Charolotte and Roy want to make sure that those that are working get what assistance or any they can!!!
Wingard Home Ministry	305737	2	/users/profile/397013	abbiekoonce	General Member of the Public	5	09/20/2016	I just recently discovered their Facebook page and have communicated with Ms. Wingard about donating some furniture and miscellaneous items they need. Their organization is exactly what Jackson needs-- they serve one of the, if not the, most vulnerable groups-- the homeless. I was so touched by them recently taking in a precious teenage mother who was expecting her second child. They truly seem to invest in "their people" and set them up for future success. We all obviously can't house the homeless but we all can certainly do our part to support ministries like this one that not only share the gospel but also meet people exactly where they are.
Wingard Home Ministry	304974	2	/users/profile/64646	Beverly	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2016	Living at Wingard Home changed my life. I learned to be responsible and accountable. It was there that I was able to rebuild my life and began to seek God's will for my life. I can't say enough good about this wonderful ministry. I'll always be grateful for Charlotte and Roy Wingard and their family. 
Wingard Home Ministry	59700	5	/users/profile/64646	Beverly	Client Served	5	01/09/2011	I have lived at Wingard Home for 8 months and this has been the most rewarding and wonderful experience of my life.  I was helpless, hopeless and homeless and the Wingard family invited me to live in their home and become part of their family.  I had no hope and I did not know where to turn.  I have learned how to be responsible and trustworthy.  I have a wonderful relationship with Jesus and I am not the person who arrived here last year.  I have a fantastic job and I have been so blessed.  There are rules and they are not difficult to follow.  It is all about trusting God and learning to seek His will for our lives.  It is beyond me how anyone could say anything negative about this Ministry or the Wingard Family.  Anyone who comes here is treated with respect and kindness.  They provide spiritual guidance, a warm, clean, comfortable place to live, excellent food.  Many people are so abundantly blessed by coming here.  The ones that I have seen be ask to leave are people who are not willing to follow a few simple rules.  If you are serious about getting on your feet this is an awesome opportunity.  Anyone who gives a negative review for the Wingard Home needs to search their hearts and be honest with themselves and try to change the negative and lazy habits that prevent them from following rules and better themselves.  I thank God daily for Wingard Home.  My family is grateful for the change in me and my life.  God has restored broken relationships in my life since I have been here.  Charlotte has always been open and honest with me and has always encouraged me to reach for goals that I felt were not obtainable for me.  I have a deep personal relationship with Jesus and I have a purpose and hope.  I know that God loves me and is working in me and my life.  I am a completely different person today....Praise God!!  Thank you Charlotte, Roy and the entire Wingard family.  You all do an awesome work for God and your love shows in all that you do.  You all have taught me so much and I appreciate being given a new life throught Jesus Christ.

Wingard Home Ministry	304647	3	/users/profile/395827	Pamruffin	Client Served	5	09/14/2016	I came to the Wingard Home last January, straight from the hospital. I was welcomed with open arms and provided with everything I needed and then some!! Charlotte Wingard literally changed the way I looked at life, as I knew it. She spent a great deal of time answering questions I had about God and spirituality itself. I know God put me in that HOLY place at the precise time He wanted me there. Little did I know that not only would my relationship with the Lord become stronger than it has ever been, but I was also blessed to meet the man I'm spending the rest of my life with...a Godly man, who's continued to teach me the Bible and to love me unconditionally. Mrs Charlotte Wingard is a special kind of Godly warrior and I'm so grateful and thankful for her and her family. Today, I'm a hard working and proud Christian, productive member of society. Adam and I have been in our own place for over a year now!! All GLORY goes to God first!! However, without the help of the Wingard Home, I'd probably still be homeless and searching for someone to believe in!! God bless this sweet family today and always...Pamela M. Ruffin

Wingard Home Ministry	238918	4	/users/profile/324429	Trish16	Volunteer	5	03/06/2015	I have known Roy and Charlotte Wingard for almost 10 years now. I have watched as they have mentored and loved everyone that has walked through their doors. I have the honor of calling them friends. At different times throughout the years my husband and I have had the opportunity to visit and work side by side with them. (usually for only a couple of weeks) and with each visit we did not want to leave.  It is amazing what you will see if you simply sit back and watch. Roy and Charlotte are two of the most steadfast faithful people I have ever met. January 23, 2014 marked a life changing terrible event. My 23 year old daughter passed away. Charlotte was a haven in the storm for me. Though she was not able to hug me physically, each time we spoke on the phone her words of encouragement and love were like a warm blanket. She will scoff when she reads this, but Charlotte Wingard is one of my hero's of faith. When I talk with her, watch her work with guests at Wingard Home, and hear her pray for the lost, she is a pillar of strength, a true example of what a Christian should be. Thank you Charlotte. You encourage me, challenge me, and without even realizing it demand the best out of me. You are a leader. A woman of integrity, a light in an ever darkening world.  I desire to live my life as fully dedicated and Christ-minded as you. My husband and I are planning our next visit to Wingard home. We cannot wait to wade in hip deep and apply some good old fashioned elbow grease :) We love you Roy and Charlotte. Thank you for all that you do for Jackson's forgotten and down-trodden.

Wingard Home Ministry	184575	4	/users/profile/241514	rwood0917	Donor	5	10/29/2013	This ministry has been around for a long time in the Jackson area.  I donated a couch to them years ago and helped give a baby shower when a woman they were helping was pregnant and had nothing.  They believe in a hand up, not a hand out.  They believe in hard work, schedules, and being accountable.  They take people in when no one else will.  They teach people how to save their money when they get a job and how to manage money.  They teach and preach love and forgiveness but also they are firm in what a person needs to do to stay there.

Wingard Home Ministry	184465	3	/users/profile/241403	JasonHorne	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	There are not many preachers who are willing to welcome their flock into their home.  These two bring families and individuals in to love and care for them while they try to get back on their feet.  I am blessed to know Roy and Charlotte Wingard and participate with them.   One of my favorite things about this ministry is that it can be hard to tell who is ministering and who is being ministered to.  Many of the people being served become servants themselves.  Awesome!
Wingard Home Ministry	184266	3	/users/profile/241203	Mary228	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I met Charlotte and Roy Wingard at Wingard Home through our Sunday School class about 20 years ago. We volunteered for years to supply the laundry detergent for the home, which I delivered to them monthly (5 five-gallon buckets of powder from Sam's). Over the years, they have been just as steadfast helping those in need as they are today. They house children that have been removed from their home, they house families and single adults who have become homeless for one reason or another - helping find them training, jobs, and helping them get what they need to get back on their feet. They also have a huge Christmas Festival for over 200 needy children (I have helped as a volunteer in the past and it was a life-changing experience) - each child is given Christmas presents from a list of the child's wants, and the family is ministered to in every way from spiritual to physical needs. The hands reaching out from The Wingard Home go far and beyond many I've been in contact with and with far less help than most (they do have many that help, though).  Years ago, my Sunday school class would visit and attend chapel service occasionally on the propery and meet their residents.  That was always a tremendous blessing. But they have continually shown a stand firm faith and God has honored that by providing over the years in miraculous ways. I deeply hope they are recognized.  I live out of town now, but I still keep in touch.

Everytime I drop-off the children's clothes and toys, I am impressed at the simplicity of the operation, the basic space used for living, learning and worship. This is a grassroots organization that is in touch with the people they serve. The Windard family takes "the Great Commission" to heart and have made it their life's work. If you want your giving to touch the most lives with the least overhead, this organization is for you!  
Wingard Home Ministry	102196		/users/profile/132506	speakthetruth	Client Served	2	12/11/2011	My family and I went to the Wingard home after we had no place else to go. We were grateful that we had a place to go,but after seeing the way things were run and the attitudes that we were presented with, I was very happy to leave. Mr. Roy has a very bad and judgmental attitude and Mrs. Charlotte is no better. We were told to leave on a rainy night,when my father defended us (my brother and I ) to Mr. Roy because he was accusing us of making a mess, that his own children made. The mess was made in the "common room", where my brother and I had not even been except earlier that day. So, we were told to get our stuff and get out, that was a horrible thing for them to do,but I was happy. Also, years later Mr. Roy came into a place my mother was working and as he walked out the door he called a  "heathen". That was not very Christian like. The bible says:  Judge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven; Luke 6:37 So, I have since forgiven you, Mr. Roy, for casting such judgement on her for no reason. I hope and pray for your family and ministry.

When someone stays here there eyes are open and their minds are the feild is to plant the seed ( The  Word of God) which  can be a life changing event. It did for me as to when I cam to no the ministry back in 1988 which went bby a diferent name but the same ministry. It showed me that God was able to deliver me from a life of alcohol  and drugs as God changed the way I look at life. The people are taught a different life style than what they are living. It takes hard work and dedication. But all thinghs are possible with God.

I have been blessed in so many ways its amazing. This is an awesome place to  help you get on your feet and also to develop my own personal relationship with God. We dont have to pay for utility bills, food,clothing ect. ect . The only thing we need to do is to try! Follow a few simple rules ( thats life ) and do a chore to help out. Not much to ask at all!!!! I am also learning how to be a good mom. I have a 7 month old whom everyone loves and always helps me out with him and Charlotte and Roy  always answer the many questions I have about the the baby. They are my family and I love this place!!!!My husband is a Turkish citizen who have never held his son and has never been to america, with the help of the ministry we are getting him over here to be with his son. If I was not here it would not be possible for him to get here.  You will succeed here  if you are not lazy, want to do good.

The writer neglected to say that she had been late or just not shown up for several required meetings prior to being asked to leave; that she knew about her chores which are a very small price to pay to have a warm place to stay in exchange for room and board.    As a current resident, I feel that I need to set the record straight.  Mrs. Charlotte has been very understanding with me and very indulgent of me from running me all over Jackson,  holding a bed for me when I could find no place in the Delta where I am from, picking me up from the train station, plus carting me around to various doctor's appointments and job interviews whether she is under the weather or not.    The rules are not difficult to follow and each person is given a list of the rules when they come here to stay.   The chores are not difficult; at the very most it takes 45 minutes normally no more than 30 minutes a day to do your assigned chore which is a very small price to pay for a place to live.   Charlotte and Roy are very understanding and fair with their enforcement of the rules.  There is not a person here who has not messed up once or twice who has not been given another chance by them.  
Wingard Home Ministry	59392		/users/profile/64113	Dont trust these people	General Member of the Public	1	01/04/2011	My family moved here after loosing our home. I have to admit. It was the most horrible experience ever! I wished I would have found a shelter! Mrs. Charlette is a two faced bi***. Mr.Roy could care less about everyone but himself. There children are the weirdest people I have ever mett. Mrs. Charlette gives a place to live but living by her rules is clearly impossible! You have chores,rules. Her children do not which explains why they are very obese! Her children are teens trying to tell adults how to live there life! No joke this place is a hell hole! Curfew is strictly inforced. Miss one meeting and your kicked out. Even if you have no place to go or food to eat. or even if you wasnt told there was a meeting. These people think sence they gave you a room to sleep in they are going to heaven. I heard Mr. Roy actually say he had a passport to heaven! You will have to share a bathroom with allot of strangers!  The wingard family could give a rats ass about your situation. They are simply kissin up to the Lord to get a get out of hell free card. They are very wrong. The whole family is very strange! I am being honest. Please do not donate or help, dont even move here!

I really believe God has a place for all of us and that was not the place for me. So I left, and I am better for it. If you suffer from mental illness or have some type of alcohol/drug dependancy, I would not recommend staying at the Wingard House, they are not equipped to handle those issues.

Three months later, after Roy Wingard told me to listen, I was saved! I still drop by and visit and drive them crazy! LOL I love these people. Met so many other lost souls while living at Wingard. It's just a shame they didn't listen! I don't like being a "client served" ... I was parttime staffer back then. These people are part of my family! I will always be grateful to God's leading me to Roy and Charlotte!!

As a result of this, I was a ward of the court. When I was 14, I went to live at Wingard Home. They gave me structure, love and continous support. I stayed there until I graduated high school. Later in life, after I was married to an abusive husband and decided I needed to leave but had no money and no where to go, I called Wingard Home and without hesitation Charlotte Wingard whom I still refer to as "Mom" said get your stuff and children and come home. She helped me get on my feet and enroll in college. Charlotte and Roy Wingard I can say without a doubt saved my children's and my life. I still take to heart the things I have learned from Wingard Home. I am the person and mother I am today because of Charlotte and Roy Wingard!!!!!
Wingard Home Ministry	98570	7	/users/profile/117096	Linda King,	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2011	I want to say thank you to the ministry known as The Wingard Home.  Four weeks ago, my daughter and I came upon a young mother and her two baby girls, who were in a desperate situation. They were homeless, hungry and tired.  All they had were the clothes they were wearing and an empty diaper bag.  Their needs were met that night and 2 days later my daughter was told about the Wingard Home and took the young family to talk with Mrs. Wingard.  Mrs. Wingard immediately accepted the family and gave them a  home.  I visited the home later that week and saw smiles on the babies faces and hope in Kayla's eyes.  What a ministry this family has! God is using them to provide for His children in need.  I must also say thank you to the MISS 103 radio listeners who responded in such a heartwarming way.  GOD'S HANDS WERE ALL OVER THIS SITUATION.  Thank you, Lord, for your blessings on me......."For I was hungry, and you fed me, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in, I was naked and you clothed me........when you've done it to the least of my children, you have done it for Me".  Matthew 25:35-40

When they took us in we had NOTHING..totally Nothing. If not for Wingard Home, I dont know what would've happened to us. I met my best friend Charlotte Wingard and I still call her my best friend to date. Wingard Home was the well in the desert just like God provided for Hagar and Ishmeal (sp) in the Bible. Wingard Home is truly without a single doubt God's Ministry. I've been a resident more than one time, and I remain one of the ministry's biggest fans. I got a job and daycare for my child in which Charlotte provided transportation every day. I received counseling, unconditional acceptance and love...they gave me a hand up, not a hand out. Charlotte and Roy Wingard open their home and only ask for people to abide by the rules of  their home. I have my own business today and my daughter graduates high school next year. Wingard Home played a big part in getting us to this point. God's Ministry, Wingard Home saved our lives....literally.

They mentor those in the home while providing a safe environment, food, clothing, and everyday needs for each man, woman, and child living there.

Charlotte and Roy teach Biblical truth as they mentor those living their home.They depend of the caring generosity of sharing people to supply the needs of the home.

I went to the garden, I loved hanging the children's art work up around the building, all of the kid's painting on the white picket feces. I love the fact that the garden is open to the community to enjoy without fees. Ms. Sharon is involved in many other things within the community, it is empowering not only as a woman but as a resident of Biloxi. We all get busy with our days, our jobs, our families..

Sharon's expertise, compassion, and persistence makes this organization stand out above all the rest of non-profit entities.  The CWC provides education to our Senior Citizens, computer training, encourages healthy living by involving them in the community garden, also it provides various youth groups the opportunity to engage in the Urban community garden, which can provide them a means of survival by understanding the reproduction in plant life. This is an authentic community service project that also provides necessary items needed for students to participation in learning without feeling "left out" because of not having the school supplies and other essentials needed for their success.

I as President of the Branch served on the original board for CWC. CWC began after Hurricane Katrina as an organization designed to keep the Women in East Biloxi informed about the rebuilding process in Biloxi.  Ms. Sharon Hanshaw was elected as Executive Director for the organization.  She lost her house and business in Katrina.  Ms. Hanshaw and CWC have done a tremendous job in the community.  They have started several programs such as Computer Training for Senior Citizens, Thanksgiving Dinner for Seniors, a Community Garden.  They are also very supportive to other organizations such as STEPS, Biloxi NAACP, Miss. Center for Justice, Save Our Schools Coalition, Second Liners Mardi Gras Club and many of the local Organizations.  They have personally supported the Biloxi Branch NAACP through memberships, working with our youth branch, developing programs, supporting our Freedom Fund Dinner and Awards Program and Chairing our Mother of the Year Program which is one of our major fundraisers.  This organization is still needed in our community and definitely keeps the Women in our community involved and informed about the issues affecting East Biloxi.

As the lead program officer for the Foundation, I was impressed by the intelligence, strength and resolve of the indigenous leadership. This was particularly important after hurricane's Katrina and Rita hit the region because the government and corporate decision-makers were starting to determine the future rebuilding and redevelopment of the area with little local community input and feedback. Coastal Women for Change inserted themselves at key decision-making tables while also meeting the basic needs of residents putting their lives back together. I was also impressed by their willingness to collaborate and support the work of other organizations.  I am proud to be associated with the organization's beginnings.

To say that CARA is an animal rescue organization just doesn't seem to do them justice.  It is so much more--in so many ways.. Yes, It is a true no-kill organization that cares for over 300 dogs, 120 cats, a few rabbits, an exotic bird or two, and even some Dumbo-eared mice.  I cannot say enough good things about all their hard work and tireless dedication.  They are filled with compassion for each and every animal they come in contact with.  While being down to earth, they still have the right amount of humor to make any living thing special to them.. They truly are compassionate about the well being of the animals.  In return you can see the love the animals have for their wonderful caregivers--their love is unconditional  Many animals they come in contact with are mistreated and have never known what it feels like to be loved until now at CARA.

Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	104102		/users/profile/139525	Matthew11	Volunteer	5	01/22/2012	In my time volunteering with CARA, I have had the opportunity to meet and work with a number of great people who strive to meet the needs of those they care and/or advocate for each day.  --- Animal rescue work can be stressful, and in Mississippi, it can be even more so.  Lower than average spay/neuter rates combined with mild winters and rural areas (in a state ranking 47th in animal cruelty laws) places a heavy demand on the animal shelters in Mississippi and the Jackson Metro area.  However, the CARA shelter staff stays steadfast in the face of adversity, recognizing their mission is to take care of the furry family (all 300 plus dogs and 100 plus cats) that are part of CARA, receiving tail wags, puppy smiles, and cats meows. --- It is costly to operate an animal shelter, providing food, warmth, medical care, and comfort to the 400 plus furry friends at CARA  It is a silent cost in society that is readily ignored in the public, at least in Mississippi as most shelters operate purely as non-profits with little or no government support, despite it being a societal issue.  Nonetheless, the CARA Board and its members continually look for new ways to raise funds to support those they volunteered to take care of, competing for grants, competing in contests, developing new fundraisers, coming up with new items to sell, figuring out ways to conserve dollars, all to take care of those they volunteered to give for, and in return, receive the gift of barking dogs, lickies, purring kittens, smiling pups. --- In the end, volunteering with CARA is about a love for the animals, doing what is needed to take care of them, and it is an experience that is rewarded with the simplest gift of all, the gift of a dog or cat who says thank you for being with me today, and the gift we get for being with them.
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103875	1	/users/profile/139081	Anna13	Volunteer	5	01/19/2012	Initially, I adopted a dog from CARA and then overtime I began to foster dogs at CARA as well. Over the past 8 months or so of fostering dogs, I have gotten to know the staff at CARA and let me tell you...They are wonderful. They spend countless hours at the shelter and dedicate so much of their emotions, time, and life to the animals at this shelter. Without a doubt, they care about the well-being of every animal in the shelter. For instance, when I went to adopt my first dog from them I was expecting to be able to bring Lucy home that day, but this was not the case. A few days later, I was contacted and told I would be able to adopt Lucy. I was fairly impressed that they took the time to call my vet and contact my references before they would let me adopt Lucy. This showed me that CARA is not "just another animal shelter who will give a dog to anyone." I honestly wish there was something that I could do for all of the staff at CARA to show them how much they are appreciated because I have seen them pour so much of themselves into this shelter. 
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103830		/users/profile/138936	Valerie14	Volunteer	5	01/18/2012	The first word that comes to mind when I think of CARA is 'blessing'. Cara is made up of loving people who are nothing short of earth angels. These angels work miracles on the many needy animals that come into CARA. Many of which, anyone else would have given up all hope on. Our sweet Francis being just one of many examples. These angels give heart & soul to save these babies, including round the clock care when needed, out of pocket funds when necessary, the list just goes on & on. Many of these babies are, honestly, rejects, pets that have never known what human love looks like or feels like. To see these babies go from knowing no love or compassion to finding that there are humans who do love them passionately and unconditionally is the most heartwarming experience on the planet. Add to all of this the fact that this shelter is kept amazingly clean! I would have never thought it possible to keep everything so clean & orderly if I had I not been there to see it firsthand. I've seen how hard they work to ensure a clean & healthy environment for the many animals. It is through total devotion that they are able to accomplish this. I wish the entire rescue community could see how things are done at CARA. They are quite the example! They have inspired me more than words could ever say. I have never seen such dedication & devotion in my life. A day spent at CARA is the most uplifting experience one could imagine. There is no better way to spend a day than to see God working through these angels that He has placed there to love & protect His small creatures. The animals there are so loved, and  you can see that with every animal in their care. Sometimes, I almost feel badly when an animal is being visited by a prospective adopter, because these animals feel so safe & secure in the arms of these angels. Life to them is awesome, they don't think they are missing anything at all, for they have it all, right there in their own little piece of Heaven. Yes, CARA is most definitely a blessing to our community & to our city, through rescuing, rehabilitating, re-homing, & providing education  as well. I would hate to see where we would be without them, and I pray that we never have to find out. 
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103629		/users/profile/138582	Jennifer74	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	Where do I begin? Not only has mine and my husbands life been enriched by volunteering for CARA, it has also been blessed by expanding our family with 3 wonderful dogs that we would not have had the pleasure of owning had CARA not provided food, shelter and love until we gave them a forever home. Housing over 300 dogs has to be such a daunting task but they are so dedicated to the animals and their well being, you would never know it. Specifically, a freezing February night in 2011 and Cara gets a call about a puppy near death, in a coma that someone has left in the freezing cold. Not only did they agree to take him in, but they spent countless hours nursing him back to health. He had to learn how to eat, how to stand and how to walk. Without their hardwork and dedication, he would not be where he is today. He has been adopted and shows no signs of his horrendous beginnings. Most recently, 2 day old puppies are found in a dumpster up the road from the shelter. Thankfully the person that left them there left them in a box with their address listed on it.  Not only did CARA take in the puppies, they went to the owner and convinced them to surrender the mother dog and are working tirelessly to have the other animals spayed/neutered. They have done a great job of raising awareness of the need for stronger laws against animal cruelty and our states desperate need to become proactive animal owners (I.e. spay/neuter) Without them, thousands of dogs and cats would be wandering the streets, starving, neglected, abused....many of those animals adding to the pet overpopulation because they have not been spayed/neutered. They work tirelessly for these animals. It is their life, heart and passion. Our state is blessed by the work they do.
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103627		/users/profile/138578	Tal M.	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	CARA is a wonderful organization and blessing to our community and state.  Their tireless work rescuing and caring for animals in need is nothing short of a miracle.  Along with volunteering my wife and I have also adopted three wonderful dogs from CARA.
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103616	1	/users/profile/138310	Nancy33	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	ecame involved with CARA a couple of years thru a client who was doing a summer fundraiser  and asked my husband and I to volunteer and work the event because they knew we had 5 dogs and that we love animals! The next year, we became more actively involved in the event and became to learn more about CARA and my husband was asked to be a part of the board.  He had 12 years of fundraising experience and I suggested he could be a good asset to them.  Thru this, i have come to see first hand how the mission of CARA to help abandoned, abused, neglected and homeless animals find refuge and healing and then loving homes they so just deserve is carried out.   The staff, shelter director and founders are actively involved in the daily care and maintenance of all the animals in their care.  It is tireless effort for each and every animal that is brought to them for refuge.  The dedication they show to the animals is truly remarkable.  The story repeated on here earlier of Francis and the round the clock support and effort for his survival is just one of the many displays of love and dedication this group provides to animals in the care.  Another example is Sara Elizabeth, who was brought to the shelter because she was not growing like her liter mates.  Her body was rejecting the food she was taking in.  So the staff at CARA watched her around the clock for a week and would not give up on this little one.  They bottle feed her every few hours and tried multiple things till her body started to take the food she was given.  She is now a vibrant little puppy!  But most people would have given up and put her to sleep.  but thru there efforts, she is a beautiful little girl!  This is just 2 of the examples of the work of CARA.  When you go out to the shelter, you know the animals there are cared for and safe.  What a wonderful world it would be if all animals were cared for and safe in loving homes!!  CARA also promotes spay/neuter to help eliminate the overpopulation problem.  
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103586		/users/profile/138498	laurengarrick	Board Member	5	01/17/2012	To Whom it May Concern: Community Animal Rescue and Adoption (CARA) truly is an amazing place! I have been involved with CARA for the past 5 years, in one aspect or another, and just cannot say enough about this organization. CARA has seen it all... from bunnies, to rats; from healthy animals to animals on death's door; and from the cute and playful to the unadoptable. Through it all CARA never ceases to amaze me. Located in the Jackson area, it is one of several shelters in our area, but has such a strong following and such a great base of givers - and for good reason - it is the best shelter in the area. CARA has provided temporary and long-term housing to a countless number of animals since it opened almost 11 years ago, and with support and exposure that it might recieve due to campaigns like this one, it can continue to get unwanted, abused animals into loving homes while promoting spay/neuter. 
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103540	1	/users/profile/138401	Elizabeth41	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	I started volunteering with CARA almost 5 years ago.  Several things I learned in a very brief time.  CARA kept its animals and kennels clean.  They were well fed and the staff knew the animals.  Every kennel worker had a rapport with the animals they cared for, knew their story and worked with the animals to improve their lives.   Puppies especially but all dogs that liked balls or toys had them in their kennels.   Animals were given a treat each night before they went to sleep.  It was not a sad place but a place of love and hope.  I've seen volunteers and staff both pull money out of their own pockets when something was needed for the animals.  Since this shelter operates on donations and grants and cares for approximately 300 dogs and 125 cats money is managed to the penny.  I believe at last indication 97% of all income went directly to animal care.  THEY CARE!!
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103505	1	/users/profile/138270	nikkiscott2	General Member of the Public	5	01/16/2012	Last February I saw a post on Community Animal Rescue and Adoptions (CARA) facebook page about a 3-month old sheltie/shepherd mix puppy that had been found thrown out in a box on the side of the road.  He was frozen, starved, dehydrated and in a coma.  After receiving emergency medical from their vet, he was monitored and cared for 24 hours a day by the wonderful and caring staff at CARA.  They would take turns taking him home at night so he could sleep next to someone and know if he woke up that there was a kind, loving hand there to help him. Feeding tubes were inserted and remained in for over 2 months.   After several days, he woke from his coma but was unable to stand or walk.  CARA continually sent out prayer requests for this puppy, Francis, who they named after St. Francis of Assisi.   When he got a little stronger, they had a human physical therapist come to work with him.  After several weeks of therapy several times a day, he was able to stand and eventually walk.     The loving, caring people at CARA wanted nothing more than for this special puppy to find a loving home and live a happy life that we would hope all homeless animals could find.  After weeks of going over applications and doing interviews we were the lucky family chosen to adopt this special puppy.  Without the extra care and love of the dedicated staff at CARA, this puppy would not be here today.  
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103480		/users/profile/138138	gayla	Donor	5	01/16/2012	I am honored to write a letter of support for CARA.  I first became aware of CARA last year when we lost our little yorkie Brunhilda, and we were looking for a companion for Bailey, Brunhildas sister.  By the happiest of accidents a friend volunteers for CARA and had posted pictures from CARA's annual Dog Days of Summer on her Facebook page.  I was immediately drawn to Baxter and was soon filling out an application.  Baxter came to join our family on Labor Day of 2010, and we cannot imagine our family without him.  The whole family competes for his attention, and he has helped us with our grieving from losing Brunhilda.  CARA made the whole process so easy, and they even brought Baxter to my house so Baxter could see if he liked us and we liked him.  He does, and we do. Once I was aware of CARA, I became a fan, helping with donations when I could.  Then last winter I saw CARA at its best when they helped a puppy survive who had been thrown away as a box of garbage in the winter's  cold.  When found the puppy, Francis, was in a coma.  Yes, Francis is named after St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.  I, like many others, checked CARA's site often to see if Francis had survived another day.  A CARA worker nursed this puppy to health by giving him round the clock care.  Once he came out of his coma, the hard work started of getting him to stand and walk.  To watch this unfold was humbling, and CARA with its team of volunteers performed this miracle with a community watching and praying.  Francis became the face of animal abuse, and our state's new animal abuse legislation was passed, surely in part, because of CARA and their tireless work for abused and discarded animals.   Francis is truly an inspiring story of triumph over adversity.  While certainly not as extreme or emotional, we feel Baxter has given our family much the same injection of hope and spirit as Francis has given North America.  Baxter is a bundle of joy who is always glad to welcome us home.  As soon as you open the door, he is the first to greet you.  He has trained the entire family to give him treats when he wants them.  We are sure he believes humans must be slow learners.  He is a beautiful dog with a spirited personality who has inspired love and affection. 
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103479	1	/users/profile/138134	lynn shaw	Volunteer	5	01/16/2012	I came to Cara 3 yrs ago. I needed a job life had been hard on me I had made a lot of wrong decisions in life and needed a fresh start.So they hired me at cara. And during these years I have been there Cara has turned my life around and has given meaning to life. I have a fresh outlook on life and my world is wonderful. These animals are what keeps me going. I take care of the sick that comes through our doors. What I am saying is cara not only gives animals a second chance at life they do the same for people. I dont know where I would be today if I hadnt found cara. But cara has given me a reason to continue to do the right things in life. I will be forever grateful to them. When I come in to work in the mornings and I get greeted by the sounds of these babies who are so glad to see me I know I have found my place in life to help those that cant help there self
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103477		/users/profile/138111	Ann Somers	Volunteer	5	01/16/2012	CARA provides a safe loving environment for animals that need a little help finding a home. There are so many components (clean healthy environment, good employees, community support, adoption options) to having a well run shelter and CARA is hitting each target extremely well.  This is a true no kill shelter and there are always some dogs that are not thought to be very adoptable. Less than ten percent of our dogs have bee at the shelter longer than five years.  We are very thankful we have CARA to take care of our city's pets without a home. 
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103472	2	/users/profile/138023	Ruth Hollands	General Member of the Public	5	01/15/2012	In February 2011 a friend posted a picture on Facebook of a tiny puppy who had been starved and frozen almost to death. He had been found by a loving couple and brought to CARA - Community Animal Rescue & Adoption the next morning. Under his picture CARA asked that people keep this tiny puppy in their thoughts and prayers, in the hopes that he could beat all the odds stacked against him. With the love and personal care by the people of CARA, the medical treatment of their vet, the help of a volunteer physical therapist, and the thoughts and prayers from people around the world that precious puppy did beat the odds and he now has a happy and loving forever family.  I was lucky enough in August 2011 to drive from Ontario Canada to Jackson Mississippi and meet not only Francis and his family, but to be able to go to CARA and meet the caring people who work there and all their fur babies in their care. CARA has a lot of homeless animals to look after and they do their best to find loving forever homes for them. Unfortunately there are some animals who will never find their very own homes, but they will still be loved and cared for because CARA will never euthanize any of the animals (they are a true NO-KILL shelter) unless the vet says nothing else can be done for them and they are suffering. If it should come to that, at least one of the caring people from CARA will be with the fur baby to the very end so they will know that they were truly loved. Even though I live in a different country, I will always admire and support CARA, and I am happy to have met and become friends with the wonderful people there. 
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103466		/users/profile/138004	karen justice	General Member of the Public	5	01/15/2012	I first found out about CARA from a friend on Facebook. There had been a puppy brought to CARA by a very caring couple, who found him in a box, thrown out like trash, in the freezing weather. He was near death, in a coma. I followed that puppy everyday, several times a day... And the people at CARA gave him so much tender loving care. He was given special attention 24-7, as some of the CARA family took him home with them, not only to moniter and care for him, but also because they really didn't think he would live and just wanted him to feel love. He survived!! His name is Francis, as they named him after St. Francis. CARA had a physical therapist,  who volunteered to come and help him, as he couldn't even walk. Ever since then I have been a CARA follower, and have witnessed one case of animal cruelty and neglect after another come through the doors of CARA, and seen the love, care, and tenderness they give to all of "their babies". I have never seen such a group of people be so unselfish, so giving, so caring, as the CARA family. I am happy and proud to say we have all developed a friendship that will last a lifetime.  God Bless CARA!!

It was obvious he was well cared for at CARA which is why he is so well adjusted today. One of my close friends volunteers at CARA so I see first hand so much of the good work they do every day for abused and unwanted animals. I really appreciate the focus CARA places on educating the public on the importance of spaying and neutering pets. This is the root of the animal overpopulation problem that creates the need for shelters like CARA. Thank goodness CARA is here to give second chances to so many dogs and cats in our area!

CARA staff are genuine, caring, non-judgemental and put the pets in their care first. CARA only receives donations from the public, grants and contests, as they are a non-profile, no kill agency. I am very pleased with any and all dealings I have had with CARA in the past and if I ever adopt again, CARA will be the only agency I turn to. 
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103461		/users/profile/137996	Lizzer	Volunteer	5	01/15/2012	My heart goes out to animals of all kind.  When I moved to Brandon, I wanted to know what I could do to help animals in need.  For me, I wish I could take all of the animals home with me because I knew they'd be euthanized or left to the elements to die.  That's when a friend told me about CARA of Mississippi, a no-kill shelter.  I knew this was the place for me.  the wonderful people here make every effort to take the animals that are unwanted and unloved to give them to good homes and loving families.  I help with the cattery socializing the sick cats.  I hold them, brush them, and give them as much love as I can possibly give.  This way, I can make sure these animals know they are loved and wanted.
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103364	1	/users/profile/137671	Sharon18	Volunteer	5	01/13/2012	My daughter & I started volunteering with CARA in Sept. 2001.  She was the cat-lover, while I worked with the dogs.  I have seen my fair share of stories, both good & bad, come through our doors.  All have been loved equally and unconditionally.  All of my pets are CARA dogs and cats and I wouldn't trade them for the world.  My very first foster was a litter of eight 1 month old Boxer pups that were abandoned at the Reservoir.  
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103181		/users/profile/137086	Denise12	Donor	5	01/11/2012	joined the CARA Community Council in 2008.  I had been sponsoring a dog there by the name of "Dexter" for several years and know I wanted to get more involved with the Shelter. On my first visit to the shelter I was so overwhelmed and emotional to see all their many dogs and cats.  I decided the best way I could help them was to get involved with fundraising and events to make everyone else aware of this wonderful organization.  I have seen so many miracles occur these last couple of years.  Dogs brought in on the brink of death or in horrendous conditions., newborn puppies abandoned at the door without their mother, you name it.  Whatever the situation the wonderful staff always has the animals' best interest at heart.  They tirelessly bottle feed the babies, patiently lay with the suffering, take them into their personal care for days  and always find a way to nurse them back to a hearlthy dogs that any family would be blessed to adopt.  People sometimes tend to misjudge the CARA Staff--they are not trying to be anything but the earth angels they are to all their shelter children.  God bless them.  
Community Animal Rescue & Adoption	103126		/users/profile/136998	Laura47	Board Member	5	01/10/2012	I first met Bear in September 2009 when I started volunteering in the cattery at Community Animal Rescue and Adoption (CARA) in Jackson, MS. I was recovering from cancer surgery and Bear seemed to be very slowly emerging from his own ordeal. At first he was so shy I could barely pet him but I kept reaching out to him because, at some level, we had already bonded. After a few months, Bear let me pet him and eventually brush himwhich he loved. Even though I felt affection for all the cats in the cattery, Bear was special and he kept tugging at my heart. In July 2010, I lost my 12 year old rescue cat, Thunder, which broke my spirit in so many ways. After months of grieving Thunders loss, I knew it was time to bring Bear home to meet his new companion, Lightning,  my 13 year old rescue cat. No one could ever replace Thunder but Bear has become a much loved member of our family. I am convinced that the special care Bear received at CARA is the only reason he is still alive and healthyphysically and emotionallytoday.After adopting Bear I began volunteering more and more at CARA because I saw what a special place it is for so many abused, unwanted and neglected animals300 dogs and 125 cats to be exact.  The staff at CARA gives their all each and every day to improve the lives of these innocent animals.  I am blessed to be a part of the CARA family.

I was physically injured in 25 Jun 1996 by an IED in Saudi Arabia and developed PTSD as a further result.  I did my best to stuff all that into a mental "box" and leave it alone until I was put in contact with the Warrior Bonfire team.  I am so glad I became involved with the Warrior Bonfire organization.  The emotional and mental turmoil I had tried to deal with alone has become far easier to deal with now that I've spent time with others dealing with similar issues in an environment where all are equal and open to sharing.  It's a blessing.

I loved my experience with Warrior Bonfire Program.    They took me and 4 or 5 other veterans on a 3 day pig hunt as well as a get together full of skeet shooting and other events that helped raise the morale and welfare of us all.   I found a lot of fellowship and healing during this trip.   It was very rewarding as well as therapeutic.   The people that run this program definitely have their hearts in the right place.

Whether it be hunting, fishing, skiing or just skeet shooting, it has been an awesome experience.  I have made so many friends and experienced things that I probably would have never experienced.  Flying in a P51 Mustang is one of those experiences and it is definitely one I will never forget.

Warrior Bonfire Program	286208	2	/users/profile/376291	Writer	Client Served	5	04/19/2016	I just spent a weekend with this organization and I am quite impressed. They are addressing a much needed gap that no other group has addressed. Vietnam veterans suffer from many of the same debilitating afflictions that affect the younger veterans. The way that they were treated after returning from Vietnam was disgraceful and many have had to suffer it in silence. Nowadays, there are many organizations that offer therapeutic services to the current generation of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, but sadly ignore the baby boomers.  This organization is deserving of everyone's support.

They provide therapeutic opportunities and build a brotherhood of support so that America's heroes know they are not alone in their struggles.  Not only does this organization reach out to combat wounded veterans, but they have opportunities for the spouses of combat wounded veterans who struggle with the changes in their loved one after war. There are a lot of organizations out there that help our veterans, but this one is one that provides a need most do not.

Comparing to other non profits, this one is second to none in my opinion. The org has strong roots imbedded in integrity and loyalty to those who have been wounded in combat. Since my trip, the org and it's founder have went out of their way to make me "and others" feel and know we have someone out there just for us. They do these trips and events that bring our Purple Heart recipients together for meaningful, quality, rehabilitating social interaction. Something to many of us lack in our normal "not so normal" lives. I will continue to proudly stand tall with this org and I know they will stand with me. Please help this org, please help our combat wounded. I don't know of another organization that I can truly say " I know there doing the right things for the right reasons". Thank you. And god bless You, America, and our service men and women.

I think what they have done to preserve the history of the Jewish South as well as to educate those in the South is fabulous.
Institute of Southern Jewish Life	59093		/users/profile/63644	TovahG	Client Served	5	12/27/2010	We live in an area with few other Jewish families. We are able to attend services once a month in borrowed space at a Presbyterian church. The Taste of Torah from the ISJLl provides us with a weekly d'var torah (sermon)  Their dynamic rabbi attended our Seder and and plans to return next Passover. ISJL provides a comprehensive K-12 Sunday school curriculum so that every Jewish child can recieve a quality religious education. Although there are no children in the Shalom b'Harim congregation right now, as our group grows we will make good use of that curriculum. The ISJL education fellows travel throughout a 13 state area working with congregations and their educators. This is an invaluable program for small congregations that are struggling to survive.

For several years I have printed the Taste of Torah lessons to read and reread, finding the portions by the Director to be masterfully taught, insightful, humorous, and at times, even personally moving.I became acquainted with ISJL through my high school best friend, now the Rabbi's secretary.  The benefit of my involvement is in knowing that more Jewish children and young adults in small communities in the South will have their very rich and most unique heritage among the world's cultures opened up to them, and nurtured, and that it will change their lives forever.

Since I teach in our parent-run religious school, the curriculum and instructional assistance from the Education program has been sanity-saving. It works so much better than each person selecting his/her own books each year and stumbling through based on their limited knowledge. And the Taste of Torah emails are great too!

The leadership is outstanding and the staff, without exception, is talented, efficient, and gracious.  The Education program is, in my opinion, the most important of the various programs in which ISJL engages.  It is of invaluable help to the Jews in the smaller communities of the region served by ISJL but also of major help to the larger communities.  The head of this program is one of the most capable young ladies I have met and her staff reflects her leadership.  I also think that the Jewish History program has outstanding and devoted personnel.  In fact all of the various ISJL programs are staffed by energetic, sincere, capable people and contribute to the Jewish experience of the region.

Our Directors are usually parent volunteers, our teachers are wonderful college students and community members with varying degrees of experience as educators.  The curriculum provides a solid foundation for teaching Judaic studies and Hebrew.  As the teachers change, I know our youth will continue to be learning new material each year at an age-appropriate level.  We also love having support from our ISJL Education Fellow who has helped me already on several occasions when my knowledge has been lacking.  The ISJL is providing an outstanding service to our small community and helping us to raise Jewish youth with a strong connection to their Judaism.

Over the past years we sought to get this same level of assistance from the URJ, but seemed to feel "overlooked" rather than looked after.  The ISJL treats us as if we are their largest member congregation rather than one of their smallest. We participated in the educational program this year, after passing it up for a number of years, and we are seeing a definite positive result by following the ISJL primer on what we can do. Our educational leaders came away from the program enthused and prepared in ways they had never expected before attending. We are looking forward to our second visit from our educational advisor. This is something we never had working with other programs. We have participated in entertainment programs in the past and would like to do more in the future, as time and money allow. The people of the ISJL, from the very top of the organization down, understand us, and our challenges and give us real world options as solutions. This is why we are so very pleased with the ISJL.

We were encouraged to find that the organization's foundation was focused on bringing quality education combined with Biblical teaching to spread the word of God. Through a series of prayer and evaluation, we decided to join the NICS staff in Korea. Throughout our 12 years of service we can proudly say that the school demonstrated and displayed a Christ centered atmosphere to the students and community. The teachers and staff established a unique family type of relationship with the students and families. My children were able to receive a great education surrounded with other children from many nations.  This impacted them in a very positive way that will always be with them. Even to this day many of the former students still stay in contact with us and  I believe that the education they received from NICS helped prepare them for their professional careers. I am so thankful for the vision that God gave the Director Joe Hale many years ago to reach children all over the world through education.

My daughter started in kindergarten and for the next 10 years she studied at NICS.   We transferred back to the states and now she is a junior at UCLA.  I would not hesitate to recommend NICS for the education of your children.  The curriculum, text books and professional instruction given to them will give them a solid foundation for their future.

Having volunteered and then worked with this organization for many, many years I can say whole heartedly that the employees exercise character and integrity with every decision made.  And with  all choices falling under that umbrella, anyone knows that success ushers in many difficult challenges and even through those, I  have observed decisions that fan integrity, continue.  We are not perfect, not even close, but we are transparent.  If you doubt, inquire; if you are puzzled by the 8 percent, please pick up the phone.  Then we can explain that other agencies need up to 15 percent instead of our requested 8.   May we always, come what may, strive to create and support God honoring schools led by directors and staff who also reflect this ultimate calling.   Maybe you are a teacher or have a teacher friend who would like to apply?  We hope so!

The family atmosphere was truly amazing and their was true professionalism at this school.  Presently, I do some volunteer work through the home office and if I have any complaint it is that they are too concerned about asking too much from their volunteers.  It is unfortunate that some who have a bad experience or think themselves wiser than the leadership feel the need to speak negatively about an organization that has existed over 30 years and continues to grow for the glory of God.

Within two years this new school faced a teacher exodus, low morale, only 46 students, and financial ruin.  NICS gently offered to get us back on our feet.  After a $180,000 investment to bail us out, NICS also handled sensitive personnel decisions, brought in great teachers and truly saved the school.  Now, 23 years later, all three of my sons have graduated from this school that now has 480 students.  The loan from NICS that we repaid after several years fails in comparison to the school's annual $6 million budget now.

The schools buy their own textbooks and resources, and very little (in most cases no) money flows from the "Home Office" to the schools around the world. Conversely, the money flows into Southaven in the millions and is exempt from tax (at least for now). If you look at their Form 990 you can easily see that they state that they do not own any school overseas, and yet this is not clearly stated on their website. Also of note, donated funds in the amount of $500kUSD are being used to support the start up of a FOR-PROFIT school in Kuala Lumpur, a direct violation of non-profit laws (ironically this school is led by the President's son). They actually promote this on their website, asking for donations for their for-profit school in Malaysia! Also, take a look at (Form 990) how many schools the "network" had each year in the past (hint, it is decreasing). Also, hundreds of thousands of donor's and school dollars are being used for legal fees around the world (not declared accurately). It is actually a sad state of affairs as they could be a very positive and impactful organization. 
The Baddour Center	272828		/users/profile/361955	Hounddawg	Donor	5	11/24/2015	My brother has lived at Baddour for over 20 years. The faculty and staff at the center has changed his life. He now is self confident, happy, working and enthusiastic about living at Baddour. It's a Christ centered home for residents who live, work, and play together. My brother likes to visit his family members but he's very excited to get back to the place he calls home. 
The Baddour Center	270666		/users/profile/359395	Writer	Donor	5	11/01/2015	I have known about the Baddour Center since its inception more than 35 year ago. It is one of the most remarkable facilities of its kind. Watching it grow over the years, I am always impressed with the dedicated staff and how they continue to serve its residents in the most innovative and caring ways.

The Baddour Center	269888		/users/profile/358620	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2015	I have had the pleasure to be in attendance at  several functions  spotlighting the Baddour  Center.  The  Christmas program put on by the residence, is a Heart Warming  production expressing love, respect for each other, and a true Spirit of Home. As a  guest you feel like you've gathered at a  family reunion, not visiting a program and leave untouched. You leave warm and humbled by the sweet presence shared by staff, residence, and guest. The Garden center is over the Top !!!The garden manager Linette , has along with her crew of residence, and staff developed a master piece by developing a butterfly center, welcoming the winged beauties. I was present  watching the eyes and excitement  of one resident experiencing his first visit of the monarch caterpillars. They together have shared the Magic butterfly development with schools, individuals, and most importantly their own residence at their own homes.  The Dancing with the Stars Event featuring residence and other important guest is a Splendid evening  that should not be missed by anyone. All of the above comes together because of the folks working with their hearts to keep the residence FIRST in the cause. Reba Wright   
The Baddour Center	269782		/users/profile/358512	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2015	The Baddour Center Garden Center is a customer of mine. This is a full line, full service garden center. The residents play a huge role in growing the majority of the plants they retail. This year they began what I think is one of the most innovative programs I've seen - a monarch butterfly project. They are growing and selling the native milkweed and are also offering monarch caterpillars too! This is just one of the things they do that sets them apart...
The Baddour Center	269746		/users/profile/358470	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	Choices is the first word that comes to mind when I think about The Baddour Center. Residents have so many choices in their day-to-day lives! Job choices, independent living skill choices, recreational choices, and friendship choices are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to choices for them! That same word could be applied to me as a former and recently returned staff member. I had the privilege of working here for five years; then, I made the choice to become a teacher, thinking that was what God called me to do. As much as I loved my students, I always thought about residents of The Baddour Center -- and unknowingly even centered many of my lessons on kindness, tolerance for people who are different from you, and celebrating your abilities, not disabilities. In hindsight, I realize that what I was teaching my students was what The Baddour Center taught me. You see, the choices we make in life is subconsciously a model to others around us about how to live life, treat others, etc. Life is one big beautiful choice. The old saying suggests that we should choose wisely. So, I chose to return to The Baddour Center a few months ago in a role that allows me to share this incredible group of people - not just a non-profit but a family - with others who are searching for choices for their loved ones. If The Baddour Center can indirectly teach a staff member such valuable building blocks for life, can you imagine what they can teach the men and women who live here, the ones who every program is geared toward and the culture is built around?  I hope you will select a non-profit to support. I personally choose to give back through our United Way payroll deductions. Remember, giving of your time and money is your choice, but we hope you choose Baddour residents!

I promise you will receive more than you give or at least feel that way.  Beautiful place with beautiful people who love unconditionally!  How do I know all of this?  I've had the privilege of working here for the past 36 years.  You may come by yourself, bring a group or your family but come take a tour and see what area you would like to volunteer..

The Baddour Center	268587		/users/profile/357319	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2015	I became affiliated with this agency about 10 years ago as a volunteer on a committee, then joined the Board of Directors, and finally have become an employee.  the Center's mission to be a model community for persons with intellectual disabilities does not waver.  Management is top notch.  The Center is privately funded, and displays only the highest standards of care and best practices.  A truly person centered program, tops in this field, and the most enriched environment I have ever seen.  Five stars plus here!!!
The Baddour Center	267838		/users/profile/356569	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2015	We have had the good fortune to be able to offer Physical and Occupational therapy to the residents of the center. The last 2 plus years we have experienced not just a great working relationship but also a wonderful example of the dedication of all the staff in providing not only great service but giving all those that live there a loving and warm home. We are honored to play a part in this mission of care and would highly recommend the community to any and all who would benefit from a place that is more than just a place to live.
The Baddour Center	267702		/users/profile/356432	Writer	Former staff	5	10/27/2015	Retired a little over a year now, I reflect back on fond memories of my some ten years with the Baddour Center. It was the best job I ever had and the best place I ever worked. Instead of saying I have to go to work today, I would often say, "I get to go to work today", because it was an opportunity to spend time with my friends, both staff and residents, in a positive, nurturing environment. One definition of love is "wanting the best for someone and actively taking steps to help them achieve it." The Baddour Center afforded me the opportunity to do just that and I shall always be grateful for my time there.
The Baddour Center	267646		/users/profile/356378	Writer	Client Served	5	10/27/2015	Our daughter has been a resident of Baddour for 32 years. The facilites are top notch, the campus is beautiful, and the Staff is second to none. Our daughter has thoroughly enjoyed her time there and has had so many wonderful experiences over the years.   We are very blessed to have a place like Baddour so close to home, and would highly reccommend it to any families with special needs children that are looking for a place to watch them succeed and grow.
The Baddour Center	267457		/users/profile/356188	FCurry	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2015	The Baddour Center, located in Senatobia, MS, is a wonderful place.  It provides a residential home for the adult intellectually challenged. The campus is beautiful with many trees, lakes, facilities for sports, and residential group homes that give the feeling of a college campus.  I have visited the Center many times to pickup beautiful poinsettias and Easter lilies for our church. These and other plants are raised in greenhouses tended by residents.  On campus I've observed so many of the residents walking or biking and always smiling and happy.  Baddour Center is one happy place.
The Baddour Center	266907		/users/profile/355667	Writer	Former staff	5	10/24/2015	I was blessed to have had the opportunity to work along side many fantastic individuals at The Baddour Center for 5 wonderful years.  I moved and left The Baddour Center 4 years ago; however they remain in my heart and it will always be one of the highlights in my career.  I now live several states away but continue to recommend this community to families I meet that are looking for a full life experience for a family member.  
The Baddour Center	266681		/users/profile/355439	Writer	Client Served	5	10/23/2015	Our son has been a resident of the Baddour Center since 2002.

The staff truly cares about the residents and I would encourage anyone with a need or heart for special needs ministry to visit the Baddour Center.
The Baddour Center	266457		/users/profile/355225	ruthanhale	Donor	5	10/22/2015	I began working at The Baddour Center 2 years ago as director of development and public relations. I know you may think I'm writing this great review because I work here but that's not the reason. I do feel privileged to work here though. The Baddour Center is a residential community for adults with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities located in Senatobia, Miss., just 45 minutes from Memphis, Tenn.  This beautiful pastoral setting is 120 acres of rolling hills and lakes and is home to 170 residents. I have seen firsthand how the staff and programs at Baddour transform lives. Residents learn to be more independent, get a job, improve their social skills, make great friends, be healthy, better worship God and so much more! I've seen people grow and blossom in ways that amaze their families and give them the self-esteem and skills to fulfill their dreams. The  Baddour Center rocks!

I personally got my baby Dixie from them 2 yrs ago and she is a blessing to our family.. I recommend anyone looking for a fur baby for their family to check them out.. and if anyone can help them they run strictly off of volunteers...  Shaw Pitbull Rescue is an amazing non profit organization that goes above and beyond to help these animals..

They work with each dog individually to get each dog to their very best with love, patience and excellent care. They are the best.

The love and dedication they have to those sweet babies is remarkable. The first time I walked into the rescue I got to walk through and see all the dogs and hear all of their stories. All of the dogs there have come a long way and are so happy and healthy and it's all because of the love and care that the Shaws have for their rescue and each individual dog. 5 stars no doubt about it 
Shaw Pit Bull Rescue	248841	2	/users/profile/336629	Bella.rose	Donor	5	07/18/2015	This rescue helps the breed that is in vogue to think as dangerous. These are wonderful dogs that are well cared and loved by this rescue. Please consider donating to this worthy rescue.

Shaw Pit Bull Rescue	248760	3	/users/profile/336530	Loridavis	Volunteer	5	07/17/2015	I've been involved with raising and donating money to the Shaw Pitbull Rescue for 2 yrs now. The reason I chose the Shaw rescue is because of their dedication to the dogs. Every dog at the rescue is treated like family. They put countless hours into socializing, re habilitating, training, and loving the dogs. I've been to quite a few rescues, but have never seen a cleaner, more organized, more loving atmosphere than the Shaw rescue. These neglected and abused dogs are taught how to be dogs and family pets again and shown the kind of love and attention that usually and often only comes from a home situation. I love that they are totally transparent with donations so we are able to see where every dollar goes. The owners and volunteers at Shaw are completely dedicated to giving the dogs the best while they are in their care and to continually improving the dogs environment. Definitely a 5 star rescue ! 
Shaw Pit Bull Rescue	248751	3	/users/profile/336518	Weloveourpit	Client Served	5	07/17/2015	The people at Shaw Pitbull Rescue are angels on Earth. They genuinely love and care about every dog they rescue, and they do everything in their power to rehabilitate  the dogs. Before you got our dog, they had done fundraisers to get him the surgery he needed. Most people would have given up on him, but they didn't. This is just one reason why the are the best and need all the donations they can get!
Shaw Pit Bull Rescue	248695	3	/users/profile/336462	Andrea125	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	I have been volunteering at Shaw PBR for two months, after starting as a donor. The day I walked in and signed volunteer paperwork was the start of a wonderful and educational experience. The owners are very knowledgable about the bully breed and provide the community with education and awareness. If they hear of someone in need of help or advice about their dog, they help and do all they are able.All the dogs at the rescue are well taken care of and loved. Shots, spay/neuter, heartworm preventative, etc is all taken care of but also each dog has time spent with him/her. The dogs just do not go to the first home that comes up, there are preadoption forms and meetings to make sure the family is the right fit for the dog. I honestly could not think of a better rescue to spend my days and time at than Shaw PBR with the staff and dogs. I wish there was more than 5 stars, but even then I could never select enough to show how awesome/friendly/amazing this rescue is. 
Shaw Pit Bull Rescue	248691	3	/users/profile/336459	Dana57	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	I have been at Shaw PBR as a volunteer since Aug 2014. During that time I have seen many dogs come and go. Each dog is spayed or neutered, up to date on ALL vaccines, microchipped, on heart worm preventative, and sent home with 30 days of pet insurance.  During this time I have seen the love, care, and training that goes into the animals. I have seen the owners take their own money and buy for these dogs, I have seen them spend their own money to help other dogs in the community that they have never met just to lend a helping hand. And I can guarantee you that there has NEVER been a Volunteer Work Day that both owners were not out there busting their butts right along with us.  For your love of the dogs, the community, and the people who offer to help even once, I salute you Aimee and Kenneth Shaw. You are amazing people and even more amzing is your dedication to the American Pit Bull Terrier and sister bully breeds. 5 stars and would give more if I could.
Shaw Pit Bull Rescue	248637	3	/users/profile/336393	Miranda_J	Donor	5	07/16/2015	I have been working with this group now for 3 years.  This small group achieves more than you would think is possible - they do this simply by hard work and dedication.  The animals in their care are well cared for, well loved and happy.  The folks at Shaw PBR work with adopters to ensure they find the dog that fits into their family, but they go beyond that by reaching out to the community to educate about the breed as well.  They also try to assist people to learn how to work with their existing pets to resolve any behavioral issues rather than the owner simply give up on, and surrender their pet.  They are transparent with their operation therefore donors never need to wonder where their money goes.  This is an honest group who simply do good work.  I highly recommend them to anyone who would like to adopt a pit bull, volunteer their time, or donate to help their cause.

We established the Randall Speck Special Needs Fund and have been amazed at the number of children we have been able to assist. It is definitely the best feeling one can get knowing that Randall's fund is helping kids get the medical attention they need and all of the credit for the success goes to Dave Estorge and the Memorial Hospital Foundation. All of their funds continue to provide much needed assistance for a variety of causes and we are proud to be a part of the MHG Foundation.        Carol & Richard Speck and Allison & Jason Walker

I donated all of the monies that I raised to the Memorial Hospital's Breast Imaging Fund, which helps women along the Mississippi Gulf Coast pay for their breast imaging services they cannot afford.  Without the help of the Foundation, I would not have been able to raise as much money as I did.

Memorial Hospital At Gulfportfoundation Inc	144856		/users/profile/191404	Ginger Worth	Advisor	5	11/30/2012	The Memorial Foundation was instrumental and  helped to fund a brand new mobile Immunization Van to provide immunizations and limited health screening services to the community. By providing the mobile van, Memorial is now able to reach more members of the community, providing preventative care to children and adults, which in turn helps Memorial carry out its mission of Building a Healthier Community. Some community screenings that are conducted on the van and in the community are: Blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose and stroke screenings.  Key aspects of care for those needing immunizations include assessment of the individuals immunization history, administration of needed vaccines, education about the vaccine and possible side effects, directions as to when the individual needs to return for additional immunizations and what to do in case of an adverse reaction to a vaccine.  Those receiving health assessments are informed of the result of the screening with an explanation of what the result means.  They are given education as appropriate, based on the screening result.  Referral is made to other health care providers as needed.  The community receiving this service are individuals who may not ever see a healthcare physician or get the needed immunizations. All immunizations administered on the Van are entered into the statewide immunization registry so wherever they move their record will follow them.  The Foundation continues to support this program by purchasing needed equipment and supplies to serve the community and continue this program.

It is a joy to see how MHGF touches lives day-to-day.  From children learning the dangers of texting & driving to women getting funding assistance related to Breast Cancer Imaging and Diagnostics.  It's no surprise why this Foundation should be rated as one of the best on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.  
American Family Association Inc	271535		/users/profile/360394	Writer	Donor	5	11/09/2015	I love the AFA, clearly they stand for truth and the love of Jesus in and age where that isn't always accepted.  Praise God for the AFA and the ppl who work there
American Family Association Inc	241196		/users/profile/327536	Jason424	Donor	2	04/15/2015	Unlike the other reviewers who gave this organization a negative rating, I greatly respect the AFA's mission.  I have contributed to the AFA many times in the past, and often participate in their "Action Alerts." So, what's my beef with them?  They are terrible with customer relations, and sometimes inconsistent in their views.  In the past, I wrote them a couple of letters (which asked for a response), but they never responded.  Eventually, I told them point-blank in a letter that I was a contributor who wasn't receiving any responses from them, and that if they didn't respond to my final letter, I would stop contributing.  Guess whatno response.  So, I never contributed to them again, even though I believe in their mission.  Don't ever try to e-mail them either, because you'll rarely get a response.   I was also stunned when Don Wildmon endorsed Newt Gingrich for President in 2012.  Gingrich is a serial adulterer, and according to the Bible, his current marriage is not a real one but an adulterous one.   His stance on pro-life issues has been questionable in certain ways as well.  For Wildmon to endorse Gingrich was shocking and outrageous.   In a nutshell, the AFA does a lot of good things, but I would recommend never trying to contact them for anything and never contributing to them, because they seem to be terrible stewards of what God has given them.  I forgive them, but I refuse to deal with them anymore, because it feels kind of like casting pearls before swine.  There are many other responsible Christian organizations out there who are far more deserving of your contributions.  
American Family Association Inc	225140	2	/users/profile/288915	Dharma Monkey	General Member of the Public	1	10/22/2014	Betrays the word "charity" in every sense of the word. AFA is counter-productive to human welfare both to the groups that it victimizes and its own members. They would be entertaining if they weren't so damaging to people. They have truly earned their status as a hate group, as labeled by the FBI partner SPLC. 
American Family Association Inc	214205	3	/users/profile/277454	archangel2014	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2014	American Family Association promotes Biblical values that not all people agree with. That does not make them a "hate" organization. From a Christian point of view, AFA does a tremendous amount of good work.  They host inspirational music, prayer, feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, curing the sick, and promoting the love of Jesus. The ones who say that AFA is intolerant are the most intolerant people and organizations out there. They are only tolerant if you agree with them, but because AFA doesn't, even though everything they do is in Christian love and not done in a cruel fashion, they are called "haters", "intolerant", "evil", when in actuality, it's just the opposite. 
American Family Association Inc	187935	1	/users/profile/245106	bygracealone	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2013	i disagree strongly with the negative reviews received by AFA.  Have these folks taken the time to read the magazine ? If they are regular readers they would see the true heart beat of this organization which is to present Christ without compromise in a way that glorifies Him, which puts loving God and loving others a priority. Not a hate group in any regard! It has been a very helpful resource for me and I pass the magazines to my daughter when I finish them.
American Family Association Inc	150650	3	/users/profile/200893	Taylor6	General Member of the Public	1	03/07/2013	As a Christian, I will say that the AFA are NOT good ones. All they do is promote intolerance against LGBT people and liberals, it seems.
American Family Association Inc	146569	1	/users/profile/193505	Jeffrey Miller	General Member of the Public	5	12/13/2012	The truth about the AFA has nothing to do with hate, but with the love of Jesus, who is quoted in the Bible as saying, "Go your way and sin no more." Love and compassion require us to tell the truth about sin. The AFA is an organization of amazing resolve to hold fast to God's plan for a better way to live.
American Family Association Inc	127852	1	/users/profile/172966	rbm190	Client Served	5	10/23/2012	The AFA has been INSPIRING  on everything from family issues, work ethics, faith, and american political issues.  Indeed, many times I have been down and had a negative outlook and listening to them has brightened my outlook. They are FAR from being any hate group. Issues were I maybe had hate they helped me to see LOVE. They promote biblical truth, family growth, and love of country. 
American Family Association Inc	125632	8	/users/profile/170863	Taylor4	Donor	1	10/16/2012	Clearly a hate group NOT promoting Jesus' teachings of acceptance and compassion but creating fear, division and exclusivity.  The fact that they stopped over 200 schools from participating in a anti-bully campaign is beyond any type of Christian I know or respect.  If they can influence schools with their religious rhetoric then their tax exempt status should not exist.

Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	278216		/users/profile/368134	Writer	General Member of the Public	4	01/28/2016	Visited ARF today to take some dontations given by community members.  These people work so hard.  Did a walk through and came to appreciate what it takes to do this kind of work.  I saw very few dog that were sick or looked bad.  The one that I did see that was thin and bruised was a dog recently left at the shelter over night. I saw healthy happy puppies. Clean and playful.  The staff was very friendly. Both the Director and her husband were on site and both were engaging with the staff and the dogs.  They showed me their adoption records for the past year. Hundreds of dogs and cats adopted.  The cat room was clean and those cats are having so much fun!   No, it's not perfect. How could it be?  But I was so glad to see that these dogs and cats had hope for a better future.  
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	275944	3	/users/profile/365629	fatlouiecat	Client Served	1	01/07/2016	I visited ARF a few months ago in hopes of adopting a companion animal and was blown away by the deplorable, filthy conditions and the incompetent staff. I usually don't write reviews, but I felt the need to do some internet research on ARF after witnessing animals in such horrendous conditions.  I am totally shocked that this place has a single good review, and that local law enforcement/HSUS hasn't shut this place down already. ARF is located in a metal-roofed, light industrial building off Mayes St. in Jackson. The first thing I noticed was the stench of urine and feces, which was so powerful I couldn't get the smell out of my hair and skin after a shower. When I asked a staff member to show me around, he silently led me through the warehouse portion of the shelter, which consisted of several rows of metal cages. As we walked, I noticed the leaking metal roof and the recessed trench running the length of the caged rows. Apparently this trench is used as a rudimentary plumbing system. I witnessed ARF employees hosing out OCCUPIED cages caked in feces, allowing the sewage to run into the trench between my feet. When I asked the employee about specific animals, he just shrugged and said he didn't know their names or histories, but he was keen on telling me which ones I shouldn't adopt. That's right. He told me I shouldn't adopt multiple animals from the shelter. I asked about one dog in particular, a blue and white pitty, who was being "treated" for heart worms at the time. The employee said, "You don't want him, he gonna die soon." Shortly after, the employee introduced me to his boss, Elizabeth, who had just arrived and seemed to be well informed about all the goings-on around the shelter. She walked me around the warehouse again, introducing me to dogs and telling their stories. It was an immediate red flag to see dogs with mange, matted fur, open wounds, etc. who had been living in the shelter for up to ten years!! Those dogs looked like they needed to be rescued from the rescue fund. ARF is blatantly at capacity, bordering on animal hoarding and after inspecting living conditions, appears to be misusing funds. The cat portion of the "shelter" is even worse. The cats all look sluggish and diseased with ooze dripping from their nose and eyes, matted or balding, and flea ridden. All the animals in this shelter look like they need to be rescued.This whole thing stinks, literally. Somebody needs to do some investigating around Elizabeth and her Animal "Rescue" Fund.
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	160871		/users/profile/213280	Itsamiracle	Donor	5	06/17/2013	What a wonderful organization!!! ARF is such a special place-  It has been such a treat to watch them grow from a grass roots organization born out of the director, Elizabeth Jackson's love, and dedication to animals after hurricane Katrina displaced and left so many abandoned animals in the Jackson metro area after the storm to the wonderful inner city shelter it is today.  .  She has taken ARF from a dream to one of the most amazing no kill shelters in the state of Mississippi!! ARF is such a well run, top notch facility where the animals are loved and  well cared for.  Kudos to Mr and Mrs Jackson for all the sacrifices they make in their lives so that so many animals can have a better life!!!  
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	160822		/users/profile/213220	tico11	Donor	5	06/17/2013	I learned about ARF of MS last year and have enjoyed following them and their stories.  I am an avid animal lover and love reading all of their success stories.  I live out of state but feel close and connected to them through the common bond of animal care.  Even though I've seen and worked with many other shelters, in several different states, they stand out to me. Their care and concern for the welfare of ALL animals is genuine and their organization is unique. Whenever I am able I love being able to donate what I can and help them.  I can't wait until I can come visit them one day!
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	160818		/users/profile/213219	Rusty Fawcett	Client Served	5	06/17/2013	My husband and I have adopted two dogs from this wonderful shelter.  The staff has a knack for finding the right animal for the right home.  Within only 2 hours our first dog had already made himself at home and found his favorite spots in the house.  We were so happy with our first adoption we decided to give a second dog a home and have never regretted out decision.  We continue to support this shelter whenever we can and need to do more.  It's heartwarming to have a no kill shelter in the area helping animals that are thrown away like nothing more than trash.
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	160817		/users/profile/213223	catcrazy	Volunteer	5	06/17/2013	I have volunteered for ARF for over 5 years and have had a great experience there. They help as many animals as they can, and people don't realize how much pressure is put on them to help ALL of them. They do their best, and it really shows. I adopted my dog from them, and I can't imagine where he would be now if it wasn't for them. This is a great organization that needs more volunteers and donations to help the animals. 
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	160813		/users/profile/213215	NewDog	Board Member	5	06/17/2013	I had the honor of giving two tours at the new ARF facility yesterday. I didn't call ahead, didn't give any warning. Just showed up with friends. I do volunteer there one day a week and am very proud of the new facility. Yesterday, these two families were very impressed and pleased with all they saw. ARF has grown in many ways. Adoption rates have doubled, volunteers are there daily, attitudes are good all the way around.  This is a tough business. The stories are sad, the funds are low, the moral however is high at ARF. All are welcome to visit, volunteer and adopt. You will be greeted by people who genuinely want to be there and expect no personal gain or recognition. Just good folks wanting to do good for the animals. Glad to be a part of this organization.
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	158205	9	/users/profile/209879	olddog1	Volunteer	1	05/18/2013	I volunteered for this organization for over 2 years. when i started, people started to warn me about their director Elizabeth Pippa Jackson. These were people that called her their friend and workers there as well. They told me she misused funds and was mean as a snake. I foolishly did not believe it because she charmed me. After being there a few months, I first hand witnessed them using grants and donations for things other than what they were intended. They would lie to the public to get support and trick people into donating money. Their rescue was a hell hole for animals on Rankin County. They were kicked out of Rankin County for good reason. They were hoarding animals. The director never visited the shelter. They hired drug addicts and people with criminal histories hoping they would be loyal and keep their mouth shut. Many of the animals were not spayed so they reproduced. They did not vet the animals. Several died of heat strokes cause there was no shelter from the heat and sun and rain.  The vets they used would all say that their dogs were eat up with worms and diseases. They never treated a single animal for heartworms, and did not warn adopters of that. So most  had deadly heartworms. The kennels were so overcrowded the animals would get in fights real often. Many got terrible wounds. Some were disabled. Some had eyes missing, even some with missing limbs from fighting. The main caregiver at the shelter kicked and abused the dogs.  They often ran out of food and did not provide clean water. They won a grant to build a cat building. Instead of using the money for that, they just put an old trailer, like from the back of an 18 wheeler, and put cats in it. The cats all had diseases, watery eyes, coughing, not worth adopting. There was no vents. Litter never cleaned. The dog kennels were caked in a mix of mud pee and poop. They were all outside with no cover over them so every time it rained it made more mud. The dogs never got walks or baths. Then that Pippa woman would drive volunteers away on droves. She is a psycho b***h. She calls an haraases people, threatens them, posts all kinds of crazy, mean posts on her facebook page. If you dared question her, she would tell lies about you to get other people to hate you. Even her closest allys will tell you she is a mean grinch. She does not care about the animals. She does it for attention. The only people who care are the volunteers. and they all end up leaving cause of her. They wont even let people in their house cause they horde animal there as well. There neighbors would often tell us about how the dogs howled all night and that they had destroyed the inside of home. So they jsut waited for her mom to die and moved in her house and left the dogs in the old house. There was a very suspicious fire at their old house while dogs and cats were in it. Insurance would not even pay for it and is still investigating it. she used that to beg for money again and used it on herself, not the animals or repairs. They also owe over 15 vets in town 100,000 or more total. They find a new vet and run up a bunch of bills then leave and never pay them. She has been arrested for bad checks and not paying bills. Check her record. she also got arrested in rankin county for dumping a dog at somebody's house an would not come get it. she tells people she was arrested for not rescuing an animal. The don't even make sense. She is also an alcoholic and uses drugs. She gets drunk every night and gets on websites posting threats and talking bad about people. She abuses her husband. I wish I had never met her. I stayed for the animals. Then she started real bad rumors about a bunch of us to get us to leave. she knew we were leading an investigation and documenting things. That is when she started lying to the public about why she had to leave Rankin County. She has some powerful friends so she gets away with things. They threaten and bully people, send anonymous letters, have fake lawyers send letters. When ARF is in contests, they also pay for votes. They tried to accuse another shelter of doing this when they were. They paid for votes for themselves and the other shelter. Then they reported the other place to try and get them kicked out of contest. Pippa has lots of supporters. It is bc they never went to her old shelter or they would not be loving her. They have anew place in jackson now. it is a big plae with no air or heat. they had to give all the dogs and cats shots, baths and flea and tick meds when they got there cause they had never kept records at the old place and had no idea which ones had gotten them. Many never had. Still do not prevent heartworms. they even had people checkin of the dogs were spayed cause they did not know whoch ones were not. Awful.After you adopt they charge you $120 and say you have to take dog to get fixed and they pay for it. But when you call to get it done, they dodge the calls. They will scream and holler at people for not fixing their pets but do not even do it to their own adoptions.  they also say that money covers shots but half the time don't give them. and they tell you to call back for rest of shots, then never give them. lots of adopters will tell you that. They have had parvo at the old and new shelter so many times bc they do not give shots. they don't even post about it most of time cause they do not want people to know. all there dogs have invisible hookworms which causes bloody poop. Pippa steals dogs too. there is video on youtube. charles is mean too. that is her husband. he cusses at people. If you give them money you are supporting animal abuse and neglect. They have been investigated by human society. Still are i think. And other places are looking into them to cause I keep getting calls. So i decided i need post this so people know. it is time to shut em down.

Their facility is simple and spotless. Volunteers are inspired by the founder to show love and compassion to any and all God's creatures. Using a "no-kill" shelter philosophy, they turn none away and always find ways to mend broken bodies and treat painful memories. This group deserves our support!
Animal Rescue Fund Of Mississippi	126766		/users/profile/171766	pippa	Board Member	5	10/17/2012	I am the founder and director of this organization. The org is responsible for rescue, rehabilitation and adoption of multitudes of animals from the southeastern united states.   We take in the animals that others reject and look away from whilst traveling down the road of life.   We give a chance to those others would ignore.  We take on their cause and give them a voice.  Currently, we are re-writing our business plan and relocating to a location to provide our residents a more accessible option for the public to come and consider them in their lives.  WE are a positive opportunity for homeless animals within our community.

If you are of like mind and you want to contribute to the Kingdom of God then you will be blessed by any time, money, work, even prayer given to the Mission at the Cross.

I am so thankful to the men and women who work and serve at the Mission at the Cross. But most of all I am exceedingly thankful to the men who live at the Mission at the Cross.
Mission at the Cross	248942	1	/users/profile/336745	LastChance	Volunteer	5	07/20/2015	Mission At The Cross in Laurel, Mississippi is an incredible Christian ministry dedicated to helping men of addiction recover from the addiction they are facing and hopefully come to know Christ in the process. The Mission operates on donations from individuals, churches, businesses and individuals and doesn't charge the men who are residents anything for the services they receive. The six month residential program provides men a safe place to reside, three meals a day, clothing, vocational training and Christian guidance at no charge to the residents. Over 700 men have called Mission At The Cross "home" at some point in their lives since the Mission opened in December of 2008. This ministry is changing lives and helping men beat addictions! Please consider helping Mission At The Cross with your financial contribution or a donation of goods and services when you are making your donation decisions. It's a life saving ministry!

When I came to the mission I had no money, no food, my family had given up on me, and I was at rock bottom because of my drug  addiction. While I went through the program, God began to deal with my heart and I accepted Jesus into to my life! Through the power of God and the stability and opportunity that the mission has to offer, I have peace and restoration with my family, a joy and peace that cannot be described and hope for the future of my life. All of my needs: food,water,clothes,hygiene,etc., have been have provided for during my eight months, and nothing asked in return except to keep moving forward and to always keep God first. After the first six months, I was given an apartment on the third floor of the mission and they gave me job working for Headrick's T-Shirt Shop. I thank God for Mission at the Cross and for Mr. Richard and Mrs. Gina Headrick , the founders of Mission at the Cross, for their love and obedience to God's will. Because of God and them and many others who pour their hearts and lives into guys like me, I have hope and future!

Mission at the Cross	248741	3	/users/profile/336505	arachne77345	General Member of the Public	5	07/17/2015	I was skeptical when we we toured the mission at the cross. "How could a motorcycle shop and apartments help heal addicts?" What I saw and felt when I met the young man who shared some of his story was equal parts uplifting and heart wrenching. God heals, but this is a safe place to work, to cleanse, feed and rest the body while the soul is is healed and the mind cleared. When these young men leave they know a trade, they know a better life and best- they know God. The lives ahead of them is so wonderful there could be no question of turning back.Mission at the cross is the real deal.

Hundreds of men have been helped in beginning a new life and contributing back to the community and many have regained what they had lost, such as self respect and even their families. Most importantly, the Mission presents hope from a Biblical perspective and many find God and His plan for them. I always encourage everyone I can to go by the  Mission and meet the men and especially the Director, Mike Shirley and House Leader Roger Tucker. These leaders really care about the ones who come through the  doors and go the second mile in presenting Jesus to them. God bless The Mission At The Cross!

Mission at the Cross	248590	3	/users/profile/336333	ga4ever	Client Served	5	07/15/2015	Hello , my name is David Edwards , and I'd like to start by saying that my testimony can be read on the Mission at the Cross web site ! Mission at the Cross is most definitely a place that can help any man , young or old , come in out of the storms of life and be in a stable environment to be able to get their head , heart , and soul cleaned and cleared of all the junk , mess , and filth that's out in the world . It's a faith based mission , and you will hear the word of God spoken and taught there on a daily basis ! If you're in need of a place to help you with an addiction , or circumstances in life have caused you to be homeless , Mission at the Cross can help you ! But you have to have a willingness to change ! I myself stayed there for nearly three (3) years , and my life has been a thousand percent better because of it ! No , the Mission didn't save my life , but it sure was instrumental in helping me become the person I am today ! God used the Mission , and those that run it , to give me the time and resources necessary to get clean and sober , and to grow into the Christian man I am today ! From the moment I walked into the place on September 12th , 2011 I just knew God had His hand on that place ! And to experience the growth of the place and certain events there , there's no way anybody could ever convince me other wise , but God is most definitely a huge part of Mission at the Cross in Laurel , Mississippi ! It's truly a wonderful thing to have had a place to go to in my darkest hours , and without the constant and continuous support from area churches and individuals in the community , there never would be a place such as Mission at the Cross ! So , if you haven't already helped out in some way by supporting the mission , then I strongly encourage you to do so ! The mission couldn't function without the support it receives ! I have remained , and will always remain greatful to those who give and have given !   
Boys & Girls Clubs of the Mississippi Delta	157916	2	/users/profile/209446	Robert86	Volunteer	5	05/15/2013	I interned with the Boys and Girls Clubs of the Mississippi Delta in 2011.  I was able to learn so much from Mr. Deming, his staff, and the fantastic volunteers.  Most of the clubs are open after school from 3 to 7 PM and during the summer months from 8 am to 5 PM, Monday through Friday.  Their staff members are trained youth development professionals who provide a safe and positive place for kids to learn and grow.  Activity fees are kept low to ensure that all children will have access to our club site.  The annual activity fee for each child is just $25!  Everyone works very hard to keep the clubs in the delta open; to keep our children in school and becoming great responsible people with a dynamic future.  I was so impressed with my experience that I continued to volunteer as a Pro Bon Consultant for the organization.  My next step was to help the advisory committees as much as I could with research on how best to raise funds.  Well, Im still conducting research and now Im training boards on the best fundraising practices.  Also, I knew that we need to establish a club in my home town of Tchula.  Our Proposed Tchula Boys and Girls Club Steering Committee are now raising funds for our own club in 2013.

Their transparency and accountability were not only attractive, but refreshing.  They welcomed us with open arms and gave us access to the data we needed.  Although we have only been working with the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Mississippi Delta for less than six months, we are continuously impressed with the phenomenal organization this group consistently demonstrates  from Jeremy Deming (their Chief Professional Officer) to Stacye Allen, Sam Baker, Mamie Watkins, and Deloris Davis on down. And while some organizations sacrifice passion and friendliness for efficiency, this is decidedly not the case with the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Mississippi Delta.

The children soaked up information like a sponge and even created a music video during my time there.  The staff were competent, professional and caring.  Their desire to be right there with the children everyday was evident and spoke volumes about their character.  Specifically, Mr. Deming welcomed me as a volunteer and his director of the club, Ms. Stacye Allen, ensured that every resource was made available to me to conduct the workshops I sponsored.

Within half a month, the organization has already reaped significant benefits of having a non-polarizing figure who has spearheaded different aspects of the non-profit such as fundraising, community outreach, and of course animal rescue.  The Madison Ark has always been a reputable organization with an obvious passion for animals, yet the new director has instilled new progressive qualities that, frankly, the previous director never broached.

Most people would totally Old Yeller some of these dogs, but she loves them and nurses them back to health; with seemingly no concern for herself. Seriously...she takes care of the dogs before taking care of herself; without makeup, let's just say it's impressive. But I digress...If you have a dog that the old mean conservative in you would rather have put down, or some knuckle head in Jackson has been pulling a Michael Vick with them, take the poor unloved dog to Madison Ark. Those suckers will be loved and taken care of.  
Madison Ark	221519	2	/users/profile/285203	TherealBurrus	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	Now that Madison Ark has new management this rescue could not be any better. It is very refreshing to see someone in charge who is transparent and caring. I look forward to new positive experiences with Madison ARK. Just so there is no confusion, I am the real Burrus. 
Madison Ark	221505	1	/users/profile/285196	Glorya G.	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	Madison Ark is a wonderful group that needs your support. They have a new director in place, who is wonderful and if given the chance, would love to show you just how much she honestly loves and cares for all breeds of pets. All Rescues have certain rules for their adoptions that have to be followed and I know many people have put ARK down in the past for being so strict on these rules, also. Rules are part of adopting from a Rescue like ARK. Please give this group a chance. You will find the most wonderful pets there and remember these pets have been in foster homes with families.  Thanks, Glorya

They have really turned things around and I'm excited to work with them! They save so many animals..I am so grateful to have them in the community!

Madison Ark	195226		/users/profile/255173	BRHamil	Volunteer	1	03/05/2014	Unfortunately this organization is not properly run. The organization consists of a paid director, Ms. H. Koller, and a board member, H. Corbin, President who also acts as the accountant. There are two other board members 'on paper' but they  have had nothing to do with the organization the entire time I was a volunteer. Meetings are not conducted, there is no accountability.  The in-fighting and the nasty childish bickering is staggering. The way volunteers are treated - even the vulgar name calling is astonishing.  I witnessed too many actions that were at best, questionable, and I have since found out there is reason to suspect, highly illegal activities were also being conducted. I doubt a single volunteer would remain if they knew what went on behind closed doors at this so called 'rescue'. There is a valid reason they were kicked out of the building they once occupied as the City they operate in is currently investigating them for fraud and illegal activities.  I worry about the poor innocent animals and can only hope that they are sent elsewhere and out of the danger they are in while in the care of these people. I can not recommend this organization. There are other local animal rescues that are transparent and drama free. Simply look at the other shelters and you can tell the difference between dishonest people focused on self gain and those who are really taking care of the animals.  Do not waste your time here, there are places that need your help; you'd be better off helping another shelter.  
The Animal Rescue League	61299		/users/profile/66904	HGreen	General Member of the Public	5	01/27/2011	The Animal Rescue League in Laurel has been operating for years providing a much-needed service both to our community and of course, to some precious and needy homeless animals.  The shelter volunteers and staff are professional and caring and extremely dedicated to these animals.    The ARL has provided this important work on a shoe-string budget for many years and are in need and are quite deserving of financial assistance from your organization.  I hope they will be considered for funding.
The Animal Rescue League	61297		/users/profile/66900	Sunny	General Member of the Public	5	01/27/2011	I have not only donated to this organization, but have dealt directly with it's board members and volunteers. Hands down they have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help me find homes for at least 3 lost souls. I have never been turned away or brushed off. The members take the time to really reserch problems and find solutions.

The Animal Rescue League	61126		/users/profile/66691	colleen	Donor	5	01/26/2011	I have adopted several pets from the Animal Rescue League, and I have supported the organization for many years.  The staff, board & volunteers do a fantastic job of caring for the needs of the animals.  Most of all, they love these animals.  They can make a dollar stretch farther than you could ever imagine.  You can give to the ARL and KNOW that your money is invested in the lives of these animals - sometimes for their entire lifetime (as they are a no-kill shelter.)  
The Animal Rescue League	61121		/users/profile/66686	pam5755	Volunteer	5	01/26/2011	I've been a volunteer at the Animal Rescue Legue (ARL) since 1992. I love the work they do for our community.  They house approx. 100 dogs & cats on any given day, and they are a "no-kill" shelter.  ARL was chartered in 1986 for the prevention of cruelty & education to the public to the plight of animals.  The staff is a caring and dedicated group of folks that work 7 days a week to make sure our animals are fed, loved, medically cared for and provided shelter from the elements. They strive hard to find the right loving homes for the right animals.  All animals are spayed/neutered before adoption.  Please consider giving a gift of love. You will be blessed beyond measure.

G E L I Inc	137873		/users/profile/183893	kimbrown	Client Served	5	11/13/2012	I would like to say that I have been very pleased with the GELI program this year.  My daughter is a student in this class so I feel like I have great insight into this program.  I have to admit  that when I placed her here, I felt like she would be very advanced as far as in the education realm, but would benefit from the class in the area of socialization.  She had been taught at home for her entire life and has always been more advanced than others her age.   To my surprise, she has learned so much more in the past 3 1/2 months than I could have ever imagined.  Not only academically, but she has blossomed socially and in other areas of development too.  I have been an educator for 21 years, therefore I feel like I know what to look for when it comes to quality education.  I've also worked with The Early Intervention Programs of Mississippi for almost 18 years so I understand Early Childhood Education as it works hand in hand with both of my jobs.  I feel like the GELI Promise Schools of Monroe County have been the biggest asset to our education system in a long time.  We will definitely see the benefits of this program more and more as these children move through-out our Elementary schools in the near future.   Thank You for this wonderful program!   Sincerely,  Kim R. Brown

My child is part of the GELI school this year in Amory & has learned so much! Each day she comes home, all she talks about is her day at school! The people involved with GELI are absolutely God sent! They are there whenever called upon, no matter what the issue may be! The GELI program is for our area and for the kids to learn and exceed in what life might throw at them! It's a program that is helpful and very enjoyable all wrapped into one!

Veterinarians work with them to heal, against all odds, to give them a chance at a life they have never known. People from all over the country help as much as possible. I have a rescue from there, my sweet loving Cali. I am so happy to have her in my life.
Tunica Humane Society	63121	1	/users/profile/69012	Tunica H.	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	As one of the founding members of the Tunica Humane Society, I can honestly say that our success  has far surpassed my hopes and dreams for this organization.  It is amazing what a few individuals can accomplish when they are truly passionate about what they are doing. We started with nothing, no money, no shelter, no support from our local government.  In just over two years, the Tunica Humane Society has literally transformed our community and how we treat stray and abandoned animals.  We are now a kinder, more humane community and for that I am extremely proud. The Tunica Humane Society treats every animal the same, one is no more special than the next.  All of our animals receive quality medical care and every animal that comes into our care gets a second chance at life.  We aggressively rehabilitate our animals and we aggressively seek quality, loving homes for every one of them.  It is devastating to us when we get an animal that we cannot save. I have learned from my experiences of working for the Tunica Humane Society that you should never be afraid to ask for help.  The worst that can happen is that you will come up against indifference.  And for those hardened individuals, I feel extremely sorry.  Because helping someone that cannot help themselves or speak for themselves is one of the most rewarding gifts in life.  Whether if be man or animal.  God intends for us to care for others and that is what the Tunica Humane Society is all about.

Southern Pines Animal Shelter	38332	1	/users/profile/39216	rosesquaw	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	I've been volunteering at the shelter for about a year now and I really enjoy working there. The staff are nice and take the time to connect with you and explain to you what help they need done. I also enjoy how there are more opportunties to volunteer than just at the shelter. There is the spay/neuter clinc and fundraising events. A few months ago, I showed my shelter pride by helping them out in a fairy tale themed parade. I've volunteered in other places, but I continue volunteering at the Shelter because the people there make me feel like I am one of their own.
Southern Pines Animal Shelter	38325	2	/users/profile/39211	donnadavis	Volunteer	4	05/08/2010	I have volunteered at the Southern Pines Animal Shelter for several years in a variety of roles. I started by assisting with the shelter's animal adoption program at our local PetSmart.  I then began working along with other volunteers at the SPAS  low-cost spay/neuter service program.  We started with a two day per month cooperative service through a statewide alliance.  After two years of demonstrating the need and support for such services, SPAS opened a four day per week low-cost spay/neuter clinic.  This successful effort is a clear demonstration of the organization's focus on long-term solutions.  This focus is paired with an absolute committment to providing humane and responsible care for every animal at the shelter.
Southern Pines Animal Shelter	38251	3	/users/profile/39143	dr-lin-harper	Board Member	4	05/07/2010	I have always been interested in the plight of lost, abandoned, and surrendered companion animals. I was a long-time donor to Southern Pines Animal Shelter before I began to be active on the Advisory Committee and, later, the Board of Directors, where I serve now as Treasurer. SPAS has undergone significant transformation from an under-funded holding facility with bad conditions for the animals to a clean, bright and large facility where there is hope for those animals who come into our care.In the past few years, we have enlisted community support, such as PetSmart where we are an adoption partner and keep cats and kittens in their store for adoption. We have many community businesses who donate money and services, including some on our Board of Directors.In 2008, I led the Board on a strategic planning session, the first ever for this group.  Out of that planning, we have grown our budget, our funding, our donor list, our contact with the community, and,most importantly, we opened a low-cost, high quality Spay & Neuter Clinic during Summer 2009. We recognize that the only way to effectively reduce the euthanasia rates is to address the issue of companion animal over-population.Our Shelter is still under-funded and under-staffed. We continue to build our donor base and have a plan to address and expand our municipal support base. The Board of Directors is active, committed, and engaged. Our two programs, Shelter & Spay/Neuter Clinic have operations managers who are excellent at their jobs. We are currently working to hire an Executive Director who will oversee both programs and work primarily on funding issues.

The shelter (if you ant to call it a shelter) is not air-conditioned or heated and is in very poor condition where the animals struggle with severe weather conditions of extreme heat and cold.  These women spend countless hours to rescue the dogs, find suitable foster homes, clean the shelter, bring blankets and towels to the shelter, provide medical care with either donations or out of their own pocket, and then work with shelters in other states who can hopefully help them to place some of these sweet animals in permanent homes.  The volunteers of Animal Relief & Rescue Fellowship work tirelessly to help these forgotten animals who would otherwise suffer and die. I have worked with them to foster some of their dogs and also adopted a few of their sweet dogs who are now part of our family and who bring us much joy. ARRF of Leland, MS, was thorough and forthright and provided all pertinent information as best they could about the dogs transported to our area and through their dedication and love for these sweet and innocent dogs, many families

French Camp Academy	2854	14	/users/profile/4502	Suzanne	Client Served	5	02/25/2009	I was a student at French Camp Academy from 1972-1977, starting at age 12.  Coming from a home environment where there was too little supervision and very little discipline, FCA provided a safe, nurturing environment, with much needed structure.  Among the many problems my family faced, two of my older brothers had already quit school before my move to FCA, and I had plans to quit after the seventh grade.  By God's grace, I was offered the opportunity to go to this wonderful school.  I made it to graduation, and even though I did not have the opportunity to complete a college education immediately following my high school years, I did eventually get a BA.  French Camp Academy has had a life-long impact on every area of my life.  I still feel a strong attachment to the school and the surrounding community, and visit as often as possible.  Since many FCA students come from backgrounds where the biological family is not a good source for Godly mentorship or financial support following graduation, this is an area where help is needed.  Many young people need help with making the right decisions about higher education and other life issues, as well as financial support during this first phase of being on their own.  This kind of intervention could broaden the options students have and deter some potentially life-lasting effects from wrong choices made when options are few.  My deepest personal gratitude to any of you reading this who have been supporters of French Camp Academy during my time as a student thereAnd my wholehearted encouragement to anyone considering support in the future.

East Mississippi Animal Rescue Inc	67173	3	/users/profile/73415	twhite38869	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I've always been an animal lover, but it wasn't until I became a volunteer with Lauderdale County Humane Society that I truly understood the importance of spay/neuter. It was also the first time I personally faced what happens when people abuse, neglect and abandon their animals. It was a hard education, but one I am so glad I learned. This organization does a great job of rescuing, fostering, vetting and re-homing animals, and equally important, they do a great job of educating the community about what it means to be a responsible pet owner. They have given me a great education; they have given me an incredible opportunity to volunteer; and they have given me the chance to adopt some very precious, special four-legged children. I have moved away from the area, but I will never lose touch with the folks who make what is now known as East Mississippi Animal Rescue the awesome organization it is. I am blessed to call them friends. 
Extra Table Inc	286668		/users/profile/376738	Stacy_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	You think you know what the 'face of hunger' looks like...but you don't. I consider myself beyond fortunate to live the live I live and to work with the organization that I am a part of. As a first generation child in America, born the immigrant parents from Nigeria, there are a million ways that my life story could have played out. By the grace of something more powerful than me, my parents have lived full, successful lives in the United States and my two older sisters grew up with a roof over our heads, food to eat every day and the opportunity to build a good live for ourselves. But not everyone, no matter where they were born, is as fortunate.A year and a half ago, (June, 2014) while ending a short term contract as a consultant for a U.S. Senator's re-election campaign, I was turned onto an organization in my hometown of Hattiesburg, MS because they had a new vacant position. The organization, Extra Table, was a non-profit started by a local restauranteur and had the mission of feeding the hungry in Mississippi by getting new, healthy food in bulk to food pantries and soup kitchens. I applied for the position and interviewed, not knowing if I would be the right fit, but knowing in my heart that I had the 'Type A' personality skill set that could help Extra Table get organized and hopefully be more effective. As most fairy tales go, I interview twice and got a call an hour after the second interview offering me the job as Program Coordinator. Fast forward November 14, 2015. Extra Table was hosting its 3rd Annual Hattiesburg Hunger Run, a 5k, 10k and 1 mile Fun Run around Downtown Hattiesburg to help raise money for Extra Table. After the race, we hosted an after party for all of the runner to eat, drink enjoy some music and hopefully learn more about what Extra Table is doing in their area. While chatting with some of our volunteers and passing out plates of BBQ to runners, an older man, meek in appearance and timid to approach, walked up and asked if I worked with the group putting on the event. I told him that indeed I did. The gentleman smile lightly and proceeded to tell me a story, full of the very stuff that Extra Table was born out of. He told me his truth:He was an AIDS patient. He had just recently moved to the Hattiesburg area and he was a client who received a monthly food box at our local food pantry and often partook of hot meals at our local soup kitchen. For the first time in 10 years, he was not homeless. He had secured an apartment of his own, just a few blocks from where the Race was being held. He just happened to be walking by and saw that everyone was having such a great time. When he asked a volunteer what the event was for, he was told about Extra Table and our mission. He didn't ask for money. He didn't ask for food. He didn't come to criticize or take advantage or even offer a suggestion. He found me to thank me. He said he knew what good work we must be doing, especially since everyone was having such a good time, and he just had to say thank you. I am but a small part of the much larger mission that is Extra Table, but my heart has become so embraced by countless stories like this one. I work for Extra Table with absolute joy and I fight on behalf of those who have been too weak, too scared, too ashamed, too outcast, too small and too neglected to be provided the basic need of a little food in their belly so that they can make it another day. I say all of this, not to say that I inspire myself, but to say that this man and the 670,000 hungry in Mississippi that he represents inspire me to give, to work, and to be better through Extra Table.

I have worked with and for parent aid for about 20 years, why because my time is not wasted. I have watched families & children go thru the program to the point that I was really proud of them. Specific example; watched one family (parents& 2 children) after our work with them want to give back.  At our big WE-Care Banquet they go up before about 400 people and tell their story and thank P-A. There were lots of tears. This is just one example, their are many more to share.Why after 20 years am I still working with them, well I could not find a better organization to spend the next 20 years with.

At the time of their birth, I felt so alone because I didn't know of anyone who had experienced an extreme premature birth. I looked online, but there wasn't much information on children born as early as mine were.  A year and a half later, I met Keira.  I was touched by her story and what all she went through with her daughters' premature birth and Zoe's untimely passing. I was amazed at how determined she and her husband were to help other families who had a micro-preemie or had lost a child.  The Zoe Rose Memorial Foundation is a great foundation to help other families who have had a child born before 32 weeks gestation. They have so many ideas to help others that are starting to come to fruition. I know that the Zoe Rose Memorial Foundation will do great tings and help so many people.

Southaven Chamber Of Commerce	211911		/users/profile/254435	Dpratt	Board Member	1	08/22/2014	Below states the problems...but not all!!IIN THE CHANCERY COURT OF DESOTO COUNTY, MISSISSIPPIDENISE PRATTPETITIONER CAUSE NO.:______________________!VS.!SOUTHAVEN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, JEFF FIELD, JAMES HUFFMAN, RYAN ENGLAND, DAVID DELGADO, PETER FELSENTHAL, BLAKE WEAVER and CARMEN KYLERESPONDENTS! !PETITION FOR CALLING OF MEETING, INSPECTION AND ACCOUNTING, REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS AND/OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, DISSOLUTION OF NON-PROFIT CORPORATIONCOMES NOW, the Petitioner, Denise Pratt, by and through undersigned counsel and pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated Sections 79-11-131, 249, 289 and 355, and files this, her Petition for Calling of Meeting, Inspection and Accounting, Removal of Directors and/or, in the alternative, Dissolution of Non-Profit Corporation against Respondents, Southaven Chamber of Commerce, Jeff Field, James Huffman, Ryan England, David Delgado, Peter Felsenthal, Blake Weaver and Carmen Kyle, and would show unto this Court as follows: The Chamber bylaws state that the Board of Directors shall consist of 14 members, composed as follows:![T]he Executive Director, one member appointed to a one year term and 12 elected Members. Four (4) members shall be elected annually for a three-year term or until their successors are elected and have qualified. Each director shall be eligible to serve no more than two (2) consecutive three-year terms. A period of one year must elapse before eligibility is restored. This section shall not limit any person filling an appointed position or serving on the board by reason of being Past President. If the Presidents elected term expires at the time they assume the position of Past-President, they shall remain on the Board for one year with full voting privileges. ! The Executive Director shall be an ex-officio, non-voting member of the Board of Directors. ! The new President shall annually appoint one (1) additional Director to serve on the Board with full rights, powers and responsibilities as though elected. If the term of the Past President is expiring, the new president shall appoint them to the one-year term. See Exhibit A, Southaven Chamber of Commerce Bylaws. At present, there are only 11 members of the Board of Directors (hereinafter Board): Executive Director Carmen Kyle, President Jeff Field, Past-President David Delgado, Ryan England, Peter Felsenthal, Jim Green,!3Dr. Vincent Henderson, James Huffman, Todd Mastry, Denise Pratt and Blake Weaver.	Thus, The Chamber is currently operating in violation of its own bylaws.12. Rather than attempt to comply with laws and regulations, the Board, in its meeting ofApril 17, 2013, approved a motion by its President, Defendant Field, to freeze the Board for a period of eighteen (18) months. See Exhibit B, Minutes of Chamber Board Meeting approved May 14, 2013. Such conduct is wholly contradictory to the laws of the State of Mississippi and the bylaws of The Chamber. Unfortunately, the Board, and particularly its President, Defendant Field, has regularly disregarded the concerns of board members regarding the illegal conduct of the Board.	Following the May Board meeting, Petitioner forwarded correspondence to Defendant Field expressing concerns regarding, inter alia, the improper freeze vote and her dissatisfaction with sexist comments made to the Board members in attendance. See Exhibit C, correspondence from Petitioner to Defendant Field dated May 14, 2013. The Board and, particularly, its President, took no action to reply and/or address Petitioners concerns.13. Such disregard is the course of conduct of this Board, as numerous issues regarding thelegality of certain actions, inactions and/or conduct had previously been brought to the attention of the President by a former Board member, Lisa Wade.	Ms. Wade, in correspondence of April 8, 2013, advised of the Boards failure to disseminate certain marketing plans and budgets, failure to submit The Chamber budget in accordance with bylaws, failure to follow rules regarding officers and committees, failure to follow the proper process of using nominating!4committees for Board members, failure to have an annual meeting of membership, Board members skipping meetings not being enforced and failure of the President, Defendant Field, to appoint the annual director. See Exhibit D, email of Ms. Wade dated April 8, 2013, along with related communications. The response to Ms. Wades concerns was to illegally freeze the Board at the next regular meeting.14. No response, board or member discussion has been forthcoming on the various illegalactions expressed by Ms. Wade, or Ms. Pratt. Subsequent to the illegal freeze vote, Ms. Wade resigned. The Board attempted to wrongfully remove Petitioner Pratt during a Board meeting of November 12, 2013, when she was asked to resign and, upon refusal, forced by a Southaven police officer to leave the meeting. Upon investigation of the event, it was learned that, during the Board meeting of September 17, 2013, which Petitioner was unable to attend, several Board members discussed their desire to remove her since the Southaven Board of Alderman did not like the fact that she employed its former mayor, Greg Davis. According to its minutes, members present on September 17th meeting discussed what the proper manner by which to remove a fellow Board member. See Exhibit E, Minutes dated September 17, 2013. Rather than follow a legal procedure to effectuate removal, those members tried to force her resignation in a contemptuous and degrading exhibition of power and ego at the November meeting. The undersigned forwarded correspondence to the Board, via its President, Defendant Field, advising that Petitioner would not resign and must, therefore, be allowed admittance to future meetings.!5See Exhibit F, correspondence dated November 18, 2013, from M. Lee Dulaney to Jeff Field, President of the Southaven Chamber of Commerce. Petitioner was allowed to return and no response to the undersigneds correspondence was ever received.15. Such conduct is typical of that displayed by the current Board and its leader. Petitionerhas continued to demand that the Board comply with its own bylaws and Mississippi law. On February 24, 2014, she advised the Board attorney of inappropriate comments made by the Executive Director, Defendant Kyle, on WREG-TV, as well as the Executive Directors refusal to provide Petitioner a list of members, which is required by Mississippi law. See Exhibit G, correspondence to Rick Duerr. Said correspondence also outlined the exact misconduct discussed in this petition and requested that he bring the matter to the attention of the other Board members for discussion and resolution. Petitioner forwarded her discussion to the entire Board on February 25, 2014. See Exhibit H, correspondence to Board members regarding discussion with Rick Duerr. No response was received and no action taken to rectify the improper activities of the Board. Instead, Petitioner has again been asked to resign, but she refuses.16. Petitioner is left with no option but Court intervention to make this Board of Directorscomply with its own bylaws and existing Mississippi law. The Board has and continues to refuse to comply with its bylaws regarding compilation and make-up, fails to disseminate marketing plans, budgets and other essential information to members, fails to submit annual budgets, fails!6to follow rules and regulations regarding officers and committees, fails to have an annual meeting of membership and fails to take the necessary steps to have a legal Board.17. Further, The Chamber has violated Mississippi Code Annotated Section 79-11-285,Members Right to Inspect and Copy Corporate Records, by refusing to allow Petitioner, a Board member, to inspect and copy the organizations membership list. Said statute provides in pertinent parts as follows:.. .(2) A member is entitled to inspect and copy, at a reasonable time and reasonable location specified by the corporation, any of the following records of the corporation if the member meets the requirements of subsection (3) of this section and gives the corporation written notice of his demand at least five (5) business days before the date on which the member wishes to inspect and copy:.. .!(c) Subject to Section 79-11-291, the membership list.!Petitioner has requested this information numerous times. See Exhibit I, correspondence to Ms. Debbie King, dated February 21, 2014, as well as the follow-up request to the Board attorney previously attached hereto as Exhibit G and the additional request contained within her correspondence to the entire board in Exhibit H.	Petitioner requests this Honorable Court immediately require The Chamber to provide this information, which she is unquestionably entitled to receive as a Board member, and award her the fees and expenses associated with forcing The Chamber to comply with this lawful request.! ! !!718. Notwithstanding the foregoing, several Board members of The Chamber have andcontinue to sit in an illegal capacity. Mississippi Code Annotated Section 79-11-239, Term of Office of Directors, provides as follows:(1) The articles or bylaws must specify the terms of directors. Except for designated or appointed directors, the terms of the directors may not exceed five (5) years. In the absence of any term specified in the articles or bylaws, the term of each director shall be one (1) year. Directors may be elected for successive terms.!The Chambers bylaws limit terms to three (3) years and require election by members for successive terms. Those Board members who are serving in violation of Mississippi law and The Chambers bylaws are Defendants Jeff Field, James Huffman, Ryan England, David Delgado, Peter Felsenthal and Blake Weaver. Also, the current Executive Director, Defendant Kyle, was neither properly elected nor appointed in her capacity as a Board member. Petitioner requests the Court promptly remove these illegal members from The Chambers Board of Directors.19. Petitioner requests this Honorable Court set a preliminary hearing at its earliestconvenience to order a special meeting of The Chambers members pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated Section 79-11-131, which provides:(1) If for any reason it is impractical or impossible for any corporation to call or conduct a meeting of its members, delegates or directors, or otherwise obtain their consent, in the manner prescribed by its articles, bylaws or Section 79-11-101 et seq., then upon petition of a director, officer, delegate, member or the Attorney General, the chancery court of the county where the corporation's principal office (or, if none in this state, its registered office) is located may order that such a meeting be called or that a written ballot or!8!other form of obtaining the vote of members, delegates or directors be authorized in such a manner as the court finds fair and equitable under the circumstances.Petitioner, as a director, prays that the Court will order there be a fair and equitable vote after sufficient information is presented to evaluate the validity of the entire board of directors and how the membership wishes to proceed after being apprised of the issues alleged and referenced herein. The Board has shown a propensity to deny fellow Board members access to the membership list, thereby thwarting the ability to present such matters to the entire Chamber without court intervention. The Board has also shown no regard for conflicts and/or transparency to members concerning such basic matters as substantial expenditures, and cannot be left to call any meeting on its own accord. Specifically, the Board previously refused to present information regarding purchase of property for its relocation to the general membership. It was only after a Point of Order from Petitioner and call to the Mississippi Ethics Commission that the Board withdrew its previous vote of approval. See Exhibit J, Point of Order and correspondence from Defendant Field regarding the Mississippi Ethics Commission dated December 12, 2013. As such, Petitioner would request that the membership list be produced, that there be an immediate accounting of all revenue and expenditures (of particular concern considering the current financial status of The Chamber showing operations at a net loss, as prior to the illegal freeze and hiring of the Defendant Kyle as Executive Director, The Chamber operated with a net profit), a status quo with regard to the Board and any executive positions and/ or staff and, if appropriate, a custodian or other trustee appointed to oversee the procedure necessary to rectify the actions and conduct of this rogue Board.!!920. As alternative relief, Petitioner prays that, should this Honorable Court determine thatThe Chambers Board of Directors has and continues to exceed and/or abuse the authority conferred upon it by law, or its own bylaws, an order should be entered dissolving this organization. Of course, should there be a reasonable alternative to dissolution, Petitioner would withdraw this alternative request for relief.21. Petitioner would request this Honorable Court allow her attorney fees and expensesincurred in the bringing of this action. WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner request this Honorable Court,as soon as practicable, order that a meeting by all members of The Chamber be called, or that a written ballot or other form of obtaining the votes of members, be conducted in a fair and equitable fashion to determine the composition and appropriate conduct of the current Board of Directors, committees and/or staff, that an accounting be conducted concerning revenue and expenditures of this illegal Board, an order directing that Petitioner immediately be provided with the previously requested membership list, that any Board members sitting in derogation of Mississippi law and/or Chamber bylaws be removed and, if no reasonable alternative exists, appointment of an appropriate custodian to oversee dissolution of this non-profit corporation. Petitioner would further request recovery of her fees and expenses associated with the prosecution of this action, as well as any further relief, at law, or in equity, to which she may be entitled.!10!RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, this the _______ day of August, 2014.

DESOTO ANIMAL RESCUE SOCIETY	256980		/users/profile/345382	MsStella	Volunteer	5	09/13/2015	We are a very small group of like minded people who's only connection is our love of animals and a desire to make their lives better. We work very hard with very few resources to help as many animals as we can. One of the most rewarding things I've ever done in my life is foster needy animals. What a feeling! To know that you literally saved that animal from abuse or neglect, socialized them, showed them love and patience until the perfect forever home comes along to give them the best life they can have. Yes, sometimes it is difficult to let them go, but you know that once they're placed, you can open your home and arms to another needy animal! We desperately need new foster homes. Whether you do it once or 100 times, it will change your life and I can't recommend it enough. You don't need any prior experience, just a love of animals and a desire to help them. We'll teach you everything else you need to know. Please consider saving a life - you'll never be the same again!

Marshall County Educational Foundation Inc	157457		/users/profile/208836	stepreb	Client Served	5	05/09/2013	Marshall County Educational Foundation, Inc. runs Marshall Academy (MA).  MA is a K3-12 school in Holly Springs, MS.  My little girl is in 4K at the school, and I am amazed by what she has learned this year.  She is reading a little, can count by  5's, and 10's, has created advanced art projects, can speak a little Spanish, and, most importantly, she has become a social butterfly.  It is a small school and relies on donations to help supplement school needs.  With greater contributions the school could add unique and varied programs that would open the world to students in this small community.  The administration is committed to college prep, and to demonstrate this point,  every senior in the current graduating class is going to college in the fall.  The potential of this school and its students is limitless.  The economy has affected some families who send their children to the school, so it would be awesome to have contributions.  In addition to adding programs, more financial aid could be available to help deserving students attend this wonderful school.  I only wish I was a millionaire, so I could pay for anything the school ever needs.  
Open Season Sportsman Club	99071		/users/profile/118466	wayne_v_70769	Client Served	3	10/07/2011	The group of guys running this club are fun, friendly, and a good group of guys. The area they hunt is mostly piney with  a few oaks in the bottoms. Not that many deer were taken in their second year having the property, but they are trying to improve that with a good management practice. There is several nice bucks that were films on the property before and during the 2010/11 season. They didn't cross anyones path so they are still there for the hunting. If you ever meet these guys you'll want to join, I wish I could have stayed in, but money was a large issue for me. 
Boy Scouts Of America	11618	3	/users/profile/13563	Raina Snow	Client Served	5	09/30/2009	I am 63 years old and have health problems. Before the storm Katrina, I had a yard full of pine trees 100 of them at least and I could not pick up all the pine cones and rack all the leaves and straw.  I didn't know what to do. I called the boy scouts in Hattiesburg and the Scout Master was so nice and him and his troop came out one or 2 days and cleaned up my whole yard took it all to the street to be picked up and it was so pretty my yard.  They did a wonderful job they brought their own rakes and everything.  I could not have asked for a better group to help me.  They are fantastic Betty Robinson
Msgc Youth For Christ Thrift Mart	301558		/users/profile/392509	Amanda240	Volunteer	5	08/25/2016	Volunteered at the Youth for Christ Waterpark lock-in.

Would love to see church youth groups challenge each other to step up and lead by example.
VOX Press Inc	94182	2	/users/profile/108798	MMWest	General Member of the Public	5	07/21/2011	Any time VOX does a program around Oxford, I go to itLast year the line-up was amazing with not only local talent, but National names such as Barry Hannah, Neil White, Jack Pendarivis, etc, but the one I enjoyed especially, a night at the Power House with Jim Dees. For those of us who see Jim around town, we see a friendly face, a well-known local writer, editorialist, and author, but for those of us who really didnt know Jim, VOX gave us opportunity. This is what is special about VOX. We hear the voice of the authors, the voice of the people whose names we see in print, whose logos we see in the newspapers, but whose faces we only see when VOX puts on an event. The writers are not only there to read, they are there to respond to us, and to interact with those who love their work. We realize at every VOX presentation the magic of realizing that the writers we love are just as human as we are. I will treasure forever the night of Barry Hannahs last public appearance. We were at an event sponsored by VOX at Off Square Books in Oxford. Barry walked in late, with Glenn Ray Tutor, his book cover artist and the two of them conversed as if we werent there, yet we were a part of the gathering, an audience for which this conversation took place. When Barry didnt like the introduction given to him by one of his admirers, he simply said to the manYou need to get a life. This we realized is what made Barry greathis ability to speak without fear and tell us all the truth about who we are and what we do. VOX is special to me because I write, because one day I hope to speak at a VOX event, but mostly because VOX is the voice for those who love reading, writing, and speaking about the condition and hope of each of us. We are the force or so VOX readers lead us to believe.

Standing Tall Ministries Inc	269897		/users/profile/358628	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	A man of God spreading the Word to those who will listen and breaking down the walls that keep others from receiving the message.  Dale Hathorn is an effective and inspiring voice impacting the world of our youth, someone they can and have to look up to as they attempt to negotiate the travels of life when so few faith driven role models and mentors are available.  Any group, organization or church, especially youth oriented, will be greatly rewarded by bringing Dale Hathorn to their area to generate a revival of the Word of God!
Pass Christian Delisle Community Center	142528		/users/profile/189007	dontgivegrants	Volunteer	1	11/26/2012	The Marsha Barbour center is CLOSED.  Unfortunately this center was built too far from communities that it could have served.  The community where it was built does not support it due to their lack of disposable income.  Grants seem to have been spent elsewhere, and no maintenance is being provide for the building, or pool area.  Last time I tried to use the pool it was covered in green slime and no one was around to answer questions.  The phone has been disconnected.  The people who run this center also run apartments in Gulfport for homeless people, and donate goats for people in the Sudan.  No audit has ever been done at the Marsha Barbour center, so who knows how funds are being spent.  According to their last  1099 some of their funds were spent on their apartments rather than on the Marsha Barbour center, or at least thats how it appears to me.

UNITED WAY OF SOUTH MISSISSIPPI INC	269135		/users/profile/357864	cminton	Donor	5	10/29/2015	PreK4Ward received funds to open 1 free preschool class in Gulfport that served 20 4-year-olds.  Their parents were able to send their children to a safe, early education program that was led by a certified teacher. The academic results for those children were astounding.  United Way cares about having all children read on grade level by 3rd grade, and they put their money in our program to help make that happen!  Thanks United Way..

I went to the Compass Points non profit seminar and learned a great deal about working in the non profit world and how to tailor my skills for that sector. The day workshop was worth every penny of the 99 dollars I spent and I highly recommend going to Compass Point's site for more informational classes, as I will. 
Edgar Dewitt Johnson Md Memorial Scholarship	88428	2	/users/profile/99521	dwareagle	Advisor	5	05/06/2011	I am the grand-son of Ed Johnson, and my father is James DeWitt Johnson.  My physician introduced me to a scholarship recipient; Dr. Hale had Dr. Johnson as a mentor and Dr. Hale now mentors these former and current recipients.  The stories that I have been told is that my "D-daddy" was the last physician to make house "calls" or visits.  To his discrepancy he would make house calls for only the cost of a regular check-up.  Let me say that again_ HE CAME TO MEN AND WOMENS HOMES_ in the 1970's even 80's. This is a scholarship for MD's that are born to serve mankind to their fullest.  God bless all of the physicians in the world, and may all future recipients  know that Dr. Edgar DeWitt Johnson is washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and my grandfather's serving spirit is a testament of his power.

We further taught them to market their produce in the local markets, as well as teaching them hygiene and how to control the spread of AIDS. WIN as an organisation is highly effective in chaning the lives of people, uplifting and equipping people spiritually and practically.WIN represents  love,  compassion, caring and the  hands and the feet of Jesus!!  We consider ourselves blessed to have been a part of this organisation reaching out to others who have great needs!! Norman and Sandra ShingSouth Africa

Mississippi Industrial Heritage Museum Inc	51072	2	/users/profile/51655	haccher	Board Member	5	08/26/2010	When I came on the board to help preserve the historic Soule' Steam Feed Works site, I knew that we were starting a very special project. Our goal was to preserve this turn-of-the-20th-century site for future generations. We also wanted to create a place where history teaches and visitors learn about our American forefathers' hard work, ingenuity and desire for improving life. Soule' shows an important part of how industry progressed over time. It is a joy to see younger people learn how to operate the antique machines and demonstrate them for our visitors. To experience the sounds and smells of steam engines operating under real steam is worth a visit to the Soule' Live Steam Festival in November. There are few sites like Soule' remaining in the United States. We cannot afford to let America's early technology and manufacturing era pass into oblivion. Future generations need to have some knowledge of how America became great.

The employees really love the animals and want to ensure they are all adopted. They always have a large selection of dogs and cats including pure breeds. They also have a low cost spay and neuter program to help families get their pets fixed so it cuts down on the over pet population. If looking for a new family member, make sure to go by the CLHS!

We were amazed, touched and inspired! The love and care given by all staff members to the rescued animals was just amazing.  The housing, habitat, feeding and general conditions were excellent.  The animals seem to be happy and thriving in their safe environment.   Some of the animals had been so horrifically abused that it was astonishing that they could ever trust any human again.  But the staff at Cedarhill show lots of patience and love, and somehow the animals know they are safe. Love this organization and will continue to support them.
Foundation On The Rock Ministries	281992		/users/profile/372096	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/09/2016	Foundation on the Rock Ministries provides transitional housing for women and children in the Copiah County, MS  area.  Since 2009, this ministry has been instrumental in transforming the lives of women who have suffered from severe brokenness.  Many have experienced drug and alcohol addictions, abuse,  prison sentences, and separation from their children.  The ministry has provided these women with opportunities to gain life skills to prepare them for their return to society as productive, confident women.  Efforts are also made to reunite these women with their children and restore broken relationships with their families.  Recently 70+ acres of land in southern Copiah County was donated to the ministry   to build a home for the women.  The ministry is now entering the fundraising phase to raise funds for a beautiful home for these beautiful ladies.  This ministry has been an asset to the community and provided life changing services for these women.

Students in the program act in original plays, visit colleges, read great novels, go on camping trips, and do all kinds of things that few rural Mississippi teens have the chance to experience.
