Cirras Cloud	87992		/users/profile/98823	Rebecca P.	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2011	Cirra's Cloud is full of the love and support of it's owner and volunteers.  Cirra has a deep connection with the soldiers and their families, that is evident in the individual attention she gives everyone, that walks through the doors.  Cirra's dedication to assisting the families of our deployed soldiers goes above and beyond all expectations.  Cirra is truly an inspiration to me,and I hope to work with her in the future to help build a community of individuals, that our primary purpose is to be of service to others.
Cirras Cloud	87977		/users/profile/98805	absolutechanges	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	Ciarra the founder of this organisation is an extreamly compassionate lady. Her mission of giving back to the soldiers and their families is something that is often overlooked and very much needed. This organization is built to serve those who have served our country and the families that support and are very much a part of that service.We need more people like Cirra in this world and more organizations like hers. God bless Cirra her non profit the soldiers and their families.

Cirras Cloud	87735		/users/profile/98492	Najla	Volunteer	5	04/28/2011	In a short time, so much has been accomplished because Cirra is always working to improve the facilities and make the public know about the services.  I chose to teach at Cirra's cloud after closing my own dance studio and know from that experience that a lot of hard work has created a beautiful organization. Cirra is a sincere, carring and hard working person.  She works tirelessly to create a beautiful, peaceful, healing center.  Cirrus Cloud Healing center is healing environment for me to teach and for my studios to learn.  There is a boutique with beautiful art for sale.  The center provides rooms for massage, reiki,  safe spray tanning and offers many healing classes.  And the bonus is that a portion of all the proceeds from services go to provide services to our active duty servicemen and their families.

Every time I walk into the healing center it is more and more beautiful!  The art boutique is filling up with amazing art and crafts.  The studio now has a full wall of mirrors, belly dance and yoga accessories and each therapy room is complete, painted, decorated and ready for my clients.  I am so impressed with what Cirra has accomplished with the center in such a short amount of time and with very limited resources!

Cirras Cloud	84795		/users/profile/94186	Diane	Volunteer	5	04/04/2011	I have received a reiki session at the Cirra's Cloud Holistic Healing Center.  I felt very safe and relaxed.  The therapy room was beautiful with candles and soft scents.  With my treatment, I felt a lot of heat and loving energy.  I would highly recommend the services offered here!
Cirras Cloud	84774		/users/profile/94148	awag	Client Served	5	04/04/2011	Cirra's Cloud has helped me in a number of ways, from allowing me to volunteer with several projects in the past assisting families of soldiers to current with the Holistic Health Care Center. The wonderful atmosphere and array of natural products available are impressive. I'm beginning to eat better and I definitely have more energy. I'm going to a Yoga class for the first time at the center and hope to attend other work shops etc... to try and become more healthy and spiritually sound. I hope to see you there. Adam C.

Cirras Cloud	84772		/users/profile/94146	Loving Heart	Board Member	5	04/04/2011	Cirra's Cloud has come so far, so fast!

Cirras Cloud	73431		/users/profile/80252	Brianna T.	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	Cirra's Cloud is a wonderful organization dedicated to helping the families of deployed soldiers in Arizona.  They are always finding new ways to selflessly support, assist and comfort these families the way that their loved ones do for our country.
Cirras Cloud	72687		/users/profile/79457	Zeke	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	It is amazing to see an organization that has the drive and initiative to help military families that deserve all the help they can get. The tireless efforts from this organization assist our soldiers and families with the support they need with issues that arise while deployed. Cirra's Cloud provides a much needed service to those who serve our country.
Cirras Cloud	72056		/users/profile/78790	Cindy	Donor	5	02/21/2011	I proudly donate free spray tanning to help with easing burdens on our military families left behind.  Its an unsung duty taking care of the families that are here waiting for their family member serving our country.  I have participated in dinners, outdoor functions and with the newest venture of the Holistic Center.  Cirras dedication to her country both active duty and non needs to  be properly recognized.  Great job Cirras Cloud!  I am a life long fan.
Cirras Cloud	71918		/users/profile/78637	Jasmine T.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/20/2011	This is a great organization. Its incredible to see people out there helping eachother. In order to gain the money to help these families Cirra opened a Holistic Healing Center to raise the money and also to be able to provide very effective modalities to the soldiers, soldiers families, and the people of the community. They offer Reiki, Hypnotherapy, Polarity, Reflexology, Yoga, Belly dancing, and so many other helpful sessions and classes guided and taught by people with such huge hearts. The healing Center also has a store filled with artwork of all kinds from people from around the community. I hihly recommend this place.
Cirras Cloud	71388		/users/profile/78065	Bobbo	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2011	After many years of serving her country in the U.S. military and being deployed over seas, also in Cuba to  defend our rights. She has been tirelessly working for years to help others who have served, and the families of those brave service men and women. I think any one who stands up to help those who give there time and sometimes ther lives to defend our rights as Americans needs all the support they can get. I am talking about Cirra Turpin who works endlessly running the organization of "CIRRAS CLOUD". I hope she is not alone in the on going work of helping those people who sometimes don't know where to turn.
Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	80851		/users/profile/88271	jkowals	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	VI RC & D is extremely important to the sustainable development of the US Virgin Islands.  It is a place where volunteers, specialists and government agencies can work together toward common goals  for the benefit of all.  The VI RC & D has had great, measurable sucess in many project areas and I look forward to working with this group in the future.
Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	80828		/users/profile/88240	Jenn T.	General Member of the Public	4	03/01/2011	VIRC&D is a great local resource for so many Virgin Islanders.  Locals and tourists alike benefit from the activities of this nonprofit.  In addition, all local environmental educators share both physical and mental resources of VIRC&D.  
Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	80308		/users/profile/87672	Ertwyn	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	I know that this organization has been involved in many training opportunities for the Virgin Islands residents.  They send young people on summer enrichment programs, they inform visitors and resident the importance of leaving marine organisms in the place.  I have attended Grant Writing workshop that they have sponsored.  They have also been involved in the establishment of the first Rain Garden project on St. Croix, also the creation and maintainance of the Est. Adventure trail which I have had the privilege of trekking.  I wish the organization well and they continue to impact our VI community.
Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	80187		/users/profile/87547	Kelly	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	I have lived in the US Virgin Islands for over 15 years and know the work of the Virgin Islands RC&D very well. My background is environmental planning and agriculture: two areas in which VIRC&D have been actively involved for years. Their work ranges from organizing workshops for the community in the design and installation of Rain Gardens to catch, store, and treat non-point sources of water pollution, to assisting the farming community in the development of a variety of projects.Its small staff belies its large impact in our community. VIRC&D staffs work is enjoined by hundreds of volunteers of all ages and walks of life who amplify the creative and dedicated community work this organization undertakes daily.  
Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	80142		/users/profile/87501	ACCIMB	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	VIRCD is a great organization doing many projects which benefit the entire Virgin Islands community.

Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	79849		/users/profile/87197	Marcia	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I have been involved with VI RCD for several years and find that they really get things done!  They go after and get grant funds to enhance the community and protect the environment.  They received funds to develop a nature trail on St. Croix for all to enjoy and are currently working in several watershed to reduce the amount of sediment going into our marine waters.  They are also working to increase awareness of the importance of leaving shells on the beach through the Leave Paradise in its place campaign.  They put on a nonpoint source pollution conference and several grant writing seminars.  These are just some of what they have been doing while I have been a member.
Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	79838		/users/profile/87184	Jesta	General Member of the Public	4	02/28/2011	I like how this organization can pool together its resources -- i.e. financial, human, etc. -- in an effort to provide solutions, recommendations, that can have territory-wide impacts. I have benefited from the many trainings, grant-writing, capacity-building, nonprofit managemet, etc. this organization have sponsored over the years.  It is good to see community-minded individuals coming together to make things happen.

Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	79778		/users/profile/87125	jwrightvi	Client Served	4	02/28/2011	I am constantly amazed by the amount of good work such a small group of dedicated community members can accomplish.  I received invaluable grant-writing and nonprofit management training that helped advance my career; and learned soil & water conservation techniques to protect & improve my property. V.I. RC&D matches resources [human & financial] to projects and helps grass-roots coomunity groups to organize and and run specific programs in our community.
Virgin Islands Resource Conservation & Development Council	79752		/users/profile/87095	amanda	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I have only been involved with VIRC&D for a short period of time but I have found them always at the ready to assist in anyway possible. Their employees are always trying to help in anyway they can whether that is getting you in touch with the right people or assisting with grant writing. Programs like the East End trail that protects the nesting turtles on the beach and provides access to Jacks and Isaacs Bay have been at the forefront of their efforts. 
Sisterhood Agenda	310199		/users/profile/401551	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2016	Sisterhood Agenda is an amazing non-profit organization for women and girls of multiple colors. I love the spirit and sisterhood of the organization and how it uplifts all women in a positive way. It helps us define our struggles and think of a plan to persevere. I love Sisterhood Agenda and the personal experiences I've had with them. Without Sisterhood I wouldn't be the confident, independent, and strong woman I am today! Thank you so much. 
Sisterhood Agenda	204681	1	/users/profile/266717	gifrenum	Volunteer	5	06/30/2014	Sisterhood Agenda is a great program for african american women and girls. Sisterhood Agenda taught me so much about my heritage, how to boost my self esteem, and most importantly Sisterhood Agenda taught me to love and respect all of my sisters.

WOMEN'S COALITION OF ST CROIX INC	185933	1	/users/profile/242904	Tamsmom	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2013	The Women's Coalition of St. Croix works tirelessly to fight the crime and the results of domestic abuse. They provide education, counseling and hands-on help to victims, potential victims and the general public. Their services are available to people who live on St. Croix, but with online exposure and partnerships with other similar organizations they also educate and inform beyond their geographical boundaries. They also have a compassionate outreach to families of those who have lost their lives to domestic abuse. I know about this aspect first-hand. I'm the mother of a young woman who was murdered in May, 2013, by her former partner...who then committed suicide.  The Women's Coalition honored our Tam's (Tammy Zolner) memory (and that of many others who also lost their lives this year) in their recent "Take Back The Night" silent march and vigil on October 24, 2013. The event was well-attended according to news reports and although I couldn't join them in person my spirit was certainly with them as they held vigil on that night and hopefully, brought new awareness to people there. My heart was warmed and my grief lightened by their kindness and compassion and their personal outreach to me. Although my daughter lived on the island I reside in Indiana and I was impressed by their very caring overtures to me, a stranger. This organization works on the front lines with people who have been devastated by domestic violence, providing real help to those who often have no place else to turn. They truly deserve your most serious consideration and the honor of being chosen as a Great Non-Profit. Thank you for that consideration.
WOMEN'S COALITION OF ST CROIX INC	159141	3	/users/profile/211260	pixiegirl	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2013	As a local freelance reporter I have covered events and written features on volunteers and programs at the Women's Coalition of St. Croix USVI. The success stories in the programs offered are fabulous such as people earning GEDs after hardship and dropping out. The volunteers give it their all when it comes to making an event a success. They have a number of long-standing fundraising events that the community comes out and supports any way they can. The Coalition has fallen on some hard times but keeps on assisting folks involved in domestic abuse or any other life threatening situations.  A couple years ago the Coalition offices were totally demolished in a fire and a theft took place at the new offices. It happened to be the year they celebrated 30 years of service.  And in Jan. 2012, a donor HOVENSA oil refinery closed. Almost 3,000 people were without work. Some have found jobs but there is  trickle down and more people are asking the Coalition for all types of assistance. The cost of living and doing business in the Virgin Islands is terribly high. The work the people at the Coalition do is incredible. 
Family Resource Center Inc	243013	2	/users/profile/329634	JustVI2009	Donor	5	05/14/2015	Tattered, beaten, hopeless and eight months pregnant for an abusive husband, she fled on the next plane out.Once she arrived in St. Thomas she was connected to Family Resource Center. Inc. (FRC).  She was taken to the safehouse, her 4 year old daughter in tow.  She repeated her gratitude.  When asked what she needed most, she said, "a peaceful and safe nights sleep." This is the story of only one of the victims I know of that this agency has helped to restore and transition to her own apartment.   FRC operates on  at 24 hour basis, serving victims of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and other violent crimes.  The leadership is dynamic, the staff are trained professionals for whom client education and safety, are paramount along with confidentiality.  There is always a live person on the other end of the hotline (340-776-STOP).
