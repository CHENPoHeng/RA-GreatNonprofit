We were able to get the treatment our son needed that we couldn't get in our home state. It was the best decision I made to take my son to a different doctor after the first one didn't work out and miracleflights made it that much more easier by not having to worry about the flight cost. Everyone I have talked to on the phone was extremely helpful and courteous. I even had to change a flight home since we got to go home earlier then we thought and they were able to do that right away. A great organization to use and a great organization to donate to.

They've flown my son and I out 4 times for his doctor visits. I really don't know what we would have done otherwise because we are paying out of pocket for all his medical care. This helped so much.

Miracle Flights	321428		/users/profile/414778	Brittany62	Client Served	5	01/17/2017	My family has been trying to figure out how we can get our children to see specialists. There is no one in our region who can help us or understands my children's conditions. Financially there was no way we could have afforded to go see these doctors. Miracle Flights made it happen for us! The staff that helped us through the application process was friendly and helpful. We did have some challenges getting the application correct (make sure you actually initial the application and not just type in your initials and your doctor needs to sign the letter not your NP), but they helped us every step of the way. While our plane ride was anything but smooth or short, traveling with an infant and toddler makes for an exhausting experience in the best of times, but when a less than 6 hour trip takes more than 16- most of it sitting on a plane- lets just say it was harrowing. That was Mother Nature and the airlines fault and nothing to do with Miracle Flights. My family is indebted to them, and I know that we will need to use their services again in the future for my littles.

The surgery was in California, and we live in Atlanta. We had already spent tens of thousands on medical bills in the last year and a half, and when Miracle Flights was able to pay for our flight out to CA and back, it was such a huge help for us! They were easy to work with and very on top of things. It was a great experience being served by them, and it made our hard times that much easier!

Miracle Flights	287502	1	/users/profile/377606	MiracleNC	Client Served	5	04/28/2016	Miracle Flights is truly a miracle!!!  When we were told we were out of options for trying to treat our son's Epilepsy, I sought out every doctor and option that I thought could help.  When that search landed us 500+ miles from home, I thought there has to be a way to find some sort of assistance.  As many of you know raising children is expensive enough without adding any form of illness into the mix.  With extremely limited resources for such travel, I began my next search...and found Miracle Flights.  I spoke with both Debra and Rebecca.  Both women were so helpful with the process and paperwork, understanding, accomadating, and friendly.  Any questions I had were answered in a timely and detailed manner.  All of the digital flight information was easy to understand and use.  We have seen a major improvement in our son's quality of life and well being since seeing our new doctor.  The flights that we have recieved have been life changing for our son!!!  Thank You from North Carolina.

The opportunity to go to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN was beyond a valuable opportunity and experience.  I couldnt quite understand why I needed to be accompanied by someone else until I got there.  I now know why it is a physical impossibility for a patient to go thru this without someone helping.  From the first day I arrived my itinerary was adjusted with appointments that were back-to-back-to back-to-back appointments.  After the first 2 hours I was in a wheel chair to make it to/from appointments.  I went under a cardiac catheterization on Monday the 1st of August and they found that I not only was suffering from Congestive Heart Failure but now have been diagnosed with Systolic Heart Failure as well as Diastolic Heart Failure. The team at the Mayo Clinic was relentless to search for answers.  The doctors are now conferring and will be back to me with their findings.  They have also brought the team in from Stanford to assist.  The cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic did state that I might need to return but we will see what their team decides.  But whatever is decided, I want to thank you from the bottom of my gimpy little heart thank you for allowing us to be a part of your Miracle Flight Family, without your help I may not have been able to go to the Mayo Clinic because of the logistics issue.  You made the impossible Possible!

His right eye was removed due to the extent of the tumor in that eye. We were hopeful that our road with cancer was finished and that no further treatment was needed. 12 weeks later, however, tumors were found in his remaining eye-and they were threatening the only vision he had left.We had heard about a team of doctors in New York who had developed an intra-arterial chemotherapy procedure. Instead of delivering chemo to the whole body, they found a way to deliver the chemotherapy drugs directly to the eye.Miracle Flights for kids provided us a way to seek this treatment for our little guy, avoiding some of the more damaging effects of systemic chemotherapy. They continue to help us get our son to NY for follow-up and ongoing treatment for his cancer.We are so thankful for Miracle Flights and the difference they have made in saving our son's life and his vision.

There are few treatment options. My son was accepted into a clinical trial which requires our traveling from Northern Wisconsin to Pittsburgh every 3 weeks. This treatment would be impossible without Miracle Flights funding transportation for my son and I. Miracle Flights has provided us tickets for five trips so far. They also provide flights for both parents to fly to the appointments.

I have had two re-occurances of my cancer so finding an immuno-therapy trial was critical.  This group helped me with flights to Roswell so I could get to my once a month treatments for immuno-therapy which will hopefully give me a longer progression free status with my cancer so I can enjoy more days with family and my grandbaby.

Miracle Flights	271887	1	/users/profile/360800	Writer	Client Served	5	11/12/2015	My son was born with a rare congenital orthopedic disorder called Arthrogryposis.  He was also born with bilateral (or double) clubfeet.  He has had many interventions over the course of his 6.5 years, including castings (consisting of hip-to-toe plaster, surgery, boots and a bar connected at the heel of the boots to keep his feet aligned, aggressive physical and occupational therapies.   In Fall of  2015 some of his issues began coming to a head and I sought a second opinion in regards to the way he was struggling to walk normally.  We live in Utah.  The specialist who wanted to see my son for personal consult lives in St. Louis MO.  I was a recently divorced single working mother with my son and his 2yr old sister, there was no WAY I could make this flight on my own.  I heard about Miracle Flights through a friend, I applied out of "what else can I do?" desperation, we qualified, and because of this flight we were able to make it to St. Louis where this specialist was able to detect a problem my son's other doctors were missing, and was able to correct it.  When correction involved a change of flight plans (instead of flying home the day after his appointment as planned, he had surgery on both legs that day) MF was able to rearrange the flight home to accommodate our stay in the hospital/city for the extra days needed and they did so with minimal paperwork required from me - I had enough to worry about with my son in the hospital - so that in less than 4 hours from when I contacted them to inform them of the need for a flight change, I had the flights I needed booked and ready for me and my son exactly when I would need them to get us home on time. On all flights, to and from St. Louis both times (he needed to fly back  3 weeks later to have his casts removed), MF made certain we had a wheelchair ready and had help to and from all gates at each airport.  They even featured my son on a spotlight on their blog (but my son's personality is kind of contagious, and he grabbed their attention).  They cared about my case not just as another flight to process, but as a family with a child in serious need of specialist care I couldn't otherwise get him to myself.  We have another flight coming up, another follow-up in February of next year, and I expect no less than the exceptional care for this flight that we received for the previous ones.

Not only was the transplant unsuccessful, it wiped me out financially because I am now on Social Security Disability. I am part of a case study at NWU and have been asked to come back annually for a follow-up visit.  Without the assistance of Miracle Flight For Kids, I wouldn't be able to afford and make the follow-up visits.  Hopefully, there will one day be a cure for my disease and Miracle Flights For Kids is helping make that possible.

Flying nearly coast-to-coast every month for cancer treatments gets so expensive, especially with all the other costs that are created by cancer. Being blessed with flights through Miracle Flights has taken such a large burden off of our shoulders, and becomes one less financial worry. A side benefit of working with Miracle Flights, is that the airline has bent over backwards at times to get us on a flight - even holding a plane for us because a connecting flight was late - they understand that medical appointments don't wait! Miracle Flights requests specific information from us, helping to keep all of us accountable.

I've had several surgeries after a botched mistake, and many doctors don't want to touch me.  The orthopedic problems keep going up my kinetic chain (my foot is not in a correct position) and I now have serious knee, hip, nerve and muscle problems.  Unlike the continuously overbooked local doctors who I go to for help here in NYC, I refuse to give up and become permanently disabled. I have been able to get meaningful, fresh perspectives  from experts in different parts of the country who have given me hope.  Without Miracle Flight, I wouldn't have that hope.

Miracle Flights	251108		/users/profile/339015	cotopreando	Client Served	5	08/01/2015	My daughter, Katie, was diagnosed with a lesion/cyst inside the pineal gland located in the center of the brain in October 2014.  This enlarged pineal gland created pressure in the brain causing Katie to suffer daily with symptoms of pressure-type headaches, visual issues, dizziness, nausea, fatigue and struggled daily to attend school.   If not treated, the lesion/gland could have caused other issues such as loss of vision and seizures.After many MRIs, appointments with neurologists and neurosurgeons in our home state of New York and in Vermont, our family searched for a second opinion.  We located a surgeon in Los Angeles, Californa that would be able to perform a less invasive procedure - endoscopic surgeryOur New York State health insurance did not cover this out-of-state, non-participating providers procedure.  The cost of the procedure required out-of-pocket payment.  The surgery also required a 7 day stay.  Travel and accommodations were also an added expense. Our family learned of Miracle Flights.  Miracle Flights staff were extremely helpful, friendly and were able to assist us in obtaining two airline tickets from New York to California and return. Katies surgery was performed on April 7th and it was found that the original diagnosis of a lesion/cyst inside the pineal gland deep in the mid brain was actually a tumor.   Our family is forever grateful to Miracle Flights for their assistance.  Without their assistance, our family would not have known what to do to help her relieve her pain and suffering. Katie recovered successfully and with the assistance of our home school and in-home tutors, Katie was able to graduate from high school in June.  One additional hour of missed school would have put her into summer school and deferred her enrollment into college.   We are thankful that Miracle Flights were able to work with us quickly to get her to California for the surgery.  Without the assistance of Miracle Flights, Katie would still be suffering to this day and would not have been able to pursue her continued education to someday become a psychologist.

Miracle Flights	239693		/users/profile/325606	jasturm	Client Served	5	03/24/2015	My name is Jenny, I am a single mother of six children and I have worked full time for 40 years. I was diagnosed in April 2014 with Multiple Myeloma. I started with radiation treatments unfortunately it was not successful. I then started chemotherapy. My physicians felt that the best option for a longer remission was a stem cell transplant. Multiple Myeloma has no cure but it is treatable. They recommended Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. They are renowned in Multiple Myeloma treatments and the latest research studies available.  I have always been healthy so this was a devastating shock to me. Even though this disease is treatable who wants to live a life constantly worrying about every pain and ache, and the forever testing and more than likely multiple stem cell transplants. That in itself was extremely difficult to go through. I was filled with anxiety as I knew there was no way I could possibly afford travel to Minnesota. My budget was already nonexistent  due to the fact that I am on disability at only 60% of my pay and I still have three children in the home to support, not to mention medical bills. I made a phone call to the American Cancer Society to see if there was any foundations that provide medical flights at no cost for cancer patients. They gave me Miracle Flights number and that's when things looked up. I needed to fly to Minnesota to date 4 times. My stem cell transplant is completed, and I leave in a few days for a followup biopsy to see if it was successful. I have never encountered such an amazing, incredible organization in all my life. Miracle Flights took a heavy heavy burden off me. Here I needed life saving treatment at the best location for my particular disease and every flight was made possible for me and my caregiver. Simply incredible because they are truly helping to save my life by allowing me access to the very best physicians and hospital for my disease. I can not possibly in words alone express my gratitude and heartfelt thankfulness. I promise though that as soon as I am back on my feet and back to work I will absolutely donate to this charity and spread the word of their outstanding foundation and the kindness of their employees. From my heart I thank you!Jenny

Again, transportation concerns were raised and yet again Miracle Flights for Kids were there ready to help. There are no words that can express how grateful my family is to Miracle Flights for Kids.

Miracle Flights	235453		/users/profile/319017	Lisa418	Client Served	5	12/14/2014	    Miracle Flights has been such a blessing. They helped take away a big part of the financial burden we were faced with in flying our son , my husband and I to Ohio to  Cincinnati Children's Hospital to receive care for Eosinophilic Esophagits  (Eosinophilic Disorders)  The staff are all so compassionate and so wonderful in planning our trip. We will	be forever grateful, I don't know we could of done it without their generous gift! I Thank You all for all your help and all you do for Families who are faced with serious illness.Miracle Flights is truly a blessing to our family.Without Miracle Flights we would not be able to provide this very necessary treatment for our son.What Is an Eosinophilic Disorder?Eosinophilic enteropathy is a complicated digestive system disorder in which eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, are found in above-normal amounts in one or more specific places in the digestive system and/or the blood.When the body wants to attack a substance, such as an allergy-triggering food or airborne allergen, eosinophils respond by moving into the area and releasing a variety of toxins. However, when the body produces too many eosinophils, they can cause chronic inflammation, resulting in tissue damage.These rare diseases are diagnosed according to where the elevated levels of eosinophils are found:Eosinophilic esophagitis (esophagus)Eosinophilic gastritis (stomach)Eosinophilic enteritis (small intestine)Eosinophilic colitis (large intestine)Hypereosinophilic syndrome (blood and any organ)This condition can be divided into two types, Primary and Secondary. The Primary type is further subdivided into allergic and non-allergic forms. The allergic type occurs in association with food allergies, while the non-allergic form occurs when no obvious cause can be found to explain the high number of eosinophils in the digestive system. Because of this, the non-allergic form is thought to be evidence that the body is attacking itself and considered to be an autoimmune disorder.Common symptoms may include pain, swelling, skin rash, hives, reflux, choking, difficulty swallowing, nausea, vomitting, loss of appetite, stools containing blood and/or mucus, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, fever, esophageal rings, motility problems, bowel obstruction, bowel or stomach wall thickening (from scar tissue buildup), pseudopolyps, protein loss, anemia, malabsorption, developmental delay, bleeding, and several other symptoms that occur in individual cases. Many people also experience nutritional deficiencies and/or side effects from medications, such as neuropathy (nerve damage) or osteoporosis (decrease in bone mass).Special amino acid-based formula may be needed as a supplement for those whose diets are so limited that they are unable to obtain enough nutrition from food alone. Some primary forms may require the avoidance of all regular foods and complete reliance on an amino acid-based formula, which may be consumed normally or pumped through a special feeding tube (naso-gastric, gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes). For the most severe flare-ups or for those who experience problems from all foods and formulas, feeding through a blood vessel (TPN) may be the only remaining option. Some cases also require additional symptom-specific help, such as pain medication. This disease may cause such severe bleeding or nutritional deficiency that they condition may be life threatening if not treated with appropriate medications. Since there is no known cure for Eosinophilic Enteropathy, management of the condition is very important in order to prevent severe damage to the digestive system (and to the organs in the case of Hypereosinophilic syndrome) caused by the high numbers of eosinophils. Because symptoms vary so widely and may minic other conditions, it is important that accurate information and awareness of Eosinophilic Enteropathy is achieved.To Learn More About Eosinophilic Diseases go to http://curedfoundation.org/site/

When you have a child with medical needs those expenses are more than some can even imagine.  When our daughter was born, even with problems, we were thrilled.  However, someone needed to stay home with her at all times, which financially drastically changed our lifes. She needed medical care that we not only didnt have in our area, but couldn't afford on our own. Miracle of flights has made it possible for us to take our daughter to the top facilities for her treatment to give her the best life possible. There is absolutely no way it would have happened without this foundation. They are extremely friendly, efficient, and hands down the best foundation we have ever come across. All children deserve the best medical care that is out there and Miracle of Flights helps achieve that. My family is forever indebted to this foundation for helping our family! Angus Family

Miracle Flights	235152		/users/profile/273272	Alison30	Client Served	5	12/08/2014	Our son, Dominic, was born without nerves in his intestines. He is dependent on TPN (IV nutrition) with lipids (fats), but the lipids destroy the liver with long term use. Drs. Puder and Gura began using fish oil, called omegaven, in 2004 with wonderful success! This has provided a better option for Dominic's long term survival. However. we are required to return to Boston every other month for labs and clinic, to continue with the protocol. We cannot afford to travel to Boston every other month for this life-saving treatment. Dominic has a twin brother, 3 year old sister and 5 year old brother.  We just took our third Miracle Flight from Michigan to Boston. Dominic is doing awesome! He is healthier now than he has ever been in his 15 months on this earth. We are so grateful for Miracle Flights. Their staff is warm and helpful. We have had the best experience using Miracle Flights to provide our little one with the  medical care he needs to thrive.. 
Miracle Flights	210502		/users/profile/273272	Alison30	Client Served	5	08/13/2014	Dominic was born on August 28, 2013, shortly after his fraternal twin brother, Vincent. After 6 excruciatingly long weeks, we discovered Dominic was born with a 1 in a million life threatening intestinal disease. His intestines lack nerves and the ability to absorb enough nutrients to sustain life. He needs TPN and lipids (IV nutrition and fats). The lipids, a soybean oil emulsion, were destroying his liver. We were quickly finding ourselves on the path towards small bowel and liver transplant; a procedure with only a 50% survival rate, made even more risky because Dominic is only 14 pounds at 11 months old.   Dr. Mark Puder, at Boston Children's Hospital, has helped pioneer a new lipid, Omegaven, which is made from fish oil. This new lipid is being used to correct TPN- related cholestasis with great success! It is providing an opportunity, for children and babies like Dominic, to grow and become healthier!  Possibly avoiding transplant altogether! Omegaven is not FDA approved, and not widely available. We had to find a way to get Dominic to Boston from Michigan, but financially it was far out of reach. Then we found Miracle Flights! It was our ticket to the life-saving treatment Dominic so desperately needed! Friends and family rallied to our side to help fund our lengthy stay in Boston.  Dominic's liver has drastically improved in the last 4 weeks since starting treatment. We will be returning home in another week, with a healthy baby! Dominic will continue receiving treatment through BCH, returning every 6-8 weeks or more frequently, as needed. Because of Miracle Flights, Dominic can continue receiving care through one of the best Intestinal Rehabilitation Programs in the country and  stay on Omegaven.  We are truly grateful! Dominic has the chance to grow and thrive. We have been so scared that we could lose him. Miracle Flights has given us the ability to focus on living, the chance to see Dominic grow up and reach milestones. Truly, from the bottom of our hearts, we are thankful!

Miracle Flights	234041	5	/users/profile/298113	begoodtoyourself	General Member of the Public	1	11/19/2014	If there was a way to give this organization 0 stars, I would.   I have never been so rudely dealt with in trying to get assistance from anything related to any organization or business ever before.  And I was trying to get help with a flight for cancer treatment.  The office staff, director and president of the company put you on speaker phone and talk mockingly to you when you ask questions about their policies or clarify their misinformation.  They don't keep track of emails so you must email them multiple times for the same issue.  Their requirements list is incomplete and when you turn in work, they add details not on their requirements list.  I took 6 days to complete all their requirements.  I had to have my doctors re-write letters 4 times each to have the correct wording.  They refused to tell me what the maximum financial requirements were to qualify and never did tell me, even 6 days later.  They mocked me that I am "adult applying for the program that is intended for kids" EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS THE PROGRAM IS FOR ADULTS AND KIDS.  They mocked my concerns about their paper work process and made up stories about what I had said in conversation during previous phone calls AND THEN called me a liar on the phone.  I thought it was just the office staff at first, but then the Director, who was apparently instructing the office staff, continued the same derogatory, interrupting behaviors, threatening to hang up on me, refusing to answer my questions, THEN the president got on the phone and hung up on me when I wanted to clarify a question with her, telling me I was yelling at her.    I think this organization discriminates against homeless and cultural minorities, which is absolutely shocking.  I think they make people go through hell to get a charity donation, people who are fighting for their lives who have unbelievable financial burdens and lives with very little time to mess around with such unprofessional organizations.  They even told me that they were doing me a favor, harassing me on the phone.  I would almost believe the folks there were on drugs, had their horrible, uncompassionate, unprofessional, disrespectful behavior not gone on for nearly a week. I finished putting in the application and did not hear from them.   This is probably for the better.  I think setting up a Facebook fundrazer would be more sane!  If I was on the board of directors, I would seriously look at getting a continuous improvement program in with this organization. I also believe the high star ratings from folks may be to propitiate to the organization so folks can keep getting donations.  If they told us we should be grateful we are being helped, I am certain they told other people this too.  Oh! and it costs $$!  They charge and Administrative fee.

Miracle Flights	210751		/users/profile/273544	maryelizabethbond	Client Served	5	08/14/2014	I am a 49 year old female who was diagnosed on 02/04/14 with Stage 4 of a very rare type of cancer.  I was blind-sighted, never saw it coming.  The oncologist I saw at the University of TN Cancer Center (who I'd heard wonderful things about) gave me ONE option of chemo, which had horrible side effects & a very bleak chance of being helpful at all.  He wouldn't even suggest whether I should take the chemo or not.  He looked me straight in they eyes and just said "This cancer is going to take your life; it's just a matter of when."   My mom (who I tried to talk out of it, but had insisted on going to the appointment with me, after the PET scans, CT scans, biopsies had all been done) and I were first shocked and sat for a moment in silence, grasping each others' hands.  Then we hugged each other and cried for a few minutes.  Then I gathered myself for a moment and asked the only question that came to my mind: "How in the world am I going to tell my teenage daughter?" (a daughter who tells all of her friends that I am her very best friend, a daughter who shares everything with me (how blessed I am!), a daughter with a strong relationship with our Savior and a spiritual outlook and maturity that at times just amazes me, a daughter who's an honor student and already has taken several college credit classes while in high school, a daughter I could not have even known how to pray for, but with whom I am crazy in love with and for whom I would do anything in the world).  The very thought of telling her what the oncologist told me literally broke my heart.  I felt an ache I've never known.  The oncologist had not much of a response that I can recall. My mom then asked: "Aren't there any options?!  This just can't be it!"  The oncologist mentioned we might try MD Anderson in Houston, TX, that perhaps there were clinical trials that I might be eligible for.  After the appointment, driving home - I cried, then screamed, then sat in silence; and then about halfway home, I pulled over into an empty church parking lot, googled MD Anderson on my iPhone, called them and made my first appointment.  After about 7 weeks at MD Anderson (and many tests, scans, bloodwork), I was indeed accepted into a clinical trial that had proven very effective in breast cancer and melanoma patients.  This clinical trial chemotherapy had to be administered at MD Anderson every 2 weeks for 2 years.  There was no question, I had to somehow find a way to take part in that clinical trial.  (Though I'm perfectly ready to meet my Savior and bow at His feet and praise Him, I am NOT ready to leave my daughter, as I'm the only parent mentally, emotionally, spiritually & physically in-sync and available to her, as her dad has always been a 'checked out' kind of man). But how???  How in the world would I get to Houston, TX from Knoxville, TN EVERY TWO WEEKS for TWO YEARS.  I am not rich & there was nothing at my disposal that would generate the kind of cash it would require for that many flights.  I contacted the American Cancer Society and they gave me information on Miracle Flights.   From my very first conversation with Ginny at Miracle Flights (who is very pleasant, compassionate, personable, yet still professional), I knew I was on the right track.  She walked me through everything I needed to do to apply for flight assistance; and she very patiently answered every single question I had, even when I called her back many times.   Then, speaking to Mary, who scheduled my flights - I was just amazed that she didn't just stick me on a flight, call me, and say 'that's that'.  She actually calls me before scheduling my flights and gives me the options she can find, and works with me to pick the flights that are best for me.  She too, is very compassionate and personable, yet professional - a rare breed, both Ginny and Mary. Without Miracle Flights, I would never have been able to take part in the clinical trial chemotherapy in Houston, TX, as I could never have afforded the flights.  And the chances of continuing to live my life would've been, as my local oncologist originally said 'just a matter of time'.   I thank God for Miracle Flights, as I see them as a true miracle that God is using (even as I write this) to work toward my healing.

My husband and I were on our way to see the doctor for an ultrasound. there we found out our precious little Emelee was sick. Quickly doctors decide to hospitals me and try to do there best to get ready for this little angle to come. after two months the doctors advice us that it was time. My self very scare because she was only 32 weeks. but doctors advised they can do more with her here then in my belly. So my little angle was born May 24 2010. And her battle to live began, within minutes of her life Emelee had her first surgery. She was in the UNIC unit for 3 months. Once release from hospital we became a (frequent flier) an nickname they give families that are in and out of the hospital allot. There was a point that we were admitted every 2 weeks to the hospital it became our second home. Rocky Mountain Hospital for children were the best they took care for her like she was there own. 3 years later, after multiple surgeries her team of specialist had exhausted all the available interventions they could here in Colorado. So her lead surgeon recommended that we go to Cincinnati Children Hospital in Ohio. On March 2013 we took out first Miracle Flight to Cincinnati OH. We meet with a group of doctors, after many test. we were told they can fix everything with one marathon operation. On Dec 10 2013 we did our second Miracle Flight, we were set and ready for the big surgey but we had a little hiccup Emelee got sick a couple of hours before the surgery, so they had to cancel her surgery.

Miracle Flights	205075		/users/profile/267166	KaylaPolk	Client Served	5	07/03/2014	We utilized Miracle Flights for Kids to travel from California to Pennsylvania. Our youngest daughter was born with Arthrogryposis. The treament plan prescribed by local doctors was to wait and see how she grows, with the silver lining being she may be in a wheelchair for life. While that is still a possibility, the doctors in Pennsylvania have given us much more hope for her future. Their treatment plan has included serial casting, bracing, and recently surgery. All of which has put her on the right path to one day walk. Without Miracle Flights, we would not be able to see the doctors across country, and our daughter wouldn't have the care she deservse. We are so grateful for Mircle Flights and all the donors! It's been such a blessing to have ease of mind that our daughter can get the best care available for her without having to worry about how we are going to get it for her. Thank you Miracle Flights for all you do!!!

He had his lip repaired in Houston, Tx but his lip and nose still looked very funny and his speech was nasally. I met a girl who had used a surgeon in Boston for her son and his repair looked incredible. I was sick of other kids making fun of my son and I knew I just had to get him working with this surgeon. However, the costs of flights, hotel rooms, etc made it highly unlikely we'd be able to.  Miracle Flights for Kids stepped in and covered flight for my son and I to travel to Boston. Granted, we stayed in some sketchy hotels, but he is now working with an incredible surgeon and cleft team. This would not have been possible without this wonderful charity.

Miracle Flights	197604		/users/profile/66134	timbeckett	Client Served	5	04/14/2014	When he was 8 years old Casey was diagnosed with a rare inoperable tumor that even the docs at the university hospital had never seen before.    The local doctors were unsure how to best care for him.   We found a team of doctors familiar with, and doing active research on this condition at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,  MN (we are in Oregon).   Finding the right care was only part of what we needed.  The 2000 miles distance between our home and Casey's appointments was a major obstacle to his care.  I am on disability with M.S. so we have a limited fixed income.   It was so difficult for me to know that care was available, but not know how we could get to it.  Miracle flights came to the rescue as the last piece of the puzzle.   Casey could have the best doctors in the world ( and maybe he does) to no advantage if we could not get him to the appointments.   I count Miracle Flights very much as part of his care team.    Casey is a freshman in High School now.   He makes a couple of trips to Mayo each year.     With the encouragement of his physicians he has set his sights on becoming a doctor and passing on to others the care he has received.     Thankful alone does not cover what we feel towards the donors and staff that make Miracle Flights happen.    We are truly very grateful for the many flights and the kindness of the folks at Miracle Flights. Tim Beckett

Miracle Flights	197447		/users/profile/258122	wood.brianj	Client Served	5	04/11/2014	About a year ago my autistic son started having seizures, then trouble walking, then difficulty eating, eventually developing parkinson-like tremors. Our local doctors in Idaho did not have the experience to help us, but would not sign consent forms for us to seek treatment elsewhere. Without this consent, our insurance would pay for the doctors, but not the trips to a neighboring state. Thanks to Miracle Flights, we have been able to afford several trips to Seattle where my son was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive form of epilepsy that the more experienced doctors in Seattle were able to recognize. We have been able to start treatment and have a decent chance to get his condition under control. Miracle flights did not have Southwest flights directly from Boise to Seattle and since extended travel can cause seizures, they paid for flights on a competitors airline so that we could have a direct flight for my son, my wife, our infant and myself (our insurance, even if they were paying, would have only covered my son and 1 adult). This allowed us in our most recent trip to have multiple adults to help endure 36 consecutive hours of medical tests that are very difficult for an autistic child. Once again, our insurance only would have covered one parent despite the difficulty of the situation and length of the tests. Basically, because of Miracle Flights, our family has been able to get a proper diagnosis, potentially save my sons life or at least his ability to maintain his ability to walk, eat, think and sleep, and we were able to endure our trials with relative comfort. Thank you does not begin to describe what we feel about Miracle Flights.

Miracle Flights	123687		/users/profile/168389	thadlo	Client Served	5	09/28/2012	Our daughter was born with a rare condition called arthrogryposis.  This has caused her very limited movement in both her arms and legs.  She is unable to raise or bend her arms, knees, ankles.  The drs. here have given her little chance of walking or even independent care.  They see maybe 1 or 2 cases in their career.  Because of Miracle Flights we are able to take Ember to Shriner's Hospital in Philadelphia to be treated by a team of surgeons who see several kids like her every day.  They believe she will walk, that she will live independantly, and they never give up looking for ways to help her.  We are so grateful to be able to give Ember this chance.  It would not be possible without the help Miracle Flights provides.

When I called with question, they were always kind, friendly, & helpful, which is not common when we function on average 30-90 minute chunks of sleep at a time.

After some independent research for travel assistance I came across Miracle Flights and for the last almost two years we have been able to travel over 10 times with Miracle Flights.

We searched for the best surgeon we could find before she was even born.  We finally found one that was confident he could help us and save our unborn baby, and on top of it he could do it without the use of a blood transfusion which was a must for us.  The problem was we live in California and Dr.  Mark Galantowicz is in Columbus Ohio.  Before we knew about miracle flights we flew our family to Ohio twice.  The expense of flying started to be impossible.  Then we heard about miracle flights, applied for flights and they have granted out family flights twice now.  Also when things didn't go exactly according to plan for her surgery am we had to change our flight dates,  they were more then willing to help us.  What a wonderful organization Miracle Flights is!

Miracle Flights	163674		/users/profile/217359	knightcole	Client Served	5	07/26/2013	I will forever be in debt with Miracle Flights for Kids based on the expedited service that was given to me.   My son Terrance was diagnosed with an uncommon case of Neuroblastoma Stage IV on April 29, 2013.  I say uncommon because they cannot find a tumor.  So the treatment plan for Terrance is several rounds of harsh chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant and/or immunotherapy.  We chose immunotherapy because in logically thinking since there's no tumor the treatment plan in my opinion was basically cutting down the tree and not the roots in other words there's a chance of relapsing.  With the immunotherapy antibody, it would kill off any new cells that may form but the only doctor that had the clinical trial open was located in New York.  Terrance doctor inquired about our interest in the trial and set up the appointment; which we did not expect so quickly, in about 2.5 weeks.  The Social Worker at the hospital gave me the information about Miracle Flight and the rest is history.  On June 30, 2013 we boarded American Airlines headed to New York.  I really appreciate the kindness and patience that was shown to me in filling out the application and assitance from the representative.  I will definately use them again.

My 2 sons have rare multiple complex medical needs including Bone Marrow Failure and Combined Immune Deficiency, Cerebral Folate Deficiency, to name a few.  Because of the complex nature of their illnesses we needed to follow up in the Bone Marrow Failure Clinic at Cincinnati Childrens hospital. (They have been previously seen there). Travel has gotten more and more expensive, and this stay would encompass several days, along with multiple medical procedures. By being able to use Miracle Flights for Kids to help with airfare made a huge difference and impact for our family. Without them we were either looking at driving the 18 hours, or possibly having to postpone are visit for care. Our visit to Cincinnati hopefully will provide more answers for us as well help with future care of our boys. Thank you Miracle Flights for helping us get the care our boys so desperately need!

The help they have provided is just as their name states an absolute MIRACLE!  We have two precious little boys with Eosinophilic Esophagitis, a rare, incurable, inflammatory diesease of the esophagus.  They are on a strict elimination diet avoiding many, many foods and require constant monitoring of their condition.    We travel every 3-4 months to a children's hospital who specialize in helping children who suffer with eosinophilic disorders.  Each visit, under anesthesia, they undergo endoscopies with biopsies to monitor their condition.  Because of Miracle Flights we are able to take them to (in our opinion) a doctor and hospital that give them unbelievable care and gives us hope in not only managing their disease but possibly finding a cure through their research.  When dealing with any medical problem the last thing you want to worry about or let stand in the way of treatment is finances.  Miracle Flights helps take away the financial burden of airfare so that parents are able to obtain care their child needs.  We cannot praise this organization enough and what an absolute blessing they are to us.  They are so kind and compassionate and you can truly feel their true dedication to what they do.

It was an all around amazing experience to get answers to our questions regarding our daughter's health.  But the most impressive thing was that our daughter was able to communicate for the first time EVER.  We met with an AAC specialist who is world renowned for her work with the eye gaze on girls with Rett Syndrome.  She uses a special computer, called a Tobii, with a special eye gaze system to help non-verbal girls communicate.

The youngest of four children, she is, ironically, one of our familys greatest teachers. She teaches us about patience, perseverance, strength, flexibility, staying positive.. and love.Isabella was born with Talipes Equinovarus. Immediately upon her birth, it was clear that she would need extensive orthopedic care. Her feet were curled and twisted up towards her shins. Only two hospitals in the country provide access to the Dimeglio Method; a non-surgical treatment for Talipes Equinovarus. One is in Texas and one is The Shriners Hospital for Children, in Erie, PA. We live in Central Connecticut, and Erie- a 20 hour round trip drive- is as close as we can get.Isabella has been receiving treatment at the Erie Shriners since she was 6 weeks old.              Isabella  has received exceptional care in Erie, while offering her the unique treatment that is only available at a distance from our home and the rest of our family.The history that Isabella has with the Erie hospital and the Shriners care providers is invaluable in contributing to her continued progress. Even with surgery now inevitable, the Erie Shriners has a commitment to and understanding of her condition and its evolution in her little body.In Isabellas first few years, she had to travel back and forth to Erie from our home as often as every other week. Isabellas Case Manager told us about Miracle Flights. Miracle Flights has supported us in so many times of need. Miracle Flights has enabled us to access the medical care that Isabella has needed, while keeping us away from the rest of our family for shorter periods of time.Two of our children have medical needs. The cost of caring for children with needs, including the need for a parent to be home and available to provide care- can add a good deal of financial burden to a family. Travel expenses are certainly not covered by insurance.Isabella is a bright and shiny light. We are so grateful to have her in our lives. We are grateful for being able to access the medical care that she needs to help her reach towards the goal of pain free, healthy functional feet. Thank you Miracle Flights. Truly.The Trowbridge-Wheeler Family

We are forever grateful and blessed that Miracle Flights for Kids continues to help us travel to Cincinnati for required medical treatment for our son.

Miracle Flights	148489		/users/profile/197663	jessicacharles22	Client Served	5	01/24/2013	My two year old son was diagnosed with an eye eye tumor at 18 months old which started to grow at 32 months. He was getting seen by a doctor in Houston, TX and they were trying to rule out other conditions and weren't sure if it was retinoblastoma. After a lot of research I ended up finding the Wills Eye Institute in Philadelphia, PA and scheduled an appointment. I was left to find a way to pay for the flight. I checked numerous organizations and Miracle Flights was able to book our flight after submitting very easy paperwork from us and the doctors. While we were at Wills Eye they diagnosed my son with retinoblastoma and wanted to begin chemo right away, which meant we had to change our flight so I was worried. One simple call to miracle flights and a letter from our doctor changed that right away as Miracle Flights conveniently changed our flight to accommodate his treatment. I am so grateful that Miracle flights was there for us in seeking a second opinion to ensure that our son could be in the hands of the best doctors.

My little boy needed a transplant last year and it took me 6 months to figure out how to pay for our flight to Chicago. Needless to say, I wasn't aware of Miracle Flights back then.  After $6000.00 spent on flights, I was blessed with the link to Miracle Flights.  We have used their service 3 times now.  We sadly had 2 experiences with other companies that literally left us stranded in Chicago once and  at home once when my son was scheduled at the hospital. Miracle Flights provide us with flights on commercial airlines, we preboard due to exposure and the flight attendants are so loving. I have 5 children and am doing this by myself. I also have another child with medical ailments as well as myself.  We have a genetic disorder that hasn't been diagnosed in 3 years of testing. I have so much stress from medical and financial, but Miracle Flights helps me get my son across the country as needed and with minimal paperwork. They are a Miracle and have given My son life!

Miracle Flights	145982		/users/profile/192609	Andrea60	Client Served	1	12/05/2012	Our son is 21 months old, has Retinoblastoma, and 13q chromosome deletion, and we have used Miracle Flights organization twice for which we were grateful.  I want to tell you about my experience with Rebecca Boyce because it seems like she was making things unnecessarily difficult for us to get help and I can't understand why. At first I thought that maybe she was having a bad day, but when I continued to have difficulties with her I decided to write a letter to the Board of Directors. I will give you some examples of the behavior I have experienced with her. Originally, we were somewhat outside range of your financial maximums, but we were told by another associate that if we could show $4,700 in paid medical expenses we could still get covered. I forwarded multiple emails from hospitals and physicians to the email address on your website, but they were lost because that email address wasn't working. I was told to send them to Rebecca, which I did.   As I reviewed one of these documents with Rebecca she said to me this was not added up and I can't believe I have to add all this up. I felt that this was very inconsiderate of her. She's did not consider how I felt that our son was in the doctor or hospital every week for a year but only about how inconvenient it was for her to add up the all the individual $20 and $40 charges.  I said I'm sorry and that I can look at it, but when I pulled it up I saw that it was actually added up in different sections; what I paid and what insurance paid. She just didn't understand it.  We were accepted and out flight was booked.  We were grateful. The next month, we requested another flight to NYC for my son, my husband and myself.  I had a letter from my sons pediatrician in Denver, and one doctor in NYC that my son would see.  My son sees 2 doctors in NYC.  Rebecca said the letters must have the exact dates to book our flights and include all doctors.  I begged Rebecca to book the reservation because of the extra expense our family would incur if we weren't able to book the flight two weeks in advance, but she said we had to wait for a letter from the third doctor.  This was the week of hurricane Sandy, and NYC was in a state of emergency, so it was a lot to ask of the medical staff who had not even been able to return to work at that point. She said that this was policy no exceptions. Rebecca finally received the letter from the third doctor made out to Footprints instead Miracle Flights, so she called and threatened to cancel me. I tried to explain to her that I had requested help from Footprints in the past so it was just a simple mistake by the doctors office, and I would get it fixed. We needed to book the flight for my daughter during Thanksgiving week as well because she is 4 years old and would need to be with us on the flight.   So I ended up booking a flight for my daughter in hopes that one of us could get on the flight with her. The extra expense we had to pay was around $150. Rebecca did not follow the letter from the doctors this time because she booked our flights for Friday at my request. Unless I am misunderstanding something, this proves that she did not really need exact dates and therefore unnecessarily caused me extra grief and expense. On the day of travel Thanksgiving week, she calls my husband John because she received an email from Frontier airlines that had a different confirmation code and she tried to look it up but couldn't. My husband was driving and passed me the phone and I told her we were in route to the airport and I would have to call her back. We arrived at Ronald McDonald house Monday night.  Tuesday my son had an exam under anesthesia and he was very sick afterwards.  Wednesday he had his Intra-Arterial Chemo surgery. She knew all of this because it was in the letter that I was required to submit. Knowing all of this, she called again Wednesday. I told her that we were having IAC and she had been rude and inconsiderate, I was tired of it, and I wanted her supervisor's name. The doctor arrived and I said I had to go, but she continued on, saying that she was not harassing me but that I said I would call her back and I didn't. She did not give me her supervisor's name.  I finally hung up. I'm not sure if you know what its like with a disabled child and one with cancer in addition. The level of exhaustion, pain and suffering you see and feel in your family is tremendous, and the financial strain of cancer for us is huge. We stay at the Ronald McDonald house and we have to pay for it. I am separated from my daughter and spouse every month. It looks as if we'll be doing this for at least the next year, because they do not do this type of surgery in Colorado. Rebecca's negative behavior has been ongoing. I've bit my lip because my son needs the help, but is this it?  Rebecca, who is in this position to help suffering families, behaves in this manner and frequently.  Do I need to continue being subjected to this when requesting help?I've received help in the past from Angel Flight Central receiving vouchers on Southwest airlines. There was not this type of drama and they had empathy and respect. In addition, the airlines knew why we were traveling and gave us priority boarding and free baggage. We have flown twice with Corporate Angels and they have been very kind and accommodating. These other corporations operate differently and corporate angels is infrequent. I need help and I need to get it from wherever I can and it seems that you can help us.    Thank you for your time and consideration. We'd also appreciate your prayers. Andrea Mother of Madeleine and Alexander

I spent almost four years on chemotherapy, and was then told that the cancer was growing, even on chemotherapy. My doctor was convinced my only hope was to cut the cancer out. I tried many surgeons in Florida but was told that I was too weak for such as a surgery.  Miracle Flight flew me to Boston, Mass. where a surgeon agreed to do the surgery, against all odds. It is now a year and one half later and the cancer has now returned to my lungs.

Specialized areas of the country,  like Boston because of Dana Farber Cancer Center, offer treatment that gives us the ability to live another day to raise children and watch them grow up. We owe you our lives. Thank you.

Miracle Flights	121218		/users/profile/164934	lschust	Client Served	5	08/22/2012	10 months ago my son, Benjamin, was diagnosed with a rare and devastating seizure disorder called Infantile Spasms.  He was 13 months old.  On the bad days, he would suffer thousands of seizures that would come in clusters lasting up to an hour.  He was very sick.  After failing 6 drugs and a specialized diet (Ketogenic) to treat medication resistent epilepsy, we realized we were running out of options.  Ben's development had stopped and with every seizure we were risking more and more brain damage.  We were praying for a miracle.  We were referred to a Pediatric Neurologist at the Children's Hospital of Michigan.  He is known as "Dr. Rockstar"  amongst the families he has served.  The only problem was - we live in Frederick, MD and Michigan is a 9 hour drive.  Too long for a sick baby.  A mom in my on-line support group reccomended I apply for a miracle flight to get us to Michigan.  I did, we were accepted and flew to Dr. Rockstar!  I will never be able to put into words how much Miracle Flights helped my family.  We are now under the care of a top notch doctor and for the first time in a very long tome, we have hope!

Miracle Flights	112813		/users/profile/153548	lisann711	Client Served	2	05/23/2012	Let me begin by saying that we are so appreciative and thankful for Miracle Flights for Kids.  They have flown us 3 years in a row for our daughter's outpatient appointment to Cincinnati Children's Hospital and it has been such a blessing.  We just traveled in the beginning of May and unfortunately had a rough experience.  Miracle Flights booked us a flight from Tampa (our home town) to Denver, CO and then on to Dayton, OH.  I was concerned because our layover in Denver was only 30 minutes, which didn't leave much time for catching another flight.  Of course, our flight out of Tampa was delayed for maintenance issues and we were late arriving in Denver, which caused us to miss our connecting flight.  The most unfortunate part was that Frontier Airlines didn't offer any additional flights to OH until late the next afternoon, but our daughter's appointment was at 2PM.  The airline 'customer service' counter said there was nothing they could do to get us to OH on time and they were extremely rude to our family.  Once we explained our situation and our daughter's medical condition, they accomodated us by booking us tickets on another airline and flew us from Denver to Miami and then from Miami straight into Cincinnati.  This caused a lot of stress for our family...we were in airports and on planes for well over 24-hours straight, which was really difficult on our 2-year old daughter.  We unfortunately did not make it to Cincinnati in time for our appointment, but we were very lucky that the doctors at the hospital were understanding and kept the clinic open until after 6PM for our visit.  During this process, our luggage was lost and all of our hotel accomodations had to be canceled (since we were originally flying into Dayton and then it changed to Cincinnati at the last minute.)  We were disshoveled during our daughter's appointment and that made it a lot more difficult and stressful.  Everything ended up working out and our luggage was brought to the hospital and we had a wonderful rest of our stay in Cincinnati.  This annual visit is always overwhelming and difficult for our family, which is why I try to have as much as I can planned and organized.  Missing our connecting flight made all this spiral out of control and caused a lot of unnecessary stress for us.  As I mentioned earlier, we are so very grateful for Miracle Flights and all they have done for us.  We hope that, by sharing our story, Miracle Flights will not schedule anymore connecting flights for families that are so close and can potentially be missed from even a minor delay.  It's important to remember that families traveling for medical reasons are already under a lot of stress as is, so making the proper accomodations to ensure that they arrive on time for their appointments should be a top priority.

Miracle Flights	109332		/users/profile/148957	mbirr	Client Served	5	04/09/2012	On May 4th of 2010 we learned that our son Anthony, now 7 years old, has a very rare genetic disorder called X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy or ALD.  Since this is an x-linked genetic mutation that is passed to boys from their mothers, we then needed to test our other son Joey who will be 3 years old on March 13th.  His results came back positive for ALD as well.  ALD can be devastating for young boys, it can render a boy totally disabled followed by death if it is not detected early enough.  Ultimately, the adrenal glands can malfunction causing Addisons disease; and the myelin sheath that surrounds the nerves of the brain can be destroyed causing neurological deterioration.  Our family is very fortunate in that our son Anthony has a very wise grandmother who knew about Addisons disease.  She was aware that one of its symptoms was having an all-year-round tan, medically known as hyperpigmentation.  Anthony had a gorgeous tan since the age of two; he would become particularly dark in the summertime.  His grandmother started expressing concern, stating that we should investigate his tan; suggesting that it may not be his Italian roots causing him to be so golden.  It was Anthonys diagnosis of Addisons disease that led us to ALD.  As a result of the adrenal glands being a part of the endocrine system, we were referred to a Pediatric Endocrinologist.  Our sons new specialist was diligent in finding the reason for his adrenal failure; she knew that any young male diagnosed with Addisons disease needed to have ALD ruled out as the cause.  We are so very blessed that Anthonys only symptom of ALD right now is Addisons disease; and Joey currently has no symptoms.  We monitor them both every six months with MRIs of the brain to detect the onset of any loss of the myelin sheath.  There is no cure for ALD, and once the myelin begins to deteriorate the only option is a bone marrow transplant to try and arrest the progression of the disease.  Currently, the Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland conducts a clinical study involving Lorenzos Oil therapy for ALD boys who have normal MRIs. It is believed that boys with no cerebral involvement, who take Lorenzos Oil along with a low fat diet, will reduce their risk of developing any cerebral involvement by 30%.  We had the opportunity of enrolling into this study in February of 2011.  Miracle Flights funded our second trip to Baltimore on March 12, 2012.  We are so grateful and thankful for their generousity.

WOW!!! I spoke to Becky who directed me to their website. From here I printed the forms and a few days later emailed them to Becky. In less than 15 minutes I was speaking again to Becky who qualified our flight times and then 30 minutes later we had the flights booked and the booking reference! Truly a miracle flight for us!!!
Miracle Flights	106830		/users/profile/144449	carmdog	Client Served	5	02/21/2012	We just used Miracle Flights for the first time last week.  My 9-year old son has a brain tumor.  We have been battling this locally for 6 years now.  Finally, his team of local doctors suggested we try a clinical trial that is very specific to his type of tumor in Washington DC.  Although we do have a small emergency fund set aside, I was hoping to use that for a more positive trip for my son.  Miracle Flights helped me and my son get to Washington DC (from Cleveland) to begin this "journey."  We still have to go back to DC once a month (Childrens National Medical Center).  This would have cleaned us out financially AND we probably would've become another forclosure statistic if it weren't for Miracle Flights!

Client Served	5	10/14/2011	I want to thank Miracle Flights for everything thing they have done for me and my family and most importantly my duaghter. Me and my family live in Ontario California we are a family of four now but unfortunately our life did a complete turnaround. My duaghter was  born a healthy baby with no health problems at all, but unfortunately a stomach flu changed her whole life and ours. My daughter was diagnosed with OMS (Opsoclonus Myoclonus syndrome) which is something really rare that i have never heard of. We did  not have a cure or treatment available for my daughter from the doctors here in California, all the doctors could say is this problem your daughter is having will go away with time and it didnt. As parents we looked and looked online trying to get some answers and find someone that could help our daughter get better and be a normal child. We found a doctor in Springfield Illonois that had our answers but the problem was how are we going to get there? We did not have any funds to fly us out there, so now as a parent you have to brace ourselves and figure out who can help? We knew that a possible cure was in Springfield but there was no way of getting there untill we found Miracle Flights on the web. I called Miracle Flights and they were really supportive with every question I had for them. They sent me a packet that had a step by step on what they needed to help me and most importantly to help our sick daughter. I reached out to my daughters doctors, faxed all the paperwork the packet requested and in a day i received the call that changed my daughters lifes and everbodies around her. Miracle Flights called me and told me that we are approved to fly to Springfield Me and my wife and my daughter, there has never been any more better news than to hear Miracle Flights are able to help us. I cant never stop thanking Miracle Flights for all they have done for me and my family and wish that anybody donating to this wonderful organization can realize that its not only families they are helping but they are helping the innocent lives of our babies/children throughout all United States. My daughter found her doctor and is going thru treatment and can now live a normal life thanks to the help of Miracle Flights and her doctor.Thank you soo much for listening to my story and thanks for everything you have done for us and thanks everybody that made it possible for my daughter.

He has had three doctors and many therapy sessions over the years previous to 2009.  In 2009, he woke up one morning and literally, fell out of bed, because he could not walk.  Our previous doctors said there was nothing they could do for him until he was a teenager.  That was four years away.  I could not stand to see my son in pain and not walking if there was something we could do.  I went on the internet and found a doctor in Baltimore, MD who could help him.  We live in Kansas, so it was not an easy decsion to make.  We paid for several flights ourselves until we found Miracle Flights.  They have been such a blessing and so easy to work with.

For this reason, she sees a special pediatric neurosurgeon in Iowa. We live in Memphis.I am a divorced mother of two children and not working as I care for them both. To conserve in costs, I have formerly driven to these appointments which take about 16 hours each way. This is very difficult to do alone both for me and my daughter. On the first trip, I was so exhausted, that I fell asleep behind the wheel momentarily on the return trip. I decided from then on to not try to stretch the trip from 3 to 5 days so that I could stop at a hotel on the way up and on the way back.Also,  I have an old car that is having a lot of problems.Finding this service was a Godsend and made the trip so much better for me and my daughter. The trip is safer and shorter. We would have not been able to afford it. So, we thank all of you for helping us in our time of need.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

We scrimped together enough for the first few visits to fly from our home state of Arizona to Chicago to see THE top doc, but by the fourth visit, our savings was depleted, our family and friends had helped as much as they could and we had come to the realization that if we didn't find help, our daughter would not be able to continue to receive the life saving treatment she so desperately needed. And then a fellow JDM mom mentioned Miracle Flights for Kids. The application process was easy and straightforward, the people who run this organization are kind and I am not exaggerating when I say, we owe them EVERYTHING. I don't even want to think about where we would be without their help. I have joked that I would walk to Chicago with my daughter strapped to my back if that's what I needed to do. Thank God for MFFK, I don't have to do that :)
Miracle Flights	91233		/users/profile/104287	katia cabrera-gonzalez	Volunteer	5	06/17/2011	My name is Katia. I am a 32 years old mother of 2 with Medulloblastoma, a cancerous brain tumor. I have been fighting this since February of 2008. I had 2 brain surgeries, radiation, and chemo. I was cancer free for 1year and a month. Then it was back in April of 2010. My doctor decided to do a bone marrow transplant, so I did that too. I first had another brain surgery, 1 treatment of radiation, and then the transplant. I came out of the hospital after transplant on September 9th, 2010. I had an MRI on January 6th, 2011 and everything was clear. I went back on April 21st for my second MRI thinking everything would be fine. I brought my daughter with me because it was spring break, and it was her 10th birthday. I though we would spend the rest of the day in Boston. The news weren't good. The tumor was all over my brain now. I was hoping for another brain surgery, but it was now inoperable. My neuro-oncologist told me that in his opinion I had fewer than 6months to live. I felt terrible. My daughter was terribly sad, but I promised her that I would fight until the end, and that I wouldn't give up. The only option for my survival was to participate in a Medical Trial out of Pittsburgh, PA. The problem was that not having worked for the past almost 3 1/2 years; I clearly couldn't afford flying weekly to get treatment as it was required by the study. I decided to search on the internet, I also contacted my councilor at Dana Farber, and I came across this organization called Miracle Flights. This was exactly what I needed. They would provide me with every flight I needed to get care. If it wasn't for Miracle Flights For Kids I couldn't continue to fight. I am grateful that I was given another chance to life. Thank you.Sincerely, Katia

Our son was born with a rare craniofacial syndrome that requires many surgeries in the first 2 years of life.  Because his condition was not very common many of the doctors in our area had not seen or worked with a patient like our son.  We found a renowned surgeon in Dallas that specializes in these craniofacial syndromes and naturally we wanted to entrust our son's care to someone with experience.  We have been struggling to keep up with the medical bills and the travel expenses seemed overwhelming.  Miracle Flights for Kids made it possible for us to fly to Dallas for the surgeries that our son needed.  We are incredibly grateful to be given the opportunity to provide our son with excellent medical care and a better quality of life. 
Miracle Flights	90304		/users/profile/102950	joelknakaya	Client Served	5	06/09/2011	I have a 11 year old son who was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called X-Adrenoleukodystrophy in 2009.  We are a family of 4 living in Honolulu, Hawaii.  I am a firefighter with the City & County of Honolulu and my wife is a self employed chef.  There are only 2 facilities in the United States that treat this disease that affects 1 in 18000 boys.  They are the Kennedy Krieger Clinic in Baltimore, Maryland and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  As this is a very serious disease that can be fatal we traveled to both facilities in the Spring of 2009 to get my son checked out.  After seeing 6 doctor's and having a battery of tests performed along with a sedated 3T MRI we were told we had to return to the Mayo Clinic every 6 months for additional testing and MRI's to monitor any progression.  We traveled 2 more times in 2009 and 2010 and spent over $30,000 in medical and travel expenses in 18 months.  For our 4th visit in 2 years we had no way of paying for another trip to Minnesota from Hawaii.  After contacting over 10 charities for any type of financial assistance we found Miracle Flights for Kids in Henderson, Nevada.  These wonderful people and their charity were the only charity out of 10 to offer help to families in the state of Hawaii.  Rebecca Boyce, Director of Operations, helped us every step of the way and arranged for my wife and son to get to the Mayo clinic last July.  The checkup went so well we were told we could extend our time between visits to 11 months.  My family and I just returned from The Mayo Clinic again last month where Miracle Flights for Kids again provided airline tickets for us.  This time for my son, wife and myself and this really helped us immensely.  Even with good medical coverage for my son my plan has doubled our copay starting in 2011  and with airfare running over a $1000 per person for our flights we would not be able to monitor my son's disease without Rebecca Boyce and Miracle Flights.  We are so grateful and humbled to have found this charity and it has helped us focus on our son's health without having the additional burden of mounting debt.  Please include Miracle Flights for Kids as being one of the most caring and helpful non profit organizations in the country. Sincerely and Thankfully,  Joel Nakaya

Client Served	5	06/08/2011	Miracle Flights is an absolutely amazing organization that is a lifesaver for families who have to travel for medical reasons.  As a family who has been dealing with medical expenses for years and weren't sure how to get my son to a top doctor in the field, it was terrifying to think we may not be able to get him the help he needs...until we contacted Miracle Flights.  Their staff is warm, understanding and get what it's like to go through what we do on a daily basis.  We were able to fly from Wisconsin to Georgia without a hitch.  Thank you, Miracle flights!
Miracle Flights	89905		/users/profile/102425	Lorena G.	Client Served	5	06/08/2011	Our daughter, Damaris Izabella Guerra, is 7 years old and we nicknamed her Butterfly. Butterfly has been diagnosed with chronic eosinophilic esophagitis and persistent rhinitis. She has suffered with this condition since 2008. Since November 2008 we have been traveling to Houston, TX, 400 miles away, to see specialists at UTHealth. Butterfly has an upper GI endoscopy performed every 4-5 months (a total of 6) because that is the only way to measure the eosinophil cells in her esophagus. This has cause a huge financial burden on our family. Because her conditions have been very difficult to control, the specialists in Houston referred us to a group of doctors at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital who are the world experts in Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disorders. Due to the financial burden we were currently facing, we were unable to purchase airfare to make this trip to Cincinnati. This trip opened new doors towards our daughters treatment for her condition. We thank Miracle Flights for Kids for the airfare assistance that made this trip possible and appreciate all they do helping families across the nation.

My boys have Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, an incurable debilitating disease.  My boys benefit from the specialized clinic that Cincinnati Children's has.  We do not have this type of clinic where we live.  We could not make a trip like this without the airfare assistance.  We are so grateful to the donors and to the caring staff of Miracle Flights.  The process was clear and easy.  We were given all the information we needed and encouraged to contact Miracle flights with any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend to families: check out Miracle Flights before discarding specialized clinics that might be out of state.  For potential donors: please know what a gift it is for a child to receive needed medical care because of your thoughtfullness.  Thank you all!

Without their help, we would not have been able to fly from Kansas City to New York to have our son's necessary treatments and surgeries.  Not only that, everyone we spoke to was so kind and helpful.  It was very easy to tell that everyone there really wanted to help.   (Our son was born with a rare mixed venous & lymphatic malformation.  He has a trache and feeding tube.  We travel with a feeding pump, suction machine, oxygen concentrator, and pulse oximeter machine.)

Of course we were concerned with how we were going to pay for our flights last minute. We were told about miracle flights so I looked into it. I got in touch with Renecca Boyce who was extremely helpful with giving us the information that we needed to get started, and so mice! I got all the stuff we needed faxed it over and within 20 min I had a flight for my son,husnand, and myself. A huge sigh of relief I was almost in tears! Now we are able to get the best care for our precious angel without losing everything in the process. Miracle Flights thank you for your wonderful staff and help :-) 
Miracle Flights	89068		/users/profile/100936	3ayers	Client Served	5	05/23/2011	Miracle Flights has been great assistance to our family.  We have used the Miracle Flights service twice within the past 8 years.  Our now ten year old son has Cerebral Palsy.  In October, 2003, we flew from AL to St. Louis, MO, for a surgical procedure that changed our son's life forever.  Due to the surgery, he was able to start walking independently!!   Our son had surgery again in Houston, TX, in April 2011.  The service of being able to fly to the surgery destination is priceless.  When you have a child who has just undergone surgery, it is very difficult to travel by car for a long distance.  By being able to fly for these past two surgery procedures, it allowed our family to safely travel, and it gave our son the ability to travel home much sooner by flying than if we had to travel by car.  I can never thank Miracle Flights enough for the support they have shown our family these past years.  I strongly encourage you to contact Miracle Flights if you need their service, and I certainly encourage anyone who is able to donate to this wonderful service.  This is a service that directly helps children in need!

Although she had good doctors here in SC, we wanted to speak with a doctor in Illinois that has been researching and treating OMS for children all over the world.  Within a week of her diagnosis and days before her surgery to have a tumor removed, we had a appointment at Southern Illinois University.  We contacted Miracle Flights a few days later and were able to get a flight right away.  We were on a plane five days later.  Miracle Flights made the hassle and expense of travel the last thing on our minds.  Lainey is now receiving the treatment she needs.

We would not be able to afford to see the experts on our own and they have been a real blessing!

We live just south of St Paul, MN. We wouldn't have been able to go ahead with all the medical testing if it was not for Miracle Flights. We are struggling financially just like everyone else plus we have added challenges/cost because of our son's circumstances. It was nice to know that everyday people like us could get some help to do what is best for their child. I was so surprised how easy it was to get a flight arranged. The staff was very friendly and explained everything. I will definitely use this service again and tell others about it. I comes highly recommended by us!

Miracle Flights	84938		/users/profile/94411	t_hudson	Client Served	5	04/06/2011	I would have to be honest and say that I didn't know much about the Miracle Flights Organization before my families recent personal experience, but have come to appreciate the mission of the organization.  I would have to say that the beginning process of applying was significanlty tedious, but after going through it I understood the reasons for such a comprehensive process.  However, I really appreciated that when I did have questions concerning the process a represenative from the organization was knwoledgeable and warm in responding to our needs.  The only major problem we had was when we arrived at the airport in time it seemed that the agent had difficulty in processing our ticket information which almost resulted in us being late for our flight.  It wasn't clear whether they were making the errors or discrepancies in the processing. Overall, I would say that Miracle fights provided my family with a great service, and I can honestly say that without the financial support for our airplane tickets to Sacremento California we would not have had the opportunity of being evaluated by one of the best doctors in the country who is studying fragile-x syndrome.  If my son and daughter could write you themselves I believe they would thank you from the bottom of their hearts.

I contacted Miracle Flights for Kids (whom we previously used in 2005) to assist us with our travel.  I was believing God that they would at least pay for her flight and received a double blessing by them paying for me, her caretaker.  Her paternal grandmother was able to be booked on our same flight (thanks to MFFK getting us the itinerary in time).  Ms. Rebecca Boyce kept in close contact with me as I gathered all the required documentation and did an exellent job in carrying out our requests.  I highly recommend Miracle Flights for Kids to be recipients of any grants and/or donations that would enable others to be blessed like we were.

As my condition worsened, and my list of brain surgeries stacked up, this was no longer possible, and we were forced to either put flights on our mounting credit card debt or ask family for help. I've looked at many, many organizations that claim to help cancer patients, but don't actually do much but refer you to other organizations or sign you up for a "support group." Miracle Flights for Kids is the exact miracle that a 25 year old kid from Utah had been praying for, and is the first charity that has ever come through for us as victims of cancer.

We have now been privileged to have received help from Miracle flights twice.  We have 3 sons, and our youngest son who is 3 has had health problems since he was 6 months old.  The medical bills and travel requirements have become overwhelming for our family. Feeling that we had drained our resources asking for help from family members, it was such a relief and miracle to have Miracle Flights step in and help.  There are several medical specialists that our son needs that are not available in our area or even in our State.  Because we live on an island, flight is a necessary part of our sons medical care.  Miracle Flights has helped to ease some of that burden.  Because time to care for our sons health needs is also a part of our burden, it was nice that the paper work required to receive help was not too time consuming and the approval process was very quick.  We were pleasantly surprised how quick it was to receive help.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We are so grateful to this organization, and those who have generously donated.

As a parent of a chronically ill child, it is always comforting knowing that I can rely on MFFK.   Not only is the service they provide fantastic, but the support you receive from their staff goes above and beyond any expectations.  I've never met anyone from MFFK, however I feel that I have,  just  from speaking with them.  Their caring, and kind words always help to brighten my day.  In closing, MFFK is simply just that an absolute miracle.  We are truly blessed to have found  them, and are honored are to be a part of such a wonderful organization.

I was researching taking him to a world renown surgeon in Columbus, Ohio for bloodless surgery.  My insurance covered the surgery however it was difficult to come up with the money needed for the flight to get to Ohio.  My Cardiologist informed me that there were organizations that could help with this , so I got in touch with Miracle Flights for Kids who immediately planned my flight and we were able to get there the day before our appointment and leave the day after discharge.  In September 2010, I found out that my son needed another, bigger open heart surgery and I again contacted Miracle Flights for Kids who were so helpful in getting a flight scheduled.  Since we had the best surgeon in the country (my personal belief) my son recovered faster than expected and we were able to adjust our return flight without any problem.  I never could have made it to Columbus without this help.  I am deeply grateful for this organization.

At 3 months old he had surgery to remove the prematurely fused bone in the middle of his forehead. We did not have a doctor qualified in our area who could perform his surgery so we had to travel from North Carolina to Texas for him to receive the endoscopic treatment we wanted him to have. This treatment requires the initial surgery with several return visits for new cranial bands to reshape the triangular forehead his condition left him with and to maintain the space the surgery created to allow his brain room to grown. With the high costs of the medical treatment, the return trips to San Antonio were more than we could afford. Thank the Lord for Miracle Flights for Kids. I have no idea how we would have been able to make these appointments since they are on such short notice because my son is out growing the helmets faster than they can make them it seems. Rebecca is phenomenal. She is so helpful and kind. It is really nice to talk to such caring people during such and stressful time. It really does make the situation a little easier when you have friendly people helping you. I can't thank Miracle Flights for Kids enough for helping our family. God Bless them.

Client Served	4	10/19/2010	Miracle Flights for Kids has helped us four times now, providing flights for us to take my son, Andy, to Baltimore for his Lorenzo's Oil study evaluation with Kennedy Krieger Institute.  With MFK, my son has gotten life saving treatment for his adrenoleukodystrophy.  I am thankful to be able to consult with the doctor in person about the latest research.  As part of the evaluation, my son gets an MRI, which checks for lesions on Andy's brain.  All six MRIs have come back clear, a testament to how well the treatment is working.  But we need this yearly evaluation, in Baltimore, to tell us how well.  That's where MFK comes in.  They provide us with the flights needed to get back and forth.

We knew she had shortened arms, but did not know that her leg was also shorter (about 8").  When we brought her home to the Pacific Northwest, we found out that her leg was correctable by surgery.  Unfortunately for us, the two surgeons who would do such a significant procedure were on the East Coast of the US.  Once we had our appointment with MD, Miracle Flights was able to get us a flight to and from our requested cities in just over 10 business days!  The flights went smoothly and we traveled to and from the surgery just fine.  Miracle Flights really helped us make our daughter's dream come closer to fruition because we were able to travel to get her leg fixed.

My 2 1/2 yr old son has had health problems for over 2 years now.  Medical resources are very limited where we live and the medical doctors here have not yet been able to diagnose my son.  We have drained most of our financial resources for medical appointments, blood tests, medications, supplements, therapies, as well as airfare.  We have been referred out several times to specialists that are thousands of miles away.  This last time we did not have the funds and decided that if we couldn't get financial help then we just wouldn't be able to go (we had already previously asked for help from family members and felt we could not ask again).  It was such a Miracle that we found Miracle Flights and they were able to assist us.  The process was so quick.  Every thing was approved with in 2 weeks.  The staff was so friendly and made us feel really special.  We are so grateful to those who founded Miracle Flights and all those who have donated their time, money, and miles!

Without them I dont think that she would be doing as well as she is today. She was confined to a wheelchair just 2 and a half years ago, I am a single mom with little to no help from her father and barely make it paycheck to paycheck on top of having 2 other children besides Kaylie. They have flown us 3 times to Illinois getting us to the appointments and doctors that we need to see. Due to her illness she has to go in for a spinal tap every time we see them. They have always been helpful and do what they can to assist you in all aspects of getting to where you need to go at an affordable price. It costs me $100 for them to fly us to Illinois when 2 plane tickets would cost far more than that when we make more than one trip there a year. Honestly I dont know what I would do if they were not there to help us get where we need to go. I thank God that there is a program out there to assist all of us who have a child that needs to get somewhere else for proper treatment. They are a godsend and alot easier to get ahold of than other agencies I have tried to get help from. Thank you for all you do and all you will continue to do for families of children who need to see other doctors.

Miracle Flights	45534	3	/users/profile/46423	mmolnar	Client Served	5	06/24/2010	My son (2 years 6 months) was born with multiple Lymphangiomas (vascular tumors); which are located behind his left eye, the tip and side of his nose, and side of his face.  He was misdiagnosed from birth until 18 months of age.  We have seen many doctors and specialists and until August 2009 they were not able to confirm what the lesions were.  The Lymphangioma that is wrapped around Brogans optic nerve has caused him to lose most of his vision in his left eye.  Because of this, he has had glasses since he was five weeks old.  If not treated, the lesions will grow as Brogan grows and cause more health issues.  By a miracle we located a group of Endovascular surgeons in New York that have been treating Brogan with Sclero Therapy treatments since August 2009.  The doctors still do not have a time frame or a number of procedures left before the Lymphangiomas are diminished.  Brogan is reacting very well to the treatments and they plan to continue with them until he is not.  We will be making our fifth trip to New York City on June 17, 2010 for another treatment (five trips in ten months).  We are extremely excited for Brogan and will do whatever it takes to get him the help that he needs.Miracle Flights for Kids has helped us tremendously in the past.  We would not have been able to help Brogan without this support and feel very blessed!

I have conducted hundreds of interviews on behalf of Miracle Flights for Kids, with people who have received flights for their sick children.  The overwhelming response was always positive and very grateful.Many of the stories are heart-wrenching as they involve life-and-death scenarios for the children, who are still alive because of a flight they received.  Many of the families who receive flights have children with special needs  most often requiring great medical expenses.  Their courage and endurance in meeting these expenses was always sobering.  To know that they had someone to turn to when their situation became overwhelming was a great source of comfort and gratitude.This is an organization that makes a real difference in many, many lives.

Miracle Flights	8003	12	/users/profile/9825	mse	Client Served	1	07/30/2009	This charity requires you send a photo of yourself before they will donate a flight. I have gone through several other charities for free flights to treatment and have never been asked for a photo.  To ask is one thing but these people REQUIRE it before they will consider giving you a flight for cancer treatment.  Having cancer is horrible. Telling friends and family that you have cancer is difficult. Letting current or future jobs know of your diagnosis is also difficult...cancer becomes a part of your identity. If you need assistance to pay for services you are required to share all your very personal medical information, call many numbers, talk about your cancer and divulge extremely personal information just to get some assistance. I understand why this is and that its necessary but to take it a step further and also require I send you a photo of myself, thats one step too far.What could be the purpose? Everyone knows you cannot get on a flight without a picture ID. All my medical information includes my full name and social security number.  I know what they want my photo for....PROMOTION! Well to that I say "NO" I am not going to be exploited because I have cancer. You do not get a picture of a sick young woman who needs chemo/radiation and surgeries. It makes me sad that a charity that is suppose to be doing something good insists they the right to require so much from the one in need. They feel its their right to know every personal detail about your battle with cancer and then put a photo of you in their file to complete their intrusion.  I would rather not get my treatment than to let an organization violate my privacy any more than it already has!

I am from Navrongo in the Upper East Region of Ghana.Being the best scholarship program in the University of Ghana in transforming the lives of needy but brilliant students whom the lives of families, communities, and the countrys hope depend on, Educational Pathways International has achieved its goals. I was selected for the scholarship program after applying and going through a number of interviews.  Being a beneficiary of this scholarship for the past three years is a life changer and blessing to me. Being the first member of my family to come to the University would have been a nightmare. Not only have my fees been paid over the past three years but also my accommodation was paid as well as money to buy books and for my upkeep. Three years as a beneficiary of Educational Pathways International has made tertiary education less stressful and gave me the peace of mind to concentrate on my studies.Aside paying for our school fees, accommodation and our upkeep, Educational Pathways International always has a coordinator and an office where we meet periodically for guidance counseling concerning our educational and social welfare. This has helped me a lot in terms of social and educational life.Educational Pathways International also inculcates the spirit of giving back to society in us through internships we do during our vacation periods at home. Not only do we give back but also this helps us develop our educational and professional career.

From the family I come from, I thought tertiary education was only meant for the rich in our society and then came the timely intervention of this charitable organization to prove me wrong, that is Educational Pathways International. They inspired and motivated me to work realizing success is non-dependent on your financial background.Being part of this reputable family, I feel honored and blessed. Not only has it made education smooth and interesting to me. It has also help build my life through meetings and interactions with other beneficiaries and most importantly lessons learnt from guidance and counseling sessions with respect to my social and educational welfare. This has helped me concentrate and perform well in the University. Again inculcated in me is the spirit of togetherness and helping others become successful as one succeeds in life. Because of EPI, I have acquired some practical skills through internship programs we are supposed to engage in during vacations which I think would improve my curriculum vitae and prepare me for the job market.Without EPI, tertiary education would have been the last thing to think of for me, for this I would like to say kudos to EPI for its priceless works, transformation of lives and putting smiles on the faces on needy but brilliant students in Africa, Ghana to be precise.Hassan Ishaosecond yearBusiness schoolUniversity of Ghana

I am a third year Bsc.Administration student (majoring in Banking and Finance) at the University of Ghana Business School.After my senior high education, I had to do menial jobs but however, none of the jobs paid well and my aim of saving for university education was not realised. I thought my dreams of furthering my education was not going to happen until I met Educational Pathways International (EPI) when I got admission into the University of Ghana.Since I got this privilege, my life has been changed. I am now able to focus on my academics and on building a secured future for myself and my family. My parents do not have to be burdened with my fees, books, accommodation and feeding costs since it is all covered by my scholarship from EPI.With the counselling, personal development training and internship opportunities being provided by EPI, it has been a great blessing to me not just financially. EPI is truly a holistic scholarship scheme that transforms the lives and destinies of its beneficiaries. EPI is worth recommending for its dedicated and selfless support to the youth of Ghana. Thanks to Mr and Mrs Lafrance, our country coordinator and the sponsors of the EPI program. God bless you.

Client Served	4	02/23/2017	Im glad to have this rare opportunity to share with the world how Educational Pathways International (EPI) is a blessing to my family and me. I come from a single parenting home where finance to feed was a problem for the family, not to talk of education. I took a leap of faith when I decided to come to the University, because there was no way I could have finished my four years course with my familys meagre income.  In 2015, EPI came to my University (University for Development Studies), that marks the beginning of my songs of joy. I was among the five gifted students who were awarded a three years full Scholarship by EPI. This scholarship package includes: school fees, books allowance, stipend and accommodation fee. This means EPI has taken full responsibility of my financial needs without requesting for anything in return. This is a great relief to my family and myself since we dont have to worry about my educational financial needs.  Aside the financial support EPI gave me, they have created a great and wonderful family for us (beneficiaries). Though we are from different campuses of the same University; offering different disciplines; different ethnic groups and religion, EPI has put all of us together to make a strong and harmonious family. This has taught me that the development of our country (Ghana) is only possible when we put our differences aside and focus on our common goal of making our country a better place. EPI also has a monthly seminar to provide extracurricular support for all beneficiaries, where we are taken through life-transforming topics like how to set and achieve goals.  Let me not mince words, being part of the Educational Pathways International (EPI) family is one of the best things that has happen to me. EPI has touch my life, brought relief to my family, possible transformation to my nation (Ghana) and an opportunity of change to the world. Kudos EPI.

After staying at home for a year upon senior high school completion, I had no hope of being in the university but here I am at last, and since then, I have been struggling to make ends meet. I had no idea how I was going to go through this 6-year programme of study in the midst of such financial difficulties. There came Educational Pathways International (EPI). I have been an EPI Scholar not long ago (since November, 2016), but within this short while, my family is relieved and I also enjoy a peaceful mind as I now need not worry about my academic and accommodation fees  all covered by EPI as well as other expenses. Not only that, EPI is a wonderful family that promotes social integration among all scholars and also organizes workshops and other leadership seminars for us. I am so fortunate and glad to be a scholar of EPI and I am so grateful to the Lafrance family. I am much convinced that EPI is the best of the few organizations trying to change our world into a better place.

I almost gave up on education due to my inability to financially support my self. When all hopes and aspirations of becoming a medical doctor were virtually shuttered, then came my 'salvage family' EPI in the 2016/2017 academic year. Aside the financial benefits I get from EPI, it has given me the opportunity to meet and share interesting moments of academic and career importance, with people of diverse origins, both in EPI family and my school in particular. Thanks to EPI, the Lafrances and Madam Eunice, today I can learn in the same environment with my mates who can afford university education so easily. With the impact EPI is making on needy students and society, I hope and wish that EPI continues to exist to support many others like me, so that together we can effect a positive and progressive change in Ghana and beyond. Long live EPI  benefactors! long live EPI beneficiaries!! long live EPI!!!

I'm in my second year and offering Bsc. Nursing.Ever since I joined EPI, It has been a dream come true for me to be able to complete my degree with ease. It wasn't easy starting as I have to do extra work alongside my loaded courses in school before I will be able to cater for the basic needs of life and cope with life. Joining EPI has not only reduced my burden for me to get more time for my studies but also it has expose me to a family whose members are scholars. Now I'm compelled to study harder than I used to do to be able to cope with my EPI family members which has converted in helping me maintain high standard in my academics.Besides, I must say EPI is the best  scholarship scheme to join. Our alumni are always there to help us make it to our dreams in school. I can't count out a single day that they were not around to encourage, motivate and inspire us to do better in all our courses.Not forgotten how EPI has expose us to leadership roles to change our home country in our generation. Just recently a workshop that was organized by the Transforming leadership Ghana of which EPI scholars were part has really enlightened my knowledge on how to be and what it takes to be a competent and transformed leader. With these training gained in school, I'm rest assured of making a great change in my country some years to come. Without EPI, this my talent and the gel of making a difference in my country would have been a hidden dream.In fact there are more to talk about EPI but most of it is what I have elaborated above and wished that EPI stands tall at everyplace it goes because it is really making students who are poor but brilliant reach their goals.Thank you

I am so proud to talk of Educational Pathways International because it is not just a scholarship scheme, but a very great family and mirror of life.Educational Pathways International is a Non Profit Organization that has taken it upon herself to help bring out refined people in the society to make great positive changes in the society.  From my point of view, EPI does not support my financial needs but cater for my financial needs. After catering for my financial needs, EPI guides me in life. EPI through the coordinators teach us how we can be good leaders, how we can set goals and achieve them, how we can manage our time and Finances and so many other things which are the pillars of success in life. EPI also fosters a good social relationship omongst the members. We all know one another. Each time I meet an EPI beneficiary, I see that that this is my family member. We chat and are always nice to one another. EPI also monitors our lifestyle and our academic life to ensure that no one is in trouble. EPI encourages us to move on. Educational Pathways International has been catering for my needs. My emotional needs, my finance needs, social needs and many others. It has made me see the world differently and I have become different. Besides the financial needs it cater, EPI shows us how to move around in life.  EPI trains us so that we will leave the school more refined than the school alone could have. I learn a lot from the training EPI gives  me. It is so great to have EPI. It is such a great blessing to Help EPI carry out its invaluable role in the society.

I am in my final year in the University of Ghana and majoring in Economics. As a beneficiary of the Educational Pathways International Scholarship, I have been receiving financial support for my university education.I am in a family of eleven members including my parents with a high dependency burden as most of us are still in school. My father has been the main bread winner for the past few years because of my mothers ill health, making it difficult for most of us to go higher in our education.EPI has made it possible for me to further my education to the university level by providing full support for my tuition, lodging, books and other expenses on my stay on campus. I am the first to attend a university in my family. It would have been difficult for me to obtain a university education without EPI. EPIs financial support has not only made my university education possible but it also reaffirms that my dreams are possible.Besides EPI financial support, I have been receiving counseling and guidance with regards to my academic life, career development and leadership thus helping me to stay focus and excel academically and in all aspects of my life.  EPI also provides me with an opportunity to have internship service in my home country Ghana during the long vacation each year which gets me fully engaged so I can take leading role in wherever I find myself during and after school.

Through all the changing scenes of life, God has seen me through with the help of Educational Pathways International (EPI).Life would not have seen me to this day in the University if not for EPI. I lost my father four(4) months prior to my West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE) sitting in 2012 and as I sat behind the WASCE papers writing my final examination, one song kept reoccurring in my head, the song entitled ( Through all the changing scenes of life), a popular hymn gave me strength and comforted me not to lose hope. The words: When there is a dream, there is a way, kept me determined as I put in all my best and came out with flying colors after Senior High School  (SHS). As to how I will continue my education I had no idea. After getting admission into the premier university and still wondering how I was going to pay my school fees and cater for myself throughout my four-year program, I gained a scholarship from Educational Pathways International.EPI has been of great immense help to me. With EPI, I got the opportunity to leave through my 3 and half years university education with joy and peace of mind and a sound mind to study intensely. EPI has been the backbone of my university education, it provided for my school fees, accommodation fees, feeding fees, and also paid for my study materials throughout my stay here in Legon. My academics have just been growing from best to more best and most best (if there are words like that). EPI also gave me the opportunity to have internships during long vacations and this has helped sharpened my corporate skills and has made me ready for the job market outside there. We also have meetings about three times every semester with our Coordinator which we discuss about life goals, basic aspects of life like time management, preparation of CV, etc. She is always there for us and we always run to her side and lean on her with all our troubles. Aunty as we affectionately call her always makes sure we leave her side with beaming smiles.My glory, my joy, my success, and all I am today, I owe it all to God and to EPIEducational Pathways International, Ayekooooo. May God continue to provide for all your needs so that our younger ones will keep benefiting from it. God richly bless you Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance ( the EPI presidents) and the entire organization. To Aunty Eunice, we say God richly bless you for taking the patience to go through life with us. We love you all EPI, you are a true definition of a great non-profit organization.

Business Administration in the University of Ghana Business School.My mother, who solely took care of 6 children, could not stop praying and thinking of how to help me and my siblings to further our courses. Educational Pathways International (EPI) helped in taking the mental stress and anxiety in relation to questions such as: How do I pay the next school fees, how do I pay my hall of residence fees, and how am I going to feed myself whiles on campus, how do I buy books and vital educational materials relevant to my studies. With all those thoughts in mind initially, I dont know how effective my studies would have been. Perhaps I may have to drop out.Educational Pathway International has given me the greatest opportunity and breakthrough in my life, such that, I can take my course with a free and concentrated mind. EPI has helped me mentally to boost my self-confidence as I can now consider myself as worth equal to other students.  With EPI, even my mom who has high blood pressure, has been relieved off such a burden. I owe all gratitude to EPI. Thanks to EPI, I have a concentrated mind to take my course, and shape the future of Ghana and the world at large, l also have an increased self-esteem. Long live EPI.

Educational Pathways International	281121	1	/users/profile/371146	Prince B.	Client Served	5	02/29/2016	 THE JOURNEY SO FARI want to begin by talking about education. Education is very necessary tool in our lives we cant do without. In fact its importance cannot be underestimated. To stress on how important it is in our lives, Nelson Mandela had this to say and I quote, EDUCATION IS THE MOST POWERFUL WEAPON WHICH YOU CAN USE TO CHANGE THE WORLDThe fingers they say are not equal and so it is in this world, we are all different. Some have it, others have it in abundance and others dont have at all and that is where the spirit of interdependence lies. You scratch my back and I scratch yours. There are so many scholarship awarding groups or agencies around but I can confidently stick my neck out on any day and say that Educational Pathways International (EPI) is one of the best so far since its inception, in doing justice in helping needy and gifted students. Why do I even say so?I remember that fateful day in September, 2010 when upon a visit to a friend who was also in commonwealth hall at the University of Ghana, entered into a conversation. This conversation was about no one but EPI and that was when the name EPI first came into contact with my life.The EPI journey began in 2011 and I must say that I am where I am today not only by the Grace of God but also, because of EPI. In fact I owe my success to them. One must be wondering what at all EPI has done to receive such accolades. Most scholarship programs cater for four year university programs but not EPI. EPI sponsors the whole of my seven year medical program. EPI not only caters for my school fees which is highly exorbitant but also cost of my feeding, accommodation and books. So I can say the stethoscope I use now EPI bought it for me. The big medical books I own and read EPI bought them for me. These are the things ideally parents do for their wards but it was unfortunate my parents were not in that capacity to do that but then EPI did that. I call EPI family because its only family who can take proper and holistic care of its own. Others may try but not ones family. You can just envision the effects it has had on me so far. I must say am at my best at the moment. Mention the best students in the medical school class of 2016, and you will find me amongst them. This is not to blow my horns but you see, when you find yourself doing what you always loved to do thats your passion, its like a talent, you dont struggle and success just keep coming your way. Looking back, I can just imagine how life would have been without EPI. The struggles to pay fees, how difficult it would have been acquiring books to read and food to eat and even the psychological effects. How would I even concentrate on my studies and how would I be able to get the best out of myself knowing in the next moment I would be sacked for unpaid fees. Thanks to EPI that other life never became a reality. You see EPI is not interested in giving only money to needy students in fact, they go beyond that. They go the extra mile to do extra curricula activities. They get resourceful people to teach and equip the beneficiaries with hands on skill to complement what they acquire from the school. For instance, a business student is taught practically on how to work in an office and not only sitting in a lecture hall for lectures and graduating with no employable skills. Aside that, they make ensure students do an attachment in their various fields of study. So using myself as an example here, during my vacation, I joined a hospital and with what I have acquired so far I put it to use and also learn more from there. So tell me where can you get this? Trust me you cant get this anywhere but EPI. EPI is gradually spreading its wings. At first it was only universities, but now deprived senior high schools as well. I think EPI deserves a big clap here! Asafo Senior high school is the adopted school so far. We get the opportunity to mentor the little ones in this senior high school. I remember in June 2012, I had the opportunity of spending two weeks with them and it was an encounter. There and then I realized how powerful motivational words were. To some of them, they only needed encouraging words. To others, they wanted to hear that they could make it despite finding themselves in a less endowed school. My heart melted that day with the look on their faces, when I challenged them to make it despite their challenges. I was a perfect example here considering my needy background. Before I continue, I must point it out that my struggles in life did not only begin in the university. It started in senior high school. I started school two months after school had reopened due to lack of funds. Eventually two scholarships helped me sailed through. These were Government Bursary and Cocoa Farmers scholarship. I made it big at the end and had admission to both University of Ghana  and Kwame  Nkrumah University of Science and Technology  (KNUST). So back to the Asafo issue, I easily identified with them and motivated these young ones in every way possible. The school was also under staffed so I also helped out in teaching elective Mathematics and Biology. I didnt have to wait to finish school before contributing to the society, but whiles still in the program the opportunity was made available to reach out to these ones and encourage them to give off their best. As you read this now we have a number reading various programs in the university. We take pride from the fact that we have also been of help to others and this was made possible through EPI.  Last but not the least, if you want to know how vibrant and successful any academic institution will be, just take a closer look at their alumni. EPI alumni are a league of professionals who are at various levels in the society. We have Doctors, Chartered Accountants, Bankers, Teachers, Engineers and other professionals as well as those doing their Masters programme both abroad and in Ghana all working tirelessly for the upliftment of not only themselves but also the society. Contributions towards EPI are numerous and cant be mentioned. It s another family altogether there and we still owe it all to EPI.Thankfully, I am six months away to the completion of my seven year medical program. A flash back at the years gone by, if I am to pinpoint the backbones of my successes chalked so far, its made possible first and foremost by the Grace of God. My sincerest and heartfelt gratitude goes to the pioneers and vision bearers Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance. Honestly Im at a loss for words. These persons see the potentials in people and they nurture it out of them for the benefit of themselves and the society. They make sure nothing becomes an impediment in that process. The best gift one can ever give to another is knowledge for knowledge indeed is power. I say God richly bless you for leaving the comfort of your home in United States to be a part of my life here in Ghana. To the board members and staff of EPI,  blessings and long life and prosperity will look for them chase them and never depart from them and their families. Its my prayer many donors out there will be encouraged by your works and follow your example.   Together you and I will make the world a better place.  I am Prince G. Barning a final year Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery at the University of Ghana.

Administration. After I completed senior High school I was less confident that I can go to the university due to the lack of funding situation I face. My family earns a very low income and so it was difficult to get enough money to pay for my educational charges. At a point in time I wanted to give up because of my financial need situation. I applied to some universities across the country but although I did get admission into some of these institutions I couldnt start my university education because I couldnt afford to pay the academic fees.In 2015, I read about the Educational Pathways International ( EPI) Scholarship Program on the University of Ghana website and I decided to apply to become part of the program. I went through the necessary procedures laid down and consequently, I was awarded with the full benefits of the EPI scholarship program. This enabled me to start with my university education at the University of Ghana and I am in my second year now. I have also gained much confidence in myself after passing the rigorous interview with the founders and team of EPI. Moreover, the periodic training sessions given to beneficiaries by the EPI Program Coordinator equipped me with knowledge I knew less of. For example, through one of the training sessions I learned how to prepare a good curriculum vitae.The EPI program has been a blessing for me and I am grateful to God and the founders for the benefits I am receiving.

During my undergrad years when it seemed that inadequate financial resources were going to end my educational dream, Educational Pathways International (EPI) came to my rescue. The organization financed my education and was a great pillar to lean on in other aspects of life too.Through EPI, I gained another set of family. A family that encourages me and has my interest at heart. Knowing that Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance and EPI saw talent and a great future in me, I was motivated to realize my full potential. Being with EPI has been a great and wonderful experience; an experience that promises no end with the strong and wonderful relationship built with the Lafrances and other beneficiaries.Its been six years since EPI came to my aid and three years since I graduated from the University of Ghana Business School with first class honors in BSc. Administration. Currently, I work as a Forex Sales Officer with the Treasury department of UT Bank Ltd, in Accra, Ghana. I hope to further my education and become a Lecturer in finance. Its my dream to strengthen my knowledge in finance and teach it to others to help grow the economy of Ghana and Africa. This is because, I strongly believe that it is mainly through education that Ghana and other developing countries will be empowered to develop their economies on their own. EPI has empowered me to change my society and simultaneously made it possible for me to follow alongside to empower others. The most crucial step in embarking on my dream has been made possible by EPI.Thank you EPI!

I have had my share of the challenges; ranging from financial through to social. Bravo!! to the Educational Pathways International (EPI) which came to show me light in my dark tunnel.I joined the EPI family in my third year in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Being offered Business Administration, I wondered how my four years on campus would be and how I was going to sail through the heddles in climbing the educational ladder. The Educational Pathways International scholarship has lifted this burden, promising me a smooth sail through the financial support, mentoring, counseling and love shown to me as a beneficiary. Multitude of words cannot say all what this scholarship has offered the less privileged in the Ghanaian society but indeed your sacrifice is greatly appreciated. I am Ruth Z. Nagre. 
Educational Pathways International	281108		/users/profile/371131	Writer	Client Served	5	02/29/2016	Kornyoh Enyonam Peter is my name. I am the youngest child in a family of five (mom, dad, my eldest sister and my elder twin brother).  I come from Aflao in the Volta region of Ghana. I spent most of my hay days in Kumasi where I was brought up. I had my primary school education in Kumasi, proceeded to St. Peters secondary school in the Eastern region and currently I am in the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology offering Bsc. In Civil Engineering. I am a beneficiary of the Education Pathways International Scholarship to brilliant but needy students in the university. I am very grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for their generosity to many people in Africa of which I am apart. The depth of appreciation for this act of benevolence cannot easily be quantified. Many a time, when I envisage my days back in the primary, secondary and my first year in the university (the period prior to obtaining this scholarship) I am short of words of the goodness of the Lord in my life through the life of the Lafrance. My parents had to hustle through the hot weather day in and day out to pay our fees. Many times the money accrued in their endeavours could not cater for all of our fees and they resort to taking of loans from the bank to pay our fees. Though other necessary items such as books were still not available we still had to bear with our condition knowing our parents we doing whatever they could do in their capacity.One major deadlock was when my twin brother and I gain admission into the university. The tuition fees and accommodation bills were that huge compared to their capacity that the option of one of us staying back in the house whiles the other continue with university education was being contemplated upon. But my parents still went for more loans to pay or our fees.To cut this long story short, I did not know how my parents were going to survive with the culture of taking loans from the bank to foot all our bills in school for the next four years of university education knowing that they already owe some banks. But thanks be unto God, a senior friend introduced me to EPI and today I can boldly say that since then my university tuition fees, my accommodation fees, feeding money and my books for studies have all been taken care off by EPI.I am so happy in school, I am among the best in my class and I look forward into the future with great hopes and expectation, thanks be to God and the EPI fraternity. To the Lafrance I am forever grateful. I thank God for the life of Auntie Eunice, our coordinator, for all the life changing topics she teaches us to mould our lives in preparation for the world out there. To the whole EPI family I am so excited and happy I am apart of you.

Civil Engineering was a great opportunity the Lord granted to me. I nearly gave up when I entered the class for the first time to meet fellow course mates who are well motivated and were expectant to excel in their academics. For me, encountering Educational Pathways International (EPI) and being a member of this great family was the turning point in my life. My outlook about life, academics and my goals went through a great transformation. Through the family love, education and encouragement from the various personnel in this noble organization, I began to believe and know that there is no limitation to life and success. One major advantage about EPI is the financial benefit they provide to their beneficiaries. There have never been a semester I had to struggle about my welfare and finances. I believe I owe it to God and to Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance. I am now in final year of a class population of about 185 students and I am happy to say I am among the first five excellent students in the class. I know my future is great and I have a lovely family here in EPI and they are ever ready to support me in my pursuit for greatness. In EPI I have come to learn and live by some virtues which are priceless, teaching us to walk in love, to care for others and to give back to the society and make impact in every place we go. Words cannot describe how grateful I am to be a member of this family.

Educational Pathways International	280966		/users/profile/370962	Writer	Client Served	5	02/26/2016	One may say, there are many non-governmental financial institutions that sponsor brilliant but needy students all over the world, so why is Educational Pathways International (EPI) distinct.EPI is distinct in the sense that it offers the students not only  financial help that care for their school fees but also cater for their accommodation,  books and handouts, feeding and any other thing that the student may use the many for: investment, caring for other needs in their families and many others.        Apart from the financial add, EPI offers the students more.EPI Family is made up of the beneficiaries, the sponsors, the President, the Vice President and  the Programme Coordinator.  EPI family gives us a sense of belonging. Going for a family meeting gives me hope that I am meeting again a family that shares a lots in common and have the same ultimate goal of making it, reaching greater heights and giving back to society despite financial constraints which the organization is helping us with.These EPI family meetings that are held several times a semester gives each student the chance to share with the rest of the group their goals and how they plan on achieving them. This has helped me a lot personally because I get encouraged and motivated by the other students and this helps me to do more in my area of study. Not only do I get motivation and encouragement from the other students but also from the President and the Programme Coordinator.The meetings also prepare us to fit perfectly in the world where ever we find ourselves. The Programme Coordinator teaches us many things we will not be taught in the class room including time management, goal setting and entrepreneurship among others. These sessions have doubtless helped me become a better person especially in the area of time management.Internships during the holidays which is a requirement of every student on the scholarship has helped all of us a lot especially me. During the internship I get the opportunity to give back to society my services and it has also helped prepared me for the job market and I also got the opportunity to practically apply what I leant theoretically.I have also benefitted from EPI psychologically in that  I have no cause to worry about how my fees are to be paid or how I will buy my books and handouts or feed because all these have been catered for.                                                                                                                                        Regular excursions organized has helped me released stress after all the tiring school work.EPI has actually made my dreams come true. It is a family that treats all her beneficiaries equally and make sure that we complete school as whole persons and be fully prepared fully for the world.  Thanks to Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance ,  our Programme Coordinator and the sponsors.

Joining EPI has not only reduced my burden for me to get more time for my studies but also it has expose me to a family whose members are scholars. Now I'm compelled to study harder than I used to do to be able to cope with my EPI family members which has converted in helping me maintain high standard in my academics.Besides, I must say EPI is the best  scholarship scheme to join. Our alumni are always there to help us make it to our dreams in school. I can't count out a single day that they were not around to encourage, motivate and inspire us to do better in all our courses.Not forgotten how EPI has expose us to leadership roles to change our home country in our generation. Just recently a workshop that was organized by the Transforming leadership Ghana of which EPI scholars were part has really enlightened my knowledge on how to be and what it takes to be a competent and transformed leader. With these training gained in school, I'm rest assured of making a great change in my country some years to come. Without EPI, this my talent and the gel of making a difference in my country would have been a hidden dream.In fact there are more to talk about EPI but most of it is what I have elaborated above and wished that EPI stands tall at everyplace it goes because it is really making students who are poor but brilliant reach their goals.Thank you

Although, I joined the programme just this academic year, the package the programme promises is enormous and no one is made left out in decision making. The local Coordinator calls on each beneficiary to check on us with respect to how we are coping with academics and every aspect of life in general. It gives me great pleasure to give my heartfelt acknowledgement to such an amazing God-sent organization. Through their endless support to me towards my education I will forever remain grateful and indeed only words cannot express that.Educational Pathways International (EPI) is the most charitable organization that seeks to help the less privileged in tertiary institution with extraordinary academic performance especially in Africa, precisely Ghana. Once one becomes a beneficiary, he or she is taken through training that would equip such an individual holistically to develop his or her skills for the competitive world. It refines all its beneficiaries to take up responsibilities and contribute their quota to the development of their nation. With the help of this great organization, Ghana would develop tremendously from one level to another since as part of their training, being innovative and creative is a core discipline instilled in its beneficiaries.Indeed life would have been a mess for me and my family if I did not obtain this indispensable financial aid for my university education. Great relief was restituted into my life when I was awarded the most enviable scholarship on campus. The Educational Pathways International (EPI) Scholarship Programme is second to none as far as university education in Ghana especially at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) is concerned. This is because of the numerous avenues and opportunities provided by the scholarship scheme.The organization teaches all its beneficiaries to be kind hearted and give back to the society through volunteering community services such as taking part in annual internship programmes and teaching at a remote community, to mention but a few. With this group by my side I know I would contribute immensely to national development through my unwavering service to my community and beyond. Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance, your commitment to assist, inspire and motivate the brilliant but needy students to complete their university education will have a lasting impact since posterity would also be affected positively. Long live the duo, Auntie Eunice (the local Coordinator), the legacy and every stakeholder in this programme. Thank you and God bless you abundantly.
Educational Pathways International	280844	1	/users/profile/370823	Writer	Client Served	5	02/24/2016	My encounter with Educational Pathways International (EPI) scholarship program has triggered an indelible positive change in my life. This program has contributed immensely to various aspects of my life as a student of the University of Ghana.To begin with, EPI has given me financial stability by covering my tuition, residential, books and other incidental cost. This has enabled me to concentrate fully on my studies in other to achieve my goals and objectives as a student.More so, the internship opportunities that I have had on this program has equipped me with the needed skills that will enable me thrive excellently in the corporate world. EPI has enabled me to relate directly what I have learnt in school to the job environment via these internship programs. I have equally had the chance to work with one of the EPI alliances, which is University Studies Abroad Consortium (USAC), through the buddy system; this has equipped me with relevant years of experience in international exchange program management and has equally influenced my career path. I dont want to be an agent of change in my home country alone but in Africa and the world at large.The most exciting part is that I feel this sense of belonging and family bond in EPI. The regular meetings that are organized for us and luncheons allow me the opportunity to meet my other colleagues on the program and to share ideas and opinions, it also serves as a constant reminder of the fact that I need to fulfil my obligation as a higher achiever.  We also get to have free training seminars on wide range of subject matters and I have benefited greatly from them. The ever active EPI alumni system assures me that I would never lose this sense of belonging. I anxiously await the opportunity to join the system and contribute my quota towards the give back to society project.I am very grateful to Mr & Mrs Lafrance and all the EPI partners who have contributed towards making my University education a reality. I will graduate some few months away knowing that I wouldnt have made it this far without Educational Pathways International Scholarship Program. It is the best program that any student can ever be enrolled on. This is because, EPI transforms life, foster academic development and help a nation grow.Parrendah Adwoa KpeliFinal YearBSc.

Educational Pathways International	280829	2	/users/profile/322126	Diana O.	Client Served	5	02/24/2016	I am writing this review as an alumna of this prestigious scholarship. I talk about how accountable and successful I have become, in all aspects of my life, as a result of adhering to the discipline that was required for me to maintain the scholarship throughout my tertiary education.  On Wednesday 10th September 2008, I officially signed the EPI Scholarship Acceptance letter granting me full-time scholarship, board and tuition for my Ashesi University College education in Ghana. Appending that signature, after reading and agreeing to the terms of the scholarship, was like swearing an oath of allegiance to my home country and promising to be the best that I can be in every endeavor. I wholeheartedly embraced the challenge and looked forward to growing and inspiring others from freshman year to senior year. Fortunately, Ashesis curriculum empowered me to achieve my goals. Today, 8 years later, I have become a savvier and more mature computer science graduate spearheading a purposeful organization that promotes digital literacy. If the president of a country does not fulfill his or her manifesto within 8 years, then the people will certainly believe that their president abused their trust and blew an opportunity to impact a whole generation  especially when their governance was not transparent. When we take the EPI Scholar to mean the president of a country and EPI to mean the people, this statement becomes an allegory for justifying why the EPI put specific clauses in the Scholarship Acceptance letter, ensuring that my colleagues and I graduate as balanced individuals with both academic prowess and a social conscience. One of such clauses was for each EPI Scholar to PURSUE PERSONAL SERVICE during vacation and non-school periods and to REPORT ON THE SERVICE EXPERIENCE because personal service is considered such as important element as we pursue our academic careers.  Knowing that I was required to continually serve others while maintaining outstanding academic records to remain qualified for the EPI scholarship empowered me to refine my time management skills and consequently impacted my level of success and self-accountability. Overall, it was a very good discipline for me to independently take charge of my academic progress, personal service and achievements and EPIs feedback and support encouraged me to persist.  My personal service pursuits transformed and enriched me and enhanced my soft skills for problem-solving. I learned to look at the big picture of Ghanas development and realized what I could contribute via my talents and hard skills. My purposeful organization thus employs innovative and creative techniques to ensure that our digital literacy solutions are viable, contextualized, learner-centered and sustainable. It is impacting a generation of young leaders just as EPIs scholarship impacted me. EPI is proud of me. I am equally proud of myself for surmounting personal challenges to become the best version of myself today, contributing to sustainable growth in my home country, Ghana.  One of the personal service opportunities I leveraged was song competitions. EPI promoted my first single, Ubuntu, beyond the shores of Ghana to a Women of Africa forum in Nevada because the lyrics were about women empowerment. That is one way EPI has supported my holistic development since 2008 for me to become a balanced, savvy and mature technologist. I am currently the Creative Director of a unique all-female live band in Ghana poised to present traditional African rhythms to the rest of the world. Another way EPI has supported me beyond a scholarship offer and massive appreciation for my music was encouraging me to apply to the 2016 Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, a merit-based open competition launched by President Obama.  I look forward to growing with the EPI alumni family and applying my profession to more personal service opportunities. EPI certainly deserves the 2016 Award for Top Rated Non-Profit because they are positively impacting generations of Ghanaian youth who graduate top of their class with the humility to reach out to serve others everywhere they go.   
Educational Pathways International	237479	1	/users/profile/322126	Diana O.	Client Served	5	01/30/2015	I am one of the four Ashesi University College graduates who benefitted from the EPI scholarship during its maiden Call for Scholarship Applications in Ghana, West Africa. Backed by the EPI financial support, I enjoyed the peace of mind to focus on my rigorous higher education curriculum without interruption. I gained knowledge that opened me up to new possibilities. I developed my passion for sign language and am now working on a software project to scale up sign language instruction to basic mainstream schools all across Ghana. EPIs support also reminded me to keep up with my community service and extra-curricular activities, and doing so really enhanced my CV for the Ghanaian job market. I am happy to reveal here that my current full-time job was recommended to me by a fellow EPI alumnus. That was possible because EPI Alumni have a culture of networking and sharing opportunities. Having graduated from university, I often find myself counting my blessings and recognizing that I am now a part of a unique group of gifted young Ghanaians called, EPI Alumni, who are poised to serve mother Ghana with integrity.  As one of the pioneering beneficiaries, I recently volunteered to serve as the first EPI Alumni secretary. Together with my team of executives, we are laying a solid foundation for ourselves, based on community service, peer-mentoring and innovation, to ensure that future EPI beneficiaries continue to enjoy the love and moral support that comes with being a part of the big EPI family. We have welcomed the third graduating class into the EPI Alumni family, and just like the rest of us, their desire to give back to Ghana  despite personal challenges  burns strong. Each of us has received the priceless gift of higher education from the Lafrances and cannot help but pay it forward.  Sometimes, I am amazed at the impact that the Lafrances are making in our lives and in Ghana as a whole. It is not just about the scholarship. It is more about the love/ attention that they continuously show/ give us. Sara and Leonard Lafrance always have our best interest at heart. Every year, they make it a point to visit Ghana and interact with all beneficiaries and Alumni of EPI. They always look forward to learning more about the progress we are making in our studies and career pursuits.  EPI beneficiaries and Alumni are all selflessly making a difference in our home country, Ghana. All I have left to say is, Long live EPI and long live the Lafrances! We are all very proud of Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for their efforts in making EPI a great non-profit organization based in America.

I am very glad to write my review about this noble non-profit organization; Educational Pathways International (EPI). This sponsorship organization is the best non-profit institution on campus. They offer the best of package to brilliant but needy students on campus.In fact, before I became part of this selfless family, all my educational needs were being catered for by the sole effort of my mum. I really pitied her considering the work she does to get money for me to have my secondary school education. She brewed pito( a local drink) and sold firewood in order to take care of the family after the sudden demise of my father when I was in second year at the senior high school.However, after my senior high education, my mother was desperate to send me to the university despite her haplessness. She was able to afford the entrance form to the university alright but could not afford to pay the full fees demanded by the university. As determined as she was she borrowed from friends and well wishes to support me. A concerned friend told me to surf the universitys website where this benevolent scholarship was being advertised encouraging students to file in their applications for consideration. I did my best to apply and fortunately, with ideal scrutiny by Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance and the joint aid of Auntie Sandra and Auntie Eunice I was considered worthy of the scholarship.And I was given a full scholarship in 2014, and this covered all my 6years programme at the University. My mum was dismayed by all this and so was I.  Furthermore, the living standard of my family changed tremendously and we are a happy family now. Besides, my younger brother also, who got his admission to the senior high school last year had no trouble or intricacies going at all. This has really made him gained the zeal to study harder.Lastly, EPI has not only helped me financially but it has continually impacted in me (us) in diverse ways; by the good works of Auntie Eunice, I can proudly boast of how to manage my time well and how to engage in group studies as well. In addition, especially how to write Resume or CV, she tirelessly took us through these topics. Above all, one significant thing I have gained from EPI is the yearly vacation training (internship) that we are being made to undertake. It has really enlightened me in broad spectrum about how my future career of being a Pharmacist would be. I am so much grateful for the wonderful support that has always been given me and I hope it would continue to touch the lives of many.In summary, EPI is the best in reaching to the needs of brilliant but needy students in our country, Ghana.Long Live EPI and Her Workers. God bless you.

It was a time when my academic future was near bleak by reason of financial constraints. I witnessed a complete turnaround when I met my angel of hope and success, EPI. Thereafter, I possessed a boosted morale to pursue my academic goals without having to worry about finances. EPI sponsored me throughout my bachelor studies! My bachelor transcript is a faithful witness to the excellent academic strides I made after meeting EPI. I cant forget to mention the quality of social life I enjoyed with the EPI family. For a truth, EPI is a family of real love and care! In fact, being part of EPI has been a real holistic transformational experience for me. Currently, Im a final year master student at University of Agder, Norway, and still aiming higher. I owe special thanks to EPI and to The Lafrances. I am glad to be a member of the EPI family!

Through the support of EPI, I was well founded to unleash my inner-most potentials and hence achieving real excellence during my bachelor studies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Aside financial aid, I have come to appreciate EPI to be an organization that offers the opportunity for career development and enhancing ones social well-being. The benefits I derived from the internships, seminars and mentorship programmes are overwhelming. I have been empowered and well placed by these programmes to fit well in myriad of social contexts. My interpersonal, communication and time management skills have all been well shaped through my participation in the above mentioned programmes by EPI. Further to the above, EPI afforded me the opportunity to work with the organization (EPI) after my bachelor degree as a National Service Personnel during which period I further acquired skills essential for my career  development. Currently reading a Master programme in Business Administration at University of Agder in Norway, I am strongly convinced that EPI has contributed immensely to building me for life. I must honestly confess that I have had a life transforming experience with EPI. It is certainly good that I met this organization of charity!

Many words cannot describe the burden that this family has lifted from my mother and I. Only the heart can really tell it all. EPI, your beneficiaries shall stand and say many others have done well but you excel them all.Growing up in a family with no literates at all, built up in me a great desire to stand out and go higher in academia to the highest level possible. The cost of tertiary education posed one of the greatest treats to this determination to go higher. I had to stay at home for one year even though I had admission to offer Electrical Engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in the year 2013. My mother would dare not try because she could not raise even a quarter of the money needed by herself to talk of financing me throughout the course. In 2014 we tried and that is what got me started. Unfortunately this left behind a lot of financial strain on virtually every member of the family who attempted to help because no one person was financially sound enough to take up the whole cost. I wasnt sure if I would be able to go through to the end. Upon meeting the EPI family I have a renewed confidence that I will surely go through to the end and there is also a renewed edge to go higher and do better in my academic work. My sincerest appreciation to the family that is not only interested in helping its beneficiaries financially, but making sure they excel academically as well.I am also grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for their generous and thoughtful support. Also I say thank you to Auntie Eunice for her encouragement, guidance and counsel.EPI, a family like this, who can find.Vincent KwaoElectrical/Electronic EngineeringKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)

I find most of them with a great story and a compelling vision. After benefiting from EPI's scholarship scheme and getting an opportunity to work with the EPI team. I find EPI's story truly fascinating and revolutionary.EPI, through its community engagements has demonstrated its special commitment to transforming lives across generations. This nonprofit supports economically handicapped students through their secondary and tertiary education, empowers its beneficiaries through training programs and provides the beneficiaries with training and resources for personal development.My desire to always give back to society is greatly influenced by EPI's unsurpassing commitment to create this habit in people who in one way way or the other encounters this nonprofit. Through some of the company sponsored internships, I have had the unique opportunity to share life experiences and lessons with younger underprivileged students to keep them focused on their academic and career goals , for the greater good.It has been a truly satisfying experience working with this and profit and I have no doubt that if EPI gets the necessary support, lots of lives lives will be transformed by the dream of the founders.

Gaining admission to the University was great news for my family but funding my education was a problem. Thankfully, I got selected to be part of the great family and my educational life has been awesome since. Being a beneficiary, the scholarship pays for both my academic and residential fees and provides additional money for up keep and to cater for other educational expenses.EPI does not only cater for our financial well-being but also trains us to be the best of ourselves and be better future leaders. I have benefited so much from the monthly mini seminars/meetings where our coordinator, Aunty Eunice gives talks on life goals, career developments and other trivial matters that contribute to our growth both as human beings and also as students. EPI encourages its beneficiaries to engage in vacation internships, which prepares us for future jobs. Beneficiaries are also advised to engage in community volunteering to contribute to the growth and development of our societies.All in all EPI has been a great family with the strongest bond that can never be broken and I thank God for giving me such an opportunity. I thank Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance and our coordinator, Auntie Eunice for being part of this family. I wholeheartedly recommend EPI scholarship for any award as it is all about changing the lives of the youth in Ghana.

All this I say because I am a living witness to what this wonderful organization is doing in Ghana and other parts of the world.I must confess that, there are several reasons why I will recommend EPI to many but for want of space and time as well as for the purpose of this review, I have decided to stick to these cogent ones out of the lot I can enumerate.To begin, EPI as an organization is not restricted to some selected few of individuals like say only students of Engineering or Medicine as some other scholarship organizations do. Rather it opens its tentacles to make known its intentions to the whole student populace. It is well advertised and their doors are always opened for any enquiry one would like to make. This has endeared the organization to the student populace so much that it is the most talked about organization on various campuses.Another interesting thing about EPI I that I cherished so much is their selection process. The documents requested are always within the reach of any student willing to apply and enough time is given for aspiring students to assemble them before the closing date. Also a thorough and an unbiased interview is conducted for the selected few to ensure they indeed deserve the grant and this is beside the scrutiny of the about thousand pieces  of  documents submitted for consideration. This always involves the constant annual visitations of Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance to Ghana and even in situations where circumstances prevent them  from getting involved there has always been a  live streaming of the interview to suffice for their absence, so committed they have always been.Furthermore, this wonderful organization has always kept to their promise of grants and has not only been prompt in honouring them but annually they seem to have always increased the grants to students. EPI gives you more than an average student will need to cater for his fees, books, accommodation as well as upkeep money and any other need as they may come. It is indeed an all in all scholarship. In a nut shell. I will always say that, their grants have always been enough and on time.EPI does not only look at our tertiary education but also has great interest in the lives of our sisters and brothers in the secondary schools as well. It may interest you to know that as part of its annual programme, beneficiaries from EPI go to Akim Asafo Senior High School, one of the less privileged schools in the eastern region of Ghana to teach them as well as assist them in any way they can. This is so much unlike many other organizations at least with the few I know of. God bless EPI, Sara and Leonard Lafrance for what they are doing for generations.  Kingsley Emmanuel Bentum4th Year Doctor of VeterinaryKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) 
Educational Pathways International	281115	2	/users/profile/371139	Writer	Client Served	5	02/29/2016	Hi, I am Sophia Acquah and EPI has been a blessing in my life. During my undergrad years when it seemed that inadequate financial resources were going to end my educational dream, Educational Pathways International (EPI) came to my rescue. The organization financed my education and was a great pillar to lean on in other aspects of life too.Through EPI, I gained another set of family. A family that encourages me and has my interest at heart. Knowing that Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance and EPI saw talent and a great future in me, I was motivated to realize my full potential. Being with EPI has been a great and wonderful experience; an experience that promises no end with the strong and wonderful relationship built with the Lafrances and other beneficiaries.Its been six years since EPI came to my aid and three years since I graduated from the University of Ghana Business School with first class honors in BSc. Administration. Currently, I work as a Forex Sales Officer with the Treasury department of UT Bank Ltd, in Accra, Ghana. I hope to further my education and become a Lecturer in finance. Its my dream to strengthen my knowledge in finance and teach it to others to help grow the economy of Ghana and Africa. This is because, I strongly believe that it is mainly through education that Ghana and other developing countries will be empowered to develop their economies on their own. EPI has empowered me to change my society and simultaneously made it possible for me to follow alongside to empower others. The most crucial step in embarking on my dream has been made possible by EPI.Thank you EPI!

I have had my share of the challenges; ranging from financial through to social. Bravo!! to the Educational Pathways International (EPI) which came to show me light in my dark tunnel.I joined the EPI family in my third year in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Being offered Business Administration, I wondered how my four years on campus would be and how I was going to sail through the heddles in climbing the educational ladder. The Educational Pathways International scholarship has lifted this burden, promising me a smooth sail through the financial support, mentoring, counseling and love shown to me as a beneficiary. Multitude of words cannot say all what this scholarship has offered the less privileged in the Ghanaian society but indeed your sacrifice is greatly appreciated. I am Ruth Z. Nagre. 
Educational Pathways International	281108		/users/profile/371131	Writer	Client Served	5	02/29/2016	Kornyoh Enyonam Peter is my name. I am the youngest child in a family of five (mom, dad, my eldest sister and my elder twin brother).  I come from Aflao in the Volta region of Ghana. I spent most of my hay days in Kumasi where I was brought up. I had my primary school education in Kumasi, proceeded to St. Peters secondary school in the Eastern region and currently I am in the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology offering Bsc. In Civil Engineering. I am a beneficiary of the Education Pathways International Scholarship to brilliant but needy students in the university. I am very grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for their generosity to many people in Africa of which I am apart. The depth of appreciation for this act of benevolence cannot easily be quantified. Many a time, when I envisage my days back in the primary, secondary and my first year in the university (the period prior to obtaining this scholarship) I am short of words of the goodness of the Lord in my life through the life of the Lafrance. My parents had to hustle through the hot weather day in and day out to pay our fees. Many times the money accrued in their endeavours could not cater for all of our fees and they resort to taking of loans from the bank to pay our fees. Though other necessary items such as books were still not available we still had to bear with our condition knowing our parents we doing whatever they could do in their capacity.One major deadlock was when my twin brother and I gain admission into the university. The tuition fees and accommodation bills were that huge compared to their capacity that the option of one of us staying back in the house whiles the other continue with university education was being contemplated upon. But my parents still went for more loans to pay or our fees.To cut this long story short, I did not know how my parents were going to survive with the culture of taking loans from the bank to foot all our bills in school for the next four years of university education knowing that they already owe some banks. But thanks be unto God, a senior friend introduced me to EPI and today I can boldly say that since then my university tuition fees, my accommodation fees, feeding money and my books for studies have all been taken care off by EPI.I am so happy in school, I am among the best in my class and I look forward into the future with great hopes and expectation, thanks be to God and the EPI fraternity. To the Lafrance I am forever grateful. I thank God for the life of Auntie Eunice, our coordinator, for all the life changing topics she teaches us to mould our lives in preparation for the world out there. To the whole EPI family I am so excited and happy I am apart of you. 
Educational Pathways International	281106		/users/profile/371129	Writer	Client Served	5	02/29/2016	Gaining admission into Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) to read BSc. Civil Engineering was a great opportunity the Lord granted to me. I nearly gave up when I entered the class for the first time to meet fellow course mates who are well motivated and were expectant to excel in their academics. For me, encountering Educational Pathways International (EPI) and being a member of this great family was the turning point in my life. My outlook about life, academics and my goals went through a great transformation. Through the family love, education and encouragement from the various personnel in this noble organization, I began to believe and know that there is no limitation to life and success. One major advantage about EPI is the financial benefit they provide to their beneficiaries. There have never been a semester I had to struggle about my welfare and finances. I believe I owe it to God and to Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance. I am now in final year of a class population of about 185 students and I am happy to say I am among the first five excellent students in the class. I know my future is great and I have a lovely family here in EPI and they are ever ready to support me in my pursuit for greatness. In EPI I have come to learn and live by some virtues which are priceless, teaching us to walk in love, to care for others and to give back to the society and make impact in every place we go. Words cannot describe how grateful I am to be a member of this family. For me, EPI has not just been a blessing to me but to my family as well and we cannot comprehend the love of Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance and our Programme Coordinator, Auntie Eunice.  I love EPI and I am proud to be a beneficiary of EPI. I am Paul Enyram Kornyoh, a final year student of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology  (KNUST) pursuing BSC.

Educational Pathways International	280966		/users/profile/370962	Writer	Client Served	5	02/26/2016	One may say, there are many non-governmental financial institutions that sponsor brilliant but needy students all over the world, so why is Educational Pathways International (EPI) distinct.EPI is distinct in the sense that it offers the students not only  financial help that care for their school fees but also cater for their accommodation,  books and handouts, feeding and any other thing that the student may use the many for: investment, caring for other needs in their families and many others.        Apart from the financial add, EPI offers the students more.EPI Family is made up of the beneficiaries, the sponsors, the President, the Vice President and  the Programme Coordinator.  EPI family gives us a sense of belonging. Going for a family meeting gives me hope that I am meeting again a family that shares a lots in common and have the same ultimate goal of making it, reaching greater heights and giving back to society despite financial constraints which the organization is helping us with.These EPI family meetings that are held several times a semester gives each student the chance to share with the rest of the group their goals and how they plan on achieving them. This has helped me a lot personally because I get encouraged and motivated by the other students and this helps me to do more in my area of study. Not only do I get motivation and encouragement from the other students but also from the President and the Programme Coordinator.The meetings also prepare us to fit perfectly in the world where ever we find ourselves. The Programme Coordinator teaches us many things we will not be taught in the class room including time management, goal setting and entrepreneurship among others. These sessions have doubtless helped me become a better person especially in the area of time management.Internships during the holidays which is a requirement of every student on the scholarship has helped all of us a lot especially me. During the internship I get the opportunity to give back to society my services and it has also helped prepared me for the job market and I also got the opportunity to practically apply what I leant theoretically.I have also benefitted from EPI psychologically in that  I have no cause to worry about how my fees are to be paid or how I will buy my books and handouts or feed because all these have been catered for.                                                                                                                                        Regular excursions organized has helped me released stress after all the tiring school work.EPI has actually made my dreams come true. It is a family that treats all her beneficiaries equally and make sure that we complete school as whole persons and be fully prepared fully for the world.  Thanks to Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance ,  our Programme Coordinator and the sponsors. I recommend EPI for any award that are given to Non-governmental Organizations for her selfless support and dedication to brilliant students of need in our countrys universities.  God bless EPI.

Educational Pathways International	280959		/users/profile/370956	ASIGRI	Client Served	5	02/26/2016	I am Peter Asigri, a Research and Teaching Assistant at The Energy Center, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) Ghana.I got to know about Educational Pathways International (EPI) scholarship in August 2013 when it was advertised at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technologys (KNUST) website for application.Since I joined the scholarship family in October 2013, EPI provided full tuition fees waiver as well as extra funds to cover accommodation, books and living expenses until I graduated in June 2015. Therefore I had no difficulty in my university education as it was before the scholarship award.EPI is not only a body that provides financial assistant but also moral, social and academic education. During our various meetings, we were taught various topics which drive individuals in their lives. We discussed topics such as goal setting, time management, relationships, and achieving higher academic grades among others.  With EPIs trainings, I was able to maintain my grades which led me to graduate with first class honors in BSc. Electrical Engineering.Socialization was not left out during the scholarship programme. We embarked on various trips which served as entertainment and socialization.  We made a lot of friends during the trips and these friendship have continued till now.After graduating in 2015, I have been part of the EPI Alumni chapter. We have social media groups where we share ideas on trending developmental issues. EPI also organizes annual dinner for the alumni chapter where we get the opportunity to meet and socialize.I will finally state that my education at the university would not have been possible without the timely intervention of EPI.` 
Educational Pathways International	280936		/users/profile/370933	jkakafua	Client Served	5	02/25/2016		My name is Jonathan Akafua, a third year student of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) reading BSc. Electrical Engineering.  In 2013, my brother John and I had passed the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) with  flying colours. Our performance made my parents and various family members so proud of us. One thing that I was so sure of was that gaining admission into the university would not be a problem at all for both of us. However, due to the financial background of my family, the greatest problem I knew we would be facing in the new episode of my academic life would be finance. That year, my dad took a loan from the bank and part of his provident fund to pay our school fees, accommodation and provide clothing and food. However, after paying the school fees, accommodation and buying the clothing John and I needed for school, the money he had borrowed was almost exhausted.	This made my first year quite a challenge for me. Thus, I found it difficult to feed myself let alone talking of books to buy. Moreover, I was not ready to be a burden on my father since I was virtually not the only one he was catering for. Yet, I made a relentless effort of not making my dads effort fruitless, even though it was quite difficult a challenge. My performance in the first year impressed him and he promised me he would do whatever it takes to make sure he sponsored my education. A responsible and promising father indeed!!.	Before I started my second year at the university, I could not bear the thought of how my father would take care of me in school since he had not cleared the debts he had incurred during the previous academic year. Those moments of my life were one of my worst nightmares. I then started searching for scholarship opportunities to ease the burden on my dad and also to give me the maximum focus I needed. I applied for scholarship with Educational Pathways International (EPI) and fortunately for me I had it. I still believe that it was EPI that located me in my distress. The day I had this scholarship is one of the moments I can never forget in my life. Words could not and cannot express my joy because I knew I was liberated from dependence on my dad. Even my dad was so glad because he knew that for the rest of my first degree programme, he would not have to bother himself on how he would fend for me. My life was for the first time turned around. I could study without thinking of how I would survive on campus. And as of now, all I am doing is making good use of this opportunity given me. There is one thing I can say with certainty; EPI is now a part of my life. I can never tell my life story anywhere I find myself without the name EPI surfacing. EPI is indeed the greatest miracle that ever happened to me. 
Educational Pathways International	280844	1	/users/profile/370823	Writer	Client Served	5	02/24/2016	My encounter with Educational Pathways International (EPI) scholarship program has triggered an indelible positive change in my life. This program has contributed immensely to various aspects of my life as a student of the University of Ghana.To begin with, EPI has given me financial stability by covering my tuition, residential, books and other incidental cost. This has enabled me to concentrate fully on my studies in other to achieve my goals and objectives as a student.More so, the internship opportunities that I have had on this program has equipped me with the needed skills that will enable me thrive excellently in the corporate world. EPI has enabled me to relate directly what I have learnt in school to the job environment via these internship programs. I have equally had the chance to work with one of the EPI alliances, which is University Studies Abroad Consortium (USAC), through the buddy system; this has equipped me with relevant years of experience in international exchange program management and has equally influenced my career path. I dont want to be an agent of change in my home country alone but in Africa and the world at large.The most exciting part is that I feel this sense of belonging and family bond in EPI. The regular meetings that are organized for us and luncheons allow me the opportunity to meet my other colleagues on the program and to share ideas and opinions, it also serves as a constant reminder of the fact that I need to fulfil my obligation as a higher achiever.  We also get to have free training seminars on wide range of subject matters and I have benefited greatly from them. The ever active EPI alumni system assures me that I would never lose this sense of belonging. I anxiously await the opportunity to join the system and contribute my quota towards the give back to society project.I am very grateful to Mr & Mrs Lafrance and all the EPI partners who have contributed towards making my University education a reality. I will graduate some few months away knowing that I wouldnt have made it this far without Educational Pathways International Scholarship Program. It is the best program that any student can ever be enrolled on. This is because, EPI transforms life, foster academic development and help a nation grow.Parrendah Adwoa KpeliFinal YearBSc.

Educational Pathways International	280829	2	/users/profile/322126	Diana O.	Client Served	5	02/24/2016	I am writing this review as an alumna of this prestigious scholarship. I talk about how accountable and successful I have become, in all aspects of my life, as a result of adhering to the discipline that was required for me to maintain the scholarship throughout my tertiary education.  On Wednesday 10th September 2008, I officially signed the EPI Scholarship Acceptance letter granting me full-time scholarship, board and tuition for my Ashesi University College education in Ghana. Appending that signature, after reading and agreeing to the terms of the scholarship, was like swearing an oath of allegiance to my home country and promising to be the best that I can be in every endeavor. I wholeheartedly embraced the challenge and looked forward to growing and inspiring others from freshman year to senior year. Fortunately, Ashesis curriculum empowered me to achieve my goals. Today, 8 years later, I have become a savvier and more mature computer science graduate spearheading a purposeful organization that promotes digital literacy. If the president of a country does not fulfill his or her manifesto within 8 years, then the people will certainly believe that their president abused their trust and blew an opportunity to impact a whole generation  especially when their governance was not transparent. When we take the EPI Scholar to mean the president of a country and EPI to mean the people, this statement becomes an allegory for justifying why the EPI put specific clauses in the Scholarship Acceptance letter, ensuring that my colleagues and I graduate as balanced individuals with both academic prowess and a social conscience. One of such clauses was for each EPI Scholar to PURSUE PERSONAL SERVICE during vacation and non-school periods and to REPORT ON THE SERVICE EXPERIENCE because personal service is considered such as important element as we pursue our academic careers.  Knowing that I was required to continually serve others while maintaining outstanding academic records to remain qualified for the EPI scholarship empowered me to refine my time management skills and consequently impacted my level of success and self-accountability. Overall, it was a very good discipline for me to independently take charge of my academic progress, personal service and achievements and EPIs feedback and support encouraged me to persist.  My personal service pursuits transformed and enriched me and enhanced my soft skills for problem-solving. I learned to look at the big picture of Ghanas development and realized what I could contribute via my talents and hard skills. My purposeful organization thus employs innovative and creative techniques to ensure that our digital literacy solutions are viable, contextualized, learner-centered and sustainable. It is impacting a generation of young leaders just as EPIs scholarship impacted me. EPI is proud of me. I am equally proud of myself for surmounting personal challenges to become the best version of myself today, contributing to sustainable growth in my home country, Ghana.  One of the personal service opportunities I leveraged was song competitions. EPI promoted my first single, Ubuntu, beyond the shores of Ghana to a Women of Africa forum in Nevada because the lyrics were about women empowerment. That is one way EPI has supported my holistic development since 2008 for me to become a balanced, savvy and mature technologist. I am currently the Creative Director of a unique all-female live band in Ghana poised to present traditional African rhythms to the rest of the world. Another way EPI has supported me beyond a scholarship offer and massive appreciation for my music was encouraging me to apply to the 2016 Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders, a merit-based open competition launched by President Obama.  I look forward to growing with the EPI alumni family and applying my profession to more personal service opportunities. EPI certainly deserves the 2016 Award for Top Rated Non-Profit because they are positively impacting generations of Ghanaian youth who graduate top of their class with the humility to reach out to serve others everywhere they go.   
Educational Pathways International	237479	1	/users/profile/322126	Diana O.	Client Served	5	01/30/2015	I am one of the four Ashesi University College graduates who benefitted from the EPI scholarship during its maiden Call for Scholarship Applications in Ghana, West Africa. Backed by the EPI financial support, I enjoyed the peace of mind to focus on my rigorous higher education curriculum without interruption. I gained knowledge that opened me up to new possibilities. I developed my passion for sign language and am now working on a software project to scale up sign language instruction to basic mainstream schools all across Ghana. EPIs support also reminded me to keep up with my community service and extra-curricular activities, and doing so really enhanced my CV for the Ghanaian job market. I am happy to reveal here that my current full-time job was recommended to me by a fellow EPI alumnus. That was possible because EPI Alumni have a culture of networking and sharing opportunities. Having graduated from university, I often find myself counting my blessings and recognizing that I am now a part of a unique group of gifted young Ghanaians called, EPI Alumni, who are poised to serve mother Ghana with integrity.  As one of the pioneering beneficiaries, I recently volunteered to serve as the first EPI Alumni secretary. Together with my team of executives, we are laying a solid foundation for ourselves, based on community service, peer-mentoring and innovation, to ensure that future EPI beneficiaries continue to enjoy the love and moral support that comes with being a part of the big EPI family. We have welcomed the third graduating class into the EPI Alumni family, and just like the rest of us, their desire to give back to Ghana  despite personal challenges  burns strong. Each of us has received the priceless gift of higher education from the Lafrances and cannot help but pay it forward.  Sometimes, I am amazed at the impact that the Lafrances are making in our lives and in Ghana as a whole. It is not just about the scholarship. It is more about the love/ attention that they continuously show/ give us. Sara and Leonard Lafrance always have our best interest at heart. Every year, they make it a point to visit Ghana and interact with all beneficiaries and Alumni of EPI. They always look forward to learning more about the progress we are making in our studies and career pursuits.  EPI beneficiaries and Alumni are all selflessly making a difference in our home country, Ghana. All I have left to say is, Long live EPI and long live the Lafrances! We are all very proud of Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for their efforts in making EPI a great non-profit organization based in America. Thank you. Diana D. Osei

I am very glad to write my review about this noble non-profit organization; Educational Pathways International (EPI). This sponsorship organization is the best non-profit institution on campus. They offer the best of package to brilliant but needy students on campus.In fact, before I became part of this selfless family, all my educational needs were being catered for by the sole effort of my mum. I really pitied her considering the work she does to get money for me to have my secondary school education. She brewed pito( a local drink) and sold firewood in order to take care of the family after the sudden demise of my father when I was in second year at the senior high school.However, after my senior high education, my mother was desperate to send me to the university despite her haplessness. She was able to afford the entrance form to the university alright but could not afford to pay the full fees demanded by the university. As determined as she was she borrowed from friends and well wishes to support me. A concerned friend told me to surf the universitys website where this benevolent scholarship was being advertised encouraging students to file in their applications for consideration. I did my best to apply and fortunately, with ideal scrutiny by Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance and the joint aid of Auntie Sandra and Auntie Eunice I was considered worthy of the scholarship.And I was given a full scholarship in 2014, and this covered all my 6years programme at the University. My mum was dismayed by all this and so was I.  Furthermore, the living standard of my family changed tremendously and we are a happy family now. Besides, my younger brother also, who got his admission to the senior high school last year had no trouble or intricacies going at all. This has really made him gained the zeal to study harder.Lastly, EPI has not only helped me financially but it has continually impacted in me (us) in diverse ways; by the good works of Auntie Eunice, I can proudly boast of how to manage my time well and how to engage in group studies as well. In addition, especially how to write Resume or CV, she tirelessly took us through these topics. Above all, one significant thing I have gained from EPI is the yearly vacation training (internship) that we are being made to undertake. It has really enlightened me in broad spectrum about how my future career of being a Pharmacist would be. I am so much grateful for the wonderful support that has always been given me and I hope it would continue to touch the lives of many.In summary, EPI is the best in reaching to the needs of brilliant but needy students in our country, Ghana.Long Live EPI and Her Workers. God bless you.

It was a time when my academic future was near bleak by reason of financial constraints. I witnessed a complete turnaround when I met my angel of hope and success, EPI. Thereafter, I possessed a boosted morale to pursue my academic goals without having to worry about finances. EPI sponsored me throughout my bachelor studies! My bachelor transcript is a faithful witness to the excellent academic strides I made after meeting EPI. I cant forget to mention the quality of social life I enjoyed with the EPI family. For a truth, EPI is a family of real love and care! In fact, being part of EPI has been a real holistic transformational experience for me. Currently, Im a final year master student at University of Agder, Norway, and still aiming higher. I owe special thanks to EPI and to The Lafrances. I am glad to be a member of the EPI family!
Educational Pathways International	237253	1	/users/profile/321692	Nyarko	Volunteer	5	01/24/2015	Lingering in my memory is the timely intervention of EPI when the path to academic success was gloomy by reason of financial challenges. Through the support of EPI, I was well founded to unleash my inner-most potentials and hence achieving real excellence during my bachelor studies at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Aside financial aid, I have come to appreciate EPI to be an organization that offers the opportunity for career development and enhancing ones social well-being. The benefits I derived from the internships, seminars and mentorship programmes are overwhelming. I have been empowered and well placed by these programmes to fit well in myriad of social contexts. My interpersonal, communication and time management skills have all been well shaped through my participation in the above mentioned programmes by EPI. Further to the above, EPI afforded me the opportunity to work with the organization (EPI) after my bachelor degree as a National Service Personnel during which period I further acquired skills essential for my career  development. Currently reading a Master programme in Business Administration at University of Agder in Norway, I am strongly convinced that EPI has contributed immensely to building me for life. I must honestly confess that I have had a life transforming experience with EPI. It is certainly good that I met this organization of charity! Thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance, for the unflinching love and care for humanity and for their contribution to my life through EPI. I am proud to be part of the EPI family! 
Educational Pathways International	280631	1	/users/profile/370557	Writer	Client Served	5	02/21/2016	Being part of Educational Pathways International (EPI) is being part of a loving and caring family. Many words cannot describe the burden that this family has lifted from my mother and I. Only the heart can really tell it all. EPI, your beneficiaries shall stand and say many others have done well but you excel them all.Growing up in a family with no literates at all, built up in me a great desire to stand out and go higher in academia to the highest level possible. The cost of tertiary education posed one of the greatest treats to this determination to go higher. I had to stay at home for one year even though I had admission to offer Electrical Engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in the year 2013. My mother would dare not try because she could not raise even a quarter of the money needed by herself to talk of financing me throughout the course. In 2014 we tried and that is what got me started. Unfortunately this left behind a lot of financial strain on virtually every member of the family who attempted to help because no one person was financially sound enough to take up the whole cost. I wasnt sure if I would be able to go through to the end. Upon meeting the EPI family I have a renewed confidence that I will surely go through to the end and there is also a renewed edge to go higher and do better in my academic work. My sincerest appreciation to the family that is not only interested in helping its beneficiaries financially, but making sure they excel academically as well.I am also grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for their generous and thoughtful support. Also I say thank you to Auntie Eunice for her encouragement, guidance and counsel.EPI, a family like this, who can find.Vincent KwaoElectrical/Electronic EngineeringKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)

I find most of them with a great story and a compelling vision. After benefiting from EPI's scholarship scheme and getting an opportunity to work with the EPI team. I find EPI's story truly fascinating and revolutionary.EPI, through its community engagements has demonstrated its special commitment to transforming lives across generations. This nonprofit supports economically handicapped students through their secondary and tertiary education, empowers its beneficiaries through training programs and provides the beneficiaries with training and resources for personal development.My desire to always give back to society is greatly influenced by EPI's unsurpassing commitment to create this habit in people who in one way way or the other encounters this nonprofit. Through some of the company sponsored internships, I have had the unique opportunity to share life experiences and lessons with younger underprivileged students to keep them focused on their academic and career goals , for the greater good.It has been a truly satisfying experience working with this and profit and I have no doubt that if EPI gets the necessary support, lots of lives lives will be transformed by the dream of the founders.

I am yet to come across any non-profit which genuinely pursues its social interventions with the passion which EPI does.  I am so proud of EPI and I feel really privileged to be part of the numerous lives that EPI has impacted here in Ghana. Words cannot help me communicate my sense of gratitude the way I feel it. EPI does not do its things like any ordinary scholarship foundation. It seeks to develop its beneficiaries in every aspect of their lives in order to produce all rounded individuals who will be able to make real life impact in their communities. I strongly recommend EPI to any institutions that promotes the interest of non-profits. If theres anything that will help EPI get more recognised and earn the support of many donors, I strongly recommend EPI.I will love to continue to see such a great non-profit grow and transform more lives right before my eyes. Long live EPI! Long live the Lafrances!

At the he end of my first year stay at the university, my world came tumbling down. I had not the smallest amount of hope of where to get funding for be remaining three years of study.But when I had the rare opportunity to join the EPI family, all I concentrate on now, is when to study and how.My life has undergone a great transformation under EPIs scholarship program. Thanks to the Lafrances, I smile and to the future with boldness and confidence.The ever-growing EPI  family continues to transform lives  beyond national borders and skin color.

Gaining admission to the University was great news for my family but funding my education was a problem. Thankfully, I got selected to be part of the great family and my educational life has been awesome since. Being a beneficiary, the scholarship pays for both my academic and residential fees and provides additional money for up keep and to cater for other educational expenses.EPI does not only cater for our financial well-being but also trains us to be the best of ourselves and be better future leaders. I have benefited so much from the monthly mini seminars/meetings where our coordinator, Aunty Eunice gives talks on life goals, career developments and other trivial matters that contribute to our growth both as human beings and also as students. EPI encourages its beneficiaries to engage in vacation internships, which prepares us for future jobs. Beneficiaries are also advised to engage in community volunteering to contribute to the growth and development of our societies.All in all EPI has been a great family with the strongest bond that can never be broken and I thank God for giving me such an opportunity. I thank Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance and our coordinator, Auntie Eunice for being part of this family. I wholeheartedly recommend EPI scholarship for any award as it is all about changing the lives of the youth in Ghana.

I am a beneficiary of the Educational Pathways International ( EPI) scholarship Program . After being admitted to the KNUST medical school, I was faced with the probability of a very difficult life in medical school. I was put through first year through the support of family members.  And  that was when I was introduced to EPI by colleagues of mine who were already on the scholarship. I applied and was accepted into the scholarship after an interview. The financial package includes tuition fees, accommodation, books and upkeep money. In addition to this, there are regular seminars with the coordinator at which beneficiaries are trained on personal grooming and leadership. There is also a vacation community service where beneficiaries get the opportunity to impart knowledge to a local Senior High School (Asafo Akim SHS). Through these initiatives, we have built a strong network among ourselves as we share experiences and carry on the vision of helping to build a better country.I am currently in final year of medical school and would graduate in August 2016. This journey through medical school has been made much more easier  thanks to EPI. i am grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for this invaluable assistance through EPI.

The joy I have by simply being a member of the EPI family is awesome.Thanks to EPI, not only do I have peace of mind to study but Iam part of a family that is loving and caring. They are not only concerned with my academic affairsconcern but my total wellbeing. I receive counselling for my personal issues and coachingand direction in many areas of my life. I simply feel blessed to be a part of EPI.

Human Biology student at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. As a beneficiary of Educational Pathways International (EPI) Scholarship, it is with utmost joy and conviction that I write this review about a scholarship that I consider not one of the best, but the primus inter pares. I became a member of this great family in my first year in the university. It was a time of trials and great despair. I had divided attention until my application for EPI scholarship was considered. The news came as a joyous day break, a sign of hope and a reason to dream even bigger. I was glad that I didnt have to worry about my fees anymore, and that all I need to do is study hard knowing that my school fees, and all other monetary issues were settled. For me, all I expected was a scholarship that will pay my fees and other financial needs. I had little knowledge as to what was in stock for me. Over the years, I came to realize that EPI is not like any other scholarship but a family affair. We do have family meetings with the Coordinator Auntie Eunice and discuss a lot of topics ranging from social to academic issues. Our resent discussion was on writing of curriculum vitae.EPI doesnt just provide financial needs for our education but provide a conducive atmosphere and a platform for beneficiaries to learn and develop themselves. This is not common with most scholarships and I am most grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance for the love, kindness and their commitment towards me and so many others. It is my wish that they find fulfillment in all they do and continue to transform generations. Long live EPI, long live the Lafrances and God bless all those who have made the work of EPI a success. Thank you

I am Valentina Nyame, a final year student offering BSc. Human Settlement Planning at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) Ghana. For the past 4years  thus, all my stay on campus  I have been a proud beneficiary of the EPI scholarship program and I must say with all truthfulness, that being with a family like EPI  has been the best experience I can ever have and has imparted my life in ways I never thought was possible. EPI is more than a scholarship program, we consider ourselves as a family and as a result work towards the personal, intellectual, professional and social development of each other.  The goal of EPI is to recognize,  supports, and empower, gifted young people from families of need in the country of Ghana through a comprehensive university scholarship program, enabling them to develop their talents and make a positive difference in their home country. In my view tremendous results have been achieved, since I have seen my colleague beneficiaries take up major student positions, receive countless awards, graduate with the best of grades, with some furthering their education in prominent schools both within and outside the country while others join the working environment. None of the above would have been possible without EPI. For me, I could not have made it this far in my educational path without EPI as a backbone . EPI has empowered me to reach higher in all endeavors and has been a source of inspiration for others like me to give back to the community. It sometimes saddens me that I am not in the position to provide the financial or otherwise support needed to support the course of EPI for now. But I believe strongly that others in the position to support will not miss the chance to touch the lives of students like me.Thank you EPI.

Receiving this scholarship has helped me achieve my dream of securing education in one of the best universities in Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology(KNUST). EPI will go a long way to change the economic class of my family background since my education at  KNUST will spur me on to greater opportunities in life. EPI has not only given hope to me and my family but it is transforming and nurturing the development of a whole nation as we the beneficiaries are the future of Ghana. Receiving this scholarship has fortified my identity as a beacon of hope and example to many youth especially the females (brilliant but needy students like me) in my community. EPI has given not only me but others an opportunity to acquire the needed knowledge to make meaningful contributions which will go a long way to affect and positively change the current state of growth and development in Ghana. Educational Pathways International(EPI) to me is more like a family.

I appreciate the financial aid I am receiving from the EPI. The scholarship is helping me greatly. It has relieved me from worrying about paying for my accommoduation, my school fees, books and I also my upkeep money.Awarding me the scholarship enabled me to concentrate on my education. I am getting closer to my dream. I believe my dream of becoming an Economist will come to realization. Having been awarded EPI scholarship in 2013, I have realized that EPI is more of a family than a scholarship scheme. As a family the welfare of every member (beneficiary) is at heart. EPI goes the extra mile to give you a better future. Apart from the financial support, I also receive training in areas such as Time Management, Career Development, Goal Setting, Entrepreneurship, among others. According to Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United State of America "an investment in education pays the best dividend". It is one of the best investment a country can make in its citizens, a father can give to his children and it is critical in reducing poverty and inequality in all forms. If all students in low-income countries left school with basic reading and arithmetic skills about 171 million could be lifted out of poverty. Why is this so? Because education gives people critical skills and tools to help them better provide for themselves, their family and society. What other investment is better than giving tertiary education to the youth? Giving education to the less privileged is exactly what the EPI does. It identifies the brightest from family of great needs and offer them tertiary education. Education has the power to break poverty cycle, kill illiteracy and ignorance. EPI gives us that power.EPI is the family everyone should look up to. It is the pacesetter in lifting the youth of Ghana from ignorance and illiteracy. Knowledge is power and it is life transforming. I doff my hat to Mr. .Leonard Lafrance, Mrs. Sarah Lafrance , our Country Coordinator and EPI in general for their great work.I strongly recommend EPI to any donor and any brilliant student ready to continue his/her education to the tertiary level. I am highly honoured to be a member of this family. Thanks for coming to my aid when I was in financial crisis. God bless you. DANIEL AFENYAUniversity of Ghana, LegonBA.

I can now go on outreaches to teach the preventive aspects of health.

Thanks so much Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance.   Aside the financial benefits (not having to worry about when I will pay my fees, hostel accommodation, books, upkeep money and how Im going to survive on campus) that I enjoyed, EPI offered me the platform to meet inspiring minds (that have increased the numbers in my social circle) who have been family to me and not just a group of beneficiaries. As if that wasnt enough, EPI offered me the chance to give back to community. We undertake voluntary teaching in less endowed school, thereby contributing to national development. Now we just dont stop there, we also aid children of other communities, thereby cultivating the spirit of giving in us. I am now a proud member of EPI Alumni. And what excites me most about EPI is that, it has structures that bring the alumni together to share ideas, experiences and opportunities that ensures a long term solidarity. I am forever grateful for the value EPI has added to my life. I had EPI by my side and today I am this confident, kind and wonderful gentleman contributing to nation building. ALAS, I AM AN ENGINEER.

Fortunately, EPI came to my aid and I can confidently say I no longer worry about finances which has allowed me to fullyfocus on my studies and graduate with a goodclass. Indeed, EPI has made my educational pursuit a possibility. EPI has not only offered me financial assistance but also, EPI has established a system that offers me numerous benefits that are non-existent with almostall the other scholarship schemes available to students at the University of Ghana. EPI has an organizational framework that captures its beneficiaries needs and properly addresses them. EPI is the only scholarship scheme on my campus that has its own office with a formidable Coordinator (Auntie Eunice) that administers the affairs of the scheme for the welfare of its beneficiaries. The Coordinator guides, counsels and directs us (beneficiaries)to excel academically and morally and also train us with skills and information that we will need in the working world,and most importantly, she makes sure our funds are releasedto us on time.  EPI inspires me to learn harder by awarding beneficiaries who excel in their fields of study. To me, EPI is a family that brings the beneficiaries together to share opportunities and experiences. This has created a strong family bond among the beneficiaries and the benefactors. What excites me most about EPI is that; it has structures that bringthe alumni together to share ideas, experiences and opportunities that ensures a long term solidarity.  Last but not the least, EPI makes sure its beneficiaries undertake internships during vacations which has helped me to develop new skills, gain confidence in my abilities and also network.I am living a comfortable life on campus thanks to EPI for its financial support, guidance and counselling. EPI has made my academic goal a reality. I recommend EPI for its selfless support in changing the lives of numerous youth in Ghana.

I am reading BSc. Medical Laboratory Technology.  EPI has taken away the burden of thinking of how to pay my school fees, how to get money for securing an accommodation, money to feed myself, acquiring books to study and many more. Added to the financial aid are the benefits I have derived from the seminars, internships and mentorship programs - all because of EPI. I have personally benefited more than I anticipated - EPI is really helping me in nurturing my dreams and bringing them into fruition. Furthermore, I enjoy our meetings usually organized by the local Coordinator, Auntie Eunice Adjoa Eghan. Auntie Eunice (as she is affectionately called by EPI beneficiaries), has helped me immensely. Due to the demanding nature of my program of study and lack of proper planning on my part, I began retrogressing academically and this caused me extreme emotional and psychological distress. Auntie Eunice was quick to help me when she noticed that fall in my academic performance. There I received encouragement, academic guidance and counseling which was very effective, and this has helped me improved in my academics.  In a nutshell, I want to emphasize that it is only with EPI that such help could be gotten.EPI has given me the opportunity to meet and network with other eminent beneficiaries of this scholarship. As a matter of fact, there is an impressive difference in the benefit one gets with EPI which cannot be gotten with other charitable organizations in education. I will say that the EPI program has modified my expectation for the future; now I have a burning and insatiable desire to give back to society to the best of my ability.To me EPI is not just a charitable organization that takes care of the education of brilliant but needy students but a fabulous and a fantastic family.  Indeed EPI has proved to be more than a boon companion.

I applied for the program when I realized the need to obtain some form of financial support in my tertiary education. After two interviews, I was given the opportunity to join the scholarship program and the rest was history. Initially I thought the program was to only provide financial support but I soon realized that it was more than I actually thought. They also engaged the beneficiaries in periodic meetings which enabled us to learn some lessons on time management, goal setting and other topics which were essential to us as students and individuals. The meetings also served as a means of ensuring that we bonded well with the other beneficiaries and the Coordinator as well.  Such meetings gave us the platform to express any form of recommendation or grievance that we faced as students to our CoordinatorOne thing that I am impressed about this family is that, they take a keen interest in the academics of every student on the program. Although it is a requirement to do well academically to renew ones scholarship annually, they see to it that we are actually learning. Any concerns we have in our studies are addressed as much as possible, even to the extent of arranging and paying for extra tuition for students on probation if need be. The periodic meetings also serves as a platform for the Coordinator to encourage us to study and be the best that we can become. Another requirement to remain on this program was to engage in internships or community services when school is on break in summer. Although this was a requirement, they did not leave us to the mercy of searching for an Organization by ourselves but ensured that we had Organizations to work with and they even send applications on our behalves just to ensure that we did our internships. At the end of every internship we were made to write a report, which is an essential skill that we learnt and will forever cherish.Personally, EPI has really lived up to my expectations over these past three and half years of being in school. I have the privilege to be supported financially throughout my time in the university. I already had the zeal to learn but EPI gave me an extra motive to learn. Now I that I am almost through with my degree, I have learnt to focus on the most important things that I have to achieve and work towards, for this period of my life it is making the best out the opportunity given to me to learn without any financial burden.  Also, I have made a lot of friends, and learnt a lot of skills through our periodic meetings, which I believe are very beneficial.I will like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance, my former and current coordinators, the Students and Financial Aid Office of this university and Educational Pathways International (EPI) as a whole for supporting me both financially and non - financially to make my dream a reality. God bless EPI and I recommend her for an award for her great sacrifices and support to the numerous youth in Ghana. Thank you.

Educational Pathways International (EPI) did not come to us to provide money just to satisfy our immediate hunger, but has set us in a position to alleviate poverty in our country. The organization provides enough financial support to cover tuition, boarding, study materials and other expenses relating to our studies at the universities. I strongly believe that education is a major key, if not the only key, with which one can change society. EPI have given us a peace of mind to study. The financial ease they have provided, coupled with other workshops and training they organize for us, put us in better positions to impact on society through community services.The Lafrances did not only provide us with funds but also encouragement and warmth, through Auntie Eunice, the Coordinator and sometimes through their visits to Ghana. They give us advice, just as a parent would do and always provide us with more purposes to strive for success and make positive impacts in our society. I always feel the presence of that love from a parent when I am on campus because I know EPI has got my back in the absence of my parents.EPI has raised me from a level of hopelessness to a level full of hopes and I am now more purpose-driven than ever. I now have a stronger desire to help alleviate poverty from my community and beyond, thanks to EPI.  Richard Osei KwameBusiness Administration3rd Year, University of Ghana (Legon)

I am a third year Human Biology student of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). After going through a highly competitive interview, I was selected to join the wonderful family of Educational Pathways International (EPI) in October 2015 and I am currently enjoying a full scholarship for the rest of the my university education.   I was just one of many medical students with chronic financial challenges and understandably pessimistic about my prospects in life. Thanks to EPI, these problems are nowbehind me and I am motivated more than ever to study well and do my best while in school and even after school.Not onlydoes EPI provide for us financially but also,EPI monitor our progress in academics, health and extracurricular activities.EPI has given us hope and instilled in us the spirit of altruism. EPI is definitely healing the world and making it a better place for students with financial challenges and in fact other challenges. For me, EPI is a five-star non-profit organization. I am happy and proud to be part of EPI Family. I recommend any award and encouragement  be given to EPI for it selfless and dedicated efforts in the lives of the youth in Ghana.

I am currently in my penultimate year in a six-year Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery degree programme at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), one of the best universities in Ghana, my home country, and in Africa at large. I have been afforded this whole opportunity for a bright future by the Educational Pathways International (EPI). EPI is such a great initiative. I have personally had an overwhelming support through almost five good years of medical school.Five years ago, I could only dream of how to get through medical school due to financial constraints. But now I see my dream come true because of the financial aid, academic guidance, counselling and encouragement that I have received from EPI. In just a year and five months, I will be graduating from medical school, God-willing, poised to affect my community, my country and the world at large to help people just as EPI has helped me.The whole of Educational Pathways International, Mrs. Sara Lafrance, Mr. Leonard Lafrance and Auntie Eunice Adjoa Eghan are truly God-given. EPI epitomizes a true non-profit.

This hasn't been the only platform I've used. I'm just overwhelmed by Educational Pathways International that I always want to show gratitude with my testimony to people and on platforms like this one. Being through education, in a developing country, with a financial burden is a very bitter pill to take.  I, Vincent Appiah, have been greatly aided financially by the Educational Pathways International since I made it to the School of Medical Sciences of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology - Ghana to pursue Medicine. It is by far the best scholarship scheme in the university now, making provision for my fees, hostel facility, books and even personal upkeep as a student, as well as for several others like me in my university and the other public universities in Ghana. This nonprofit organization has seen me through when even my supporting parents had no means to meet all my financial needs in school and my Uncle got weary of the financial burden I was to him. I just thank my parents and my uncle for being always there for me. But for EPI, it all happened like a miracle in my life and as a beneficiary, the good role of EPI in my life cannot be overemphasized. Educational Pathways International is truly an outstanding Non-Profit.
Educational Pathways International	278522	4	/users/profile/368481	Elvis_UGMS	Client Served	5	01/31/2016	Educational Pathway International cannot simply be defined by fathomable tenets of good will and sacrifices. In my opinion, they are Messiahs: little gods among mankind - abandoning their lives and illuminating the darkest crevices of near impossibilities battered with fear, suffering and hopelessness, is a sacrifice worth recommending. I have heard about the good works of Educational Pathway International before I managed to master the courage to further my education at the tertiary level. Some of my friends have benefited from scholarship packages granted for free through the benevolence of the founders of Educational Pathway International. My experience with Educational Pathway International has been overwhelming and full of blessing. I will do my best to summarize my points, in order to make it possible for people to learn about the positive impacts that this great non-profit organization is having on other beneficiaries. When I completed Senior High School, I could only dream of University as an opportunity for a few fortunate individuals. I learnt also that obtaining the best grade do not guarantee that you are bound to make progress in life if you live in a remote village and descends from a humble home like mine.  In my community, education is nothing that people value. Well, I do not blame them much because the firm pillars of penury that weakly support the people is so brittle that the most poised individuals found themselves crashing to the hard. The more you aspire; the more painful your disappointment. The youth who are able bodied are seen engaged in illegal gold mining since it provides the sole source of income in the perils of abject poverty, lack of job opportunities coupled with unqualified retinue of families who can survive on the provision of daily bread. When I completed my basic school education, there was blur possibility that I will further my education. However, since I managed to obtain one of the best results in the national examination; there was a glimpse of hope. I was nominated for presidential awards but in the midst of competition with the privileged in Ghana is always tilted in favor to the rich. A painful lesson, I learn at age 12. I was, however, proven wrong by Mr. and Mrs. Lafranc, founders of Educational Pathway International when they offloaded my worries and fears in moment dire strait.  My desire to pursue higher education to change my destiny and that of my community kept me moving on. I managed to set a small business which I used to finance myself through my secondary education. By God's grace I obtain distinction. I could have done better if I was not exercising double sided life- a student in the morning and a casual worker in the afternoon. It took me three years of working to accumulate enough funds to pay for my University admission fee. How I would survive after that, I had no idea. The thought of loosing my initial investment by failing to fend for myself in the coming years drained my hope and left me dejected.  I applied for sponsorship from Educational Pathway International. God being so good, I was awarded a full scholarship. I paid nothing in the application and I am not being charged to do anything to offset the favor. I am most impressed about the fact I have the opportunity to buy most expensive medical books and I believe that I will improve my performance in my quest to become one of the best medical practitioners in the world. My words to people who may read this and find themselves in either the same situation as mine or even worse must know this "giving up is not the solution; persevering is the only proof that you wanted to win".  Secondly, there are people with beautiful hearts that think about us; and have sleepless nights over the problems we are facing. They are angels- God's mortal hand granting the wishes of mankind, dissipating the worries of mankind and showing the light at the end of the tunnels of our lives. Since I became associated with Educational Pathway International, I do not worry about how I will pay my fees and other educational needs. I am concentrated on my books and my future goals to assist others. I am saved to serve. Educational Pathway International also organize occasional educational tutorials and counselling services. I always talk to the program coordinator in Ghana about my problems and she is so quick to address them. This is a rare opportunity because I hardly, have someone who cares to talk to. I am blessed to have such a family. I am most intrigued about the sacrifices of the founders who are personally funding dozens of students with financial needs. When I went for my first general meeting with the founders, University officials and beneficiaries, I became overwhelmed by the large number of people that Educational Pathway International is paying their full educational needs. My prayer is that may the good Lord continually bless them and give them opportunity to expand their resources to support other students in Ghana and the rest of the world. I read that, Educational Pathway International has spread it wings of Charity to another University in Ghana (UDS) which I am sincerely pleased about because dozens of possible future leaders who cannot make progress in their educational resolutions without the singular support of Educational Pathway International can realize their dreams. "In the end we will not remember the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends" was the fear of Martin Luther King Jr. that he would receive no assistance. However, in my case, my friend, Educational Pathway International has roared so loud that noise of enemies of my progress have been silenced.  In the end the roar of our friend (EPI) echoed hope and life, putting to death the obstructions of failure. Agyemang, Elvis EffahBachelor of Medicine and SurgeryUniversity of Ghana Medical School, Ghana
Educational Pathways International	276305	4	/users/profile/366040	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/11/2016	I wish to present this extremely positive review of the Educational Pathways International foundation. I am a Foundation Professor Emeritus of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, and a Fulbright Senior Fellow.  Thus, I am knowledgeable about university educational programs.  In addition, I have lectured at numerous foreign universities around the world and participated on scientific advisory boards in the US and in two foreign countries.  These activities have giving me a comprehensive insight into international university programs providing me the expertise to evaluate Educational Pathways International (EPI).  EPI was founded in 2007 to provide scholarships for gifted students of need in Ghana.  Working with the Ghanaian universities, EPI selects and then supports their scholarship students with educational and living expenses as well as guidance and support in the areas of academic performance.  To date, EPI has supported 64 students who have graduated from the University of Ghana or Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST).  Each of these students are now either completing their national service with a commercial, educational, or non-profit enterprise (a requirement for students in their first post-graduation year), actively working in a career position, or enrolled in a graduate program.  Another 94 students are being supported by EPI and are working towards achieving their undergraduate degree. These numbers indicate the outstanding success realized by EPI and the positive impact of this nonprofit on university education in Ghana.   Furthermore, I had the opportunity to meet and hear a presentation by one of the graduates of this program; he was in the US for graduate studies. The sprit of EPI was endorsed by this students intent to return to Ghana with all the expertise he could gain while in the US. He told his audience that his goal was to contribute to the development of his country.  I am impressed also by EPIs objective to identify these gifted individuals who would otherwise not be able to afford a university education, and thus, would not achieve the potential to use their exceptional intellect to further the advancement of their country.  It is my opinion that EPI should have the highest rating as a nonprofit international-education foundation.  Respectfully submitted,  Ardythe A. McCracken, PhD  
Educational Pathways International	275889	6	/users/profile/365560	Writer	Client Served	5	01/07/2016	I am writing this review on behalf of the University for Development Studies, Tamale. This is the first year of our collaboration with EPI and our experiences are very positive, We had opportunity to gain scholarships for five of our undergraduate students in this academic year. EPI personnel were involved throughout the selection process, helping us with information on their earlier experience in Ghana, brochures etc. At the same time, they were also open to suggestions from our own end, as to how to conduct the entire selection process, so the final result was satisfactory  for us all. I hope that in the coming period we can continue and expand the collaboration. There are many worthy and deserving students who need help from organizations such as EPI within UDS. We especially like the emphasis of the EPI on live interviews, with interest in where the potential beneficiaries see themselves after the course of their study and how they intend to give back to their community and region. This has brought about some valuable insights to the quality of students and also added to our information on the type of  education the applicants are receiving at UDS and the aspects of training the value most, such as Third Trimester Practical Training Programme.I am looking forward to the next opportunity for meeting with EPI and more interactions and discussions on how to improve current practices and empower students  financially as well as  to build their own confidence and encourage creativity.Prof. G.

Educational Pathways International	253651	4	/users/profile/341877	Edem S.	Client Served	5	08/22/2015	Hello Everyone! I am Senaya Edem Kwasi, a fresh graduate from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana  Kumasi. I would love to add my review to the numerous reviews that my colleagues have beautifully written about Educational Pathways International [EPI] on this platform.  I will do my best to be brief. Lets Get Started! First of all, I am really excited to share my review on this platform because I wouldnt be here da it not been EPIs intervention. After completion of high school, I had no intention of starting tertiary education immediately because of lack of funds. This is because I had to work myself through high school. But once I was done with high school and is eligible for tertiary education, the dream of attaining higher education reignited in me once again and I began the search for funds to continue my education by taking on any job that is available.  I applied to the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and had admission to read Civil Engineering. I was very much excited when I had admission but that joy was short-lived due to the fact that I have no one to go to with my admission letter for sponsorship. It was one of the sad moments in my life due to the fact that, I will not be able to start my tertiary education even though I had admission. I therefore decide to ask friends for money to pay my admission fee and start school. I did not know how I was going to continue after my first year since I was taking loans from my friends to pay my fee and I had to redeem those monies taken. I was in a difficulty situation at that time but I think my determination to attain higher education overrode my challenges so I gave myself to the challenge. I took up the challenge with the few monies I was able to gather and paid my admission fee. I only got to campus and realized that unlike high school where I pay my fee and had accommodation and feeding in addition, the same does not apply to the University. This means that I have to look for money for accommodation and also funds for feeding the rest of the semester but I had nothing on me. I had to perch with a friend which was illegal according to the schools rules and regulations. I had to speak with one of the hall masters who after listening to my story and how far I have struggled to this stage allowed me to perch with anyone that will allow me to be with them. I had to rely on my friends for my feeding, registration and stationary. Living was really tough for me at that time. The saddest day of my life on KNUST campus was during matriculation. I cried that day. I cried because I was not able to take a matriculation picture. My friends were busily taking photos with their families. And I was standing alone. After matriculation, I left campus for the house because I thought I could not make it. It really became difficult for me but I had to return to complete the battle I had started when I saw something on the schools website that caught my attention. I was on the schools website when I saw an advertisement for a scholarship and I decided to give it a chance. It was Educational Pathways International.  This scholarship took away a burden that was too heavy for me to carry. I was able to settle all my debts; all thanks to EPI. I was able to attain a degree in Civil Engineering; all thanks to EPI. I have learned a lot of things that will make me a better person in future due to the meetings and seminars that the coordinator has been organizing for all beneficiaries; all thanks to EPI. I have developed the patriotic attitude of serving my nation Ghana; all thanks to EPI. I have hopes of pursuing further education in future even though I do not know how I will be able to fund that; all thanks to EPI. When my academics was going down Aunty Hanna, former EPI coordinator got me a personal assistant to help me boost my academic performance; all thanks to EPI. The current EPI coordinator Aunty Eunice is a source of motivation and encouragement to me. When I look up to her, I feel like I can achieve all the impossible dreams that I have; all thanks to EPI. In a nutshell, all that I am trying to say is that EPI has given a total transformation to my life and I will replicate all that I have learned from EPI to make life better for others in the future. I am very grateful to the Lafrances for this wonderful opportunity and also very much grateful to Aunty Eunice for been there for me throughout my hard times on campus.  EPI as an organization has given me a brighter future. Senaya Edem KwasiCivil EngineeringKwame Nkrumah University of Science and TechnologyKumasi  
Educational Pathways International	249027	3	/users/profile/336851	Phina	Client Served	5	07/21/2015	I am Miss Josephina Okang a beneficiary of   Educational Pathways International Scholarship (EPI). Education is said to be the key to success and for me personally, EPI has given me that key to success. EPI provided all the financial issues that comes with education and gave me the peace of mind to study without worrying about financial problem. I thought that education was for people who are born with silver spoons in their mouths but EPI proved that perception wrong.  EPI has not only given me the key to success through the rich education I received from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology ( KNUST) but has also educated a nation through me. This is because James Aggrey once noted that when you educate a woman you have educated a whole nation. I believe the education that EPI has helped me acquired will not be for only my benefit but I will used that knowledge acquired to promote the well-being of my society and nation as a whole. EPI did not only supported me financially but also monitor the progress of each beneficiary ensuring that academically we are doing well as well as matters concerning social, health and spiritual life of each member. This is done through organization of meetings, training sessions and socialization activities where all members participate vigorously in, discussing topics such as time management, setting goals which are realistic and achievable, writing of curriculum vitae and preparation for job interview and so many others. Indeed being part of EPI has made a great difference in my life. For me EPI is not just a charitable body that helps needy and brilliant tertiary institution students in Ghana; it is a wonderful and marvelous family which I am honored to be part of. I am grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance and EPI as a whole for giving me a better life for the future.  Josephina OkangLand EconomyKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology

I pursued BSc. Telecommunications Engineering. I was admitted into the Educational Pathways International (EPI) scholarship program during my third year, at a time when I was experiencing financial difficulties.  ,This great honour relieved me and my parents from this burden and gave me the opportunity to study with a free, open and relaxed mind. It helped me to resolve issues pertaining to my accommodation, school fees and materials I needed in order to finish my programme successfully. It gave me the kind of environment every student deserves to have, a smooth academic experience. Besides the financial assistance, EPI (the Lafrances, and Auntie Eunice, the National Coordinator) constantly checks on us, monitors our progress, and keeps advising us mostly on matters pertaining to our academic and social lives. These they did through emails, phone calls, and constant visits. These have all contributed to our success in the university and I am eternally grateful to EPI for the opportunity I was given. Long live EPI!
Educational Pathways International	247977	2	/users/profile/189588	Mr. Robert Nhyiraba Adjei	Client Served	5	07/10/2015	I agree perfectly with Jeffrey D. Sachs when he says that the key to ending extreme poverty is to enable the poor to get their foot on the ladder of development. The above statement to me is in line with Nelson Mandelas famous quote Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.  To some people the statement enabling the poor to get their foot on the ladder of development is a cliche, but to Educational Pathways International (EPI), it is all about giving brilliant and gifted students who are of low financial backgrounds the opportunity to further their education at the university level.  Among other students, EPI has for all my four-year stay at the University of Ghana campus paid my tuition and accommodation fees, books and living allowances. I always say that my academic excellence at the university was made possible by EPI. How could you get the peace of mind to study when you owe fees; when you have no place of accommodation on campus and above all being prevented from writing examinations due to unsettled fees?  Besides paying for my fees and other expenses, EPI goes the extra mile to ensure that its beneficiaries achieve greater academic excellence and are among the top graduating students each year. This it achieves by organizing counseling sessions for its students through their local trained Coordinator. The sessions discussed topics such as setting goals as a university student, effective time management, and prospects of developing volunteering attitudes among others.  As part of the scholarship programme, EPI during vacations places its students on internships and volunteering programs to put what they have learnt in the classroom into practice and solve societal problems. This has contributed significantly in our aim of bridging the gap between academia and industry.  Today, I have graduated with a BSc. in Administration (Accounting Option) and all these were made possible by EPI. Many thanks to EPI and may the Almighty God richly bless you. To the Lafrances (founders of EPI) and the rest of the EPI family who have made this possible, I say AYEKOOO!!!!!!!   Robert Adjei BSc.

Educational Pathways International	143156	3	/users/profile/189588	Mr. Robert Nhyiraba Adjei	Client Served	5	11/27/2012	Educational Pathways International presided by Mrs. Sara lafrance to me is a non-governmental organization that is destined to assist brilliant but needy students to sail smoothly through their tertiary education. The sponsorships provided by EPI to its beneficiaries cover tuition. textbooks and feeding expenses throughout their stay in any Public tertiary institution of thier choice in Ghana. This helps to lessen the burden on parents and help thse beneficiaries to fulfill their dreams which otherwise would have been impossible. What makes EPI unique and different from sponsorships provided by other non-profit organizations? Aside EPI providing sponsorships for we the beneficiaries, it also teaches us to render services and to give back to society anytime we get the opportunity. How does EPI achieve this? One of the requirements of this scholarship is for beneficiaries to engage in community services- teaching in schools in our communities, serving as role models to other students in our communities, among others, during our long vacations. EPI also makes sure that every beneficiary writes an official report of whatever he or she engaged in and these reports are thoroughly reviewed by the program coordinators to check for its authenticity. What's more? EPI also trains us and equip us with the skills needed to successfully serve on an internship program which is sponsored by the organization. Also, to ensure discipline and continuous handwork of the beneficiaries, EPI requires all beneficiaries to make a challenging grade point every semester throughout his or her stay in the university. This has helped me particularly a lot as it challenges me always to take my lessons seriously to make more than their required grade point. I really owe EPI a lot of appreciation and I humbly solicit your assistance to give this organization a standing ovation.
Educational Pathways International	241676	3	/users/profile/328290	Lindsey29	Board Member	5	04/24/2015	Educational Pathways International (EPI) is a true charity, created to enable the recipients of its scholarships improve themselves and, over the long term, improve their country. EPI provides young, bright, hardworking Ghanaian students educational and financial support to attend university full time when it would otherwise be beyond their reach.  As President of the University Studies Abroad Consortium (USAC), I am very familiar with EPI.  In addition to their support, in exchange for hard work and brilliant academic performances, EPI has partnered with USAC to create a buddy system matching US students with EPI scholarship recipients.  This relationship has proven beneficial for both organizations and creates a unique experience for both EPI scholars and USAC participants.  The buddy system fulfills the EPI scholars community service requirement for their scholarship, and it also provides USAC participants with genuine cultural immersion.  The Ghanaian culture relies heavily on relationships, and the Ghanaian students help USAC participants by welcoming them into their country and into their family and social circles.   Kudos to the officers of EPI.  It is a good and pure thing they do for the improvement of humanity.

EPI happens to be one of them. For the past seven years that EPI has been on the KNUST campus, I can assess them as being organized, consistent and reliable. The benefits EPI gives to her beneficiaries on campus here is more appreciable as compared to others and this covers up all their educational and living expenses. On behalf of the university, I wish to express my profound gratitude to EPI for her charitable assistance towards our brilliant but needy  students, putting smiles on their faces and helping those who would have found it difficult to pass through the university.

Mr. & Mrs. Lafrance, the founders of EPI, have a heart of gold. I am a beneficiary of their scholarship scheme and all I can say is thank you for giving me a second shot at success. I now stand a better chance to impact my world! EPI in summary, gives young bright students hope and a chance to dream again! I recommend EPI to any awarding organisation or body. They rock!
Educational Pathways International	144568	2	/users/profile/191104	Ayeleysa	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I am a beneficiary of Educational Pathways International's (EPI) generosity and great work in Ghana and can only say positive things about them! I am a final year business administration student in Ghana's high flying University Ashesi College and this was made possible through the help and support of EPI. I got awarded this scholarship at the beginning of my second year and it has been an amazing journey with them through out. EPI covers my tuition and accommodation and this support has contributed enormously to the great things I have achieved in school. It has given me the second chance to excel in life by becoming the young rising African star that I am. I have been able to participate in Model UN programs, which included the World Model UN conference held in Boston in 2010. I also interned with Goldman Sachs in the UK, during the 2012 Spring Internship Program and got offered a place in their summer 2013 Internship program. Furthermore, got selected to attend the annual WISE Summits held in Doha Qatar for two conservative years, firstly as a learner and then a mentor and speaker in the second year. Additionally, I served students in the capacity of the Ashesi Student Cpuncil Welfare Chairperson in my second and third year. During my tenure in office, some of the things I did included organizing the second annual talent show dubbed Kaleidoscope, which raised funds to support students. I also sat on the board who disbursed some of these funds (from the Student Scholarship fund, set up by an Ashesi Student and managed by students) to two students to cover their tuition by $1000 each during the 2011-2012 academic year. All of these milestones would not have been possible/realized, without the assistance of EPI. They also have an office here in Ghana which serves as a great support center for beneficiaries of their scholarship program and this is just amazing. Another exciting part of the program, which is worth mentioning is the fact that Sara  and Leonard Lafrance; the leadership of the program, embark on annual visits to Ghana every year to get updated and track the progress of students on the program. This demonstrates their dedication to the program and commitment to the students they support; a testament of true leadership!  Just as I mentioned in my introduction, I can only but praise this nonprofit for all the outstanding work they are doing with students in Ghana, spanning Ashesi University College, Unvieristy of Ghana Legon and Kwame Nkrumah Univeristy of Science and Technology KNUST, to mention a few.  This nonprofit is certainly worth noticing and I am grateful for all their suppport!

Educational Pathways International has been an umbrella to shelter me from some major storms in my life, and a rock i can lean on. The scholarship enabled me to stay comfortably in school and concentrate on gaining knowledge to better the world around me. I also gained a new set of friends who were always there for me. I remember when the programme coordinator during my time in school would call me and my friends, also on the scheme, to teach us some valuable life skills not taught in the classroom. She would also speak to me about relationships, ask about my family and put her romantic novels at my disposal. I felt that Sara and Leonard Lafrance believed in me and expected great and admirable things from me; it was one of my greatest sources of motivation.  It made me gain confidence in myself and my abilities and, opened my eyes to the great things I could do for myself and the people around me. I still feel same. It has been two years since I completed my undergraduate degree in Banking and Finance, but EPI still has an interest in my life. The EPI family shared in my joy when I secured a position in a reputable bank in the country after my graduation, and continue to do so as I climb the corporate ladder and transform into a matured and wise woman.  I believe that EPI will be with me in every step of the way, in all areas of my life cheering me on and supporting me. I gained a new family when I went looking for financial assistance. EPI is family.  I strongly recommend EPI to any awarding organization; EPI and the Lafrances are a gift to mankind.  Sophia Acquah

Aside the good academic performance I learn a lot of skills and abilities that cannot be achieved in the lecture hall. Through it yearly internship program, I am able to learn basic office skill, techniques and have experience which helps me in every work environment I found myself.

Educational Pathways International	237602		/users/profile/322361	Jonathan_Alidu_Salifu	Volunteer	3	02/04/2015	Educational Pathways International which supports needy but brilliant students really made my path through KNUST a success. EPI took away the burden of having to think of how to pay my fees, how to feed and more importantly supported me in getting books to study. EPI advocates for good grades. This made it possible and motivated me to graduate with first class honours in Electrical/Electronic Engineering. EPI is a family to me. One thing I really like about EPI is the unity within its members even after graduation we still hold meetings to discuss how to help our community and we also receive messages from our sponsors and coordinators. With the support of EPI through its community service, I can now speak in public. This has been of immerse help to me during my national service with Ghana Grid company since we give presentations during safety meetings. EPI also gave me the medium to reach out to the people in my community so as to help. To Mr. and Mrs. Lafrance and all those that support EPI I thank you very much for the impact you have played in my life, not only academically but also all spheres of my life through your guidance and support. I recommend EPI to any awarding organization for their selfless dedication to mankind.  Jonathan Alidu Salifu

Educational Pathways International	237553		/users/profile/322256	Emmanuel K.	Client Served	5	02/02/2015	I am happy to write this review as a beneficiary of EPI full scholarship program during my undergraduate studies at the University of Ghana. Currently, I serve as the President of the EPI Alumni Charter in Ghana. The aims of EPI, of making the African continent a better place to live, rightly coincide with those of many Africans seeking higher education to build their skillset for the job market and to contribute their quota to their nations development.  EPI, over the past years, has collaborated with leading universities in Ghana to train African intellectuals with appreciable and evidence-based understanding of African societies, pre and post-colonial past, values and institutions. The end goal is that these trained Africans can lead the search for African model of development that would restore human dignity and decent living to ordinary people in Africa.  Clauses in the EPI scholarship agreement seek to solve the problem of brain drain. I strongly believe that the best means of tackling Africas development problem is to train African intellectuals to lead the quest for finding solutions to their countrys development problems. That exactly is the business of EPI. EPI did not only remove my financial burden during my undergraduate Political Science studies at the University of Ghana, it also encouraged me to believe in myself and to think beyond the ordinary. EPIs merit-based scholarship takes into consideration high academic scores, past leadership and voluntary activities, in the selection process. High academic scores are also needed to maintain the scholarship throughout undergraduate years.  The EPI country coordinator is a great addition to the program. She is unceasingly looking out for you, readily writes recommendations and even speaks with organizations on your behalf for internship opportunities. By the time I was done with my undergraduate studies, I had enormous volunteer and paid work experience on my resume. These voluntary services helped me to develop key competencies such as good communication, presentation, interpersonal and networking skills, probing and analytical thinking abilities.    EPI Alumni Charter and Activities EPI alumni consist of young graduates from University of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and Ashesi University College who have all benefited from the EPI scholarship while undertaking their undergraduate degrees. These young graduates, now with different types of work experience, skill-set and qualifications in Medicine, Computer Science, Engineering, Economics, Banking and Finance, Leadership and Communication, have the potential and motivation to succeed in varying working environments while giving back to society through voluntary work.  The alumni charter, the yearly alumni meeting with the Lafrances and the periodic alumni meeting with EPI country coordinator are all means of continuously supporting EPI scholars after completing school. The President, Sara Lafrance, and the EPI office in Ghana have both written compelling recommendation letters for some EPI graduates, including myself, for post graduate studies and for job interviews. The yearly meeting with the Lanfrances provides an interesting experience as alumni take turns to share their entrepreneurial stories and dreams for the future.      Creditably, EPI graduates from all universities continue to stay in touch through the Alumni Network Charter. This networking has helped some scholars to secure jobs and scholarships for post-graduate studies. The EPI alumni charter is currently undertaking a community service project in selected Senior High Schools in Ghana to provide mentoring, teaching support, public health education, scholarship application processes, motivation and career development information to students and staff. The services we provide for Senior High Schools are entirely voluntary with all funding borne by the EPI alumni. This is one of our means of giving back to society and we are highly elated to do this.  Emmanuel KpogoEPI Alumni President, Ghana

It has been a life-transforming experience for me. Now in my third year in medical school, it would have been extremely difficult to reach where I am if not for the timely award of the EPI scholarship. The scholarship has not only provided financial support for me, but it has provided much needed academic counseling and the opportunity to meet and network with other distinguished scholarship beneficiaries. This is strikingly different from many of the charity organizations working in education. The EPI program has changed my perspectives about life; it has built an unquenchable test to give back to society in whatever capacity I can.  Wutor Mahama BalengPresident  EPI Beneficiaries, KNUSTBSc.

I am proud and overly joyed to be part of the EPI family. I am a current beneficiary of the EPI scholarship in the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.  My headache each passing day had always been how to be able to provide my school fees, obtain books( which are really costly considering my course of study) , accommodation and other accessories for my university education. EPI did not only give me hope, but it opened a new chapter in my goals and aspirations. I can now have the peace of mind to study and engage in meaningful academic work without thinking much about where I would be able to get my fees for the next academic year, which hitherto had been the status quo.EPI has not only helped me to appreciate help, but has positioned me to be one to offer help to all who I am able to help today and in the future

This dream motivated me to study hard during my pre-university levels of education. I excelled at all the levels, having being the best student throughout these levels. After the Senior High School (SHS), there stood a stumbling block on my path to prevent me from achieving the dream. This blockade was the problem of financial incapacity to further my education to the University level.It was here that the Educational Pathways International (EPI) came my way to clear the blockade. The Educational Pathways International (EPI) had provided all my educational needs, including tuition fees, accommodation fees, study materials fees and pocket money during my four years at the University of Ghana.

You had a husband who used to pound fufu, a local meal, for chop bars. But he's gone. The elder boy wakes up at 4 am, scales fish for commercial cooking, prepares the firewood, and does other jobs for the chop bar. He has hardly time to take his bath and rushes to school. He closes and comes back to work at the chop bar till night falls, frying fish, sometimes also pounding fufu, just like his father did. And yet, despite such severe hardships, when he sits for external examinations like WASSCE, he scores "A"s. And he walks away after hearing his results, dejected, losing meaning in life because he knows there is no one he can look up to finance his education. And here comes, Educational Pathways International.What is life without self-worth? What is life without meaning? What is life without self-actualization? If EPI seeks not only to finance the education of such poor but brilliant students but provide as well coaching and counseling services to  them, EPI has also established a platform with an engine to produce institutional leadership for the country.Without doubt, such a local contribution for turning round the history of individuals is also an effective contribution for turning around community history.Ohene Bonsu

EPI has become a beacon of hope to a growing number of gifted young university students of need in our country, Ghana.   The scholarship takes total care of students tuition, accommodation, books and upkeep money (pocket money as we call it in Ghana) as well as providing students with comprehensive counseling, guidance and support in the areas of academic performance, career development, leadership and internship programmes. And these have built and increased the confidence of these brilliant students. The love, dedication and care that are shown these students by Mrs. Sara Lafrance and her husband Mr. Leonard Lafrance is amazing and worth emulating. At the moment we have graduated forty-two (42) students who have benefited from a four-year full university scholarship package. Some of these students have found themselves successfully employed in reputable companies in the country, others are doing their masters either abroad or locally whiles our currents graduates are giving back to the society by doing national service in various cities, towns and villages in the country.   They have become role models to other students in their communities, especially those who initially did not have any hope of achieving higher education. EPI is associated with high achievers who are positioned and shaped for future leadership in Ghana and Africa at large.   I am proud and happy to be part of EPI Family.  I strongly favour any encouragement that can be given to Educational Pathways International for its dedicated selfless efforts.

Personally, I see EPI not only as a charitable organization but also as a strong advocate of the above saying. Throughout my university education in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, I have realised that not only did EPI relieve me of a financial burden, made me focused on my studies and eliminated any chance of me dropping out and not getting the degree I want, but earning a prestigious and merit-based scholarship like EPI actually made me more of an attractive job candidate. Employers who understand the competitive nature of the scholarship recognize it as an accomplishment since it reflects ones exceptional ability in the academics.Moreover, aside academics, EPI have made a big difference in how much time and resources I had to spend on enhancing my experience and knowledge through internships and seminars. For example, EPI have provided an internship opportunity of which I took part. The opportunity presented was a voluntary service teaching experience at the senior high school level. EPI have organized life changing motivational meetings or seminars on time management, setting of goals in life and many more talks providing me priceless knowledge and training both academically and in life. The teachings and motivations have made a huge impact on my decision making and time management. This provided me the chance to sharpen my teaching skills. Also, the money and security afforded by EPI allowed me to be more selective in how I spent my free time. It helped me effectively concentrate on completing my studies, not only economically, but also for my personal and professional enrichment. As a national service personnel working with EPI, I feel privileged and honoured to be of use to this wonderful organization. If the working experience is nothing but amazing, then I dont know what it is. I am humbly appreciative and grateful for the assistance Mr and Mrs Lafrance have extended to me through this program. To the amazing duo, I say a very big Thank You. EPI is doing a great job by nurturing generations to make the world a better place through provision of financial support, cultivation of character and intelligence, the true goals of education. EPI is the best and I would like to recommend EPI to any awarding body capable of supporting in any way possible to help EPI to continue being a bigger blessing to all. Long live EPI!

During that time I have reviewed EPI scholarship applications and more recently have financially supported two EPI scholarships. In fact, just this week my husband and I received a letter of appreciation from the young man whose scholarship we are financing at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana. His academic success coupled with  the deep appreciation he expressed for our financial support brought tears to my eyes along with a resolve to fund more scholarships.

Thereafter, I felt cushioned, confident, focused, empowered and well placed to realize my most cherished scholastic ambition. With the help of EPI, I eventually graduated from the university with real excellence. I had no worry concerning the payment of fees and obtaining materials that facilitate academic work.

As a beneficiary, EPI pays my tuition and accommodation fees and in addition to that adds some money as my allowance for my upkeep. This makes my tertiary education less stressful in terms of finances. I am able to concentrate on my academic work and study well. In addition to these, EPI organizes very educative programes for her beneficiaries in the course of the academic year and ensures that her students give their bit to mother Ghana through voluntary community services during the summer vacation. Not only does EPI support me financially, she also sees to  my physical, mental and emotional well being through our cordinator. In fact, EPI is more than just a group. To me, EPI is a wonderful family headed by the La Frances and whose members are their brothers keepers.

Educational Pathways International	170107		/users/profile/190781	NLS1	Board Member	5	09/17/2013	Educational Pathways International has made a palpable difference in the lives of many young people in Ghana.  I saw this in person when one of the recipients of an EPI scholarship visited California recently after studying in the US for a year in an Elon University study abroad program.  This individual was overflowing in his gratitude for the support that EPI had provided him in Ghana, and it was obvious that this support changed his life prospects.  He also expressed a determination to make a difference himself in his country.  EPI focuses on very capable young people in dire need of financial support to complete a university education.  These are the very people that Ghana needs to insure a future for the country.  EPI goes to significant lengths to build expectations on the part of recipients that they are expected - and indeed are chosen on this basis - to have a commitment to helping build a future for Ghana as well as for themselves individually.  It appears that EPI is succeeding on both goals.  The organization is expanding its educational mission into the area of preparation for leadership, so that the students they support learn how to make a difference and expand their aspirations to do so. EPI is well run and well financed for its purposes, due to the generosity of its founders, and is very deserving of the widespread support that it enjoys in both Ghana and the US. 
Educational Pathways International	144262		/users/profile/190781	NLS1	Board Member	5	11/29/2012	EPI is a very well run nonprofit devoted to providing scholarships to very worthy needy young people in Ghana so that they can attend university.  The organization uses a thoughtful process for identifying gifted students and provides sufficient reseources to them so that they can fulfill their aspirations as well as become part of the cohort of the population on which the country depends for its future success.  The founders have been very focused on increasing the effectiveness of the organization through their time and resources, and have gone so far as to create and fund a position in Ghana to further the work of EPI.  Over just a few years, they have made the EPI scholarships widely known within the two major universities in Ghana, assisted a large number of very capable students, and made their scholarships a highly sought and presitigious form of recognition.  Given the poverty of the society, I think it is fair to say that the EPI scholarships have had a life-changing impact on many your people in Ghana.

I joined this organization in 2012/2013 academic year, and to be sincere EPI has been so good to me that I do not know how to express my gratitude. They do not just support beneficiaries financially but also organize series of educational programs such as how to prepare for job interviews and Curriculum Vitae writing for their students. It is indeed a blessing that we have such a wonderful organization in Ghana. 
Educational Pathways International	168831	1	/users/profile/223804	Kofi Newton	Volunteer	5	09/10/2013	Educational Pathways International is indeed a non for profit organisation.  I am a beneficiary of EPI. EPI has really given me power over choices in life, it has really hone my innate abilities with the reason that the education financial constraints I had initially have now been minimized by EPI. There is a saying by Abraham Lincoln- Do not worry when you are not recognized but strive to be worthy of recognition". EPI has striven to be worthy of recognition through the full scholarship it is given to KNUST students and other universities.

Client Served	5	09/07/2013	Educational Pathways International is a nonprofit organization that give a helping hand to brilliant but needy students in their education. I became a part of this wonderful family in 2013 and trust me I love every bit of its activities. It came to time in my education where I've lost all hopes of continuing my education successfully but EPI came to my rescue and I can boast of a successful education. EPI has been assisting many Ghanaian students to attain their goal in education and use the knowledge they acquire to contribute to the development of our nation in the near future. EPI has made incredible turnover to the lives of many Ghanians and the nation as a whole in developing its human resources to their full potential.

The sponsorship from this great organization is absolutely encouraging and highly appreciated. EPI has wonderfully contributed to my education as an undergraduate. The educational talks and teachings not forgetting the moral support from our coordinators have gone a long way to shape me as an undergraduate. Not forgetting the adequate financial support I receive from this wonderful organization. If not for EPI, the likes of me would not enjoy a problem free education in the university. All I can say is that God bless  Eductional Pathway International for their wonderful and highly appreciated support. They made us better students!
Educational Pathways International	166513		/users/profile/188135	Carmelo Urza	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/29/2013	EPI is one of those nonprofits that are real.  Its purpose is to help bright Ghanaian students from economically difficult circumstances attend the University of Ghana and earn a degree.  My organization sends U.S. students to Ghana and we partner with EPI in such a way that it enhances the experience of the U.S students as well as those of EPI.EPI is managed and funded by caring professionals and is very efficient and well run.  It does what it says it does.  The lives of many students from both sides of the Atlantic, but particularly from Ghana are altered forever through the generosity and oversight of the EPI board and staff in Ghana.

We have collaborated with EPI for several years, both with the founders of EPI and with its in country staff.  It is one of those win win arrangements for both of our organizations and primarily for the students of both entities: EPI's Ghanaian poor but bright and capable university students and the U.S.university students we send to Accra.  It is a pleasure to collaborate with an organization that is both altruistic and generous and, at the same time efficient and businesslike.  EPI is what a not for profit should aspire to become.

The EPI team visits each year to interact and encourage its beneficiaries and then the country coordinator continues with the interactions through to the end of the academic year. Through these intermittent interactions, they get to know students' needs and concerns affecting their studies and readily respond to them. The Organisation has reduced the financial pressures that may have engulfed the students by making prompt payments for their fees. I am really grateful for that. They ensure students work very hard to achieve their academic marks to retain their scholarships. They do this by encouraging beneficiary interactions to let them appreciate their individual academic problems and help themselves. These interactions have made the beneficiaries to relate as siblings and one family which I see is a very big achievement in the correctional direction. Furthermore, I perceive this as the initial stage of training beneficiaries in learning  to give back to one another as an aim of the Organisation.   This training on campus would help them extend it to their give back activities during their community service programmes. On behalf of the University and on my own behalf  I really appreciate and recommend EPI to her Donors for all the necessary support that will enable her do the work more efficiently and effectively, to put more smiles on the faces of more needy but brilliant students.     
Educational Pathways International	142067		/users/profile/188483	safosa2002	Client Served	4	11/22/2012	EPI charity in Ghana, specifically KNUST is one of the highly watched and patronised of late because of the big relieve it has brought to its beneficiaries. As the Assistant Registrar for Students' Financial Aids,I have lots  of accolades for EPI because through their financial activities, most students' dreams have been achieved. EPI has assisted students who would have dropped out, and those without the least expectations to go through University without serious financial needs. EPI has equally put smiles on the faces of most beneficiaries who would have had to defer their courses to look for resources to pay their fees in the course of their studies, have smooth progressions in their studies to have brighter future. EPI has helped students to afford regular feeding,thus most of their social, economic and psychological stress are reduced.Guardians who could not afford to provide everything for their wards are also grateful. EPI has groomed our students through their interactions, to mentor them to get exposed and to give back to their communities. So far 35 students have benefited with 2 graduating, and participating in the National Service.  Thanks to EPI for its benevolence, efficiency and effective Management.

The work that this organization is doing in Ghana is most commendable.  It is making remarkable contribution in preparing young men and women for future leadership of their country.  Leaders of this organization are dedicated to the mission of educating and thereby improving the lives of the under privileged children of Ghana.  I strongly favor any encouragement that can be given to this organization for its dedicated efforts.

Educational Pathways International	166070		/users/profile/188213	Hannah A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/25/2013	I was the Program Coordinator from July 2011 to July 2013.  I worked closely with both the beneficiary students as well as the owners of the organization.  The amazing thing is how the owners cared about the welfare and success of these students.  For a culture that expects children to act in obedience to adults with no questions asked, it was a different experience for these students to have someone genuinely care about them and listen to their concerns.  Aside the empathy, these students were assured that as long as they performed at the best of their ability, finances were put aside for their tuition, accommodation, books and some stipend to help during their summer internships.  Many of them shared their relief at the fact that they didn't have to do menial jobs during the summer to save enough for their tuition and hope that a friend will take them in and let them share their space.  With the EPI program, the sky is the limit for the beneficiaries - both in the high school program and in the university program. 
Educational Pathways International	141821		/users/profile/188213	Hannah A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/21/2012	As Coordinator for the EPI Program in Ghana, I've had a first-hand experience of what the scholarship package can and is doing in the lives of many young Ghanaians, especially the females.  This scholarship package takes care of students' tuition, accommodation, books and stipend (what we call 'pocket money' in Ghana).  The package gives hope to students who are highly intelligent but would otherwise have had to stay at home and get involved in petty trade.  At the moment, we have graduated 11 students who have benefited from a four-year full scholarship package.  These students, because of the financial burden EPI took from them, successfully completed their University education with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.5 on a 4.0 scale.  They have become an asset to their families, their communities and the nation.  They have become a beacon of hope to other students in other rural areas in the country who initially did not have any hope of achieving higher education.  Students now associate EPI with high achievers who are positioned to contribute to Ghana's economy.
Educational Pathways International	144691		/users/profile/191237	Jane Nichols	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	EPI is an amazing organization that identifies promising students in Ghana and supports them so they can finish a university education.  I have reviewed applications of students for this amazing scholarship for several years.  The need is so great for these very bright students who have no hope of completing a university education without this organization.  Built by two dedicated Americans who travel regularly to help choose recipients and support students, EPI is an incredible example of the difference that individuals can make in changing the world.  I believe that Ghana will be a better and stronger country because of the leadership being buil through this program.t

We are privileged to have yearly visits from our benefactors who come to see to our welfare in terms of our academic performances and physical wellbeing.  I sincerely appreciate the time they spent reviewing our career goals and recommending strategies for achieving them. Their advice was very helpful and gave me a new perspective on available opportunities. I especially appreciate their offer to connect me to other EPI beneficiaries.With the above, my family is very proud of me. My parents never had the opportunity so I am the first in my family. I am happy that I am setting the example for my own children and the entire community and hope that they will one day emulate my footsteps and earn their own degree.By awarding me the EPI scholarship, they have lightened my financial burden which allows me to focus more on the most important aspect of academic laurels and analyzing situations at hand. Their generosity has inspired me to see my aims fruitful thus to alleviate the poverty in the family, help the community as in terms of development projects facing the community and to boost the morale of the younger ones to focus on their education and to achieve their goals and dreams, just as they have helped me.
Educational Pathways International	142198	1	/users/profile/188644	welbeck	Client Served	5	11/23/2012	EPI lifted the financial burden that could have crippled my education. EPI has taught me to give back to my community and to those in need. Because EPI sponsors me, I do not worry about finance-I can concentrate fully on my education. Now I am in the States studying one year, because the peace of mind helped me study well in my first two years of college in Ghana. I could not have had the scholarship without EPI.

Educational Pathways International	141984		/users/profile/188401	Ohene Bonsu	Board Member	5	11/21/2012	Tertiary education in Ghana has become expensive relative to the income levels of the people and this is limiting access of the poorer segments of the society. Without doubt, the intervention of EPI to help the brilliant but poor students is a critical contribution towards ensuring that the marginalised can also scale up. What is of increasing significance is the additional provision of counselling service to guide and foster a positive aspiration of "can do" spirit and attitude in the students chosen. Just witness a student who curls up sleeping in the chair each night because of lack of space in the room, will not be sponsored any longer by parents who can't make ends meet so want their son to stop schooling and work, but scores one of the highest grades in the competitive exams for the university, and finally secures entry primarily because of EPI support!!!

Educational Pathways International	141759		/users/profile/188138	braimaha	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/20/2012	I have followed the work of Educational Pathways International in Ghana with great admiration. I was raised in a village in rural northern Ghana, the poorest region in the country, and experienced poverty and barriers to education and development growing up. Limited economic resources made it very difficult to obtain my university degree at the University of Ghana, where EPI is currently funding students. Due to the increasingly high cost of living, it is becoming even more difficult for the rural poor to attend well reputed universities in Ghana. Today I have a Ph.D. from a US University and in consequence am able to contribute to improving the welfare of humanity in the area of safe drinking water and sanitation provision.  I am a direct reflection of what EPI is accomplishing in Ghana. Through the scholarship program that EPI has established, many poor students from remote areas in Ghana are able to obtain university education in the cities and thus contribute to the economic and social development of Ghana.  The program is helping to bridge the gap between the poor and the rich; as well as between girls and boys.  I applaud the work of EPI and congratulate them for the great successes they have obtained so far.

The organization provides university scholarships to gifted and needy rural students and provides advice and support to these students while in university in Ghana.  This year, the organization graduated its first group of scholarship students and is creating a very special alumni group.  They have an excellent program person in Ghana and the founders regularly visit the country to meet with their scholarship recipients.  Additionally, the founders have an excellent group of advisors,  who help select students in the States.  This is definitely an organization and model to watch as it grows and develops.

I went to one of their "horse fairs" and got to meet some of the volunteers and learn about this great non-profit. The horse I had seen on line wasn't at the fair so I arranged to meet him. He had been seized by animal control for abuse and neglect. He was very, very afraid, most likely never rideable, and difficult for farriers. But he was being fostered and cared for by wonderful people . He and my TWH are now best buddies and with the help of my trainer; Concho has come along way.  I am a proud donor for L.E.A.N. and would recommend them to anyone looking for that "special" horse.

All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	291990	2	/users/profile/230278	Scianna A.	Donor	5	06/03/2016	LEAN is a charity without walls - all the work is done by a network of volunteers. The infrastructure is love: donations go to help give even more abandoned, suffering, neglected, mistreated, and abused equines a chance at healthy, happy lives. I've been a volunteer and donor for years now, and I know that my money is so very well spent here. I cannot say enough about these good people and their good works.
All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	174063	6	/users/profile/230278	Scianna A.	Donor	5	10/05/2013	In 2012 when we lived in Las Vegas, we had the opportunity to foster a L.E.A.N. rescue -- a 7-year-old former racehorse found abandoned and starving in the desert, with a nail in the center of his left hind foot. One of the veterinarians who worked on him told me, "I thought he'd never make it -- I was sure we'd have to put him down." But today, he is healthy, happy, playful, sound, and rideable, thanks to the caring team of volunteers that L.E.A.N. put together.  L.E.A.N. is not a one-person show (although founder Karin Larrick is an absolute marvel all by herself). It's a community of care, including vets, fosters, feed donors, trainers, farriers, transporters, and other volunteers, all connected by the Internet and their love for horses. 
All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	291987	2	/users/profile/333469	marklorri	Donor	5	06/03/2016	the differences these folks make in so many  horses lives is just unbelievable... they are horse angels!  I so enjoy the updates and the follow ups on the adopted horses as well... I would give them 10 stars if I could!

All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	284912	3	/users/profile/267868	Michelle226	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2016	I began to follow LEAN years ago when I noticed a story about Captain Jack Sparrow whom was found wandering the desert after being dumped by some heartless person.  I believe he had a foot injury as well.  2 policemen stayed with him and gave him water until he was picked up by animal control.  LEAN steps in after animal control has had them for a while. They have accepted some very sad abuse cases.  Wonderful people from around the valley donate their time and resources and even house the horses free of charge.  Donations are used for feed and medical treatment needed to rehab the horses.  They do great work. I love to see the progress these horses make and the happy endings these animals get to experience.  Anyone who has owned a horses knows they have huge hearts when love is given to them.  LEAN.  Thank you for all the work you do for those who need the help.  
All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	205645	7	/users/profile/267868	Michelle226	Volunteer	5	07/10/2014	I have been following the work of LEAN for the last couple years on Facebook.

That's exactly what L.E.A.N is, an entire community coming together to assist these horses and burros in need.  From the smallest donation to those that put in countless hours of work and dedication (the board members, all of the volunteers like the fosters,the training team, the tack team, the local show's that choose L.E.A.N as a beneficiary, the event team, the transport team, the education team, the grooming team, the media team, and the various equine health teams that chip in) this truly is what community is all about.  I am very proud to be surrounded by such incredible people that care so much about these animals.  Keep up the great work everyone!
All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	222113	14	/users/profile/231789	Rodeogal	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/12/2014	L.E.A.N, all I can say is wow!  This non - profit started out with just a handful of individuals that saw a need to do right by abandoned and neglected horses in our community.  Now, 2 and half years later, that handful has grown to become an entire community of volunteers!  From current and former board members , to the foster families, to trainers, to haulers, to event staff, to the all important donators (including monetary, services and supplies) alike... This organization is bringing the community together for the sake of these majestic animals that have no one else to speak for their plight!  I am happy to announce that since this organizations inception, not a single horse that has been taken in by animal control has made their way onto a trailer bound for auction!  Bravo everyone!  Keep up the great work!
All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	196915	6	/users/profile/231789	Rodeogal	Volunteer	5	04/02/2014	In just two short years I have watched this non-profit organization stand up and take control of the unwanted horse problem in our community.  Now, not only are they helping those horses but the are helping our community with programs like a low cost geld clinic they just hosted.  9 stallions were gelded through this program.  They also have an incredible networking program started that helps put people in contact with each other ie: those who need to rehome horses and those that are looking for horses.  Now, to top it all off, I hear that they are currently  working to create a hay bank that would serve local horse owners that have fallen on hard times to help keep their animals fed while they get back on their feet.  I can't say enough about the wonderful changes this organization has brought to our community.
All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	175441	8	/users/profile/231789	Rodeogal	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/08/2013	All Vegas Horses/L.E.A.N is an incredible organization.  The initial founders of the program saw a need in their community which was not being fulfilled and they did something about it!  This hardworking group of individuals created a program to take in the unwanted and neglected horses in their community that come through animal control.  These ladies take in, rehab and rehome these poor horses and they do it all around their own lives.  Each one of them has their own jobs, their own lives and their own families and yet they make the time to make sure that these animals get the care and love that they deserve.  L.E.A.N works solely as a non-profit and depends on their ever growing network of volunteers to make all this happen.  They get everyone involved!  From the fosters who are in charge of the everyday care of the horses to the farriers and vets that help fix some their problems, to the enormous amounts of volunteers that come forward to help out with everything and anything from something as simple as a trailer ride to the vet or as time consuming as helping out with a fundraiser event,  these gals have brought our equine community together in a way that no one else could.  Everything they do is photo documented and made public so that our community can follow along with their progress.  I for one am proud to say kudos ladies!
All Vegas Horses / L.E.A.N.	284882	3	/users/profile/374933	Kdonnahie	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	I've seen first hand the amazing amount of medical care that goes into these as horses, as we were lucky enough to have one at our barn. The horses receive everything they've been missing. Dental care, wound care, hoof care, skin care, food, attention, rehabilitation and training. They are matched with just the right rider and home only when the animal is whole again.  This is an amazing network of people and I am proud to support them with every event I host.

I enjoy following the pictorial history of each rescue and hope that more people will be influenced to get involved.

Not only have they saved many lives, and improved the quality of life for many others, they are providing a community service and working with Clark County to reduce the cost and complexity of dealing with these animals.   The genius of their plan is to spread the load out to as many people as possible.  Can volunteer a little time or a little money great, or if you're a major benefactor there is room for you too.  Also this method can be replicated anywhere as you don't need a building, land, storage, vehicles in the name of the charity, the people involved provide these things.   Highly motivated, highly ethical, and highly effective, too bad there isn't a 5-star+ rating.

This rescue takes care of those they can help in the best manner possible by giving each horse all they need - not taking in too many and spreading the care too thin.  They are being responsible with the public's funds and making sure their work is transparent.  You can see exactly how your donation or manpower is helping through the photo chronology provided for each horse.  It takes many hands to obtain these type of results so quickly and so successfully.  They obviously have a diligent, committed Board and passionate, hardworking volunteers.

Rather than just being a store house for neglected animals, the LEAN volunteers rehabilitate, retrain and  re home these horses into loving homes that are prepared for the special needs of these animals.  There is a high level of compassion matched by a high level of professionalism and practicality.  This is a charity where your money doesn't go into fancy offices or cars,  your donations pay for bales of hay and vet bills.  These people make  a positive difference in the lives of the horses, the lives of the people that adopt these horses and act as an inspiration for people like myself.

I do the tax compliance work for LEAN  too.  Because of my experience, there are many organizations I would never donate to because I can intimately see how the money is used.  This is not the case with LEAN.  I am a regular donor because I know my money is going to the horses and these people do this work for the right reasons.  I couldn't be happier donating to a local charity for the care of animals.

I have seen all the pictures of before and afters, of the horses  that L.E.A.N has helped.   I would like to say "Thank You", to all the people involved in this wonderful group.  Their efforts and dedication are tremendous, and their hearts are even greater.  Without L.E.A.N, there are many animals, that would not have had such a good ending.  God Bless you all for what you have accomplished, and for helping all the innocent animals.  And, a HUGE thank you, to our community, for helping out in so many ways, no matter how small or large of a part you played.  I certainly hope that L.E.A.N will continue to thrive, and that the community will continue to volunteer, and donate so that more animals can be saved, and given a new, much needed life.   Every animal counts.

Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	258480	8	/users/profile/346973	Lois20	General Member of the Public	1	09/19/2015	WPI has not followed through on its promised research and clinical medical resources. In checking the bona fides on the WPI website, the organization takes creative liberties with its staff's  purported credentials. For example, Mr. Hunter did not ever work for NASA; the man with the same name that did work there is deceased. The laboratory tests that have been offered at various times through WPI and its affiliates are not validated. Accounting procedures are wanting. WPI solicited patient donations for certain projects, but the patient donations were not applied to the projects, which soon fell by the wayside. WPI is publishing purported research that is obviously weakly derived from prior research, and of poorer quality. The facility, constructed with public and some additional funding, appears to be vacant on any given day. WPI had the opportunity to get real answers, but chose appearances over substance.

All costs were covered and we only made the long trip up there because we had been chosen and awarded this from WPI and we were very ill and it presented a ray of hope for recovery of some life quality to my son and me. We made the long exhausting trip with my parents paying for all the fuel lodging and food. They have not yet been reimbursed for their costs. We were not received well by the staff at the WPI clinic and thus went directly to Annette Whittemore office. She personally assured us we would be treated with the utmost courtesy from then on. that we would receive our promised Sponsorship and all that it entailed and had been promised to us. She said to have ALL bills sent to her directly.We returned home and were discouraged to find that they were not going to fulfill the treatment for us. We were made more ill by the stress of the long trip.Then began receiving bills for blood draws we never gave permission for. These totaled over 4600.00 EACH. We forwarded to Annette as we thought the WPI Clinic had just made an error. These bills stated 4600.00 in costs for blood drawn from my son and from me and were marked " OTHER" and no explanation was ever given as to why and what they drew this amount of blood from us for. What they did to us was unethical and we just want them to do what they promised in awarding us the full Sponsorships.I am holding them to their promised Sponsorship and ask that they be held accountable to uphold as well what they awarded us in full.I worked hard for my good credit rating and am hoping WPI and Annette Whittemore will do the right thing and restore this to me.Thank you for your help in resolving this for us. WPI and Annette Whittemore need to honor the full Sponsorhips they awarded to my son and me and restore my good credit rating to me.

I am thankful for the Whittemore and their research team led by Dr Lombardi because their hard work to build the institute from ground zero is paying off.  Recently Dr Lombardi published a paper in collaboration with other scientists from around the world. This cutting edge work provides new clues for patho-physiology and ethiology of our illmess. i am sure more work is under way and I am looking forward to the next publication.  i am convinced that the work of WPI will make a difference for all patients. Thank you and keep upthe good work!

Obviously, their real interest was in their own daughter's health, not in helping others who suffer from neuroimmune disorders.

My wife suffers from Fibromyalgia and has done so for over 30 years.Having seen the devastating effects of this disease close up I was excited when WPI came into existence.Through the passion of Annette Whittemore's efforts to help her daughter I have hope that in the not to distant future there will be treatments and perhaps even a cure for this debilitating disease.  I have never been around a more passionate group than the staff at WPI.

Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	151975	2	/users/profile/150370	David Spangler	Client Served	1	04/03/2013	This Whittemore Peterson Institute gave people suffering from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.), sometimes erroneously called "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" hope for effective treatment when they published their research paper on XMRV retrovirus being implicated in M.E.  However that hope was dashed when Mrs. Whittemore summarily fired the dedicated researcher who had made the research possible, Dr. Judy Mikovits.  This was worsened when the Whittemores filed criminal charges against Mikovits for theft of her own notebooks.  (That charge was later dismissed.)  The saga continued when Harvey Whittemore, Annette's husband, was criminally charged for making illegal political campaign contributions to Sen. Harry Reid, among others.  This federal criminal charge is still pending against Mr. Whittemore.  Does anyone need to know more to understand that this is not a reputable charity?

Now they say they are doing research and treatment for people with "neuroimmune disease," but I don't believe it.  They are the same money-grubbing people who sold the worthless tests.  So far they have done nothing to help the people they say they are serving.  And now they have their relatives posting good reviews on this website.  Unbelievable!

WPI's goal has always been to help severly ill people by solving the mysteries surrounding ME.  WPI has helped legitimize a seriously debilitating disease and I believe they will continue to make a difference.
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	119343	1	/users/profile/162256	BopPop	Donor	5	07/26/2012	I think that the WPI and its founders/employees are trying their very best in a very difficult field.

They failed to mention he was in no way benefiting from the institute. And, took our donations. Also; there were no beds anywhere to be found, while Mrs. Whittemore's office had spared no expense! For the Whittemore's to even be associated with the Seeno family speaks volumes... Crooks!
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	110622	13	/users/profile/150588	barbarak600	Donor	1	04/24/2012	The WPI have grossly mislead the ME community. They offered us hope in the form of research being done by Dr. Judy Mikovits.                                          The patient community donated funding in the hope of receiving some treatment, donations many could ill afford but did it in the hope of a better future.                                                                                                                                    We also spent precious energy voting for charitable donations for them.How we were taken in. We are left with no hope of treatment after the firing of Dr. Mikovits. The WPI are unwilling to return our donations which we now believe did not even reach the research lab.                                 To say they have damaged the ME community is putting it mildly and in my own opinion the raise in ME suicides during this time I would cite WPI as one of the causes. Shame on them using their sick daughter to sucker money into an already very wealthy family.

I was a devoted donar and campaigner for all that I thought the WPI was until they showed their true colours sacking, dragging through the courts and jailing their only real hope of finding what ME really is. I will never support WPI again...it has done so much damage without even realising what they were doing. They are oblivious to this day, continuing to send out thank you cards to people who have openly voiced their dissatisfaction with the WPI. They are not to be trusted!
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	110522	15	/users/profile/150462	kravitz	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/23/2012	This "charity" is run by a socialite whose husband was one of the most powerful political lobbyists in Nevada. Now Harvey Whittemore's house of cards is falling, and it is taking his wife and her Institute along with it.  Before anyone gives a dime to this charity, he should google "Harvey Whittemore" and "Annette Whittemore" and read the results.  Even if they wanted to do meaningful medical research, they would not be able to accomplish that since they fired their only competent research scientist in Sept. 2011.
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	110499	17	/users/profile/150428	Julie50	Donor	1	04/22/2012	The WPI entered the world scientific stage in October 2009 with the discovery of a retrovirus, then known as XMRV in patients with ME/CFS.  The discovery gave hope to millions suffering from neuro-immune diseases.   The controversies that followed attest to the fact that truth is stranger than fiction. No one could have dreamed up what has happened.  After encouraging family and friends to donate to WPI as I had, I now refuse to donate.  The WPI has broken its trust with patients and I cannot see that trust ever being restored. We should have taken not when Dr. Dan Peterson left WPI shortly after the publication. He knew things the rest of us did not.

When they did this, they demolished all hope of any real research coming out of this little Institute.  Now it appears their main interest is in making money for the Founder,  whose husband is now under investigation by the FBI and who is being sued by his former partners for embezzling millions of dollars.  These people havedestroyed any semblance of respectability for themselves or their institute.  I certainly want nothing to do with these people ever again, and I will tell everyone I know to stay away from them.
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	100022	13	/users/profile/68513	Wildaisy	Client Served	1	10/31/2011	The situation at the Whittemore Peterson Institute has changed.  They have unfairly fired the researcher who was making huge strides toward development of effective treatment for M.E. and it appears they have lost their way entirely.  Now they are indicating that they will try to keep the NIH research grants which had been awarded to them because of this star researcher, Dr. Judy Mikovits, and they have no one qualified to continue the research.  If they keep the grants, they will effectively end this promising research. It certainly appears that WPI is now more interested in setting up their clinic and their commercial lab to make money than they are in continuing the research which had the promise of effective treatment for people such as me.   This is a huge disappointment.  I no longer feel that WPI is worthy of support.

Other remaining staff members are not qualified to carry out the research.  Since the firing of Dr. Mikovits the Whittemore Peterson Institute has neglected to answer numerous questions to the satisfaction of patients, donors, supporters, and the general public. The closing of the Whittemore Peterson Institute's facebook page has served to further severely restrict patient inquiry and two way communication.   This lack of transparency is disrespectful and unacceptable.  I have changed from an ardent supporter to no longer supporting the wpi.

People with neuro-immune diseases such as myalgic encephalomyelitis ("CFS"), fibromyalgia, atypical MS and autism have long been ignored or poorly served by medical and research institutions. I have an MS from Cornell University and an MA from the University of East Anglia in the UK. Contracting ME while working in East Africa in 2007, my career was brought to a sudden halt. I now have hope for recovery thanks to the work of the WPI. Like many other patients, I support them with a small monthly donation. However much larger contributions are needed if research is to continue, and for the clinic to serve the approximately one million + patients in the US with neuro-immune disease.
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	86285		/users/profile/96537	Ross	Client Served	5	04/19/2011	ME/CFS is a life sentence to a living death.  It can be extremely debilitating and torturous and can go on for decades before one has an early demise due to the resulting organ failure.  It has robbed so many good people of their lives.  It affects children, adults and people of all races, ages, and gender.  It is estimated to affect at least 1 million people in the US, which makes it more prevalent (and often more debilitating) than HIV/AIDS.  The economic loss of productivity is estimated to be over 10 billion dollars annually.  People with ME/CFS are scoffed, ridiculed, and at the very least, not believed.  This prevailing attitude permeates society, the medical profession, and our government health agencies.   Finally after 25+ years of this abuse, lack of research, and being left for dead, we have the beginning of the first ever translational research/treatment facility.  The WPI is a beacon of hope.  Not just because they have chosen to take on a very unpopular and politicized health crisis, but also because they are motivated by compassion and all the right reasons.  They are truly a light in the darkness.

Client Served	5	04/19/2011	Previously in excellent health, I was diagnosed in UK with myalgic encephalomyeltis (aka chronic fatigue syndrome) in 1992, was told there was no treatment for it and that it would work its way out of my system in about a year. 19 years later I still have ME and there is still no treatment for it.  I had to give up work due to the level of disabilty it caused, as it affects almost every organ and system in the body. It is a most insidious disease with devasting effects on health, life-style and livelihood.  ME is indiscriminate - anyone can get it, including children as young as 2 years of age. It is heartbreaking that children and young people lose their lives to this disease yet no public funding is provided for biomedical research to find root cause and treatment.  I totally trust the dedication and integrity of Whittemore Peterson Institute - their only vested interest is in finding cure(s) for neuro-immune disease.  It was set up because the founders' daughter has ME so what better motivation could an organisation have to persevere and succeed?  WPI has my full support and gratitude for giving millions world-wide hope for a cure at long last, through its ground-breaking research and now moving on to translational research with the prospect of treatment if it can get the necessary funding.

They want to find the answers for all of us affected.  They need the funds to do the science so they may continue their efforst bring new treatments for both of these conditions and possibly all kinds of cancers  They are extremely dedicated to finding the answers that will give our children a future.Marcia Hinds
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	79255		/users/profile/86571	Zach	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	WPI's claim to fame is the discovery of XMRV in ME/CFS and a growing list of neuro-immune diseases such as Fibromyalgia, chronic Lyme, Gulf War Syndrome, autism, Parkinson's, etc.  The list is growing. Interesting is that they also found it in the general population at a 4% rate.  That's about 12 million people in the USA.  This is a sleeping epidemic of Gargantuan implications. WPI is the right organization to investigate further into the effects of this retrovirus (XMRV) in neuro-immune diseases.
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	79204	1	/users/profile/86515	Tami Rainmom	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	WPI is a small, but mighty group of dedicated scientists and doctors who are one of the few institutions actually looking at the biological basis and science behind many neuroimmune illnesses including CFS/ME, autism,  parkinson's, MS, and more. Looking at how the rates of "autism" have soarded- now estimated to be affecting one in every 91 children in the US, it's clear there's an infectious basis. While other organizationss waste time and  money looking to exercise the demons from the CFS patients, WPI found a retrovirus that's causing persisten infection. This is a ground breaking discovery  that urgently needs and deserves funding. It's esitmated 17 million individuals are living, and dying of CFS/ME- and that's not including other neuro-immune disorders like autism and MS. There is no worthier cause.

Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	78446		/users/profile/85728	lulu	Client Served	5	02/27/2011	A little over a year ago, I became very ill. Migraine like headaches every day, feeling like I had the flu with body aches, low grade fever and my memory started to deteriorate. I was 43 and finishing up my dissertation for a PhD in history. It took several months before a doctor mentioned "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" and that day, when I got home, I cried. What an embarrassing diagnosis! Isn't CFS a name for lazy hypochondriacs? How can that possibly explain the seriously debilitating condition I find myself in? My doctors did not think much of the diagnosis either: "It is a wastepaper diagnosis" one said. I spent a lot of time on the internet, trying to understand what was happening to my body and to find a "real" diagnosis. Eventually I stumbled onto information about the WPI. The WPI was created by a parent of a child with ME/CFS and a doctor who has worked with ME/CFS since 1984 when the major outbreak in Incline Village occurred. They had funded a scientist, Judy Mikovits, who had discovered a new retrovirus in most of the CFS patients she tested.  This retrovirus explains how patients with ME/CFS can have so many symptoms- gamma retroviruses can penetrate genes that control homeostasis.  Less than a year after the WPI published it's major study in the journal Science, scientists at the NIH and FDA confirmed that XMRV is definately associated to a high degree in ME/CFS.  The WPI has continued its research for ME/CFS patients as well as those with autism, chronic Lyme, and other neuroimmune diseases. For such a small operation, they have made a huge impact in the world of these diseases.  They are now getting ready to open a clinic that can treat people with ME/CFS. They are transparent about where they get their funding and what they plan to do with it. They are the model non-profit- putting their constituents first and doing cutting edge research in the face of a lot of institutional naysaying on the part of other organizations that have given little serious attention to this disease.

We are not lying on our couches and beds because we want to; most of us had active, fulfilling lives before we because sick with ME. I had just found a job I really loved and one I was ready to work for until retirement, as a claims adjudicator and benefits counselor at the VA, when I first developed chronic pain and a bit later, a terrible weakness and sickness. I hung on for two years, then cried my eyes out when I had to retire. For 12 year I felt hopeless and uncared for. WPI came along with their XMRV study and gave me the first hope, and I've held onto that hope, even though all the forces seem aligned against us. We will prevail but we need grants for more research. Please, consider donating whatever you can to WPI. Thank you to all. xoxoxoxo

For too long this illness has been unresearched and underfunded by governments. The WPI has given millions of people  hope and stirred up the medical community to finally take this disease seriously.  They need all the money they can garner right now - just as they are on the brink of discoveries that hopefully will not only help us  - the patients with ME - but also other patient groups with neuro -immune illnesses.

That's what the research and the ethos of the WPI have given to the area of ME/CFS/CFIDS.  They have given an idea of how ME might be viewed in future and given the area of research into the etiology and pathology of ME a new goal, one that is focused on the reality of the disease.  There is now hope.  Hope for a diagnostic test, hope for treatment and above all hope for ME patients, that the world will see ME in a new light.

Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	63880		/users/profile/69829	Nancy	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	The Whittemore Institute (WPI) made a remarkable medical research breakthrough within two years of its existence.  It should be remembered that Whittemore Peterson Institute have input from scientists with decades of experience in retrovirology with the National Cancer Institute.   WPI fully deserves Federal funding for its breakthrough high quality work on the human retrovirus XMRV.  I must say that our british research is put to shame by the advanced work from the Whittemore Peterson Institute, which is a model of the new human-friendly approach to high quality bioresearch that should be followed elsewhere.

It represents the best of innovation and sound science which, along with the dedication of the Whittemore family, has provided the first real hope for appropriate diagnosis, recognition and treatment. And with the scientific momentum that has been achieved in a relatively short time, even a cure may well be in sight.  Their breakthrough discovery of gamma retrovirus in many patients with neuroimmune disease has profound implications for public health and the safety of the blood supply as well. It is imperative to provide the utmost support for this institute and their research to ensure that their work continues as rapidly as possible. 
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	63276		/users/profile/69157	wingfingers	Volunteer	4	02/04/2011	Although everyone who catches this disease (ME) knows it is a caused by a virus, and in fact we have known it is a retrovirus since Dr Paul Cheney showed his MRI scans of patients to an MRI expert 25 years ago, this has been suppressed by both the US and UK governments for reasons we can only speculate on. It's thought that it suited them to keep the disease in the dark and call it "psychological" as this would be cheaper to deal with for the insurance companies (although the British NHS is not insurance-based so it has cost us a lot more). Along comes the Whittemore family and they recruit Dr Mikovits who immediately sees the disease as a retrovirus. She found it, classified it, cultured it, and even sequenced its genome. All scientists and doctors worldwide should be jumping up & down with glee at the discovery. But the Black Force is at work to delay & suppress it. It happened once before - 20 years ago, Elaine DeFreitas at the famous Wistar Institute found the retrovirus and they succeeded in suppressing that. The Whittemore Peterson Institute deserve full credit in the face of adverse conditions such as total lack of State funding and also much resistance from denialists and psychiatrists.
Nevada Center for Biomedical Research	63239		/users/profile/69138	joy1	Advisor	5	02/04/2011	My persona before ME was that of a scientist, looking at the effects of violent films on children under 10 years of age. It was new then and no one took it seriously. So I rate the research for the WPI as brave, uncompromising, and above all compassionate to the ME world. I can give them no higher accolade, because there are no words for the bravery, knowing how their research could be vilified by those who do not want the truth about ME made public. In my family we have three ME, one suspected case, and Parkinson's disease. Having ME in the UK means no support, and many are economically affected, and are socially islolated.I work on a ME help line and run a group for ME people, and it would appear that the numbers of ME people in my area are raisng exponentially.

But the research of Drs. Mikovits and Lombardi at WPI into the link between human gammaretroviruses and neuroimmune illness has given me hope for validation and treatments.  I had a slow crash with what is belittlingly known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  This dramatically restricts what one can do and imposes heavy flu-like symptoms.  In addition to benefits for patients, it is also vital that society become aware of how these retroviruses are transmitted and how best to test for them so as to protect the blood supply.  The Whittemore Peterson Institute is at the forefront of such research.

Those with ME have been their own researchers, physicians and donors for research for decades. I have very little state benefit but send what money I can to WPI whilst doing all I can to campaign for a change in policy. To say that the WPI is like a beacon in the dark is an understatement - and there are more than 17 million ME sufferers that are hidden from most people's view. Please help the WPI to help us, the sufferers, for there is virtually no other organisation/ charity that can do such an effective job.

Such severity and chronicity of illness is not unusual for this condition yet despite the enormous burden for sufferers, families and society, little research is done and we are left without any effective treatment. In a short period of time, the WPI has discovered the possibility that a new retrovirus (XMRV) might be causing our illness. This has transformed the situation; suddenly, top-level researchers such as those virologists who discovered Hepatitis C have entered the research field and for the first time in my lifetime, I feel that there is a chance of some help for us all. I live in the UK and like other countries around the world we are looking to the WPI to help.

Las Vegas Metro PD and animal control have open cases from just last year after investigating one of their locations and finding animals in dire circumstances.

The dogs they offer at adoptions, which they continue to do at Petco,  are mostly brought in from California and they are dishonest about the history of the pet and have ridiculously inflated adoption fees.  Adopting from them means a local dog doesn't have a home and you are helping them continue to take in thousands of dollars a month while they continue to let the other 300 dogs die unloved uncared for and in despicable conditions.   This is the worst of what a rescue can be.   http://www.ktnv.com/news/contact-13/insider-exposes-poor-conditions-at-dog-rescue-group

Adopt-A-Rescue-Pet	190703		/users/profile/248974	Mary239	Donor	5	12/14/2013	About two years ago, I saw a dog on facebook that was about to be killed.  His eyes just spoke to me...I put out a call to rescues to help me get him out alive, and Adopt a Rescue Pet not only contacted me immediately, but helped me to do the things I needed to do to help him stay alive. And then, one of their wonderful volunteers arranged for him to be rescued by Adopt a Rescue Pet.  The little boy, who I named "Mr. Muggs"(AKA Henry) was transported from Orange County CA to Las Vegas where he found his forever home.  This rescue is wonderful to work with, and cares deeply about each and every animal they rescue.  I just love it that they take dogs of all kinds, all sizes, and mostly...they step up and take ones who are in immediate danger of being euthanized.

Adopt-A-Rescue-Pet	281850	1	/users/profile/371935	Stacey52	Client Served	4	03/07/2016	We adopted a puppy through ARP two weeks ago. The adoption fee included up-to-date shots, neuter, a bag of dog food, some puppy toys, and discounts on a TON of stuff at PetSmart. Our new puppy, Whiskey, is adorable! He arrived healthy, clean, and full of energy! Adopt-a-Rescue Pet has an in-depth application process, asked a lot of questions about our lifestyle and home, and worked to make sure Whiskey would be a good fit for our family. We weren't able to take Whiskey home right away (we picked him up from the vet 3 days later after he was neutered). As you can imagine, there were tons of admirers on 'adoption day' at PetSmart but once we claimed him, ARP didn't allow anyone else to play with the puppies or get near the cage. I appreciated this more than anything; they protected our puppy and helped ensure his health and safety. I'm very impressed with this organization and will recommend ARP to others!

Adopt-A-Rescue-Pet	270179	2	/users/profile/358894	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	I have been a volunteer with Adopt A Rescue Pet for 13 years now, if my family and I didn't believe in them we would have left along time ago. Adopt A Rescue pet goes far beyond a lot of other rescues, they help animals in need all the time, they help out seniors so they don't have to give up their dog and when it's time they help re-home the dog in that time of need. They go out of their way to make sure if someone doesn't have food for their dog they help them out so they don't go without for themselves. They are always working on something and the volunteers are great, starting at age 16 all the way up to 90. It has been a blessing for so many people that have had to re-home there dogs due to loosing their homes and having to down size, helping with that meant that they didn't end up in the local kill shelter ready to be put down. One day they will have the Rescue Ranch that we have been dreaming of, they have the land just need to funds to build, but that will happen someday, but for now we will continue setting up and tearing down each Saturday and Sunday at 2 local PetSmarts  until there are none......

They gave me the email address and phone number of Adopt a Rescue Pet.  I email immediately and told them what I thought I could do.  Age and health limit me to handling large dogs to much but I can foster and I love to take pictures of dogs.  So  I was told "jump in" and take pictures.  I put them on Petfinder and send to Naomi to put on ADRP website.  I absolutely love the people that volunteer there and try and spend as much time as I can there.

Beyond just volunteering, a lot of us, including my sister and I, foster dogs during the week to bring them back on the weekend adoption days, fresh, loved and happier in order to help them get adopted. We're honest to those interested and do our best to re-home dogs to the /right/ home, not just to anyone. Adoption processes are simple, but get all the details ironed out to help set a platform for a successful adoption. I would hope to work at a place someday with such cohesiveness and respect among the volunteers.

So if uYou do find yourself adopting, be patient with your new loved one and give them time to adjust to their new home. Again the time and care these volunteers put in is a lot and sometimes goes unnoticed by people. ARP rocks. Great job!!

They cater to all dogs, not just the ones likely to be adopted. Time has shown that if the dog is not a good fit for the home, it likely wont be a forever home. Adopt a Rescue pet makes every effort to fully understand the situation the dog is going into before adoption papers are ever brought out. Because of this, it ensures the right home, not just a right now home.

Every dollar goes to where it should.  A fantastic organization.

I knew instantly that she was his new sister!  I was so impressed with Heidi Pieper and the love she gave to these dogs blessed enough to be fostered by her and her husband Jay!  I also met ARP's founder Elizabeth Davis and helped to raise money for them because I know that this organization is run well.  Often times, we donate to a charity never really knowing if the monies are being used properly.  I proudly attest to knowing that ARP is a model charity for helping abused and abandonded dogs.

But it helps knowing that there is an organization at work like Adopt A Rescue Pet with the caring, dedicated, animal-loving people that it has.   Along with tax deductible monetary contributions, Ive also donated a complete living room suite of gently used furniture and accessories for volunteers and care takers to use and was successful in encouraging my hotel employer to donate hundreds of used blankets, comforters, bedspreads and other guest room linens for the comfort and care of the animals while they wait for their permanent home. Roy EngelbretsonSenior FinanceGolden Nugget Hotel and Casino702-386-8278

They have been dumped because they didn't fit into the previous human's lifestyle. This group is one of many that take in those poor dogs that have been discarded and forgotten. This tireless group of volunteers do everything in their power to ensure this dog's next home will be the best match for both the humans and the dog involved. They are the voice for the animal that can not communitate what type of home envirnoment would make them most happy. I'm proud to volunteer for an organization that truly puts the animals' best interest at heart everyday! 
Adopt-A-Rescue-Pet	106106		/users/profile/142763	kodismom	Volunteer	5	02/06/2012	I became involved in volunteering with Adopt A Rescue Pet (ARP) several months ago.  They are an organization that is truly devoted to their cause.  Everyone goes above and beyond in their dedication, hard work and their commitment.  They are all a wonderful group of people that care deeply about what they do.  I feel very fortunate to have become a part of ARP and I am so appreciative of everyday I am involved.  They have had a great impact on my life because of the amazing people they are and because of the extraordinary efforts everyone puts forth to achieve their ultimate goal.. of finding a forever home for the countless number of homeless dogs that need their help.
Adopt-A-Rescue-Pet	105687		/users/profile/142041	amandaolen	Donor	5	02/02/2012	This is the best organization I have donated to. The thing that I love the most about them is when I donate money they do not spend all my donation on sending me things in the mail (tshirts, car decals, magnates, blankets, ect...) All the money my family and I donate go strait to help the dogs. 
Adopt-A-Rescue-Pet	105211	1	/users/profile/141255	biondabella	Client Served	5	02/01/2012	I have never met a more dedicated team of volunteers in a local charity.  No animal is ever turned away.  This organization truly supports the homeless dogs of Nevada.  They are concerned where their rescued dogs go and really do a back ground ground check on the future parent.  They would rather keep taking care of animal verse putting said animal in a wrong home.  I have seen them take a dog back years after it was adopted out.  They also will provide an injured animal every possible medical need it would require before putting the animal down.   For the reasons listed, I have no problem donating to this wonder animal rescue organization.

Can You Identify Me	275323	1	/users/profile/364919	Louise26	General Member of the Public	5	01/01/2016	This non profit is amazing. There are so many people who don't have an identity, no name, just a morgue number. Their families are looking for them and they don't know that they've been murdered, died by accident or even natural causes. It adds to the heartache that they can't provide a proper burial so they can rest in peace. This non profit gives families hope. They work very hard in making sure several cases are made available to the public, each day, so they can get as many details and sometimes a computer generated picture or a sketch out for people to see. I've seen a lot of non profit sites and none of them are run as well as this one. These folks are hard working and are a great resource for information and I consider all families lucky to have them.
Can You Identify Me	261864	2	/users/profile/350510	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/06/2015	I have volunteered at this non-profit for a few months now, and I enjoy it!! It is a great opportunity to have the chance of figuring out who these unidentified victims are, and possibly reconnect them with their loved ones who are searching for them. The hours are flexible and the interactions with the other volunteers are always great, we all get along. I have gotten to speak to coroners and medical examiners from around the country, and worked with them to help match some cases. Overall my experience here has helped me get a better understanding of what happens with these victims, and Im glad I can help them.
Can You Identify Me	261238	5	/users/profile/349836	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	As a volunteer you already have the mind set to contribute your time and talents. Generally, most volunteers will volunteer to causes they have been affected by.  Can You Identify Me is a nonprofit organization I personally have never heard of and thankfully never had to experience such a horrific topic.   After meeting with Rebel Morris, Executive Director and founder of CYIM I found myself even more intrigued and impressed with the training and one on one time Rebel took explaining in detail what the organization is about. She also gave me the opportunity to ask as many questions about volunteer time, the team, the website, the findings, and helped me to figure out where I would best fit in.  The website is one of the best user friendly websites I have ever encountered.  The communication through Rebels (Can You Identify Me) FaceBook wall is informative, intelligent, and respectful to the subject at hand. Thank you Rebel Morris, Board Members, Forensic Artist, and volunteers for their hard work and dedication for such a heartbreaking, but great cause. Without the computer networking, data and forensic art reconstruction families may never be able to locate loved ones. 
Can You Identify Me	260500	1	/users/profile/349077	Sonya9	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	I wanted to contribute some time to the community when I came accross "Can You Identify Me"  this past March. Since then I have gained some valuable skills and made some wonderful friends which is something I was not expecting. I have seen first hand at the difference this nonprofit has made within the community with limited resources.
Can You Identify Me	260444	1	/users/profile/349028	Terri66	Volunteer	5	09/30/2015	I moved from S. Florida three years ago, after my husband passed away. I was lost without him and only left my home to go grocery shopping. I decided that I needed to get out of the house and do something to help others. I found CYIM and became part of the family immediately. This has changed my life as I get out to volunteer and have made some good friends here. Everyone is so friendly and helpful and you will also be part of our family as soon as you start volunteering. The feeling that you are helping others makes volunteering so rewarding and I look forward to the days I'm scheduled to work.

I wanted to be part of an organization that made a difference in others lives. What a Blessing CYIM is in knowing that they are working with the local community (and Nationally!) in bringing awareness about the unidentified! 
Can You Identify Me	259962	3	/users/profile/348497	Jonathan48	Board Member	5	09/27/2015	I have been working with CYIM for about a year now, and this is an organization that fills a void overlooked by many other groups, whether government or nonprofit.  The chair has been very dynamic in establishing a volunteer center, building partnerships with other groups and experts, and bringing greater attention to the nation's missing and unidentified.

I have not been volunteering ling at all and I already feel like I am family! Everyone is so kind and welcoming, and I love that they are so accepting and loving to EVERYONE. The things they do for these families who have lost their loved ones is so wonderful and heart warming. I am truly blessed to have come across "Can You Identify Me?"  and become a volunteer. I am looking forward to all the great things that we ALL will do together and individually because of the amazing people who put together "CYIM?". I have hope that this organization will grow into something even more amazing and well known. They truly deserve it. 
Can You Identify Me	245521	5	/users/profile/332695	Morgan93	Volunteer	5	06/17/2015	I have always loved volunteering and was passionately searching for an organization that I felt I could make a difference being a part of. I found that organization when I came across Can You Identify Me. I immediately found an interest in their cause and became a volunteer in March of 2015. I have worked directly on case updates and recently worked my first potential match. Knowing there is a possibility that an unidentified victim's family may finally find closure is amazing. No words can express how grateful I am to this organization, its volunteers, and its executive director/founder Rebel J. Morris. I have not only helped others, but have also helped myself by being a part of it. Through this organization and the experiences I have had with it, I now know what I want to do with my life. No matter what you want to do in life, this organization can provide you with direction, experience, friendship, and an opportunity to make a difference in the lives of those who are searching for a loved one and of those whose lives were lost and remain unidentified. 
Can You Identify Me	245208	5	/users/profile/332328	ShaunB	Volunteer	5	06/13/2015	I have been volunteering for this organization for a couple months now. These volunteers who donate their time for this organization are caring and compassionate. They are all willing to help the families that are in need of our services. This experience has made me grow as a person and I am better because of this experience. 
Can You Identify Me	244767	5	/users/profile/331777	Tanya26	Volunteer	5	06/07/2015	The "Do you know me" quote on the logo touched my heart and I decided to meet with Rebel to see if I could make a difference. Her passion and the team I met with was  inspiring. I did not realize hwo many nameless faces are out there, so this non-profit is really helping the community to bring closure to many families. Looking forward to continuing to volunteer with a great group of people.
Can You Identify Me	243791	5	/users/profile/330623	Daniel95	Volunteer	5	05/28/2015	Can You Identify Me is a non profit organization dedicated to spreading awareness about unidentified Jane and John Does.

Can You Identify Me	226364	4	/users/profile/290094	gloreb	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2014	I found Can You Identify Me when I was looking for guests to be on my Internet TV Show. I am of the mind that cold cases need to be solved as families need closure and the remains need to have their final resting place. I am impressed with the tenacity of this group of individuals - both paid and volunteer - who make it their mission to do the deceased justice.
Can You Identify Me	223211	5	/users/profile/286953	SheriK	Volunteer	5	10/15/2014	I found Can You Identify Me when I was seeking volunteer work. Working with CYIM has been an eye-opening experience. Rebel has an amazing passion and dedication to CYIM and all who are involved with it. And, the other volunteers and board members all go that extra mile to help those who currently do not have a voice. CYIM stands out as a nonprofit that searches to help find names for those who died without identification. I love being a part of a noble cause that can help bring closure to family members still wondering about missing loved ones.
Can You Identify Me	222089	3	/users/profile/285777	Kelly_F	Donor	5	10/12/2014	Can You Identify Me (CYIM) specializes in providing information that can help lead to identifying deceased individuals as well as giving assistance and closure to families of missing loved ones. Can You Identify Me performs their activities with a mixture of intelligence and compassion that is unparalleled, and it is fortunate that people who feel the call to do this work exist. It is an organization which fills a need and it's unfortunate that this need exists. I truly hope that I never find myself in a situation where I require the services provided by this nonprofit but if I do, I know that there is not another organization that would listen and provide the measure of solace and compassion for my ordeal as would the kind staffers at CYIM.
Can You Identify Me	221791	4	/users/profile/285484	jae67	Volunteer	5	10/10/2014	I am currently serving with Can You Identify me and this has become one of the most rewarding roles I have ever had, It is one of the most worthy organisations I have had the pleasure to be a part of. Rebel is one of the most determined human beings I have ever met which is why CYIM is the success it is. The goal of this organisation is to reunite unidentified people with their family and friends. There are lot of families and friends that never give up hope in finding a missing loved one, the hope of finding them alive is the ultimate result, sadly this is not always the case. The people that feature on CYIM are the ones that have no name, they are lost. I think the most rewarding part of CYIM is when unidentified people become identified, to know that someone was searching for them, they were loved and missed and at least now they know what happened to their loved ones. I hope to be a part of this organisation for many years to come.
Can You Identify Me	220637	3	/users/profile/284308	Jeannie Johnston	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2014	Can You Identify Me speaks for those who no longer can speak for themselves and is a voice for lost victims. Their team has (from their website) "a combined 78 years of media, art, forensics and legal backgrounds, united with a mothers personal journey to discover her missing child unidentified in another state 2,243 miles from home." This experience combined with a passion for helping those who have been silenced (and an exceptional Founder) make CYIM a wonderful organization. We should be able to give more stars.

As a volunteer you know you are appreciated and I appreciate the time & talents all the wonderful volunteers bring to Team CYIM.  Can You Identify Me goes above and beyond to help bring greater awareness and resolution to America's Unidentified. They provide an invaluable service to the families searching for their loved ones and an interactive website that allows one to search cases in various ways. The website also offers resources and tools that are unique to Can You Identify Me and not found anywhere else.  Rebel is one of the most compassionate and exemplary leaders I have ever worked with.

Can You Identify Me	220249	2	/users/profile/283898	Kate84	Board Member	5	10/06/2014	I have been involved with several nonprofits, but CYIM is a real standout!  It is well organized and it's purpose of identifying unidentified victims is successful.  The website is extensive, but easy to use. Many professionals across the country are actively contributing their knowledge and skills to making this nonprofit a success.  Can You Identify Me is definitely a top nonprofit.

Can You Identify Me	212609	2	/users/profile/236114	JPHuffman	General Member of the Public	5	08/28/2014	Can You Identify me provides such a unique and valuable service.  It is amazing to think of the number of people who are killed or die, with little or no way to identify the remains.  To think of a family, somewhere, having lost touch with a loved one and that loved one has been killed or died, with no way of being identified; with no way of giving the family closure for their loss, is a harsh and cruel thought.  The services Rebel Morris, who heads Can you Identify Me, provides in aiding to identify these otherwise lost, nameless, remains, not only gives them a name, but humanizes them, and brings much needed closure to families and loved ones.  The work CYIM performs is not only overwhelming in the tasks it performs, but in the emotional toll it takes on CYIM staff and volunteers.  Can You Identify Me truly warrants the title "Great Nonprofit."
Can You Identify Me	179471	2	/users/profile/236114	JPHuffman	Donor	5	10/18/2013	Can You Identify Me provides an invaluable service; assisting in locating family and loved ones of what might otherwise forever remain an unclaimed human; putting a name, a story, giving humanity and dignity to the unidentifed, not only honors those deceased, but helps to put to rest the unending questions families, friends and loved ones of missing persons live with every day.  I am so honored to be able to do the very little that I do to assist Rebel Morris in this very important work.      
Can You Identify Me	212272	2	/users/profile/234591	Grace29	General Member of the Public	5	08/25/2014	Rebel and her staff are the reason CYIM is so successful.  So professional, down-to-earth, friendly, caring, committed, and I could just go on and on.  I swear Rebel has some kind of radar or sixth sense.  I'll be having a bad day and there it is.  A wonderfully, kind and encouraging note from Rebel.  Just out of the blue.  I don't know how she does it. I go to CYIM's Facebook page everyday.  They do such a phenomenal job presenting the unidentified to the public.  I'm sure this work weighs heavy on the heart but they do it.  Somebody has to do it, right?  NOBODY           could do a better job than CYIM!
Can You Identify Me	177988	2	/users/profile/234591	Grace29	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2013	I have been a faithful follower on Facebook for a few years now.  I try to share every post I come across.  I can honestly say that you will not find an organization that does more for 'America's Unidentified.'  The narratives draw the reader in by giving you a glimpse of what their lives might have been like.  Thank you Team CYIM for providing this much needed service!  Because of you, not only do identified loved ones get their names back but they get to go home.   Grace Flynn
Can You Identify Me	211694	2	/users/profile/274620	Beth114	Volunteer	5	08/21/2014	I was CYIM's very first volunteer, and continue to do my part for this wonderful, worthy organization to this day! Rebel is a joy to work with, always very generous in sharing her time, talents and knowledge. She makes certain that every volunteer knows how much their contribution is valued. For each one of these cases, there is somebody somewhere who misses them, someone aching for answers to what has happened to their loved one. Everyone deserves the dignity of being buried with their own name. CYIM strives to find answers for these worried loved ones and to help return to these victims the dignity of their own name.

Rebel is a special person who knows how to listen which is so important when working with families of the missing.   This organization has instituted important changes in the field of missing persons by giving a story to the unidentified which gives the best possible opportunityto finding a real name.  Rebel puts her heart and soul into each and every case that she works on.  You can not find more heart and dedication to the missing than you find at CYIM! 
Can You Identify Me	188328	2	/users/profile/245691	FindNony	Client Served	5	11/11/2013	Can You Identify me?  Is so much more then the name!  I have a brother that has been missing for 3 years.  CYIM, is another way for me to search for my brother.  Through my searches for my brother, some of the founders of CYIM volunteered at the search.  One found me on facebook and began to offer assistance to me.  She helped me to search online through certain databases and also introduced me to local organizations that could guide me along the way.  This wonderful woman did this out of the kindness of her heart!  Never asked me for a dime!  CYIM is difficult for some people to see and at time some of the pictures are hard to stomach.  However, when you have a missing loved one.  Desperation sets in and you just need to find them.  Have closure!  So the pictures, items and descriptions are necessary in order to place these lost souls back with their loved ones.  I absolutely encourage anyone that needs to find an unidentified loved one to search with Can You Identify Me.  Rita WIlliams, Las Vegas, NV

Can You Identify Me	180248	2	/users/profile/236905	Eve Carson	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2013	When someone is missing from your life, grief is suspended. What Rebel does, with an enormous amount of love and compassion, is give a name to the lives that have been devalued and discarded. For the loved ones, she helps them find a measure of closure. Genuine healing requires the truth. The efforts of CYIM and Rebel Morris are immeasurable. I have had the fortunate experience to speak with Rebel and know her experience and commitment are a resource that has touched my life in a positive way. Every soul she helps is given the gift that they are not forgotten; they matter, their experience matters, and their loss matters. She gives them a name, gives them dignity, and brings them home. Rebel and CYIM are examples that everyone needs to follow.  Eve Carson
Can You Identify Me	179786	2	/users/profile/200582	Glendene G.	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	Can You Identify Me? has been a huge support to me, the mother of missing Jessie Foster. Over the years there have been several times when we got tips or info about a body that was found and with the help of founder Rebel Morris and her organization, we had the strength to get through it all. I am very grateful to what CYIM does for the unidentified and the loved ones looking for them. 
Can You Identify Me	179721	2	/users/profile/236361	Lisa1961	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/18/2013	There is a huge heart behind CYIM,, and its goal: to ensure that no person leaves this earth without their name, and their dignity. It takes passion and commitment to make any sort of change in this world, and from everything I've known about Can You Identify Me,  and Rebel Morris, this will be the organization that has the most impact on solving the plight of the Nation's Unidentified.
Can You Identify Me	179548	3	/users/profile/236192	Jeanne25	Donor	5	10/18/2013	 As a young person my grandfather got me interested in Mysteries, Thrillers and Missing Persons. This eventually led to an interest in everything medicine and especially forensics. Having served in the Military and traveled extensively, I've met and conversed with thousands of people and listened to their "stories". The greatest tragedy I've come across, personally, is seeing someone go missing and not knowing what has happened to them. I've seen people who are left shells of themselves for lack of hearing that voice, or seeing a loved one, one last time. It literally leaves me with an ache in my heart for them.  I've know Rebel Morris for several years now, and she is one of the  most dedicated people I've known in trying to find answers to who these missing people are. Knowing what Rebel Morris and CYIM do by trying to find closure for those people's families who've gone missing is one of the biggest rewards that can be done for someone who is going through that kind of grief. I commend her and CYIM for having the ability to take things as far as they do to help others. They don't just place a picture on a website and say this is Jane or John Doe. They get you interested in this person and make you want to care, to look and be a part of the process of helping others know about them. They make you want to donate to helping that person find the family so the loved one can find closure. God Bless them!  Anyone who has the ability to volunteer and help in any way they can or donate to the cause should do so knowing they are doing a great service for the families out there who are in much need of comfort. This kind of tragedy could happen to anyone. An organization like CYIM is a much needed one in today's world. Thank God it's out there! With today's technology in Forensic's and people like Rebel Morris along with CYIM working hand in hand to discover who these missing souls are, we are sure to give some families the answers they are so dearly seeking. I highly recommend the CYIM organization as THE leader in helping those Missing Persons find their home.

Can You Identify Me	179230	2	/users/profile/235872	Carl K.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I've became involved in the issue of the missing and unidentified after the Jaycee Dugard story broke in August 2009.  I was greatly inspired by the miraculous happy ending to that 18-year nightmare.  Jaycee was reunited with her loving family, but sadly, her case is the exception.  Far too many of these cases are never resolved.  As I was browsing the internet looking for news about Jacyee, I became aware of the volunteers all over the country who are dedicated to finding a resolution for those whose lives are turnied upside down by the disappearance of a loved one.    Rebel Morris is one of those persons who have spent countless hours dedicated to the goal of returning missing persons back to their loved ones, and giving the unidentified their names back.  Her website "Can You Identify Me", is an invaluable resource for those families who are searching through the listings of the unidentified in search of a resolution.   The information about these unidentified persons is presented in a very respectful manner, always cognizant that even in death, these these are human beings who all have a story that needs to be told.

I found your site to be incredibly easy to navigate around. I also liked that it had more than one option for the search criteria. I like being able to look by state, or by year recovered. I found this site to be easily accessible and family oriented.  I loved the little narratives, it made me feel as if somebody had at least given the UIDs a voice. That may seem like a little thing to some, but to the family of a MP......it is a very important thing. 
Can You Identify Me	179136	2	/users/profile/235771	amkerlin	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	We all need closure when life throws challenges our way. We definitely need it when we lose a loved one for whatever reason. I think this site gives those who can no longer speak for themselves, a voice to let their families know what had happened to them. Even if they never reconnect with their families, those of us who see their likeness displayed, is able to send them a quiet prayer and let them know someone cared for them. 
Can You Identify Me	178934	2	/users/profile/235560	Steven33	Donor	5	10/17/2013	Can You Identify Me provides a great service to the unknown people of the world.  It is an organization that I am proud to be associated with because they are run by professionals who care.  They help reunite the missing people with their families and loved ones.  What a Great Organization.
Can You Identify Me	178410	4	/users/profile/235047	Scott71	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	Greetings to All Concerned; I have had the pleasure of working with Rebel and Can You Identify Me for a few years now. They have been a source of information and support to me and my Agency. I am the Coroner for Newton County, Indiana. Here is my story and how CYIM has been helping. Back in 1983 the bodies of four young men were found on an abandoned barn lot in the Northwest part of my County. Two of these "boys" were quickly identified and sent home with their families. Two remain "unidentified" and are in my custody, they have become known as "my kids".Then in 1988 the bodies of a male and female were found shot and burnt along a ditch also in my County. The male was identified by x-ray conformation but the female, now known as another of "my kids", still remains "unidentified".CYIM has been not only a place where I have turned for help with getting information out, they have helped with Forensic Sketches and flyers that can be handed out. They have also put this information on their web site and Facebook page so to get the info out to as many people as possible.But the single most important thing that they have done is to lend an ear and to give support for these kids. Without CYIM I may have simply "given up" the search, but CYIM and Rebel have given me the motivation and renewed hopes that one day I (we) will send these kids home where they belong.I strongly support CYIM and Rebel and would hope that everyone would support such a great organization with wonderful people who selflessly devote their time and efforts to helping people like me and most importantly helping those who can no longer speak for themselves. Thank You Rebel and CYIM and Thank You for reading this; I remain your supporter always; Scott A. McCord, EMT-P, CFT, MLDINewton County Coroner4117 S. 240 W.Morocco, IN 47963219-285-2515
Can You Identify Me	178397	3	/users/profile/119932	Vicki Linginfelter	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	Can you Identify me is a productive organization that not only educates the public, but helps find answers for families .  The information they post on the website helps people realize just how many unidentified people are out there, needing answers.   You really cant help reading about the unidentified because the articles and posts are written so well,  and with respect and professionalism .    The time and work put into the cause is a 24/7 job which has only moved forward .  No one suspects they will be in this unfortunate and heartbreaking situation , or even think someone they know will be unidentified.  This can happen to anyone. This problem does not discriminate.  Having this organization makes searching on the internet for resources much easier. As well as any questions you may have, the organization is quick to respond and very well educated on the topic.  
Can You Identify Me	178388	2	/users/profile/235011	A. Eames	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	Imagine someone you love and care about suddenly disappears one day without a trace. What if despite law enforcement's tenacity and commitment to finding this loved one, the case goes cold? Years go by. The case gets lost in the maze of other cases and crimes the police have to deal with and is largely forgotten by the public. Then, maybe off in some strange far-off place, a set of remains is discovered with no means of identifying it. No body has any idea as to who this person was. Could it be this missing loved one? This is where dedicated, compassionate individuals like Rebel Morris come in to play. Ms. Morris and her organization Can You Identify Me are in so many cases the last chance for unidentified remains to be given their names back and returned to their families, and possibly bringing responsible parties to justice. Can You Identify Me is a rare and precious resource for law enforcement personnel and grieving families needing answers.
Can You Identify Me	178356	3	/users/profile/234963	Cal Millar	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2013	Through the years Can You Identify Me has been a trusted site where people can obtain accurate information about unidentified remains found in jurisdictions in the United States, as well as other parts of the world. Various law enforcement agencies do publicly appeal for information regarding bodies that are located within their area, but Can You Identify Me is the only location on the web that has such a comprehensive list of unidentified bodies with descriptive detail that would assist anyone with a knowledge of these individuals to instantly recognize and be able to formally identify them. Rebel Morris has a passion to help families who have lost loved ones and also to identify found bodies which in the majority of cases are likely murder victims. Once police are able to identify these John and Jane Does, investigators have a greater opportunity to track down leads and bring to justice those who may be responsible for the killings. I first made contact with Rebel while researching missing people cases for a book and she convinced me to include some of the people she had in her files. As a result of her enthusiasm and persistence, I gladly included a chapter on unidentified bodies. I only wish I could have done more to help, but space didnt allow for the number she really wanted to include. However, I am working on a second book on missing people and will definitely feature other additional remains that she wants to profile. Personally I would like to thank Rebel for the assistance she provided to me and also to commend her for the work she does on behalf of families who are looking for answers as a result of a loved one going missing. Cal Millar,Author,Burlington, Ontario, Canada 
Can You Identify Me	178317	3	/users/profile/234924	Amber47	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2013	Through the years, I have read many sites devoted to the missing and unidentified.  Can You Identify me far surpasses almost every one I've read.  Most sites give you a clinical, sometimes cold feeling, "by the numbers" approach to presenting John and Jane Does, this is where Can You Identify me differs, the site really offers a human element to their writing which is absent elsewhere.  When one reads a narrative on this site,  the presentation is such that it is as though the unidentified are speaking in their own voice.  Those voices have been silenced for so long that Rebel can only guess as to what they would say or how they would say it, but she does so very well.  This site serves a much needed purpose while offering often heart breaking accounts of the facts in the listed cases.  I have read the site continually and will continue to do so.  I'm proud of the work that Rebel and her staff do and thankful that these people give a voice to those who no longer have one of their own.

Can You Identify Me	178153	3	/users/profile/234779	Gaetane	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2013	CIYM is an invaluable organization that offers a tremendous service to the public!  There are so many unidentified people, and families in pain.  Being able to identify them helps to give them a voice that needs to be heard.  Rebel's dedication and selflessness is admirable, and her mission has helped many. I personally thank her for the amazing work that she does through CIYM, and I encourage everyone to follow the organization and support them in every way possible.
Can You Identify Me	178127	3	/users/profile/234751	ngolinsky	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2013	I have been continually impressed with Rebel and the work of CYIM. Above and beyond serving such an important need, Rebel selflessly devotes her time and her skills to helping put families back together.  I have found Rebel to show professionalism and respect for others in all that she does and am inspired by her devotion to increase awareness on the issue of America's unidentified. There is a reason she was voted Volunteer of the Year - she's a change maker in every sense of the word. Truly a Rebel with a cause - a great one! 
Can You Identify Me	178092	3	/users/profile/234714	MikeRatliff	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2013	There are thousands of unidentified persons and that means there are thousands of family members searching for their loved ones; wondering where they are and what happened to them. I can't imagine what that must be like.  As a death investigator it is my job to help with these cases. I am so thankful that there are organizations such as Can You Identify Me that provides such a valuable service so selfishly and with the only goal in mind is to help. I had the pleasure of working close with Rebel and her organization on a case from 1975; with her help we were able to return him to his family that had been searching for so many years. Thank you Rebel, Thank You Can You Identify Me. Thank you for caring and thank you for going the extra mile to help. You give the Unidentified a name, a face and a voice.Thank You.

Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	This is a great group who do so much for the unidentified and I am proud to help as a volunteer.I work with the missing also so I see this from both sides and do believe a lot of the unidentified are our missing and also many have never been reported as a missing person.There are also some from other Countries who come here and then are found deceased in America.To be able to identify someone and give a family answers is so very important to all of us here at Can You Identify Me.So many great people here helping to identify the so many unidentified all over this Country and work hard to accomplish this.This is a wonderful group to work with and I sure recommend them to everyone.
Can You Identify Me	177981	3	/users/profile/234584	michelleclosemills	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2013	This organization gives a voice to those who lost their own voices long ago. The victims go from unidentifiable to having a face to go with their story...a tremendously positive step in reuniting families with their lost loved ones. So many of these families have lost hope. I can't say enough about how much I admire their work and dedication.
Can You Identify Me	177964	3	/users/profile/234566	TylerJane D.	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2013	In 2011 I approached Can You Identify Me about helping me get the word out about a Jane Doe found in Smith County Texas Oct 1, 1985.  There were many clues about her that most people would not know by looking at a Unidentified Person Flyer.   I found copies of articles written about Jane Doe or MS BONES as she was referred to by Law Enforcement that gave more info than would be found on a flyer.  By doing the narrative for my Tyler Jane Doe - it made her more real.  It gave people clues that I hope one day will give her identity back to her and return her to her family.  It explained to people why they should not look at the recon but look at the clues and circumstances of how she came to be known as MS BONES.  Her remains in a box in the evidence room of a Sheriffs Department in East Texas.   MS BONES has finally been turned over to a forensic artist who will give her a new face and hopefully bring her the justice she deserves.  Having the narrative that Can You Identify Me did for my Tyler Jane Doe has given me hope that people who read it will see what I see, a person who had a life, a family and needs to be seen as a human being - not a hopeless box of bones.Betty Edwards

When we first found out, I was 8 months pregnant. I was confused asking why?... When we got introduced to this wonderful organization we felt welcome at ease made us understand what was going on with our son. Group of Dr's and nurses are phenomenal!!!! Outstanding medical staff make u feel at home. Keep on doing what u all are doing excellent work. Thank you Broomi Family 
AmeriFace	297684		/users/profile/388492	ad0722	Client Served	5	07/22/2016	They truly are a wonderful group of people. They are not only there with information when you need it, but they are there to encourage you and help you in any and all ways possible. Without Debbie and all she has done for our family, we wouldn't be where we our today. We are greatful for everything AmeriFace has helped us with. Truly great people and organization.
AmeriFace	297681	1	/users/profile/388489	tknk	General Member of the Public	5	07/22/2016	I was born with a unilateral cleft lip and palate.  I remember going to these sad picnics for parents and children with "facial differences"  I say sad because no one was happy and all the parents would introduce their kids as this is my son or daughter with the cleft I don't remember anyone caring about what my name was just what kind of cleft I had, what surgery was I on did I have "the palate" also.11 years ago I had boy/ girl twins, one had a bilateral cleft lip and palate.  I knew since my pregnancy (16 weeks)  but I think I'm a procrastinator or I'm one of those who thinks I don't have to deal with things till they come.  So I didn't do much research or look for much support actually didn't even know that there was support out there and I sure didn't want to contact those "sad" groups. My twins were able 1 month old and I was sitting in front of the tv while pumping milk watching the montel Williams show.  It struk my interest when I heard something about cleft lip and palate so I stayed tuned.  That's where, for the first time I heard about the wonderful Debbie Oliver and her amazing cause and she was in VEGAS!!!  I immediately got on line and found cleft Advocate.  We attended our first conference about 3 years later which was so wonderful to meet some of the people I been been getting know, helping and getting help from.  I had actually met a young couple in person who just had their new baby girl and wanted to meet us in person who I had met in cleft Advocate.  This network has been so amazing all these years for me to be able to get help and get answers to things I never knew about it had gone through.  This week my family was blessed and able to attend this year's 25th annual conference!  My twins are now 11, they have a younger brother who's 8 and a new baby sister.  Being able to come this year has been amazing and so different to be in such a different place in our lives.  What brought me the most joy was to see my son happy again and have that big smile on his face.  He knew that he was just like other kids, he wasn't alone in this world and he wasn't my "cleft kid"  he was himself and he is beautiful and perfect!  The conference is a huge plus to be able to make once in your lifetime is a huge plus but the heart and soul purpose of this network is the friendships, the support, the love and sense of family and others who "get it" then being able to help others to be out in the community and to be able to share what we got is priceless.  I'm so grateful that I saw that montel Williams show and learned about Debbie and her organization all those years back!  What a blessing it has been. 
AmeriFace	297643	1	/users/profile/388450	Annie49	Client Served	5	07/21/2016	I expected going to this conference to get information on having a cleft lip and palate.  What I came out with was knowing what to expect in the long run what our son will be going through. It was very eye opening for my husband and I. We also met new friends young and older. I love how the speakers used words that were easy to understand and we're able to answer our questions.  I was expecting more people to attend. I'm glad it was a smaller amoubt if people after all. We were all able to connect with one another on a more personal level. My kids all met great friends. This was the first time being outside of a medical facility that we were able to interact with othet cleft lip/ palate kidd and adults.  We cant wait to go back and attend next year. 
AmeriFace	297543		/users/profile/270302	abcfrye	General Member of the Public	5	07/21/2016	Amazing group of people who provided support, guidance, and insight that was much appreciated. 
AmeriFace	207629		/users/profile/270302	abcfrye	General Member of the Public	5	07/29/2014	The information found on the ameriFace/CleftAdvocate website, Facebook page, via its members, and by Debbie Oliver was paramount in helping us get insurance coverage for our daughter's most recent surgery. Not only were we welcomed with open arms, but we were overwhelmed by the vast amount of knowledge, support, and genuine care and concern offered. Thanks for such an amazing resource for families with children with facial differences. We couldn't have done it without you. 
AmeriFace	294496		/users/profile/385235	Ally S.	General Member of the Public	5	07/01/2016	I cannot even remember how I came to know about AmeriFace, but from the moment I did- I loved it. Debbie Oliver is one of the most gracious, kind-hearted, intelligent women I've gotten the opportunity to know. AmeriFace provides so much information and clarity when it comes to the knowledge of Cleft Lip/Palate's and other Craniofacial deformities. The level of professionalism and care goes hand and hand. It truly is like a community, and they will make sure you are informed and comfortable. There is a plethora of information and resources you can find, just by visiting the AmeriFace website. It is an awesome organization, and I just wish more people were informed about it! 
AmeriFace	294477	1	/users/profile/182849	Robin53	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	My family has always found comfort from the many people at Amerface.  We have also been a part of helping others throughout the years and now my son is picking up and helping others.
AmeriFace	207695		/users/profile/182849	Robin53	Volunteer	5	07/29/2014	Ameriface has been with my family since my son was a year old.  They have been with us for good and the bad.  I have also been able to help others due to this organization.  I have become friends with many of the families and we have been able to watch our kids grow and become happy healthy teens.
AmeriFace	136899		/users/profile/182849	Robin53	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	Cleft Advocate and Ameriface were not around when my son was born.  However, a year later it was.  It was a great way for me to learn more about how to care for my son but also to help others who were stepping into my shoes.

Debbie had just begun forming the organization, and I've been served as a parent of a child with a craniofacial difference and I've been a volunteer.  I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had to. This organization has done so much over the years. Hope it keeps on ticking for the next 12 yrs and more more to come.

AmeriFace	113988		/users/profile/154501	Cathy22	Volunteer	5	06/06/2012	I've been a member of cleft Advocate since right around it's institution in it's early days. And Debbie is a wonderful advocate and parent. I haven't been involved in recent years, due to my chaotic lifestyle, but her website stil is and always has been the lead GOTO for information on anything craniofacial affiliated and information. I call her the "cA Guru" I have a local group (via phone and email connections only) that we meet once a month or so locally, for play dates, or just to connect when someone needs help. And she was the inspiration behind that networking. And I refer them all to her website: www.ameriface.org. 
AmeriFace	208116	1	/users/profile/270795	Milli D.	Volunteer	5	07/31/2014	I ended up volunteering with AmeriFace because I fell in love with the people. I can't imagine going though my son's childhood without their support. cleftAdvocate was brand spanking new when I first stumbled on them, and they were a lifeline, a source of comfort, and a place of sanity. I honestly don't know what I would have done without them and am so glad I found them when my son was only a few months old. 12 years later, I love them just as much and I can't imagine my life without them.

AmeriFace	207696		/users/profile/270371	happy1234	General Member of the Public	5	07/29/2014	The cleftAdvocate Facebook page is an amazing resource for parents/families in the cleft community. I have never seen such a supportive group of people who are all so eager to give advise, share testimonies,  and celebrate progress as this group is. As a young adult with a cleft, I'm aware that one day I might have a child with a cleft myself, and it is very encouraging to see these resources out there!
AmeriFace	207683		/users/profile/270360	Missy14	General Member of the Public	5	07/29/2014	The sense of community that they bring to the families affected by Cleft, is invaluable. There can't be enough education for the public and families outside of just the medical perspective.

No wi-fi, all dial in, and we found AmeriFace and Cleft Advocate.  They mailed us literature, and at that time a VCR tape, insert smiley, and talked with me on the phone to educate me on what a cleft was and what we needed to do.  Here we are 9 years later with a healthy active baseball player, four surgeries post, and very blessed to have organizations like this.  I have referred many families to them, and support them financially when we can.  
AmeriFace	207657		/users/profile/270335	Ann_88	Volunteer	5	07/29/2014	I found CleftAdvocate shortly after my daughter was born 11 years ago with a cleft palate. I didn't know what to do or where to turn to for help.  They were truly a beacon of light shining through the darkness of my despair when we just couldn't figure out how to feed our baby. The information and support I received from CleftAdvocate were life changing for me, my daughter and our whole family. I can't thank them enough and only hope that my story can help someone else as much as CleftAdvocate helped me.
AmeriFace	207650		/users/profile/270326	cvphalen	Client Served	5	07/29/2014	When your family recieves a cleft diagnosis, it can be overwhelming-at least it was for us. Finding reliable information is a godsend as we soon learn that cleft, though challenging, is navigatable. We watched the cleft feeding video over and over before our little one was born so we would have the confidence to feed her. Aside from needed support in the early stages this organization helps you as your child grows. Often kids need dental, speech, hearing and psychosocial support, not to mention help with health insurance. Ameriface helped me know what questions to ask doctors. Through the group, I have met adults with cleft. It is an awesome organization that makes a difference.

AmeriFace	174703		/users/profile/231011	Kerri F.	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2013	My name is Kerri and I am the mother to an amazing daughter named Ella. Ella is now 8 and healing from a bone graft surgery which is her third surgery this year alone. She was born with a unilateral cleft lip and palate. She was our surprise in the delivery room because it was undected through an ultrasound. So many questions, concerns and feelings. I had no idea where to turn or who to talk to. I stumbled across cleftadvocate/Ameriface thankfully! My emotions were everywhere and I had no idea where to begin, what to expect and needed to know there were others out there like her. I needed information and parents. I needed someone to tell me that it was going to be alright. That my daughter was alright. I needed before and after pictures. I needed someone to explain to me what was going on and what was going to happen in non-medical terms. Someone that has been there and done that. Ameriface has been that place.  Whether it's to share experiences, pictures, give advice for pre op and post op, stories, help with a team, insurance, a shoulder to cry on, or just to brag about how awesome our kids are..They have been there with open arms. Our children go through surgery after surgery. Procedure after procedure. Therapy appointment after therapy appointment. We  know how another parent is feeling without even speaking a word. It's been such an amazing experience and I am so thankful to be a part of it all!
AmeriFace	174459		/users/profile/230734	Debra Shiveley Welch	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2013	Our adopted son came home when he was seven-days-old.  Although many would say that his face was not "perfect," to us he was beautiful.  Chris was born with a moderately severe clefting of the lip, gums and hard and soft palates, left side. Ignorance is self-defeating.  Chris was turned down by six other couples because they wanted a perfect baby, and in their ignorance, they passed up just that  the perfect  baby, our son. Be that as it may, we were still concerned about being able to do all we could for our baby.  Education was paramount, we knew that, but we needed more than education; we needed empowerment. AmerFace accomplishes just that.  As parents, we need more than step-by-step answers about lip closure on a baby, or getting your child to drink from a glass before palate closure; what do we do during those long months of healing from bone graft to keep our children comfortable and engaged when all they want to do is run and play?  How do we handle bullying, speech therapies, self-image and what can we feed our children when they are not allowed solids for a stretch of time? What questions should I ask before each surgery? Yes, I can get an education on line and at the library, but how do I educate my heart to help my child?  Through AmeriFace and their FaceBook group CleftAdvocate.  And thats exactly what they help us to become: advocates for our children.

AmeriFace	174447		/users/profile/230722	ashjayt	Client Served	5	10/06/2013	In 2002 my son Jayton was born with a bilateral cleft lip and palate.  It was a complete surprise so we definitely were not prepared.  We live in a small community so children being born with a cleft are few and far between, so with that said, our hospital was not prepared either.  We were basically sent home with the Haberman bottle and a smile.  Thank goodness I found cleft Advocate and Debbie Oliver.  Without Debbie and her passion to create such a wonderful organization I would not be where I am today.  I am a strong mom and have an even stronger son due to her knowledge, & the connection with other families.  Being able to jump online and ask a question and receive a handful of responses was a god send.  I APPRECIATE and VALUE the support of cleft Advocate and AmeriFace.  
AmeriFace	172227		/users/profile/227954	JWo76	Client Served	5	09/27/2013	In October of 2001, my son was born with a cleft lip and palate.  I was a single mother and I  was terrified.  I stumbled across many organizations through the internet, but none that made feel as comfortable and welcome as AmeriFace.   Debbie Oliver and the people I met through the network changed my life.  They felt like family- and to this day, still do.  I honestly don't think I could have made it through my son's early years without the advice, support, friendship, and love of this group.  Every question I had about my son's care was answered from someone who had been there.  And now, I am one of the "old timers" and I get to help others!  Amazing!
AmeriFace	171806		/users/profile/213678	Soozy N.	Client Served	5	09/25/2013	To start Ameriface has been awesome to our family.  I love Debbie Oliver and everyone who has touched our lives and helped us.  In April 2007 my son was born with a unilateral cleft lip and palate.  The nurses in the hospital didn't know how to feed him and I thought I would end up feeding him through a straw or cup.  The nurses there put a tube in his nose to feed him.  One of the nurses that came on remembered a packet that was dropped off at the hospital by this group and asked me if they could call them for me.  I said "yes please do".   If I wasn't able to get him to eat in the next 12 hours they were going to do a GI tube.  I didn't want that to happen.  A little later Debbie called me and asked if she could send another parent who had a son born with the same thing.  I again said "please do".  She sent Monica (my angel in disguise) and her son to see me and my son in the hospital.  She then showed me how to feed him and gave me a packet with info.  We talked about surgeries and what to expect.  We are still friends and she has even taken us to one of my sons surgeries when my husband had to work.  I love everyone that I have had the pleasure to meet through this organization.  They are such a blessing.

There is no worse feeling that being told that there is a problem with your unborn fetus.  You feel alone as if this has happened to noone else but you.  Finding Ameriface was one of the best things I could have done.  It brings a light that you may not have seen before, knowing that there are others like you going through the same thing.  You suddenly feel like if they can get through it, so can you.  This organization has not only helped me but it has helped me help others going through the same thing.  There are so many resources that Ameriface has brought to my attention for my son, that I didn't even know existed.  I am so incredibly thankful that is organization exists.

Debbie Oliver and other cA members helped me get through one of the worst times of my life. It was great hear from other families who had already gone through the surgery and could talk me through it.  Whenever I had a question, it was was answered.  And I have made some awesome lifetime friends, some I've met in person and others I've met online. But I cherish all of their knowledge and friendship.    I give cA/Ameriface a 5 star + rating
AmeriFace	139583		/users/profile/185701	KellyH	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I joined cleftAdvocate back when it first started because my youngest daughter (who's now 12) was born with a unilateral cleft lip and aveolar ridge.  The support, information and life long friendships I've made because of them is priceless.  I've learned so much from them, their volunteers and the information they provide that I've become a volunteer, too.  Helping someone who's just starting to navigate the healthcare system is so rewarding.

We had no idea my daughter had a cleft palate till hours after she was born and Debbie came to our rescue with bottles and tons of information on clefts and the organization. She also provided us with a list of wonderful doctors. We are very thankful for AmeriFace and all that they do. 
AmeriFace	139528		/users/profile/185651	Gina21	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	My Son has Crouzons Syndrome and Ameriface has been a tremendous help to our family. We have learned so much from the family conferences they put on in Vegas. How to deal with insurance to get needed medical help for our son, resources to help with costs, other families to network with and workshops geared to the age of each child, including those not affected in each family. My boys have made great friends at the conferences and look forward to them each year to reconnect. Because of Ameriface we have meet other families with the same rare conditon our son has that we would have never been able to meet otherwise. Our son has come a long way from the first conference...crying when we left him in his workshop to now helping other kids know where to go and when, dancing on the dance floor, performing in skits, playing in the pool and lounging pool side. All things normal/average kids do but things that were very hard for our son to do until becoming a part of the safe, loving, nuturing enviroment of Amerface. We just can't say enough about how much we love Ameriface and what we have gained from them.

Four hours from home on a computer in the hotel lobby I found the site and our life changed.  Without the support and information available on the list serve, we would have not known there were options for us, and we would never had had the opportunity to accomplish all that was accomplished for the good of my grandson.

I believe in this organization so much that I became a Pathfinder Volunteer to help other parents with their journeys.
AmeriFace	135985		/users/profile/181890	Veronica L.	Client Served	5	11/08/2012	I am so grateful for CleftAdvocate and for Debbie Oliver.  This organization truly cares for the families that are facing the challenges of having children with cleft lips and palates. I was an emotional roller coaster when my baby was born; many times, I asked myself what did I do wrong? Did my emotions have anything to do with my baby being born that way? Did I take any medications that I shouldnt have? Is this in my familys genes?  All of these questions were questions that I was able to get answers to by attending a conference here in Las Vegas for children born with a cleft lip and palate through CleftAdvocate.  My daughter was born a month before they had a conference here in Las Vegas so this was great blessing. Hannah was born with a unilateral incomplete cleft lip and cleft soft palate and the information and help we received as a family was unbelievable.  We were able to learn how to feed my baby and what to expect from every surgery she was going to have.  My beautiful Hannah is 3 years old now and she is such a blessing to all of us. So grateful to this great organization that truly cares and helps families go through this journey by providing resources, information and letting us know that we were not alone raising a child with a facial difference.  Thank you!

The founder and her family of this organization are exceptional! !!  
AmeriFace	134624		/users/profile/180481	Jeanette A.	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2012	I am new to the cleftAdvocate group on Facebook but as a new to cleft related issues mom, I am very grateful that this group exists.  My September baby has a unilateral, incomplete cleft lip and we are facing our first consult next week.  I'm anxious and nervous but I deal better with the unknown through research and education so I love having a place to get opinions and experiences from others who've been through what we are facing.  I've already asked questions and others have been quick with support and comments and I've already felt some relief with learning.  Even though when we tell people about our son's cleft lip, others will tell me "oh, so-and-so that I know had that" so it seems so common yet we know no one personally that's been through it so it can feel lonely at times.  I think AmeriFace is doing a great job not just with the technical side of things in terms of diagnosis, correction, etc. but they are really taking care of the personal side of things too for the children as well as the parents and the family as a whole.  It is a wonderful thing!

Within the first week of my son's birth I had connections to other mothers and specialists in the field of clefts.

When I think of shelter, I imagine cots lined up on the floor and people sitting around just to get off of the sidewalk. I volunteered for about a month for school and I have learned that this place is so much more. Shade Tree is not just a shelter.  It is a place to get what you need to start again. They have a variety of services available. When you are hungry, you are fed. And not just soup and sandwiches. You can have cereal and milk for breakfast or oatmeal and coffee. I was there during lunch time and saw once they served pizza and another time they had turkey. If you want to take classes to learn about finances they have a bank come in to teach it, if you want to exercise they have yoga (Yoga at a homeless shelter is amazing!), you want to learn computers, they have a class for that. If you want to get a job, they have a program to help you do that, too. It seems as if anything you might need to help you get back on your feet, Shade Tree has is for you. In regards to one of the other comments, while I volunteered there I did see one altercation between some of the ladies there and I think the staff handled it well (I couldnt do there job) but I would think that when you get that many people living in the same place together stuff like that is bound to happen once in a while.

Recently, we expanded the relationship and brought in crews to paint murals, remodel the pantry, sort a basement full of donations and teach a class in resume writing.  The vast majority of the clients we have encountered over the years seem very much at ease, and often engage in conversations with us.  Although these ladies and children are going through some incedibly rough times, the atmosphere at The Shade Tree is upbeat and calm.  If you are looking for a place to volunteer, the enrollment process is easy, and the Volunteer Coordinator, Marian Thomas, is very organized and responsive.  Even more importantly, Marian recognizes that the needs of their clients go way beyond the basic necessity of food, clothing and shelter, and she exhibits patience and respect in her client interactions.  Highway to Hope looks forward to a continued, fruitful, and always mutually beneficial relationship with The Shade Tree.

We are not a religious group, we just want to show love to these people who are hurting, lost and needy in terms of giving our time and their material needs.

My experince with this nonprofit is now way better then my last time. I feel that I have gotten more help since my last time here, I came back to Las Vegas to live with family and things where not wtat they seems, therefore I want back to The Shade Tree. Again I must say it is much better then before, I see that staff are more willing to help u now, help in getting u a place to live, a job, to also help in getting u medical help, help in provide u with help for u pets/ and or your love ones. Staff try as best as they can to help,and provide for u as well as others. Last time I was here to me and this is for me, where not as friendly, they where into helping who they wanted to help. Most ladies have to realize that in order to better yourself u must make the first step in helping  yourself, therefore others will see this and help u more. You need to stay focus towards your goals. Now I could go on and say things are not perfect here, but why when I and my child are not out in the streets, and are living off family and friends.

As a former staff member, I've never had a job more rewarding than The Shade Tree.  Having the opportunity to impact someone's life in a positive, caring way is a great responsibility that The Shade Tree doesn't take lightly.  This organization lives its mission of providing safe shelter and life changing services that promote stability, dignity and self-reliance to homeless and abused women and children.

They help them find jobs, have activities throughout the year, and give them clothing and other items. They also take care of the pets which is really cool. I am happy to support them and the community should support this organization as well. Without The Shade Tree, so many people would have nowhere to go to get back on their feet.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	118812	10	/users/profile/161541	VeronicaD.,	Volunteer	5	07/18/2012	Its hard to believe all the services Shade Tree offers to the ladies. When I think of shelter, I imagine cots lined up on the floor and people sitting around just to get off of the sidewalk. I volunteered for about a month for school and I have learned that this place is so much more. Shade Tree is not just a shelter.  It is a place to get what you need to start again. They have a variety of services available. When you are hungry, you are fed. And not just soup and sandwiches. You can have cereal and milk for breakfast or oatmeal and coffee. I was there during lunch time and saw once they served pizza and another time they had turkey. If you want to take classes to learn about finances they have a bank come in to teach it, if you want to exercise they have yoga (Yoga at a homeless shelter is amazing!), you want to learn computers, they have a class for that. If you want to get a job, they have a program to help you do that, too. It seems as if anything you might need to help you get back on your feet, Shade Tree has is for you. In regards to one of the other comments, while I volunteered there I did see one altercation between some of the ladies there and I think the staff handled it well (I couldnt do there job) but I would think that when you get that many people living in the same place together stuff like that is bound to happen once in a while.

The Shade Tree Incorporated	166921		/users/profile/221773	crita	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	this is my first experience volunteering for a shelter, when I did my orientation, I did believe that this organization is very organized and helping our people, women and children to get a better chance in life after a crisis in family , it is really benefitting everybody in the society. My child also volunteers here and she could see that Shade Tree is a very secure for kids. well done shade tree!
The Shade Tree Incorporated	166914	1	/users/profile/221767	Tigra752	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/04/2013	I have had experience with the beautiful workings and mission of The Shade Tree; each staff member puts every ounce of their heart into helping these homeless and battered women get back up on their own two feet and reach self-sufficiency. My experience is even more well-versed at The Shade Tree's Noah's Animal House, the animal kennel temporary "home" to several of the Shade Tree women's pets. Noah's Animal House was the pioneer of adding an animal facility to a Battered Women's Shelter, and the difference it is making in these women's lives is tangible. Being able to bring an animal with them when fleeing an abusive situation is very often the "make or break" of an animal owner leaving a terrible situation. Once safely in the bosom of The Shade Tree, the women seek refuge and therapy from their furry family member, greatly aiding in their progress of their own case plan at The Shade Tree. Finally, time and again, statistics have shown that the recidivism rate on these animal-owner women is greatly reduced when compared to the woman who are not pet-owners or whose pets are not housed with them while in-shelter. I have seen this magic happen in-person, and I know that Noah's Animal House and The Shade Tree is changing lives in the hundreds on a daily basis!
The Shade Tree Incorporated	159597	1	/users/profile/211772	Beth74	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/05/2013	As the previous Volunteer Coordinator at The Shade Tree, I was humbeled and proud to see how the members of the Las Vegas Community came together to assist and support the women and children of this shelter.  It was amazing to see how volunteers teaching life skills classes or music lessons in the children's activity center could lift the spirits of residents and provide life changing skills that help women to get back on their feet.     The Shade Tree not only is a place to sleep and get a hot meal, it is a place where residents are offered case management, job referrals, health and nutrition information, support groups and so much more.  The Shade Tree is truly unique and one of a kind.  Thank goodness for the caring staff and volunteers who serve them.   
The Shade Tree Incorporated	152174	1	/users/profile/203276	Ckgborne06	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/05/2013	The Shade Tree strives to fulfill the needs of the homeless and abused women and children. Not only is housing and job assistance offered, but the shelter has a Children's Activity Center where kids can experience childhood while bonding with their mothers. Furthermore, life skills classes are offered to improve the skills of the women. There are holiday parties, career fairs, and fitness classes to cheer the women and children up. The Shade Tree even has an animal house which was opened in 2007 with the purpose of keeping families together. Women no longer have to give up their animals or leave their pets behind. The residents' animals are able to live right next door. The Shade Tree is a great organization.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	126205	1	/users/profile/159072	Sara37	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I have had the privilege of volunteering at The Shade Tree on several occasions.  The safety and comfort that they provide for women, children and also their pets is incredible.  Marlene Richter and her staff are warm, caring people who work to give homeless and abused women and children stability and skills for self-reliance.  I was so moved by my experience.

Each year that I visit them, I come away feeling so grateful to know them and to know there is a safe harbor at the Shade Tree for families in need.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	126063		/users/profile/171158	victad	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	I am honored to be a part of the Shade Tree because it ofers more than a safe, warm place to sleep.  Since opening its doors more than two decades ago, women and children have been given the tools to experience a genuine sense of pride in achielving independance. The program is constantly  evolving to address the changing needs and issues of homelessness in our community.  From job development to healthcare, to a co-located animal shelter for the furry family members...the Shade Tree reinvents itself over and over again as the needs of the clients change.  I am so grateful to be able to watch the women and children flourish because The Shade Tree is mroe than a shelter!
The Shade Tree Incorporated	122071		/users/profile/166185	Wilfred	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2012	One of my friends invited me to attend their annual walk last year then again this year. It was such a great time. Seeing the staff, kids, babies, friends, family, pets; walking together, talking together, laughing together all in support to raise money for the shelter. Staff at the shelter talked about stories of their clients with such passion to help that definitely rubbed of me, making me want to help more. If you don't take away anything from the experience, at the least it reminds you to count your  blessings. I look forward to helping in other ways and will continue to support these events.

Without a doubt, the shade tree was my shelter of choice to donate to. I see them on the news asking for help and I can tell they really want to help. I donated a bunch of dresses usable for work and play in addition to shoes and other items the ladies can wear in the workforce . I received a thank you letter and I know its always the right decision to send my items to shade tree.

We got there early and started to set up the items..there were things from body wash and lotions tto scarfs and sweaters for the moms. After set up, each child was called and accompanied by their own "shopper" to pick out what they wanted to give their moms. The why's behind their reasons were priceless. Thank you Shade Tree for making moms and ladies feel special because holidays can be extremely difficult.   
The Shade Tree Incorporated	122017	1	/users/profile/166101	KeiaD	Volunteer	5	09/07/2012	When I started to volunteer at The Shade Tree it was for school, as I continued to go there twice a week and serve the families lunch, it became a part of me. They would talk to me sometimes about how blessed they feel to have a home within the shelter, and how they learn things such as how to write a resume or tot use the computer while they're here. I moved, but when I get back, I'll definitely visit and volunteer again.

The Shade Tree Incorporated	122008	7	/users/profile/166090	speaking the truth	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/07/2012	The Shade Tree is the poorest kept for the shelter, for Christimas of 2010 there were over a thousand gift card given that were for the women and the women didn't get them.  Some how they got in Marlene Ricther hand and a couple of ladies that work there. The place is in infested with bed bugs and Marlene Ricther isn't doing anything about it. The place is is infested with rats and among other things. I don't donate to the shade tree I donate to safe nest where they really need it. The ladies don't half of the items that are donated. The shelter is filthy inside from up to the botttom. The workers are over work and Marlene is a mean and hateful woman. You have have of the the workers popping pills and drinking on the job trying to cope with the bullshit. I feel sorry for the ladies and the children they are getting half of the stick. There is no installation in the bathrooms. And if anyone says the the shad tree rocks you are lying. Thap place need serious help and the ED need to be thrown out and the rest of them. The residents see nothing that comes in at all.  The tissues comes from hotels that has been used they are half of rolls. The Health District need to come down and check on the bed bug infestation and the rats down in the basement and on  all the floors. Andl they sometimes are in the bed with the babies when there are holes in the mattress and a family of rats are in there and the babies rats drop in the bed with the children. And roaches are infested also dropping from the ceiling with bed bugs along with them. What next when you  donate it is all a show that they are showing donors and they feed into that mess. Have the donors tried Child Haven, Safe Nest, or Safe Haven. Over a hundred or more computers lap tops were donated where are they? The residents didn't get them at all. One gentleman donated $2,500 and it was put under Marlene's door and it hasn't been seen since where did the money go. So think twice because the shade tree is not what it is stacked up to be.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	121920	5	/users/profile/165921	gabby123	Client Served	1	09/05/2012	Shade Tree should be the last place you ever want to go if you're fleeing domestic violence. Security is shabby, getting paid minimum wage. You can't pay security minimum wage and expect them to actually want and be motivated to secure the premises. Staff has a very "brush-off" approach, especially administrative staff. The only ones that seem to actually care are the younger staff. Client advocates are outnumbered and short staffed. Overworked and underpaid as many of them say. Shade Tree continues to receive millions in funding and grants but I see nothing done to use up those funds wisely, such as healthier and more adequate food. Sanitation is also another miss. Lastly, I'm familiar with government funding and from the notices on the wall, Shade Tree is abusing HUD and HIP funding. The government should pull their funding so that way they can actually use the external funding they receive rather than dispensing it amongst the higher ups.

The Shade Tree Incorporated	117407	1	/users/profile/159638	heather211	General Member of the Public	1	06/30/2012	The Shade Tree sounds like a HORRIBLE place.  Full of discrimination, divisiveness and hatred.   They accept some people and turn away others based on infantile notions of body morphology.   Dividing families and destroying peoples sense of family unit. 
The Shade Tree Incorporated	116842	1	/users/profile/159016	1advocate	Board Member	5	06/27/2012	Being a part of this amazing organization for over ten years has been has been as much for me as it is for the women and children we serve.  I am reminded daily of the strength and courage that these women have under the worst circumstances.  I am also reminded that it is not about destiny, but rather the choices one makes.  The Shade Tree not only provides safe shelter and balanced meals for those who are experiencing homelessness and financial crisis, but it is made up of many programs which are offered to provide the tools and resources to break the cycle of homelessness.  I can't think of a better inspiration than the women and children who fill our corridors with hope, laughter and tears.  Credit goes to the patient and dedicated staff who insure that the shelter is a safe and inspiring space during time of desperation.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	116786		/users/profile/158952	wmarsh1025	Volunteer	4	06/27/2012	Shade Tree is a great organiztion to work with.

The Shade Tree Incorporated	116785		/users/profile/158951	Virginia6	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2012	On a convention to Las Vegas, I was able to spend a Saturday morning at The Shade Tree. It was the most rewarding event. The woman and the children all smiled and seemed so happy. No one would know the troubles each one had. I spent the time mostly with the children, and I was better for it. God was there that day. They were entertaining and made me feel so welcome. The Shade Tree does so much for all of the woman, children and now their animals that it is great to make donations to such a worthy cause.  It has a very close family type atmosphere and helps the woman so much. They are empowered and made to feel they can now have a second chance at life. 
The Shade Tree Incorporated	116779		/users/profile/158944	SusanSporran	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	While searching for charities whose purpose matched those of a non-profit foundation with which I'm associated I found The Shade Tree.  I got in touch with the Executive Director and quickly became passionate about supporting their mission, "To provide safe shelter to homeless and abused women and children in crisis and to offer life-changing services promoting stability, dignity, and self-reliance." .   My passion has been shared with others and for the past 4+ years we have volunteered through lending a hand where needed at the shelter, doing fundraising events, sending boxes full of urgently needed items and lending moral support to staff and residents.  I call it a God-shot that I was guided to The Shade Tree because my work with them has been the most rewarding experience of my life.  It even led me to a career change into the non-profit sector.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	116776		/users/profile/158940	TheBlonde K.	Donor	5	06/27/2012	My first experience with The Shade Tree was three years ago.  The dedication of the staff to the community is palpable in every one you meet.  Although some clients are in desperate situations, the shelter is filled with light and hope.  One cannot leave without being affected by the positive atmosphere.  A few hours, once a year with the clients and staff of The Shade Tree energizes me to contribute time and money in my home community in a effort to ensure the women, children and pets here also have a haven and are being cared for.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	116774		/users/profile/158937	Celine M.	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	Whilst on a vacation trip 4 years ago to Las Vegas we friends I was introduced to TST. I went along to volunteer and help out not really knowing what to expect. After being welcomed and introduced to exactly who and what TST do I was amazed. Not only do they help women and children but also their pets. To me that was something very special, as a dog owner I fully understand the need to keep those beloved fur babies with you. The work that the team do to help the women and children get back on their feet and heal their physical and emotional wounds is exceptional. This year I was honoured to help out in Noah's pet house and see all the work that goes on there. I am still in awe of the wonderful work the team do there in an efficient and professional manner to look after their guests. The women and children are an inspiration and a true mark of the endurance of the human spirit. My journey with TST started 4 years ago and each time I visit I come away a better person. This is truly an amazing organisation run by exceptional people.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	116760	1	/users/profile/158922	Holly15	Donor	5	06/27/2012	Four years ago, I became familiar with The Shade Tree via a charitable organization which had been raising funds on TST's behalf.  I was intrigued by the model implemented by TST insofar as it not only provides safe shelter to women and children escaping domestic abuse, but their pets as well. Since my initial discovery, I have consistently contributed to this cause.  For the last 3 years, I have volunteered on-site while in Las Vegas for an annual convention.  Each time I visit, I walk away more passionate than ever about the people served by TST and its role in the community.  I've not only witnessed first hand the impact the shelter has on its "guests", but I've grown to respect those "on the front lines" and running the shelter in the most efficient ways possible.  The Shade Tree is truly the shining example of how communities should provide for those in need.
The Shade Tree Incorporated	116745	2	/users/profile/158905	Susan103	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2012	I am the mother of a daughter who was murdered by the father of her child back in 1996.  For years we did not know what had happened and it wasn't until 2007 that her body was identified.  Her murderer is now awaiting trial.   A few years back I was in Las Vegas for a convention and I was privileged to go to The Shade Tree and see the fabulous job that Marlene and her staff accomplish on a daily basis to help women and children who have been abused and hurt by the one person who is suppose to love and take care of them.  This shelter has so affected me that I have joined my local domestic abuse and rape victim organization and my goal is to build a shelter modeled after The Shade Tree.  I am so inspired every year now to go to The Shade Tree while in Vegas and volunteer for a few hours and learn from Marlene and her staff what it is like to truly give back to those who find themselves in this horrible situation.  If only there had been a Shade Tree available in 1996 my daughter and many others may be alive today.

Everyone have their own daily struggles, however, the incredible sense of hope The Shade Tree inspire upon to the women, children, and pets are remarkable. Seeing the passion in the eyes of the staff reassures the belief they have in The Shade Tree's overall mission. I have been lucky to be a part of various fundraising events and seen them in action. Every 2 to 3 months, I go through my home in addtion to collecting from friends and family for items the clients of TST can benefit from. There is nothing more rewarding than being able to help. Seeing the women and families empowered from programs they went through while at the shelter embrace the world, being a part of that is heartwarming.

Keeping it out of the Nevada landfills and safely facilitating its recycling into new useful products.   And most importantly they have annually created and administered the nations largest single telephone book recycling program.   Hundreds of tons of old telephone books were recycled back into new telephone book paper because of this successful and well managed environmental program. As a representative of a Fortune 100 company that has a long history with KTMB, I must say that this is the finest and best managed community non-profit that I have ever worked with. Bravo to KTMB, Christi Cakiroglu and fine staff and volunteers that help to Keep Nevada Beautiful!
Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful	172665		/users/profile/228640	DeniseEvans	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2013	As the current Volunteer Coordinator for Washoe County Parks, I have the pleasure of working very closely with Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful (KTMB). KTMB refers a large percentage of the organizations that want to do cleanups in Washoe County parks to us, as well as helping to find groups to adopt our parks and trails. Not only do they provide support in the form of volunteers, but will also assist with any needed tools or supplies. In addition, KTMB's annual Great Community Cleanup and Truckee River Cleanup are absolutely instrumental in the overall beautification and upkeep of Washoe County's parks and open spaces. The staff at KTMB never hesitates to tackle a big project and will go to great lengths to achieve their goals. I am always inspired by their passion and am so grateful for all of the assistance they provide. I can't imagine our community without KTMB keeping it beautiful!
Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful	169363		/users/profile/224441	Urban Warrior	Advisor	5	09/12/2013	I have worked with this organization on and off for several years and I have seen it grow exponentially within the last few years.  KTMB has provided and continues to provide much needed services in an area that relies on a healthy tourism economy to survive.  
Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful	168248		/users/profile/223133	Leo H.	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	I was directed towards KTMB based on a project I envisioned for the Washoe County Leadership Academy.  There were several people at the county who liked my idea but wanted some way to make it happen.  KTMB was suggested as the best route to make that happen. It the intervening years now, I have learned much about public volunteering.  I have learned that there are hundreds of others in our area who also have my passion for maintaining clean public lands and open space and that, as much as I do for this group, there are many others, particularly Christi Cakiroglu and the staff at KTMB whose efforts and energy keep me humble and give me a bar to rise towards. Through their many efforts, directly and with other non profits and companies, they do a tremendous job in keeping our region cleaner than it would be and to facilitate and produce meaningful projects with real results to all of our residents and visitors' benefit.
Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful	167095		/users/profile/150621	CarlW	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	I started working with Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful (KTMB) as the County representative on their illegal dumping task force (seeks to end illegal dumping, particularly on public lands).  I am still involved in that task force, but have assumed a broader role as a facilitator and enabler.  What impressed, and continue to impress, me about KTMB is the dedication of their staff to make a difference in our community.  KTMB staff selects projects of value to the community, and that triggered both me and my wife to volunteer for KTMB sponsored events to help clean and educate our community.  I am really impressed with the "range" of volunteers who are attracted to KTMB events in order to clean our community.  Volunteers range from high school students, to young professionals, to 4 wheel outdoor sports enthusiasts, to families.  KTMB provides value to our community.
Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful	110648		/users/profile/150621	CarlW	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/24/2012	As a professional code compliance supervisor, I was invited to help Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful seek ways to reduce unlawful dumping on public and private lands.  I continue to work with KTMB towards this goal, and we have taken major strides towards educating the public about unlawful dumping, informing enforcement officials and judges about penalties for those caught dumping, and (most importantly) significantly reducing unlawful dumping.  However, the goals of KTMB are much broader and I was truly impressed by their community outreach, enthusiasm, and dedication - so I have volunteered on several occasions to clean up areas and assist with Christmas tree recycling.  KTMB fills a unique role within our community and without them our community would be a poorer place to live.  Thanks to KTMB, its staff, and their enthusiastic volunteers.
Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful	166942		/users/profile/221794	Jeff62	Volunteer	4	09/04/2013	My wife got me going with volunteering with KTMB after she had been connected to them for years.

In the past 3 years I  have enjoyed working on community clean ups, recycling programs and tree planting projects as a coordinator. The staff and volunteers are wonderful to work with and I can see an immediate visual benefit for the community - less trash, more trees, nicer parks. As a landscape architect having designed many area parks it is very concerning seeing the lack of upkeep and vandalism. KTMB provides volunteers for park maintenance to show that local residents care about our parks and open spaces. Additionally they coordinate with volunteers from businesses for adopt a park and adopt a spot, further expanding their reach into the community.

For me and my family,  we chose KTMB to contribute financially, to volunteer our time and to encourage others to support as well and will continue to do so for many reasons.  1) It's a cause that we all benefit from; 2) It's an organization that is run lean and healthy; 3) the staff and the board of directors are clear in their mission and their role in our community; 4) KTMB is sincere in their appreciation for the volunteer time and other contributions they receive; 5) their events and their message are consistent, which makes it simple to share with others.

Although we may be small in numbers, we are mighty in service!  Not only are we helping so many children, as well as families, we are also helping ourselves to be better people.  There is nothing like the great feeling of putting a smile on someone's face, or even watching another volunteer smile because of what she/he  has just done.  To top it all off, the lasting friendships developed through volunteering with Assistance League Las Vegas is the best.

Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	179148	1	/users/profile/235788	Katerina8	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I am a retired eye surgeon, and I love working with Operation School Bell and helping to clothe yearly8,400 needy children here in Las Vegas, Nevada.  We also donate Kindergarten and first grade bookswhich we wrote, over 16 titles, to at need public schools.  We donated over 70,000 free Pocket Bookson many different topics, in Spanish and English.  We donate Memory Boxes to the neonatal andobstetric units for the families of stillborn and the unfortunate premies who don't survive.  This givesthe family a lovely baby gown, memorial pendant for the parents to keep, blanket, memory book, etc.This fills a need for a burial gown, etc.   We donate stuffed bears for police and fire units to give toscared and traumatized children.  We are involved in so many wonderful projects it is difficult to nameall of them.  This is a great organization.  I am a member of the Desert Sage Auxiliary, we are the unitwhich meets at night.                                                                         Kathy Mahon MD
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	179147	1	/users/profile/235785	Dots4611	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I am starting year 9 with this wonderful non-profit and never cease to be amazed at the incredible programs that so benefit our community.  Being an ALL-VOLUNTEER organization is the reason I was first drawn to join.  All of our financial and in-kind donations are mainly geared to dress children sent to us by the school district - 8,100 in 2012-2013!  In addition to our membership, we get so much help from companies, schools and the general community, which enables us to honor our commitment to our programs.  Also, the friendships I've made are the icing on the cake and one of the rewards.  
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	179146	1	/users/profile/235784	beckettmom2	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	Being a small part of a very large organization is gratifying in so many ways: dressing school children Tuesday through Saturday one-on-one with such warmth and caring, delivering the bears to over 30 organizations who provide caring and support to children in distress, providing new clothes to 37 schools to have on hand items that may have been soiled or beyond wearing right from their AL's Closet when needed is a great project that impacts so many students as well as school staff and parents.  These are just 3 ways that our members help the children of Las Vegas, as well as the community at large.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	143630		/users/profile/190094	Jeanne-Marie	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I am a retired teacher and I missed the children until I found out about Assistance League of Las Vegas.  I knew of the Operation School Bell but did not connect the two until I went to a meeting and discovered just how wonderful it was.  I have been volunteering for over 2 years now and will continue as long as I am able.  It is a total delight to see the joy on the faces of the children when they are able to pick out new clothes, many of them have apparently been dressing is hand-me-downs exclusively.  Their tales of where they live and the family circumstances would break your heart.  Last school year we clothed 8,101 children and we are on our way to at least that many this year provided we do not run out of funds to pay for the clothes, school supplies, books and other items we donate.  I am so delighted with all they do and what a lovely bunch of ladies they are.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	143571		/users/profile/190029	prettygirl	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I have been a member of ALLV since 2009.  I have met the most caring and devoted women. We have dresed over 8,100 children in 2011 thru Operation School Bell. Make a Difference Day we collected over 37,000 books to be delivered to Clark County Schools. I am very proud to work with such a dedicated group of women.  They are trying to make a better life for these children to aspire to.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	143513	1	/users/profile/189969	DeniseMehocic	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I have been involved with one of thier programs Operation School Bell for 5 years. Last year we dressed 8,101 children with brand new clothing, shoes, health kits and school supplies. Our organization is 100% volunteer. I heard recently from a manager at Office Max (one of our community volunteers) that 97% of all funds raised go to the children that we service. There is no organization to my knowledge that has that trck record. we also have Assitance League Closet which 47 local schools have a budget and we buy items of clothing that they keep in a closet and clothe emergency cases. We have a reading program at a local school. Kids on the Block is a educational puppet program that adresses bully, hadicaps and etc. Layette Program that provides layettes to low-income expectant parents at the county hospital. Our bear program provides stuffed teddy bears to traumatized children  These bears are given to police, firefighters and other groups that deal with these children.  There are many other things that this group does as well and this group is awesome.

I find raising money through running a Thrift shop is a lot of fun. Our money is used to help support our Operation School Bell. The program provides new clothing to children whom our school district has sent to us. We also participate in Kids on the Block, a puppet program for third graders. this program discusses timely issues, such as bullying, divorce, and disabilities.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	143305	1	/users/profile/189749	jbell5	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I have been a member for 16 years!  This organization is extremely efficient and well run by all volunteers with no paid staff!  All donations go directly to our programs.    Operation School Bell provided new school clothing to 8,101 children in need last year!  The children are transported to our facility by the School District where they are assisted one-on-one by a trained volunteer to select their clothing and other essentials.  We also provide an opportunity for non-member volunteers from the community to help us clothe children, and they find it a most rewarding experience.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	143249		/users/profile/189689	Patricia50	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I consider it a privilege to be associated with this organization and to work with women who generously give of their time and talent day after day to help Assistance League meet its mission of enhancing the lives of children in need in the Las Vegas Valley.  Being a member is is a big commitment...the work can be hard and the hours long, but the rewards are many.  I'll never forget the first shift I worked in Operation School Bell helping a child "shop" for new clothing who said he had never had anything "new" before and when he learned that he could choose any shoes he wanted you would have thought it was Christmas morning!  The smile on his face, the thankful hug received and the sense of pride I felt in knowing that I helped make that happen...that's what Assistance League is all about!
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	143074		/users/profile/189505	lcyen	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I love this organization and all the great ladies who volunteer here.  We served so many children  and families in need.  I feel a sense of pride to be a part of this great organization.   What I give is small compare to what I get back in return;  friendship and a sense of belonging.   I also learn a lot being  with this diverse group of ladies who are smart, dedicated, driven and giving.   If you are looking for a place where you can make a difference,  this is the one to join.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	143050		/users/profile/189476	jopops	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I have been a member since 2003. I never knew the rewards involved with giving back until I joined. Wow there is no greater experience. We do Operation School Bell and the school bus arrives and children from first to six grades show up and these children come in and we try on brand new clothes and we supply them with 2 brand new outfits including underwear, socks and one new pair of sneakers. They get a healh kit, school supplies a book and lunch. When children are homeless we get their sizes and we make a package of all the things that I listed above and they are delivered to the school. We give memory boxes to parents who have lost their child at birth. We deliver books to the schools that are written in english and spanish so the children can take home a book. Our group are all volunteers and no one gets a salary except the janitor. We have a thrift shop and the funds we get go toward all programs. After one operation school bell one of the boys I clothe was on his way back from the bathroom said to me "Thanks for buying me these new clothes". You can't buy that feeling of making a child happy. I am so proud to be a member.

Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142774		/users/profile/189220	Jamcc	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I have been involved with The Assistance League of Las Vegas since 2009.  I have never worked with ladies so giving of themselves. Every aspect of the Assistance League is to enrich the children's lives of the Las Vegas area.  From the School Bell, Thrift Shop, Puppeteers, Bears program, Desert Sage, I could go on and on of the many committees of the Assistance League that are working for the Las Vegas children. The moment I walked into the Assistance League I knew this is where I wanted to give my volunteer time to.  Everything is so well organized.  You can see the genuine care these ladies give to these children who have less. This organization has made great differences in the lives of children in our area. I am proud to be a member of the Assistance League..
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142630		/users/profile/189108	kmkm61	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	The Assistance League of Las Vegas clothes over 8,000 poor local children a year through Operation School Bell, and it has many other wonderful efforts.  As a member of the night-time portion of this group, we make and donate Memory Boxes to local hospitals for the families of premature infants and other babies who die in early infancy so that their family has a lovely gown for the burial, a pendent to bury with the infant and a memory book for the family.  The group also has written sixteen bilingual Pocket Books which we donate by the tens of thousands to local public schools so that the kindergarten children own a book which they can read with their parents.  We give the nurseries at the local public hospitals health kits  for the new destitute mothers to take home so that they have a thermometer, baby blankets, and urgently needed necessities.  We donate Shadow Buddies to the local Pediatric Oncologists so that children with newly diagnosed cancer can see what is happening to them, and then take the dolls with them for Show and Tell and to take to the hospital with them.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142629		/users/profile/189107	mitchjc	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I have been involved with the Assistance League of Las Vegas for 5 years as a member of the evening auxiliary. This dedicated group of women, all volunteer, serves children and families in need in the Las Vegas area having clothed over 7000 children through Operation School Bell, donated over 80,000 Pocket Books to needy children in our local district schools, donated more than 200 Memory Boxes to families that have lost a baby at birth through area hospitals, donated clothing items to needy schools, and provided cuddly Bears for first responders to distribute.

Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142618		/users/profile/189102	Margo T.	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I have been a member of the Assistance League of Las Vegas since 2008, I found the League at a very down time in my life, having lost purpose. I walked into a family that provided not ony purpose, but friendship. The organization has such a diversity of programs that it is easy to become  happily over-envolved. I participate in School Bell, clothing thousands of needy children. I was able to help set up the first  (of nearly 40) Assistance League Closets in Elementary Schools, providing quick clothing needs for children. My favorite project in the Assistance League is being a " Kids On The Block" puppeteer performing  meaningful skits on social issues and disabilities to third grade school children. It is highly rewarding organization that contributes greatly to the Las Vegas community.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142547		/users/profile/189029	perronks	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I have been a member of Assistance League's Auxiliary (smaller night-time group) but under the same umbrella since 2000.  I love this organization, both the chapter and the auxiliary.  Our part of the group provides "memory boxes" to area hospitals for grieving parents who lose an infant at birth.  The boxes contain a blanket, a handmade burial gown and bonnet, a book on grieving and loss (English and Spanish versions) and an angel pin for the mom.  We donate approximately 200 of these boxes per year.  We also write, illustrate, and print our own copyrighted little books that we call Pocketbooks.  Some are story books, some cover a concept like numbers or colors, and some are for the very earliest readers.  This year, we will donate 90,000 of these little books to high risk schools. The women work extremely well together as a group and form very close bonds.  Come join us!

Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142479		/users/profile/188952	Bobbie Ann	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	I'm so proud of being a life member of the Assistance of Las Vegas.  We are an all women volunteer organization, which provides many needy school children of Las Vegas with two sets of new clothes, new shoes, school supplies, health kits, underwear (6 pairs), socks (6 pairs), a grade appropriate book, and many extras; everything is new; our Operation School Bell area is like going into Target.  Many of the students have never had new clothes, so all their faces light up with smiles and many ask "Are these mine to keep or are these just for me?" The students are sent to us through our school district.  Another program we provide for the the students of Clark County is The Kids on the Block, where two sets=four women go into schools throughout the county and put on puppet skits for third graders.  They perform many skits, such as ones on divorce, learning disabilities, blindness, cerebral palsy, ADHD, bullying, etc.  After each skit the third graders can ask the puppets questions regarding the skit.  At times the questions become very personal.  ALLV is the greatest!!!

Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142465		/users/profile/188937	Gretchen Papez	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	The Assistance League of Las Vegas has profoundly impacted thousands of lives for both children and their families through  our signature "Operation School Bell" to literacy programs, community outreach and Angel's Assistance programs,  The first time I volunteered with Operation School Bell (helping children from at-risk schools choose new outfits, coats, shoes, socks and other items), I saw firsthand the need we were fulfilling in our community. One of the most memorable moments was a child who tried on the new clothes over his existing clothes because he was homeless and with little room in their car (and for warmth), they wore as many clothes as possible.

Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142461		/users/profile/188935	CWarman	Board Member	5	11/25/2012	I am proud to be on the Board of the Assistance League Las Vegas. Following is a synopsis of the outreach programs we provide to the children of Clark County Nevada:	The Assistance League Las Vegas' mission is to implement programs and services that enrich the lives of children in need.	Assistance League Las Vegas, a 501(c)(3) philanthropic organization, was organized in 1976 as a chapter of National Assistance League. We do not receive any funding from our national organization. We do not receive government or United Way funding. We rely primarily on corporate and foundation support.	Assistance League of Las Vegas is composed ENTIRELY of volunteers.	Last year, 480 members volunteered over 37,000 hours to help children in need in the Las Vegas community.	We have several programs addressing the needs of children in our community.	Operation School Bell provided new school clothing and other necessities to over 8,100 homeless and economically disadvantaged school children this past year. Without this program, these children may not have had adequate clothing to attend school.	Assistance League's Closet, our newest program, is an on-site clothing closet, established in at-risk, low income schools, confidentially providing new clothing, underwear, socks, shoes and toiletries to children with immediate needs. We have closets in 37 at-risk schools.	Our Bear Program provides teddy bears to firemen, police and other first responders to children in crisis. We delivered 3,600 bears to these agencies this past year.	The Kids on the Block Puppets provide skits on issues of physical, emotional and cultural differences to third graders. Issues like divorce, bullying and ADHD are addressed in these skits. Puppeteers performed skits to 6,500 third graders. In summary, I feel that we are very much deserving of being named one of the top nonprofits for 2012.
Assistance League of Las Vegas Sanford & Co	142459	1	/users/profile/188932	paulwarman	General Member of the Public	5	11/25/2012	The Assistance League of Las Vegas clothes school children (designated as needy by the Clark County School System) in grades K-8 with new school appropriate clothing.  This provides a child with clothing so that they are not embarrassed to go to school. Along with clothing there is a health kit and school supplies given each child. Other activities of ALLV include Kids on the Block, a puppet show with moral teaching, Assistance League's Closet where they have clothing should a child have an accident or other traumatic incident during the school day and need clothes.

ISchool	316567	1	/users/profile/407804	Writer	Client Served	5	10/29/2016	My sixth grade daughter has hated school for as long as I can remember. She began attending ISchool in Reno two months ago and told me immediately that she liked it - what?!? Her whys: It's quiet, she gets one on one attention from the teacher as needed and was given the independence and latitude to create her own elective course. She's moved from 'hating' math to finding it 'not that bad' - and has moved up two grade levels in math in this short amount of time. Her teacher understands her strengths, builds on her weaknesses and gives her the added confidence she needs to *want* to learn.

My daughter had struggled in school for 6 years. Even with an IEP she continued to fall further behind. In May, I made the decision to pull her out of public school and enroll her at ISchool full time. I could not be happier with her progress in the few months she's been going! She is excited to learn again. She comes home everyday beaming and proud of herself for what she has accomplished. I can't wait to see what the future holds for her at ISchool.

He arrived in middle school with an A in all subjects including math. After repeatedly asking for help at the public middle school and getting nowhere, it ended with my son passing 8th grade algebra. However no-one told us. He was told to repeat the grade and only when sitting for the exam was he told he had already passed and was not to do the exam!!! I turned to I -School for catch up on the Geometry he should of taken in 9th grade. I could ill afford this yet it proved to be amazing. This way of learning for his style and he has excelled. This has restored his faith in his ability to learn and grow as a scholar.

ISchool	270000	1	/users/profile/358724	Dale20	Donor	5	10/30/2015	My son has learning difficulties. The local private school couldn't help us; the public middle school's individual education plan program was terrible; and homeschooling was better but put a strain on myself and my wife. iSchool changed everything. Not only did Kathryn Kelly convince us that my son didn't need an IEP or special needs classes, but my son actually may graduate high school 6 months early, and with a few college credits to boot! The key was one-on-one assistance when needed, a wider variety of courses than offered by the public school, and lots of encouragement.

My son is home schooled and has benefited greatly from Ischool. He has had many courses that interested him that were not offered on a local level, (Archeology and Latin). He is currently enrolled in the local jumpstart program that offers high school and college credit during his senior year!

ISchool	231531	1	/users/profile/295110	EveMcNeil	Client Served	5	10/31/2014	ELearning Cafe truly fills a gap in the educational field, for non-traditional students, those who are outside of the system due to full time musical or sporting activities or who are interested in specialized subjects, or who are advanced beyond their grade level.  We homeschool our six children in Northern NV and eLearning cafe provided tremendous support last school year, 2013-14, for my two oldest.   My children rehearse and perform with a musical group at least twice a week so we needed flexibility and accountability with their schoolwork.  On a nearly daily basis, Brigit & Tim went in to work at the eLearning Cafe in Reno on their Math courses, ALEX and APEX, which were two programs recommended by eLearning Cafe. We would not have known about these particular curriculum otherwise and we're delighted with the results.  The 13 year old was able to move from remedial to advanced by completing 3 levels (6th,7th, & 8th) in ALEX math in one year.  It suited her personality because the day to day work is independently directed by her interest in the topics and it offers multiple explanations for every concept. The 15 year old took Honors Geometry, and still remarks that the Trigonometry introduced last year is his favorite subject. He did extremely well with his homework and tests. Again, it was independent progress based on his schedule and motivated by his own desire to learn more about the topic because it was well structured and presented.    The only difficulty I can think of is that  eLearning moved locations mid-year because they were trying to find the best place for their program. They were unsure about the future here in Reno because it was hard to get the word out about the resources.  That was unsettling as a client, but it worked well for us the whole year and I think it's just a matter of becoming better established and well known.   Both eLearning locations we spent time during 2013-14 were lovely study atmospheres. They were accommodating and well designed - holding good hours, having plenty of computers & printers available, and hiring knowledgeable staff to supervise and answer questions.  I also noticed how respectful and attentive the eLearning staff was towards the students, which goes a long ways with teenagers, who require sincerity and authentic conversation with adults. E-learning staff answered our texts, calls, and emails promptly - anytime of the week, sometimes late at night, on holidays, or on weekends. From both the parent and the student perspective, our participation with eLearning Cafe was entirely positive.  I wish eLearning Cafe the best of success and hope they expand to help the growing population of students who seek an education outside or beyond the normal system. I will certainly use them again if we have the need.  Eve McNeil Reno, NV

The teachers were always there to help me with any problem I may have had. They were never too busy for me even with all the other students they were teaching. I was able to get one on one time with the teachers, which helped me immensely. I'm not very self motivated, but they always kept me on track. Kathryn Kelly was there for me every step of the way during my 3 years studying at iSchool.  I was able to take courses that interested me instead of the basic courses offered at the local high school. It was refreshing to want to learn because I was taking a class that I liked, compared to taking a class just because I had to. The learning atmoshpere iSchool provides is outstanding, and I was always happy to be there. I would highly recommend iSchool, especially to young ones with a variety of learning styles.

I appealed to the California Department of Rehabilitation for re-training; and through this process I became approved for vocational re-training.The choice of facilities for my re-training was selected as the eLearning Cafe in Incline Village, Nevada.The process of my vocational re-training (which involves transition from PC to Mac computer use, then instruction in Adobe Illustrator) has begun. I cannot say in words well enough to describe from my  heart the acceptance I have felt of myself as a new student, as well as the cooperation of the staff, and the understanding and compassion of my situation and  welcome I have felt to be involved in the community of learning here. It is a challenge to plunge into the world regarding computer/learning technology at my age; and it is a challenge that is intimidating, even frightening for me as one who has not had to invest in this conceptual coordination ever before.  Yet, here, I am held as one who is equal and is held as a pure student, for which I am grateful.I trust myself here.  My new learning is safe here.  And I will become excellent here. Thank you.Beth Cayce

There have been several times when youve helped us get information about how the Washoe County school system requirements work (or dont work) and got answers for us to questions that we were struggling to get on our own through the school district. Even though it wasnt your responsibility to know, you made it a point to find out what the requirements were and got our online course accepted by the high school- something that we hadnt been able to do ourselves. That was just one example of how you have always been willing to go the extra mile for a student to help ensure their success. I wish all educators exemplified this type of passion and accountability. We will continue to look the the eLearning Cafe for our childrens special needs and recommend you to everyone we can. Keep up great work! The note listed above was sent last year when our daughter was finishing her high school studies.  She was struggling mightily with the social aspects of high school and just being "different" is enough to be disregarded by her peers if not outright bullied.  She's now a freshman at UNR, studying Chemistry and excited to take her first steps in the adult world..  She's a bright girl with great potential but, as we all know, potential is not enough to succeed.  It often "takes a village" to raise a child and I continue to regard Catherine and The e-Learning Cafe as one of the most valuable resources available to help the youth of our community take flight and soar.  The level of support, caring, creativity and tenacity on behalf of the e-Learning students always comes through loud and clear.  We owe Catherine and the e-Learning staff a huge debt of gratitude for their tireless efforts on behalf of our kids.

I have watched them grow from being quite shy and elusive to very social and playful, learning to trust their humans. What a joy it is to have an animal that wouldn't come near you a few years ago, come running over and push their way past others to give you kisses and get attention.  To have them come near and be relaxed on their own is awesome. Great work!

We've helped to make new and larger enclosures and recently had the extreme satisfaction of being there when animals were moved into the new enclosures and a new pack member introduced. The work that Bill does, tirelessly is beyond what any 1 person could be expected to do on a daily basis. The animals love him beyond what words could ever describe. The friends we've made thru the US Wolf Refuge are lifetime friends and meeting up with them at the refuge to make it a better place is one of the most rewarding things we could do.

The United States Wolf Refuge stands out in that the dedication to the animals who reside there.  The wolves and wolfdogs are animals which would NOT make good pets. Had they ended up in a shelter they likely would have faced death. Instead, they live on acreage, most having several acres to roam with other wolves or wolfdogs. Some share the home of the founder, and two are ambassador animals, traveling to help educate the public about the plight of wolves and the need to protect these magnificent animals. All are loved. All will live out their lives protected and cared for, and those of us who are fortunate enough to have contact with them have had our lives enriched beyond words. A great organization.

The first time I went out to the Refuge I was amazed at what I saw and how much Bill loved these beautiful and amazing wolves.  While I was living in Arizona  I would go out to the Refuge and help out.  My very first introduction at the Refuge was to a pack of 3 wolves that Bill had rescued from cruel owners who had removed the wolves voice boxes.  Bill let me into the enclosure with instructions to sit down and not look them in the eye;  let them come to me.  Within a few minutes, the big Alpha male came and laid his head in my lap.  I had been accepted by the Pack.  Fast forward to 2010.  I had reconnected with Bill and paid a visit to the Refuge now located in Nevada.  Wow!  It was a new and wonderful place and a new home  for the many wolves that Bill had rescued.  I saw first-hand the work he has done for these loving animals and how devoted he is to them.  While I was there I got to help take care of them and I loved every minute of it.  
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	278970	3	/users/profile/368990	Brittany48	Volunteer	5	02/03/2016	The United States Wolf Refuge is located on over 100 acres on private remote property and is a safe haven currently caring for 18 wolves and wolfdogs. This organization is dedicated to providing extensive education to the public about these wonderful creatures because they are so misunderstood. They work very hard to make sure that the animals are properly taken care of. No one receives any administrative expenses, all work is strictly volunteer. They do need help with funding, so I help immensely with fundraising for the facility. If it wasn't for this sanctuary, many animals would have been put down because not everyone knows how to properly care for an animal that has natural instinctive behaviors such as a wolf or wolfdog.

United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	227661		/users/profile/291391	Comanche	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I have known Bill Chamberlain and been a volunteer at the United States Wolf Refuge for almost 10 years now.  I met Bill while trying to save the life of a high content wolf-dog that was surrendered to an animal shelter where I volunteered. Bill was able to accept Voyager at the refuge and once I saw the facility and understoof Bill's passion to help these animals, I was hooked for life.  I consider myself very fortunate to be able to work with these animals and help at the refuge with whatever I can do. Because of alot of perseverance and hard work by our dedicated volunteers the refuge is finally everything that we imagined it could be.  Bill always places the animals first above any of his own needs. He is the most self-less person I have ever had the honor of knowing.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	227546		/users/profile/291278	baronette	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	Bill is a "one-man" ambassador for the wolves. He has dedicated his life to this purpose. I have known him for at least 20 years when he had his small sanctuary in Chino Valley Arizona. He has never wavered in his belief that these magnificent creatures deserve a safe and loving home. He and his volunteers continue to do a remarkable job in spite of sometimes negative reactions and lack of funding. Bill deserves this award.Claire WaitePrescott, AZ
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	227343		/users/profile/291071	eas.stein	Donor	5	10/27/2014	I have known Bill for 45 years as a caring, dedicated and selfless individual.  I remember when he started his mission in Arizona and I can say that Ive never seen anyone give as much of his life to a cause than Bill.  He cares for his wolves as he would family, for that is as he sees them, his family.  The wolves are well taken care of and every dollar received by the refuge goes for their well being. I cannot think of a much more worthy recipient of an honor of this greatness than Bill Chamberlain and his United States Wolf Refuge.   
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	227176		/users/profile/290906	amber.polo	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	Bill Chamberlain is a vocal ambassador for wolves. His clear views on wolfdogs is a message all wolf and dog lovers need to hear.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	134713		/users/profile/180592	mdoyle	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Thanks to Bill and his outstanding dedication and care, these beautiful and noble animals have a safe, loving home!  Bill, despite his own personal health struggles, has continued to provide love and sanctuary and has shown what true compassion is all about.  His dedication has been an inspiration to the wonderful volunteers as well, as they have braved snow mud and rain to make the journey to his place.  I can not think of a much more worthy recipeint of an honor of this greatness than Bill Chamberlain and his United States Wolf Refuge.  
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	131251		/users/profile/176809	londa	Donor	5	10/30/2012	Doing a great service in educating people about hybrid wolfdogs.  It is not a job it is a passion and Bill Chamberlain and he leads by example in the work that he does.    
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	131142		/users/profile/176687	leapin	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	As rescue coordinator for a shelter, I put out a plea for a wolf hybrid that had come into our shelter.  I was contacted almost immediately by the US Wolf Refuge and was very impressed by the professionalism, knowledge and dedication of this group.  Transport was arranged easily and quickly, and follow up has been forthcoming and informative.   Bill Chamberlain is an expert on wolves and wolf dogs, and has taken the time to speak with me at length about the breed and the nature of the Refuge.  The staff that I communicated with were also extremely knowledgeable, helpful and professional.   I am very grateful for the work they do in support of the wolves and hybrids.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	131111		/users/profile/176651	kimack	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2012	I work as a volunteer for another shelter who received a wolf hybrid in our shelter.  They were excellent in their advice and instructions as to how to handle him and what we needed to do.  We arranged to get him to their facility since we were in no way capable to handle this type of animal.  They were professional and quick in their responses and in their arrangements to receive the animal.  This was very important since we were dealing with an animal that we had no experience with and did not know how to properly handle him for his and our safety.  It is wonderful that there are facilities who have the knowledge to pass on to help keep the general public safe.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	131058		/users/profile/176591	barley	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I became involved with the US Wolf Refuge in Feb. 2011 via an email asking for volunteers as the Director had been diagnosed with cancer and no longer had the energy to clean kennels and feed the pups everyday.  He needed to undergo treatment.  I am happy to say Bill has recovered, but a bad situation led to a good one for me-allowing me to work with this wonderful organization.  Bill has given his heart and soul to these animals. His energy is amazing and he never stops!!  I can't keep up with him.  I so enjoy seeing and playing with these animals every week.  It is about an 80 mile round trip for me to get to the refuge with some of the driving on dirt roads-it is so worth it!!!  As every rescue sees there are so many abused animals.  Bill has an amazing way of getting them to love and trust humans again.  The pups get to howl with no one complaining-I love driving up and hearing them howl saying HI!!  It is incredible.  There are many work weekends organized throughout the year and so much gets done and once people come out and see what a great place it is they can't wait to come back.  This is a wonderful organization and deserves the recognition of the work that has been done and continues to be done.  I am happy to give my support to the US Wolf Refuge.  Lorna Corkery
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	130507		/users/profile/111833	Shaggy	Donor	5	10/28/2012	I always loved wolves and donated to US Wolf Refuge for some time before I had the pleasure several years ago of meeting Bill and one of his furry friends. I have always been so impressed with Bill's dedication to educating himself and exploring ways to help the wolf, plus his commitment to educating the public about these gorgeous animals. Bill gives his all for these animals and never thinks of himself. This organization is so inspiring to everyone who visits or volunteers, I recommend it to everyone. I have encouraged family and friends to donate to this organization and if I were able, would definitely volunteer. It is soooo worth it.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	130292		/users/profile/110171	Trish S.	Volunteer	5	10/27/2012	I saw Bill from time to time at pet festivals and Earth day, but got to know him when he gave a moving and informational presentation on wolves at the local Nevada Humane Society. I volunteered to work at the Refuge. The Refuge is in a gorgeous, remote mountain setting. Wolves have different sized enclosures. Some have partners, others don't. The Refuge is  well-organized with a thorough orientation for volunteers. They know each wolf as an individual -- behavior, likes and dislikes, history. So with some you go right into the enclosure to clean up, give water and food. With others, you need assistance. The schedule allows some wolves to run in a larger enclosure most visits, so they get exercise and play time.  Bill, who has become a dear friend, has given his life to his animals. He will travel anywhere to pick up a wolf in need. He also provides much-needed education on these beautiful creatures who are so disastrously misunderstood.  Each one is precious to him. He works long hours doing all the maintainence chores. He has a corps of volunteers, but still works long hours himself. Bill gives so generously of his support  for other animal advocacy issues in the community; he is a role model for us. The Refuge needs and deserves more funds for upkeep. Drive down the winding trail and you will be greeted or sent off by a chorus of howls -- the primeval wolf  howl --   This is an animal rescue with heart, caring and soul. It is unlike any other. Please give them your support.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	130192		/users/profile/175652	navjag00	Volunteer	5	10/27/2012	Our family has now done two work weekends at the refuge and can't wait until we can go back.  Our kids - 18 and 15 - especially love the chance to work and play with the animals there, knowing that they are really doing something useful.  Bill, Tami and the other volunteers are an amazing group.  They are friendly and helpful, and they keep us hopping.  Bill's love for the animals shows in everything he does.  His knowledge is amazing and he works tirelessly not only in rescuing and caring for them, but in meetings and educational opportunities the dispel the "bad press" that wolves often get.  Our son has been so impressed with his time there that he has worked to arrange for Bill and Kaysa to come to his high school so that other students can learn about the refuge.  It is a never to be forgotten experience.  Come "run with the wolves."
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	129796		/users/profile/175207	forever	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	I know Bill Chamberlain personally, also when the United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center was located in Arizona, and since it located to Sparks, NV.  I can honestly tell you that this organization does an amazing work, and that the Wolves are loved and well cared for,  that not only does Bill Chamberlain, the President of this organization, use all of the donations for the welfare of these magnificant animals, he use his own funds for their welfare also.  No one need ever worry that the donations go anywhere except to save these animals and to educate the public regarding these wolves.  I personally recommed this organization as one most worthy and most needed in the United States of America.  I am happy to give my name in full support of this organization.  Gloria P. Clements
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	129356		/users/profile/174724	Patrick McLaughlin	Donor	5	10/25/2012	I have never met a more dedicated man to a cause then Bill Chamberlain is to the United States Wolf Refuge.  The man literally spends his entire life on these Wolves and Wolf Dogs that come under his protection.  He works tirelessly at giving them the best "home" that they could possibly wish for.  He has a dedicated staff of Volunteers from far and near that are always ready be there when he needs them.  These people come to help in what ever needs to be done.  Bill does an amazing job of directing these people, so that he gets maximum results from all their efforts.  Bill travels endlessly, to places hundreds of miles away from the Refuge, to rescue animals that are in need of his attention.  He also spends time trying to educate the general public about the truth, regarding the Wolf.  Stories like "Little Red Riding Hood" have only made the general public afraid of Wolves.  This type of story just adds more to the ignorance of the uneducated people in the world.  Bill trys in every way to dispel these myths.  I cannot think of a more deserving person then Bill Chamberlain to receive an award for his role with the United States Wol Refuge. 
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	129196		/users/profile/174559	Bobbie5	Donor	5	10/25/2012	I have known Bill Chamberlain for many years, even before he founded the U. S. Wolf Refuge.  He has always been willing to put in many volunteer hours to help efforts to reserve and encourage  preservation of wildlife species, particularly wolves.  As founder and director of the now defunct Preserve Arizona's Wolves that worked to restore the Mexican Gray Wolf to its historic habitat, I spent many hours at hearings, meetings and other activities connected with the reintroduction project in the Southwest, and can think of no one more deserving of this nomination for his work in founding and administering the fine fine work at his refuge in Sparks, NV.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	37795	3	/users/profile/38493	rick-mcewan	General Member of the Public	5	05/01/2010	I was immediately impressed with the personal concern the volunteer staff had for the care of all the wolves at the refuge, and especially founder and director Bill Chamberlain, who gave tirelessly for their needs.  On my visit, it was easy to see Mr. Chamberlains emotional commitment to the refuge.  Less obvious to a visitor, but none the less present was his financial commitment.  Upon interviewing staff members, I learned that much of his personal wealth had gone into the care of these remarkable creatures, from their food and shelter to the enormous outdoor enclosure he had undertaken to build.I was not only impressed with the cleanliness of the facility, the large numbers of volunteers that helped with all aspects of the wolfs care, but also Bills future plans for expansion.  If I lived in the area of Reno, I would also actively contribute my time to the refuge.  I therefore, without reservation, endorse the US Wolf Refuges efforts in obtaining additional funding for the continued success of providing the only hope for survival that most of these animals have.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	36341	3	/users/profile/35484	united-states-wolf-refuge	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/21/2010	I have been actively involved with the U.S. Wolf Refuge since 1984. Since that time I have personally interacted with every animal that has come under their care. It was a real struggle in the beginning but it is now a highly recognized charity all across the country. I have helped with their fund-raising, animal care, transportation, public events, and their education programs. I first got involved with them when I got what I thought to be a Norwegian elkhound - I later learned that it was a wolf-hybrid. Their assistance and knowledge was most valuable. In the years since then I have learned so much about these magnificent animals, and the various issues involving both wolves in the wild and captive wolves. This organization has saved the lives of hundreds of these animals, and educated literally thousands of people about the real truth concerning these highly misunderstood creatures. The results of their efforts has produced an organization that I am very proud to be associated with. Like virtually all charities today, their budget is significantly smaller than in previous years and the Green Choice Awards prize would be appreciated beyond words. They have no salaries and over 98% of their revenue is spent directly on the animals.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	36086	3	/users/profile/36877	triviawolf	Volunteer	5	04/17/2010	I have known Bill, and been associated with the Refuge for years. The care and concern for the animals under his care is his number one priority. Following that, Bill's passion is to educate people about wolves and wolf-hybrids, the Mexican Wolf reintroduction, and the other wolf-packs of Yellowstone, and Northern America. Whenever possible he spreads the word about the stupid, senseless slaughter of Wolves in Alaska's
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34922	4	/users/profile/35780	arizona	Former Volunteer	5	04/07/2010	We have been involved in animal rescue for 30 yrs.Bill was the very first 'wolfer' we ever met.This was right on time due to the fact that we rescued a cross unlike any other 'dog'.That was 14+ years ago.Many animals have passed through our gates.The only ones to ever leave were Curly,Stubby and Floppy.U.S.Wolf Refuge was good enough to take on this lifetime committment.What is truly remarkable is their education program.Wolves are not pets.The unsuspecting public too often purchases from an unscrupulous breeder.Bill has been active regarding the rabies issue,wolf release program and many other issues these animals face.Our first journey together was hiking many miles into the desert to investigate a horrible milling situation of high content animals.It is often like a bottomless pit but Bill never seems to 'hit the wall' like many of us in rescue do.Bill has also been very generous in sharing information and resources wishing for all good rescues to flourish.Why?Because it is about the animals and always has been.Much of his work has been out of pocket.I would encourage anyone to visit,volunteer and please donate to the refuge.As a community we can all help the work go on.No donation is too small.That is the easy part.Caring for the animals,protecting the public and educating,securing resources and giving the wolves a voice on a daily basis is the hard part.Please participate in keeping this lifetime effort going.Thank you,steph barsotti
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34609	8	/users/profile/35479	shellie	Volunteer	5	04/04/2010	Meeting Bill Chamberlain over five years ago changed my life. I volunteer for my local animal shelter and came across my first wolf-dog back then. He was young and had been surrendered to the shelter with euthanasia orders because they could not deal with what is normal for a wolf-dog. Meeting Voyager changed my life and saved not only his life but many more to follow. I felt the need to help with every bit of energy that I had. I became Bill's right hand person and jumped right in and began trying to help raise money and help with positive change. Raising money for our pack is not easy by any means. We fall into a very unique category. Most donors won't even consider helping. These animals are not wild life and they are not considered by many to be "pets". They are most definitely NOT backyard dogs. They are however, when understood, one of the most magnificent man-made misfits on this earth. If you are loved by a wolf or a wolf-dog, you are a very special person. Bill works harder than any man I have ever known. He puts in unbelieveably long days taking care of his animals and then his job...always in that order. His pack always comes first before anything! These animals adore him, respect him and always greet him with tails held high and alot of happy howling. I continue to fight along side him and look forward to many years of rescuing and helping many, many more wolves & wolf-dogs.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34572	11	/users/profile/35431	kati1	Volunteer	5	04/03/2010	In 2009, the US Wolf Refuge held its annual work weekend/camp out and I felt the need to attend. I've never volunteered before, in my entire life, and I felt the need to do what I could for these animals. I've always loved wolves and I've always felt they needed to be protected. I've gone from being someone who didn't stand up and have a voice, to being someone who never sits down and shuts up thanks to the refuge. They've given me a higher sense of worth and given me the knowledge that there is good in the world. These wolves and wolf dogs have become my world. I fight for them every chance I get. Having attended several events, I've seen the love that Bill gives the animals. He would endure famine and heartache for them and it touches my very soul. At the Sparks Marina we had an event and Kasa (our next in line ambassador) would not leave Bill's side, proving that she loved him just as much and he loved her. People would walk by and stare, which only increased as Kasa rose to put her front paws on Bill's shoulders and continuiously lick his face and nibble on his nose. I've had nothing but wonderful experiences with the USWR. These animals along with countless others are very much worth the time, effort and money they require to be saved.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34560	7	/users/profile/35419	christine7	Volunteer	5	04/03/2010	I rescue animals. Mainly dogs and cats for another non-profit, but I have been known to transport injured birds and 'possums to wildlife care facilities when I can.I love animals, pretty much all animals ('though some more than others). I have always been fascinated by by wolves, so when I got the opportunity to go to the US Wolf Refuge to join in a "work weekend", I jumped at the chance. The first night I heard the song of 16 wolf-dogs "singing" all at once, I was mesmerized. I kept going back for more, and learning more about these wonderful, mysterious animals.The US Wolf Refuge is more than just a place for abandoned and "troubled" wolves and wolf-dogs to find safe haven, it provides marvelous educational opportunities for visitors and volunteers, and the founder and staff of the refuge are ardent in our attempt to educate the public not only about the plight of wolves in the wild, but of the need to protect the habitat of all wildlife in order to allow them to live harmoniously with humans.The refuge itself is "green" with its use of solar and wind generated energy, and the reuse of materials which are discarded by others-- both individuals and corporations, in the fabrication of enclosures and housing for the animals. Money donated to the Refuge will go a long way to house and care for the animals there. We hope that someday the Refuge will serve as an educational center open to the pubic, enabling us to help others learn about the need to develop harmonious relationship with wildlife and the environment.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34537	8	/users/profile/35395	vino-tinto	Volunteer	5	04/02/2010	I first met Bill when I went out to see the animals at the refuge. I was there to see if I could find a suitable companion animal for my "Wolf Dog". His Brother had died of bone cancer. Junior and I walked all around the compound but Junior showed no interest in any of the animals. I left him to sit by the car and I went to speak with Bill.Since that first meeting and seeing all the efforts this man has put into the care and protection of his animals, I have become and volunteer and financial contributer to the US Wolf Refuge.  Bill goes far beyond anyone I have ever met, in the care of his amimals. That would include his driving all the way to Colorado to put one of his "Dogs" into a good home.  After much scrutiny of the people and the home he was delivering the "Dog" to. All at the cost out of his own pocket. Talk about time and money -- there is nothing Bill won't do for his animals.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34448	8	/users/profile/35297	tammy5	Volunteer	4	04/01/2010	I first met Bill and the US Wolf Refuge labor day weekend 2009. Since then my life has completly changed. First off I alway thought I was not a dog person, but after meeting the wolf/dogs at the refuge they have become my passion. What Bill does on a daily basis is above and beyond what any one person is expected to do for any animal.He has not only dedicated his life to the wolf/dogs in his care but has become a strong voice for all wolves and wolf/dogs on this planet.It is very sad to know that he will not always be able to help with these animals in the future to come due to not only the aging prosses but to the economy of today and the possible economy of the future. To see a non-profit like this refuge not succeed because of money woes is just so disheartning.Despite all that, I have seen so many people that would be willing to stand in line behind Bill to keep this Wolf Refuge going for years to come.Please know that what the refuge is doing is so very important to our world and should hopefully see expantion in the future to the free wild wolves of America.
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34444	8	/users/profile/35292	drags1	Donor	5	04/01/2010	The Sunday after Thanksgiving last fall ('09)I 4 wheeled my entire family and a few friends up through the snow in Northern Nevada to the US Wolf refuge near Reno, Nevada.     Bill Chamberlain and I work together ion the solar business, and he gave us an entire presentation about his 18 magnificent creatures. We were able to interact with a few; one in particular, Kasa,was an outgoing friendly, people lover.When you're next to these astounding specimens,the intensity of being 'in the moment' with them is overwhelming. Bill needs help; financial aid from the public to help feed and care for his brood. Everyone, please consider arecurring donation for these guys. They are so, so worthy of your support.Dennis RagsdaleReno, Nevada
United States Wolf Refuge and Adoption Center	34441	8	/users/profile/35294	den-mother	Client Served	5	04/01/2010	In 1988 when it became apparent that we could no longer keep our beautiful and beloved wolf-hybrid, we searched for the perfect home.      When we were told of Bill Chamberlain, then in Arizona, we contacted him and were impressed with his caring attitude. Bill accepted our Ginny and proceeded to find the perfect home for her.     When his facilities in Arizona became too small for this worthwhile project he moved to his present property in Reno,Nevada.     This property has proven to be a perfect fit for the animals he cares for, most for their entire lives.     Wolf-hybrids and wolves, as they mature, are often not what people expect and way too often need to be placed in a safe and healthy environment which the owners are unable to provide.     These magnificent animals fall between the lines of wild and pet categories, requiring special care for all aspects of life. And, in this endeavor, Bill is extremely dedicated.       He seeks only the perfect fit for adoptees homes, and continues to educate the public in hopes that someday there will no longer be the mis-representation of these magnificent animals as 'pets'.     The U.S. Wolf Refuge accepts 'pet' wolves and wolf-hybrids whenever the need arrives and provides for more and more of these magnificent animals in a way I have not seen in other places.     This is why I will continue to support and donate annually to them and request that you would consider this wonderful organization for your 2010 Green Choice awards.
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	225815	2	/users/profile/289568	David262,	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	Safe Nest has been an invaluable asset to Las Vegas community. As the city has grown, the need for assistance for victims of domestic violence has grown with it. County and state resources that offer aid are limited and in some cases, non-existent. Safe Nest is unique in the community as it offers a comprehensive range of counseling services as well as a much-needed shelter where victims can begin to plan the next steps of their lives in a safe and supportive environment. These services proved invaluable for a friend who felt she had few options while living with family members who had become emotionally destructive and increasingly, physically violent.

A family member once had to go to a shelter like this and found great strength in the support she received. Thank you for all you do. You save lives every day and I am especially thankful for the help that was given to my family member! https://topratingseo.com/

As a volunteer with the shelter's Children Program, I have witnessed firsthand the transformation that many of them undergo in its safe and nurturing environment. It is a privilege to be a witness to it.
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	306711		/users/profile/397998	anonymousclient1	Client Served	5	09/27/2016	I found Safe Nest many years ago when I was living with an abusive partner. I had nowhere to go with my son, we went to them. They helped us with confidential shelter and the case worker helped me create a plan. After completing our time with them we went through a transitional housing partner they had.  Safe Nest was the first step to helping me get on my feet and I'll forever be grateful for them and the work they do.

Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	305262		/users/profile/396505	kkobzoff	Volunteer	5	09/18/2016	I have been involved with SafeNest since January, 2016 as a volunteer advocate at the shelter. Maybe because the residents are going through a difficult time in their lives and are in crisis mode, I was expecting to find a gloomy, somewhat unkempt place, thinking perhaps that their broken spirits had extended to the surroundings. I was in for a big surprise! I found a well organized institution, kept very clean and tidy by the residents, where they are accountable for their behavior and their assigned rooms and duties, who have to participate in group therapy sessions regularly and must inform the staff of their departure/arrival times at the location. The staff is great at resolving differences among the residents, who then have a safe and peaceful environment to concentrate in getting well. The organization provides them with room and board and assists them with different matters (finding a job, a place to live, therapy, etc.)  It is truly a safe nest for abused persons and their children, a breather for mostly women where they can go to put their thoughts in order. I am a fan of the organization!

I used to think these things until I lost someone I love.  Anyone that is being abused mentally, physically, sexually or in any other way needs to know that it is ok to ask for help.  If you need to help or even if you just want to get some information please give Safe Nest a call.  Safe Nest is truly saving lives!

Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	304263	1	/users/profile/395431	Angelica L.	Board Member	5	09/13/2016	Safe Nest assisted me in obtaining a restraining order against my abusive ex-boyfriend 4 years ago. Since then my abuser was sentenced to 7-16 years in prison, mandatory lifetime parole, and must be a registered sex offender. Not only did Safe Nest help save my life, they assisted in saving his future victims lives as well. I have since become a proud board member for this fantastic organization that helps victims and survivors of Domestic Violence at all levels. Safe Nest is a community partner in eradicating Domestic Abuse. Our staff, volunteers, and board members take pride in their work, while handling our clients with confidentiality, empathy and care. 
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	225815	2	/users/profile/289568	David262,	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	Safe Nest has been an invaluable asset to Las Vegas community. As the city has grown, the need for assistance for victims of domestic violence has grown with it. County and state resources that offer aid are limited and in some cases, non-existent. Safe Nest is unique in the community as it offers a comprehensive range of counseling services as well as a much-needed shelter where victims can begin to plan the next steps of their lives in a safe and supportive environment. These services proved invaluable for a friend who felt she had few options while living with family members who had become emotionally destructive and increasingly, physically violent.
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	304245	1	/users/profile/395418	JGanley	Board Member	5	09/13/2016	Safe Nest is doing the critical domestic violence prevention and protection work needed every day in our growing city!  It is  on the front lines day-in and day-out, and is staffed with long-time dedicated,  compassionate, and good people of Las Vegas.  I have been so impressed with all of those involved in this non-profit organization since I joined the Safe Nest Board of Directors two years ago.  It is such a worthy cause and such a good organization.  I encourage anyone looking to get involved in a volunteer role or looking to donate funds to a great, worthy charity to consider Safe Nest.

I've had the pleasure of hearing some of the testimonials from women who had nowhere else to turn except for Safe Nest.

Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	226205	2	/users/profile/289945	mamasjoy3	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2014	I knew of this organization growing up because my mother would donate items and money. As a little girl I didn't understand the importance or significance of Safe Nest in the community, but my mom did. As an adult, I now understand the importance and am grateful that Safe Nest has had the longevity it has. I personally know many (yes, more than one) women that Safe Nest has helped. I have also had the pleasure of attending a couple events to benefit Safe Nest and I must say that they have both been very classy and to the point. In a perfect world there would be no need for Safe Nest but until that day comes I take comfort in knowing that this resource is available to my community!!!
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	225781	1	/users/profile/289533	naymikekris1	Board Member	5	10/23/2014	I have a sister whom was a victim of domestic abuse; consequently her children were victims of sexual abuse.  She was older than me, and I didn't know how to feel other than it was horrible to watch her family suffer.  I'm older now and not quite so ignorant about the devastation of this disease or epidemic.  In fact, while I thought my sister weak, I know now she was the ultimate champion for she and her children survived because of agencies just like Safe Nest.  Her scars remain but they serve as a reminder that without Safe Nest, she and her family may not have survived.

Safe Nest provides the needed shelter and safety for victims fleeing a violent relationship.  While in shelter, the agency provides all basic needs including food, clothing and personal care items. Not all victims need shelter.  Safe Nest also provides needed counseling,  legal advocacy and case management for victims who still need assistance dealing with the aftermath of violent relationship. Safe Nest is an United Way accredited agency.

Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	225402	1	/users/profile/289178	AngelicaMarie	Board Member	5	10/23/2014	I am a proud Board Member of Safe Nest. An organization that assisted me in escaping my abuser a few years ago. There was a time when I felt alone, scared and didn't know where to go. A friend of mine encouraged me to call the Safe Nest Hotline. That call very well saved my life. Safe Nest assisted me in obtaining a restraining order against my ex-boyfriend and put me on the path to survivorship. I immediately knew that it was an organization that I needed to be involved with. To help others that were in the same alone and dark place that I was in find the same path that to a better life.  Our organization is the largest most comprehensive non-profit agency devoted solely to domestic violence issues. Our volunteers are the heart of our organization they donate their time, patience, and a listening ear to our clients. Our staff is exceptional and the reason that Safe Nest has been successfully assisting and serving victims of domestic violence for almost 40 years.  I have been a board member for a year and I could not be more excited to be part of an organization that has an active board of directors that takes pride and passion in the cause and organization . I look forward to many more years of serving this organization and our clients.

As a professional service provider, I receive many requests from nonprofits to serve on their boards; however, I choose to serve on the Safe Nest Board not because of a request, but because I truly believe in its mission and programs - to eradicate domestic violence in the Southern Nevada community and beyond. Safe Nest is the largest and most comprehensive domestic violence organization in Nevada - I want it to always be there to protect and stand in the gap for any friend, family member, colleague or other person that is or has been a victim of domestic violence.

Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	135258	1	/users/profile/181124	elizabethholman	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	The work Safe Nest does for victims of domestic violence is essential. Clothes are given to those who leave with just the clothes on their backs, children are given toys in the midst of crisis, and light is given in otherwise grim conditions. The resources provided for those suffering and the empowerment they receive from participating in all of Safe Nest's programs are beyond measure or price. I am proud to volunteer at Safe Nest and witness the good that emanates from such a hardworking group of individuals. 
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	135129	1	/users/profile/180998	JGuia	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I am currently a volunteer for SafeNest. I work with the children at the shelter. This has been a wonderful adventure in my life thus far. I love watching these children just be themselves; this is something they do not get to do very often. The childrens coordinator is so wonderful. She is truly wonderful with the kids and you can tell that she makes a difference in not only the children's lives but the mother's as well. I am so thankful that this non-profit is in exsistence. I am glad that SafeNest is making a difference in the lives of domestic violence victims.

Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	135017		/users/profile/180884	Alyssa I.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Safe Nest is by far my favorite non-profit in Nevada and the most rewarding volunteer experience I've had anywhere.  When I decided to get involved I selected several causes about which I was passionate and researched the different organizations with available volunteer opportunities.  I was impressed with Safe Nest as a whole and particularly their thorough volunteer training program, followed by the many different types of volunteer opportunites afterward.  Safe Nest is a strong, sustainable organization to which I can be proud to give my time and resources.  They are highly organized, maintain great volunteer communication and make each experience fun and memorable.  I have really enjoyed the variety of ways I can lend my support to victims of domestic violence, and I have come to see Safe Nest and my family of fellow volunteers as an irreplaceable part of my life.  I look forward to many more years of making a difference with and for great people!
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	121331	1	/users/profile/165087	mactgirl	Volunteer	4	08/23/2012	I got involved with safe nest because of a domestic violence incident I witness as a teenager. I felt uncertain about what I could do to help. Then when I got older I read a book that had one of the main characters volunteering at the women's shelter and it got me to thinking back to the day of the incident. I decided right then I wanted to do something positive as opposed to sitting on the sidelines waiting for someone else to figure out what to do. I really enjoyed the training it was very thorough and very interesting. I would like the fire, passion and commitment of this organization to continue to grow stronger and become more deeply rooted in the entire community it serves as well as becoming the leading national example of what and how to do it when it comes to domestic violence advocacy for victims and their families.
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	121265	1	/users/profile/164993	English Rose	Volunteer	5	08/22/2012	I gained interest in becoming a volunteer with domestic violence victims after becoming starting community outreach dahn yoga classes. I found the orientation program to be well thought out and expectations outlined clearly. I have been supported by staff to bring the yoga and energy meditation classes to this community, especially for PTSD victims. I have seen improvements in focus, smiles & ability to relax during classes. The support & encouragement given by staff to attend is tremendous, especially with scheduling days where child care is more readily available, and times that do not clash with other activities.
Safe Nest, Temporary Assistance for Domestic Crisis	120892	3	/users/profile/164492	Heather AF	Board Member	5	08/17/2012	As a child, I witnessed domestic violence.  When asked to be a board member of Safe Nest, I did not hesitate.  Safe Nest is the most comprehensive organization in southern Nevada providing services to victims of domestic violence and education for abusers.  Safe Nest has several undisclosed locations where victims and their children can stay for a night or months depending on their situation.  They offer a hotline manned 24 hours, emergency protective order filing assistance, advocates, counselors, etc.  They accept donations of cash and inkind assistance.  They also have a contract with Savers to sell donations, not designated for the shelter, to support the operational budget.  This is a worthy organization.  I am happy to spend my time and energy to help Safe Nest to continue to provide services in southern Nevada.

I am just blown away I just wanted to talk to people in the pig community to share information.

She sincerely loves all the pigs and goes above the call of duty to help nurse them back to health,find loving homes, teach them that humans can love. I can't say enough good about this organization.
VegasPigPets	157692	3	/users/profile/209128	Victoria O.	Client Served	5	05/12/2013	I found Vegaspigpets on Facebook and visited it daily as we already have a Potbelly Pig and I wanted to learn as much as I possibly could about Potbelly Pig Care, maintenance and training, from a Trustworthy, Experienced source. Eventually over the year, our attention was drawn to Pumba, the poor rescue pig that had issues with his eyes that eventually led to a surgery requiring his eyeballs be removed. We followed Crystal's efforts to raise money for his surgery, she kept everyone posted on Pumba's recovery and she spent Long Hours dedicated to nursing Pumba and giving him the Best Post-op care. We wanted to Adopt Pumba into our family!! We live in Mississippi! We were approved as a home for the placement of Pumba, yet still faced tackling the issue of getting him from Las Vegas to MS!! Crystal was tireless in raising money to arrange a flight and van rental, in order for us to get him here. Thanks to Crystal and her Wonderful Vegaspigpet Supporters, she was able to raise the funds to allow us to get Pumba safely in our home!! When Michele got to Vegaspigpets she found the property to be a Wonderful, Safe place for pigs!! They were all Healthy (right down to the White Teeth! ha ha), Well Behaved with wagging, welcoming tails. We informed Crystal that Pumba would be an "indoor" pig... she went the extra mile of bringing Pumba into the house and spent HOURS crawling in and out of the pig door to train Pumba Not to be afraid of it. She spent HOURS teaching a Blind Pig to use "manners" like sitting before he gets a treat and to take it Nicely when he does receive his treat!! Crystal was Very Thorough with feeding and care instructions, in regard to Pumba. Naturally we were required to sign a contract insuring that we had a proper Veterinarian for him, we would keep him in a safe environment, care for and nurture him and in the event it didn't work out, he would be returned To Her! It also goes without saying that she insisted on updates and made herself available to us at all times, in the event we had and questions or concerns. He is the Perfect Love of our lives!! We HIGHLY recommend you select Vegaspigpets as your PBP destination (if you live close enough to do so) ..... I'm not sure Crystal could do the long distance adventure again to save her life!! ha ha ha ha Vegaspigpets is a CLASS A operation and we will continue to support this operation through as many donations as possible! 
VegasPigPets	116755	1	/users/profile/158913	Theresa16	Client Served	5	06/27/2012	This is by far my favorite Pig charity/sanctuary.  When I was having trouble with my pig, Crystal called me and tried to help me save her.  Unfortunately, I was unable to, and most of the issue was through my own fault.  Even after I lost my pig, Crystal and Vegas Pigs took me in and helped me with my grief recovery.  I have seen Crystal go out of her way to help people, share her knowledge and put everything she has in to the Piggies!  I admire this Charity and Think Crystal is amazing.  Not only am I willing to donate to this charity, I have quite a bit!  I would/ and have suggested this charity to anyone thinking about, or has a pig.  If/when I get another pig, I will feel more confident with VegasPigpets help!

There were many things we were not prepared for, but she helped us get our property ready, both inside and outside, in case we wanted to ever let the pig into the house.  We did not realize how smart they were but with Vegaspigpets help, we are so happy to have welcomed Wilbur into our family!  We had a lot of questions and Crystal was there for us every step of the way!  She even gave us his favorite bed, blankets and food to start us off!  We feel very confident Wilbur will have a very long and happy life here even being first time pig owners!

VegasPigPets	103833	5	/users/profile/138968	In it for the pigs	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/18/2012	VegasPigPets has been instrumental in saving many pigs through education, donating funds, rescuing from shelters and homes and other means. They are available night and day with any issues that arise helping pig owners to take the best care of their pets. As a fellow sanctuary, I am outraged that a breeder can come in and cause so much discord for people who are working to make the lives of pigs better at their own expense. Breeders are in it for the money not the welfare of the animals. And this particular breeder is even more dishonest because she claims to be  a non profit and takes much needed funds from true rescue non profits.  
VegasPigPets	103691	8	/users/profile/138731	BadKarma	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/18/2012	Crystal provides an invaluable service to the rescue community and  has for a long time. Many of us have dealt with her on a personal as well as professional level for years and can vouch for her credibility, love for pigs, kindness and generosity. She goes well beyond the norm when it comes to assisting others and educating and most of us would love to have her energy! One lone detractor in Florida and her misled minions are trying to undo the good that VPP has spent years doing. It is apparent from some of the reviews (see Roseecakes..."clothes" surely means close??) that this detractor is asking either children to write reviews or semi-literate adults who have no knowledge of the pig rescue/sanctuary community. This detractor was invited to join a pig rescue list after posing as a rescuer. Advice was offered BEFORE her pigs became pregnant as to ways to separate the males and females to avoid pregnancies. MONEY was given to her and accepted by her for the purpose of neutering her males, which she never did and had no intention of doing. Separate from the rescue list she joined, she bragged on FB about breeding. She can do that  but why did she lie about her plans to the rescue community? From her first posts on the list, it was apparent she was looking for a fight and has very real emotional issues. She has repeatedly lied about HER non-profit status and being registered as a LLC. People should give no credibility to her negative reviews about VPP as she is a lone detractor with an ax to grind. Crystal called her out on her lies and she became angry and is now bent on destroying the wonderful organization Crystal has worked hard to establish. This woman claims to be a Christian but I know many non-Christians who behave in a more Christian-like manner. It is truly bad KARMA to engage in the activities she has and it is hoped that well educated and well intentioned people will look beyond the negative reviews that have been posted and continue to help Crystal and VPP do the wonderful work they do for many more years. We in the rescue/sanctuary community support Crystal and her efforts! 
VegasPigPets	103689	6	/users/profile/138725	Pigasus	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/18/2012	Vegas Pet Pigs is an excellent informational organization for all prospects of the Potbelly Pig.  It is also one of the few Tea Cup Information that has 100% correct information on it.  I would recommend this site to anyone who is considering purchasing or RESCUING A MUCH LOVED POTBELLY PIG. Crystal has spent Thousands of Dollars on getting ordinances passed in Las Vegas so that the potbelly pigs there can remain with families, plus Dollar after Dollar of other peoples Potbelly Pigs for spay and neuter and most of all Health Issues.

The rescue of pigs is wondeful and I was more than willing to donate.  However, when I found out (through following their facebook page) that they spend a great deal of time harrassing others who don't conduct business the same say, I was appalled. I even saw some of their owners/followerers/volunteers personally try to sabotage a fellow organization.  I must admit, I do not know much about the other organization as I do not live in that persons area, but their behavior was abhorent.  I will NEVER donate another dime.  These people are childish and petty.  I wish I could get my money back.

This rescue takes on cases others would not and in the end produces a highly adoptable pig.  Has very high standards for adopters.  Educational site on Tea Cup Pigs (NOT) is known world wide and used by many world wide.  
VegasPigPets	103650	8	/users/profile/138619	potbellyacres	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/17/2012	I have been involved in rescue for 16 years and run my own private sanctuary. I have found this organization to be an invaluable source of support both financially and educationally. VPP has helped with much needed funds for spays and most recently with a pig attacked by a dog. They are both professional and responsive to the needs of rescued pigs.  VPP is passionate about pigs and educating the public about these special animals. I can direct people to their website about teacup pigs and know their questions will be answered. Unfortunately, at times, when VPP exposes breeders who are posing as non profits, they come under attack but the truth is VPP is all about what is best for pigs and the truth will prevail. In this particular incident, I also attempted to discuss proper pig care with this breeder and she became very abusive to me and then dishonest. It's too bad the pigs are suffering because of her own agenda. I am still trying to find her non profit as she claims it to be and I can't.

So if you are such a great NPO and I highly doubt that, then mind your own business & try to take care of your pigs which you obviously do not love wholeheartedly as my piggies NPO does!!! PS~ Say No To ABORTION/MURDER!!!     Signed a very concerned Pig Lover!
VegasPigPets	103647	8	/users/profile/138608	homly1	Client Served	5	01/17/2012	I have followed VegasPigPets website via Facebook and online. They were of great help when I lost my piggy Harley suddenly and were an even bigger help/assistance when a friend of mine needed guidance with her pot belly piggy.  Like the saying goes "a picture is worth a thousand words".  Just look at the pictures posted on Vegas Pig Pets and read what Crystal is doing says it all....They are happy, cared for pot belly pigs..
VegasPigPets	103646	8	/users/profile/138610	robinmatos	Donor	5	01/17/2012	I've watched Vegaspigpets help so many pigs in need. Crystal's heart is just huge. She has taken in pigs that nobody wanted. Supposed teacups that were over 300 pounds that were discarded by people who thought they would stay tiny. Sometimes these pigs were being looked at by people who were going to slaughter them for food. She is a huge advocate for spay/neuter as well as the proper care and nutrition for these animals. I have been at her place and helped her load pigs that were hard to place in a home, but she was able to put into rescues that would give some of these unwanted pigs a forever home. She has driven them to California, Utah and Colorado. She's driven them when she had migranes so bad her face swells up.  She went to the Casinos here and got one of them to donate something like 5,000 comforters to her organization. She had to rent a storage unit, there were so many. She then called pig rescues to come and pick up FREE blankets to keep their pigs warm during the cold winter.  Vegaspigpets is an angel, she doesn't breed, she makes NO money off of these animals; every penny she has goes into the care of pigs. She finds homes for pigs and works with the new owners to make sure they have the proper facilities, food and love. She is there anytime they have a question or concern. She has picked up pigs that were used as bait for fighting dogs, pigs abandoned on the side of the road, pigs that were kept in a trailer for their entire lives and the trailer was over a foot deep in pig crap, pigs that couldn't walk because their hooves were so long, pigs that had been mistreated and were scared of people, overweight pigs that had lived on a diet of donuts and dogfood, skinny pigs that had lived in a dirt lot and weren't fed at all. Crystal of Vegaspigpets puts her money where her pigs are. She is passionate about these little (and many times HUGE) guys. She LOVES, LOVES, LOVES, LOVES pigs and is an outspoken activist for their proper care. Bless you Vegaspigpets for your deep devotion to these wonderful creatures!

VegasPigPets has always been the most loving, kind and supportive resource for all my Porcine questions.  Ziggy our 8 yr old female is not always in as good a mood as Pork Chop or Reggie...but with Crystals help we keep trying.  She is the BEST !!
VegasPigPets	103643	7	/users/profile/138601	Shaiming	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2012	Always eager to help others with questions and provides excellent information about pigs.  She takes wonderful care of her rescued pigs. I noticed a few very negative reviews which were clearly submitted by a breeder who was trying to falsely claim nonprofit status and her cronies. Thank you VPP for exposing this fraud!  I hope your courage does not negatively affect donations of time or money to VPP.
VegasPigPets	103637	8	/users/profile/138591	Honesty	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/17/2012	Vegas Pig pets is a well established organization and greatly respected by legitimate pig rescues/sanctuaries nationwide. Combined, there are well over 150 years of rescue experience in these sanctuaries and they absolutely know a good, HONEST organization when they see one. A newcomer to the pig world, not a rescue, but a breeder, is trying to destroy the reputation of VPP and its supporters. Educated people will see the lies for what they are and should not be influenced by one troubled person and her followers, who presumably know little or nothing about rescue/sanctuary work. Instead, they should look closely at the breeder and determine for themselves if she is honest about HER non-profit status. Research has shown that, despite her claims, she is NOT a registered Non-profit nor a legitimate LLC and is decieving contributors on FB. VPP is an excellent organization and has earned the respect of sanctuaries across the country due to honesty and integrity, hard work and respect for those of us "in the trenches"  
VegasPigPets	103621	9	/users/profile/138565	FranklinS	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2012	This organization is dedicated and has helped me many times with different questions and concerns I've had.  They go above and beyond in helping educate the public.
VegasPigPets	103614	9	/users/profile/138553	Jo J.	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2012	I have four Dogs that were strays, alone without shelter or food, But I myself am not willing to make the personal sacrifices it would take to start a non profit organization to help the neglected, unwanted or abandoned Pets in the world, And that is why I am so thankful for the people like Crystal with Vegas Pig Pets. I found this organization when I myself was concerned about the future and well being of a potbelly pig that my son and his girlfriend had purchased under false pretense. A breeder told them that this pig would max out at 30 lbs. He is now my pet and he is 70 lb. and may not be done growing. I am thankful for the helpful advice I have received from my new much needed friends. Thank you for the advice and for taking such good care of Gods Creatures.    
VegasPigPets	103608	8	/users/profile/138526	Tammy14	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	I have enjoyed spending my vacations in vegas and going with VPP to clip hooves and be a part of the educational side of pig rescue .I do rescue in Ohio and love to help other groups .This group has vet referances for folks and can help the owners solve problems with their pigs  They want pigs to be forever pets instead of the latest craze name as in teacup mini micro or whatever the breeders market them as . VPP can help you educate yourself and make sure a pig is the right pet for you !!!!
VegasPigPets	103601	9	/users/profile/138521	barefootrunner	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2012	This rescue is truly devoted to educating the public and rescuing potbelly pigs.

They are very friendly and have the best interest of the pig/owner. They will work with people on educating them on their pet pig so they all will live a happy healthy life together.  They update people on zoning issues in their areas pertaining to having a potbellied pig as a pet. VPP takes in unwanted pigs and tries to re-home them with people that are able to care for them.
VegasPigPets	103592	4	/users/profile/138509	GracieMae	General Member of the Public	1	01/17/2012	I have seen these people viciously attack and hound another NPO in the same field for ridiculous reasons, to the point that Facebook barred them from further participation.
VegasPigPets	103591	9	/users/profile/138507	Bill Sprocket	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2012	VegasPigPets have been helpful to any & all that have posted questions & concerns with their personal pets.  The information has been good & very helpful.  There are several Rescues on Facebook, just like VegasPigPets & they all respond to be helpful to us pet piggy children owners.  I would have no problem recommending to anyone.  They are on the west coast & I am on the east coast.  I am thankful knowing they are there & willing to step up.  Have wonderful information & awesome pictures.
VegasPigPets	103583	4	/users/profile/138496	KIAB	Advisor	1	01/17/2012	I would point anyone away from this group of people. They are completely crazy stalkers. They would rather abort piglets than deal with a liter.  They are unhelpful, unfriendly, rude and completely obnoxious. I would never ever do business with them. They even had their facebook page shut down by facebook due to slander and causing trouble. I've been told by peers that the owner of this organization is horrible to deal with. I will never do business with Vegas Pig Pets. Never. They are complete liars. This group never does anything in PRIVATE except try to round up minions to their secrete elite to spam pages and cause trouble. They never asked about breeding in private or public. It was sense that a male not fixed, thus breeding would happen accidentally. It was a true accident and never meant to happen. However, their response was to ABORT. We would never abort babies. Never. Because we didn't do what THEY wanted us to do, they black-balled us to everyone (causing them to be shut down and not us) They are a horrible organization and I can tell you that I've not been the one putting the complaints on here except for this one. I am not ashamed. I never took a damn dime to neuter pigs. That money from FARAC was paid to the vet and they need to get that back themselves. I am not doing it for them. You are complete liars and finally people are seeing the truth. I am so thankful for that. You cannot continue to lie to people. I have one document that needed to be submitted to the State of Florida. WOW, so that is sooooo misleading. You are complete liars. I never knew I had to PAY A FEE $10.00 to accept donations. Thank you for bringing that to life and TRYING to cause us problems. Didn't work. Try again. I will never stop helping abused or unwanted potbellied pigs. You might as well get used to me be around. I am not going anywhere. I hope you never win awards for your abuse and lies. You don't deserve anything. They TRIED to bring down the other organization but FAILED. 
VegasPigPets	103581	7	/users/profile/138494	jminshall	Donor	5	01/17/2012	VegasPigPets is a lifesaving organization to all piglets large and small.  Crystal not only takes in stray, abused or simply unwanted pigs but takes great care and time with rehabilitation and education.  I have followed many of her pigs from rescue to adoption and they have all become very human oriented, healthy and emotionally secure adoptable pets.  I LOVE this organization and this is one that I reccomend to anyone interested in either adoption or just simple education of the pig!!

Folks I have never seen such a small organization do so much, as they literally feed hundreds weekly. I visited them this week as they went out to feed and clothe in Las Vegas and the many they reached was incredible. Many large non-profits should learn from this one. I hope and pray that they receive a kitchen as they can reach thousand more. Pastor Noran continued success in the name of Jesus.

They seem to care more and reach out as this one does on street corners as well as there Charleston location. We were helped on Friday with an amazing man that was passing out cold waters and lunches on downtown Las Vegas. I just got my check on Saturday and have a great motel room with Internet and telephone. Many believe you choose to be homeless and by the grace of God I pray daily that I will never be in a situation like we were in. What a TRUE blessing His Love Street Ministries was to help with food and a one night stay in a mote. God Bless all that need a chance and a push in life.

I decided to adopt from a rescue and after researching several in Las Vegas decided on Vegas Shepherd Rescue. I filled out my application and made an appointment for my home inspection. Once approved I went to meet their dogs. I met and fell in love with beautiful boy who luckily for me had been returned. It was important to them to make sure he had the right fit so that this didn't happen again. They are very adept to the mental and physical anguish that some of these dogs have been through and are very careful with who they place them with.  They were there for any questions and concerns I had and always available for help and guidance when needed. Dexter has come so far and is a truly wonderful dog. A lot of love, training and understanding and these rescues make for wonderful companions. I can't say enough how thankful I am that they are doing what they do. I look forward to adding another one to our family soon and will definitely be going back to Vegas Shepherd Rescue when we do.

Well, after a couple of visits, we discoverd that beautiful dog was not a good fit for our family.  She was too playful for Hunter and he was not up to it.  The amazing volunteers used their exptertise and introduced us to a couple of other dogs.  The second dog they suggested we meet was Gatsby.  He went home with us that day and he is quickly making our home and family his own.  Thank you all for the amazing work you do with these beautiful animals.

I decided to rescue a German Sheperd at Vegas GS rescue, I met with Taz, a Sable colored young Sheperd. Taz was a stray, animal control was going to put him down. For being afraid... Seriously... What a bunch of a&$ holes at animal control. So I decided Taz and I needed each other as I was really hurting over Niko. Since Taz has been home with me (5 days) he is house broken, can sit and shake hands. He protects the back yard and house already. He just needed a place to call home. I feel blessed to have such a wonderful doggie. I ask my self who rescued who... Taz saved me in so many ways. Thank you everyone at Vegas German Sheperd Rescue.

However, she was also very picky.  She has responded well to Harper (Hobi/Indy) and seems to sense that it will take time for Harper to feel truly at ease.  She is already making herself at home as the picture shows.When we meet with the folks at VSR, we were impressed with their process and how much they love what they do and how much they love the dogs.  Thank you VSR so much for giving us Harper.

At VSR the dogs truly come first,  being no one is paid everything is truly for the dogs.      I'm convinced my dog( as of now) would of been put down at a city shelter if she ended up there, however VSR took time allowing her to de-stress and again when it was time for us to build the trust needed, knowing she has the potential to become an ambassador to the breed with just a little guidance. VSR is definitely in the same league as other world class organizations, if not starting a new league. Hopefully when its time to add another member to the pack, every dog would already have a home and VSR can close shop, however they will be the first on the list. Thank You to all of VSR and to everyone that adopts, remarkable!

Vegas Shepherd Rescue	279916	6	/users/profile/369847	Writer	Client Served	5	02/12/2016	We cannot say enough wonderful things about Vegas Shepherd Rescue!  They are a compassionate group of volunteers who have the utmost respect, love, and best interest of the orphans.  When we decided to adopt another German Shepherd (after the passing of our 3 year old shepherd due to illness), we needed to make sure the new dog was great with kids. We filled out our adoption application, had our home visit and spoke to several of the volunteers about the dogs at their events. We also checked VSR's Facebook and website regularly. The adoption coordinator, Shari, was extremely patient with us and was more than happy to introduce several dogs to us that she thought might be a really good fit. When she introduced us to Ducky, Ducky came right over and gave our daughter gentle kisses. We knew right then she was the one. Ducky is a wonderful addition to our family. She is loved very much and is "Queen of the castle" in our home.  She and our 6 year old daughter have a bond that is incredible!!  Our adoption experience far exceeded our expectations!! The volunteers are great!!! Thank you VSR for everything you do!!! We have met wonderful people through the rescue and highly recommend Vegas Shepherd Rescue to our friends and family!!! Keep up the awesome work!!!

We submitted our application, had a home visit the next day and a dog that afternoon.  We had picked out a few dogs to meet and ended up with one we had actually crossed off our list.  The adoption coordinator brought Roscoe out because she felt we would be a good match and boy was she right on the money!  That was 3 years ago....THANK YOU for saving these dogs and giving us Roscoe.

I discovered Vegas Shepherd Rescue and for the first time considered adopting an adult GSD rescue for her.  I could not have been more impressed with this organization! They truly care for each and every dog they rescue and have an amazing way of finding just the right deserving forever home for them.  I applied for and adopted Hailey (formerly Fila) and it was the best thing I ever did for Jordan and myself!  Hailey has  helped us more than she will ever know! Vegas Shepherd Rescue Rocks!

Working at the animal hospital, I see other rescue groups that don't do what VSR does. They truly care for these dogs as if they were their own. I rescued a dog from them almost 2 years ago, and he is absolutely perfect. Luke was an owner surrender and it took a long time for him to trust any one. The volunteers went out of their way to visit with him and bring him treats multiple times a day to gain his trust. They go above and beyond, and what more can you ask for when adding an animal into the family.

The rescue was a blessing to deal with - everyone so friendly and so helpful in helping us find a dog to give a forever home. When Tahoe (formerly Tonka) came out for his first meet and greet, we established a bond immediately and the rest is history. Tahoe is now living with us, in a loving home. VSR was fantastic throughout the whole adoption process. Tahoe joins our older German Shepherd and 2 human brothers who he absolutely adores.  The amount of love we have for this dog is immeasurable. Thank you VSR for all you do, to keep the doggies safe and find them loving, forever homes!

It will be 3 years in March that my husband & I had to say goodbye to Abby, our 14 year old Chesapeake Bay Retreiver. 4 years prior to her passing, we rescued a female sable German Shepherd, Cheyenne. I have never had GSDs before but have always loved the breed! My husband grew up with them. Once we lost Abby, our house was not the same. Cheyenne mourned for her buddy & it was heart wrenching to watch. So we reached out to VSR. With the help of Miracle Dog Network we found Beckett, now Ammo. Not only did we rescue one of the sweetest dudes out there, we have adopted new friends & a family in the group of volunteers at VSR. I have never met people so completely devoted to what they do. Watching them care, love & train these wonderful pups is truly one of the most beautiful gifts in the world. I'm proud to say my husband & I are now a part of this organization & have referred many a friend to adopt, foster or volunteer with VSR!! 
Vegas Shepherd Rescue	275173	5	/users/profile/364758	millielee	Client Served	5	12/30/2015	We adopted our first shepherd, "Sampson" through Vegas Shepherd Rescue.  The volunteer staff for the rescue are truly amazing and caring people who have only the shepherd's best interests at heart.  We were so pleased with Sampson that we adopted Mya about six months later.  Sadly, we lost our sweet Mya to illness.  I was contacted by Shari Dale at the rescue after Mya's death and asked if we would be interested in meeting another shepherd who needed a good home.  Shari and Jen told me they thought Amy's personality would be a perfect fit.  Caught in the grieving process, I was reluctant.  But, as soon as I met Amy I knew that through the help of Shari and Jen at the Vegas Shepherd Rescue, Mya sent Amy to us to help us heal.  My thanks and appreciation go to this amazing group of people who work so hard to give our furry friends a forever home.  Millie Lee
Vegas Shepherd Rescue	275130	5	/users/profile/364698	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/29/2015	I adopted a 5-year-old male shepherd from them last year.  VSR took him in when a local veterinarian contacted them asking for help.  An owner surrendered his dog to her after she refused to euthanize the dog for behavior issues.  VSR recognized that the dog was just fearful and poorly socialized.  They worked with him for several months, and when he was ready for adoption, my husband met him and he too saw his potential, so we adopted him.  This handsome boy now has a wonderful life, is loved dearly, and excels at K9 Nose Work.  My fellow volunteers are amazing and truly dedicated to the dogs they rescue.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this rescue to someone looking for a German shepherd!

Liking what we saw and learned, we applied to become foster dog parents which inevitably lead to what we are now known as... foster failures. We officially adopted our Mr. Hanky nearly two years ago and have since adopted our baby, Shiloh. Vegas Shepherd Rescue volunteers are committed, loving and generous people who treat each and every orphan as they would their own. Both my VSR "kids" are happy, healthy and just plain awesome and for that, we give thanks and 2 thumbs up to Vegas Shepherd Rescue!

My baby was abused & doomed to die at the shelter. VSR stepped in and gave her the care she desperately needed. They paid hundreds of dollars in vet costs and made sure she was healthy enough for adoption. I am still in contact with them. They love updates & always say that you can never send to many pictures! It was a wonderful experience & our family will be forever grateful for love & care that they gave us & our baby Adelaide!! 
PAL Humane Society	82010	1	/users/profile/89973	PAL-BOD_President	Board Member	5	03/11/2011	GUIDESTAR STATEMENT  	Wednesday, March 09, 2011It is truly unfortunate that the people who posted reviews in the last few weeks had no other forum with which to voice their concerns/opinions.  As the President of the Board of Directors (BOD) for PAL Humane Society, I will take this opportunity to address some of the issues stated in the reviews. Kathi Schlintz, founder/CEO started PAL 18 years ago with the intent to help animals.  During her tenure with PAL she has provided leadership which resulted in more than 13,000 animals being adopted and contributed not only her time but much of her own money to keep PAL running.  In the last year after suffering from the worst economic decline our country has had since the 1930s PAL was faced with many challenges which Kathi persevered through.  In addition to PALs challenges, Mrs. Schlintz was faced with many personal and health challenges, Kathi has been discussing retiring for the last year, and was actively looking for someone to take over and keep the PAL team going.  Kathi has been very introspective with the many statements made of late in the negative reviews posted here.  With her concern for PALs best interest and in light of her personal challenges, Kathi Schlintz has tendered her resignation from PAL Humane Society. As PAL Humane Society is a Non-Profit Organization, the Board is and has been the driving force in most if not all of the major decisions made for the organization.  It is regretful that some of these decisions did not pan out as planned, very often; even the best laid plans for a business are not successful.  We now have several new Board members, new officers and in light of Mrs. Schlintzs resignation, we have absorbed complete responsibility for the management of PAL.   The following changes have been made with regards to our operating procedures:  As President I will be overseeing the day to day operations and reporting to the BOD monthly on our progress.  In addition, I will be managing the Wrightwood Project which includes the property donated to PAL in 2010. The BOD will be responsible for fundraising and planning as well as staff/Human Relations/Public Relations/procedural/financial decisions.   Mary Shanks will be supervising animal services. (with final decisions regarding euthanasia coming from the BOD & recommendation from a Veterinarian)  Additional employees will be responsible for data entry, accounting, volunteers and our many programs.After extensive investigation both with physical records and interviews with staff the BOD found the following:   With regards to allegations of misconduct with animals;  No incidences of medical attention being withheld were found. (this was confirmed by veterinarian records)Total Intake for 2010 - 44 cats, 73 dogsSick/treated animals 2010 - 21 cats (some with recurring illness), 7 dogs; of these, 2 dogs treated at the hospital for parvo, the rest treated at PAL under vet recommendations. 2 of the cats were treated at the hospital, the rest treated at PAL under vet recommendations.  With regards to animals being euthanized without cause;1 dog and 12 cats (11- leukemia positive, 1-upper respiratory with very poor prognosis) were euthanized due to health issues. (All recommended by our veterinarian)3 dogs were euthanized due to temperament issues. (recommendation based on a consensus of animal professionals)  With regards to the Explorer Post;The BOD voted to disband the Explorer post as it was determined not to be within the scope of PAL Humane Societys focus.  Monies collected were absorbed into the general program fund.    With regards to the Herdina grant money being misused;During the audit in February it was found that in 2009 there was a balance of $3991.44 in unused/expired vouchers, this has been rolled over into 2011; in addition a balance of $5.35 was rolled over from 2010 into 2011s fund. (this has been submitted and confirmed by the Herdina grant coordinator)  The following will be available for public viewing at PAL Humane Societys Adoption Center/Headquarters Tues.-Sat. 10AM-4PM, located at 22148 Hwy 18, Apple Valley, CA 92307:    Monthly minutes of non-sensitive information from the Board meetings. (current year only)  Yearly tax records in the form of IRS 990 documents. (Also available on Guidestar) 
PAL Humane Society	72527		/users/profile/79288	Brian	Volunteer	1	02/22/2011	I was a former volunteer helping out a fellow employee that was , not to an extreme degree, overworked on weekends. I aided her countless times in a professional and timely manner. Dogs and cats alike were treated very well on the outside looking in. My review is more for the leadership of pals. From the moment I heard about kathi she was portrayed as a very cold boss. When I first met her I was not met with a greeting but a cold stare as if I was not wanted. My first instinct was to leave but the employees workload was very high and I personally had the time. As time went on I saw number of times the employee I helped come in tears from the reprimand kathi gave her. In all honesty I saw nothing wrong with her work ethics. The employee met and even exceeded her job. But it was never good enough because kathi seemed to have a personal vendetta against her. Even the other employees and volunteers understood it. My main point is that the management isn't what you would consider a management place. Instead of acting like a boss kathi and even some of the workers made it as a like based notion. Disregarding hard work but in turn if you were her friend you were treated with some form of respect. Pals mission is a great one. Management tactics must change for the sake of that mission or the ones who suffer will be the animals.
PAL Humane Society	71523	1	/users/profile/78068	concerned citizen	Volunteer	1	02/19/2011	This review is not being written with the intent to do harm to PAL.  It is intended to provide a volunteer's perspective and hopefully constructive criticism.    I have read all of the posted reviews and would like to make one thing absolutely clear.  I am writing this review of my own volition.   No one has asked or coerced me into doing so.  I have no ax to grind.  I have nothing to gain and nothing to lose.  Let me start by saying that volunteering should be an intrinsically rewarding experience.  There is no monetary compensation but we want to do it because it feels good to help others be they two-leggers or four-leggers.   However, I would have to give my volunteer experience at PAL mixed reviews.  This is due to a number of reasons.  First of all, I would like to express some positives.  I met some great people that also love animals and that gave 100% plus in their efforts to assist PAL with it's goals.  The Senior/Pet Connection program, in my opinion, is one of the most effective and impactful programs that PAL offers.  Livia does a great job keeping it organized and functional. With regard to the animals in PAL's charge, I never saw any that were mistreated, intentionally neglected, etc.  Staff members and volunteers kept areas as clean as possible and were affectionate with the animals.  I honestly believe that they were caring and compassionate caregivers that did everything in their power to give the animals a home away from home and a chance at finding a permanent home.  Getting animals adopted was exciting.  However, there are many areas that could use some major improvement.  One of my biggest concerns for the future of PAL is how resources are managed--both financial and human.  I don't have access to PAL's financial status, records, etc. so I cannot really comment too much on that area but I have many questions.  Is it really just a bad economy? What are the priorities?  Is there really transparency with regard to how funds are spent?  When there are limited funds, shouldn't the animals be the first priority?  I know there are long term goals for organizational development but sometimes you have to go back to basics.  In some ways, I think they have tried to do just that but there is a complete lack of focus.  It is onto the next big idea without thinking things through.  Unfortunately, that speaks to lack of leadership.  There is a vision but the follow through is weak.  There are people that love animals, are passionate about saving them, but are not equiped to be in a leadership role.  Which brings me to management of human resources.  Like it or not, it takes people to make an organization successful.  It would be impossible for one person to perform all of the necessary tasks.   When you have good people working for you, you need to try to retain them.  Turnover is costly in many ways.  It can be financially expensive, it causes problems with morale, it can really affect overall performance of an organization.  It is difficult to feel sorry for someone that complains about being shorthanded but makes little effort to keep people there.  I realize that there are constraints on a non-profit as far as being able to pay a competitive wage but there are other ways to keep people around.  One is showing true appreciation for their efforts and not using an authoritarian leadership style.   People need and want to be inspired to work for you.  Fear of reprecussions is not a good motivational tool and will eventually (if not swiftly) lead to turnover.   Another issue that I had a problem with was how the Herdina Grant was handled.  I don't know the financial details--whether there was or wasn't money in the account, etc.  I just know that there were people in need of assistance and they were given excuses not straight answers.  Many filled out applications, left messages, waited for a response and got none.  Why?  Why should they have to call back several times and not get some definitive answer so that they can decide what to do?  Dodging calls was a pervasive pattern.  And it was the volunteers that had to speak to these people over and over again trying to explain why they had not received a response.  I just got to the point where I didn't want anything to do with the phones.  This practice was not only ineffective but unethical and unprofessional.  That is why I gave this organization the lowest rating.  Unethical behavior toward clients is not acceptable in my book.  And when you see a breech of ethics in one area, chances are good that things are not as they should be in other areas.  As a volunteer with a conscience, you want to distance yourself from that whole situation.  In closing, I want to reiterate that this is not meant as a personal attack but it is difficult to address these issues without questioning leadership.  It does seem to be the common denominator.  Ultimately, that is where responsibility lies.   Leadership doesn't have to be warm & fuzzy but it needs to be effective.   And people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of how one feel's about them.  It is in the best interest of the animals.  I would love to see PAL succeed and have more of a positive impact on our community.  The concept is great but the execution needs a lot of work.   With the high number of negative reviews, one must lend credence to these concerns.  They aren't just disgruntled former employees/volunteers.  I personally observed many of them putting their heart and sole into PAL.  But there is only so much one can give or put up with before they have to save themselves.  Maybe that is what has happened to Kathi.  Maybe she is burned out or overwhelmed and needs to turn PAL over to someone that can breathe new life into it.
PAL Humane Society	70313		/users/profile/76860	Vanessa D.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/17/2011	I too was a former employee, and I can say I loved it there at one point. Who wouldnt enjoy the unconditional love received from the animals? But the unfair treatment from kathi to volunteers and employees was constant. Kathis treatment towards me personally was being talked down to, 'disciplined' in front of other employees, volunteers, and often customers. She would never pull me aside and talk to me about it, rather say whatever was on her mind no matter how rude or whoever was there. She was also this way with volunteers, speaking whatever was on her mind about them. in particular about 2 new volunteers that happen to be gay, saying that they would donate lots of money because of the fact they were gay.And the poor animals there, for about 2months there were mother cats and kittens in the so-called clinic not being given the proper medications when they were sick. Having to go in and wipe their eyes with a warm wash cloth so they could open their eyes to see and their nose to be able to breathe a little bit more comfortable twice or more daily was horrible. And the dogs being in a 5by 5 kennel 24hrs a day was mean and cruel as well.By the time the money came in and we moved to the new location the cats were finally tested and given their vaccines (which all of the kittens, ranging from 6months to 9months were never given)Turned out that about 15 kittens and one adult cat had come down with Leukemia. They were all put down. The kittens that were adopted before the money came in were never tested. when i spoke up and asked if i should call the adopters to bring them in to get tested i was simply told, "If they have it, they have it." And when volunteers employees and customers asked about them, they were told they were all adopted. All of that could have been prevented.And 2 sibling puppies were also put down because they were shy and timid around people. PUPPIES could be worked with, but instead were put down. And as for a dog named foxy which was a pit bull terrier was taken to the shelter and put down because she jumped fences! NOT because she was a pit bull terrier, she was AWESOME with other dogs, children of all ages, men, women, everyone. Not ever once gave a snarl but always a friendly lick to the face. She as well could have been worked with or have found the right home for her.Another dog the kraken was also taken to the pound and put down right after he growled at kathi as she stood there and yelled at him instead of backing away. By the way he was tied to the door in a corner eating when she came around the corner and startled him.And right away she told Mary that he needed to go, that no dog was going to growl at her. He too could have been worked with.I guess you can still call them a no-kill shelter since they only did the things that lead up to it and let either the vet or Apple Valley animal control do the killings.And I am no longer there because of how generous kathi is.When the money finally came in I was made full time again and I also found out I was pregnant. when I told kathi this she slowly started cutting my hours from 40 to 20, 10, 8, 6 and finally not working for 3 weeks straight. I did the same job there that Mary shanks did, and I was being told theres no work right now for my department. How was there no work when Mary would constantly come to me saying shes so stressed because kathi never lets her get her job done. There were always piles and piles of paper work on marys desk that could have been given to me. So finally after three weeks of not working I was sent a txt message saying for me to come in. kathi and Mary had a meeting with me saying I can stay on with the little work thats coming in or she can lay me off and I can collect unemployment. Of course she had planned the whole thing so I could only really have one choice. Its funny how she was telling me make sure I put on the unemployment papers that there was lack of work, not that I was pregnant. She made sure to tell me about 5 times....  Also no one should take the negitive reviews as in trying to shut PAL down, but as in trying to change the way its managed. Ive seen other comments as to we're trying to shut it down and we're going to hurt the animals. The animals are already hurting due to lack of care. The animals there can sense when were not happy, and in turn make them uncomfortable around us. So yes, we need to have happy employees and volunteers there to make the animals happy. So for all of those who said we're hurting the animals, we're not. We stayed as long as we could because we truly do love and care for them. But sadly one person seems to run us all off. All the negitive reviews are from people who actually spent time there, not just one day or came in to drop off a donation, so how would they really know whats its like there? Know the facts before you start throwing out that we want to shut PAL down. Because from my eyes we're the only ones who really seem to care about whats going on. Oh by the way, is that Wright Wood house given to PAL in a Will ready for rent yet? Or is it still being used for Kathi's personal get away?

It is slander of another in what you are doing.  When we treat people like this, then it shows that there is a problem, but not always with the people who are being criticized  There is a big world out there with so many different types of people and sometimes people do things that hurt us sometimes they seem like they dont care or can misunderstand the other.  Sometimes they might even do something on purpose that goes against the grain of what they should be doing.. but all of us have made mistakes in our lives you, me and everyone and to try and bring them down for any mistakes that they might have made is the opposite of my belief.   I like to try and help people up that is why I help the prisoners in the dog programs that I have started around the country because many of those prisoners did major things to hurt people.. and do I sit back and try and pull them down farther for all the bad things that they did in their life or do I go out there and try and do things to make their lives better so even if they stay in prison for the rest of their life, they might do something to help someone else while in prison. Perhaps you can take all this anger you have for PAL Humane Society and go out there and do something good for someone else to make a difference in other peoples lives because that wouldn't hurt this world. Things have a way in taking care of itself people change situations that seem negative get better all sorts of things change but the greatest change that we can make in this world, is to change our own selves to focus on our own lives instead of the lives of others who you might have had a negative experience with. I cant say that I have had the same experience as you.   I have been there to PAL many times I have helped them start their prison program and I have seen them take good care of their dogs If you really want to get upset in how dogs and cats are being taken care of, then go to Haiti, Africa or other countries where I have worked and see what is being done to them and what I have seen at PAL, is a caring group of people who are trying to make a difference in the lives of animals.. that is the main and most important focus that we should all live by.. Peace,   Sr Pauline Quinn op    
PAL Humane Society	69045		/users/profile/75451	Darlene Cunningham	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/16/2011	Lyingdog called all the other posts for Pal Humane Society a smear campaign.  A smear campaign implies slander.  Why would everyone here lie about their experiences?  What good would that do?  I understand that some of the situations presented by other posters many seem outrageous, even downright ridiculous.  Sadly, I know from personal experience and observation that this is not the case.  What you are reading happened and is happening.  Its true that PAL is currently run by only a few staff members, but hat has not always been the case, and the economy is not the only culprit.  People need to start asking questions!  Why is the turnover rate for volunteers and employees so high at PAL?  Why, after 18 years, is PAL still struggling so hard just to make ends meet?  Why has PAL had to move umpteen times in those past 18 years?  Why does mentioning PAL or the name Kathi Schlintz in many community and civic circles result in waves of hostility?  Why are there are so many disgruntled employees/volunteers.  Why is everyone so upset with PAL CEO/President Katherine Schlintz? Not providing wages owed to employees on posted date/time per the labor code.  Not providing legally required breaks to employees per the labor code. Expecting employees to work overtime without pay, and suggesting terminations would result if employees did not participate in unpaid overtime. Lack of training for employees assigned positions. Lack of guidance/support for volunteers. Misappropriation of funds including, but not limited to, grants, donations, bequests, program/membership dues, and fund-raising profits for specific programs. The belittling and berating of volunteers, employees, clients, and board members, both publicly and surreptitiously. Attempting to pit employees against each other through malicious untruths and gossip.   Attempting to pit employees against volunteers, and vice versa, through malicious untruths and gossip.   Attempting to pit employees against board members, and vice versa, through malicious untruths and gossip. Not providing appropriate/timely medical care to animals entrusted into PALs care. Blatant disregard for the dangers of animal overcrowding, particularly in regard to cats. Favoring cats over dogs in regard to intake for the adoption program. Unprofessional behavior including,  but not limited to, tantrums, the sharing of sensitive/private employee/board member/volunteer/client information with other employees/board members/volunteers/clients, the malicious discussion of former employees/board members/volunteers/clients with current employees/board members/volunteers/clients, blatant condescension toward others, and an attitude of entitlement. Not paying community businesses for services rendered in a timely manner, if at all.   Not paying rent in a timely manner, if at all. Badmouthing said businesses/landlords when contacted and asked to make payment. Constant project development and execution, including the spending of PAL funds, with little or no follow through. And the list could go on and on.  As stated by other posters, PAL was a great concept, and could have been a great organization, and its easy to get caught up in the idea that non-profits are run by saints who put the mission of the organization ahead of themselves.  However, without an accountable president/CEO or an effective board of directors, PAL Humane Society will be what it has always been  a half-assed attempt at something that is really no more than an ego boost for Katherine Schlintz.   And who bears the burden for this more than anyone else?  Not the mistreated employees or volunteers, not the stiffed businesses, and not the duped donors.  Its the animals PAL claims to be helping.  They are the ones who truly suffer.  Think about that before you donate time or money to this organization.  
PAL Humane Society	66456	1	/users/profile/72638	Pet_A_Cat	Volunteer	1	02/10/2011	I volunteered for PAL for 4 months during the spring and summer. I was so excited to find a no-kill shelter in my area and when I first started to work there, I was thrilled. At first I worked in the cat rooms doing the morning clean ups. For the most part, the cleaning was not a problem but the treatment of the volunteers was.  Any time one volunteer made a mistake, Kathi took it out on ALL of the volunteers. More then once I heard her threaten to let go of all the volunteers because of a mistake from one volunteer and she generally talked down to them. I did not get to really see how terrible it was until I started working in the gift shop, answering phone and assisting guests.We got a lot of calls  from seniors with sick pets and who needed help from the Herdina Grant. When we got these calls we were told to tell them that the program was on hold for now but would be back in about a month and to call again then. Other times they called because they already submitted an application for the grant and wanted to know what was going on with their application. We were told to tell those people that their applications were still being reviewed. We always took down the callers name and number and reason for their call so that Kathi could call them back regarding the grant. A few days later, they would call back, and tell us that Kathi never called and that their pet still needed vet care and they wanted a real answer.  Sadly, the volunteers who worked the phones could never give them the real answer  and all we could do was take another message for Kathi that would be ignored.  To this day I don't know why those people were never helped or why we had to keep running them in circles when they were in need of help, but it was a major factor in my decision to leave. 
PAL Humane Society	66253		/users/profile/72418	LyingDog	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2011	I've found PAL to be a very professional although sometimes hectic place of business.  I know that they have had hard times in this economy and frankly what Non-Profit hasn't...  From my point of view Kathi & Mary run PAL with a great deal of expertise.  Reading some of the posts listed (all in 1 or 2 days) it looks to me like a smear campaign designed by disgruntled employees.  How unfortunate since it appears that they all want to help animals  And that is, from my experience just what PAL does.  When there are only a few people running a very busy organization, there isnt always time for hugs, kisses and singing kumbia.  Real world, never enough time to do what needs to be done with any small non-profit.  For me the proof is in the actions, I dont really care if anyone likes the person running the place!  Are the animals being saved?  Are they cared for in a humane way?  Is money being spent according to non-profit rules?  The answer is yes to all of these things.  Dont believe it, just as them, all non-profits are public entities and as such are subject to public scrutiny. 
PAL Humane Society	66183		/users/profile/72345	cbdc3	Volunteer	1	02/10/2011	I worked at PAL with my wife trying to run the Explore program for Kathi after she asked me if I would like a job there as the Humane Education person and I accepted.  Any time that I asked for any kind of training and for direction I was told we need to schedule time and when I tried to schedule time I was brushed off.  Over the course of 7 months my wife and I donated well over $300.00 a month to PAL and none of the money we donated was used for what it was intended...this include money we donated for a friend's dog who passed away and we bought him a leaf on the "Tree of Life"...when I asked Kathi point blank about the "Tree of Life" she said that it was not her responsibility to finish this project as a board member started it so the board member should finish it...but when I asked her about where it was going to be put she said that she did not have time to deal with it right now she need to run to Home Depot to buy paint for the cattery.  So we donated money for a project that never come to be...what happened to the money?  If you look at my wife's post she has the emails that go back and forth between PAL and ourselves about the Explore program and it states that if we require a refund to make a request for one and they would ensure we received it...well almost a year later and still no refund.  People like Kathi are the biggest reason people do not go out into their communities and help.  She gives Non-Profits a bad name and disheartens many people who just want to help.
PAL Humane Society	65973		/users/profile/72112	4_the_love_of_dogs	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/10/2011	 When I first was hired at PAL, I was so excited to be working for such an awesome organization.  I thought I had finally found a place to work that shared my love for animals.  The concept of PAL was great, however, I soon found out that things were not as they seemed.  The entire organization is based on lies.  PAL continually asks the public for donations to fund programs that no longer exist.  The Education Program was a joke.  PAL boasted about having the first Explorer Post of its kind, however the kids were never given a chance to learn what the program was intended to teach themand then it was eliminated.  The Prison Program at the juvenile detention center and at the Federal prison was supposed to rehabilitate the inmates by teaching them to train the rescued dogs to make them more adoptable.  This program was only started so that PAL would be eligible to obtain grant money and the dogs never benefitted from the program itself since many times PALs own therapy dog and even employee dogs were taken into the facilities.  PAL also receives a grant each year from the Herdina Fund, which is supposed to be used solely to help low-income seniors with the vet care that they may not otherwise be able to give their pets.  For a year and a half,  people who requested the vouchers were lied to on a daily basis when they were told that PAL was out of funding for that program, but in reality, the funds had been spent elsewhere.  Staff and volunteers were treated horribly.  Donors and board members were/are kept in the dark about PALs finances and were always shown unrealistic budgets that were false.  If PAL is the only no-kill shelter in the High Desert, why were all the dogs put down when they moved to the new facility because they didnt want to house them there?  And if PAL is in such bad need of funding, then why are they hiring a larger staff, when they are far less animals now since they no longer house the dogs?  The only two services that brought an income to PAL (grooming and training) were cut out.  Why?  The staff went for weeks, and then months without pay, but continued to stay at PAL because of their love of the animals there.  But they were berated daily and expected to do twice the work without pay.  If they questioned Kathi about their pay, they were given the oh well attitude and brushed off.  Kathi (owner/founder) has continually falsified documents to hide the truth from everyone.  Any staff member or volunteer that got too close mysteriously got let go.  As you can read from all the previous comments, the public needs to take a serious look at PAL and how it is ran.  I think the owner has a few questions to answer!
PAL Humane Society	65773		/users/profile/71861	AnimalLover10	Volunteer	1	02/09/2011	I started with PAL Humane Society as a foster volunteer years ago.  Over the course of about 2 years I fostered dozens of dogs & a couple of cats.  While I was a foster volunteer I did not interact very often with the founder Kathi but with the employees of which were awesome.  The employees worked there tails off to make this organization work while Kathi was usually off shopping or coming up with some "new idea".  I was then offered a job with PAL, that I was very excited about even though I had been told about Kathi's attitude & the way she ran things.  I soon realized what it really meant to work for PAL & really got to see behind the scenes.  While I worked there full time I also always had a foster animal in my home and was told I still did not due enough even though I worked for free several times a week (as she did not pay overtime).  The employees who worked at PAL along with the volunteers had to come into work everyday hoping Kathi was in a good mood.  It was very common for her to yell & belittle her staff, as she says she isn't a people person so deal with it.  She has been open since 1993 but for all those years she hasn't been able to make PAL what it should be because she doesn't know how to run a business.  In 2007 PAL was given half a million dollars and the money  was wasted on renovating rented buildings that she decided would become such great things (they all sit empty now full renovated & were never used for what they were suppose to).  She would come in every week & have a new idea & just do it & spend the money without thinking about it.  She hand picked her board members so she could control them & what ever she says goes.  She did "lay off" the Humane Officer when she was on medical leave from giving her mother a kidney.  Her excuse was she didn't have the money to pay her but she turned around and hired somebody else at a high pay & gave her right hand man a raise at which combined was higher than the Humane Officers pay.  I wish the community could see what PAL is really like.  Yes they have helped animals & seniors but if the money had been used like it was suppose to be it would have helped so many more animals & people.  Kathi is a master at putting on a great face to donors & the public & then turning & doing whatever she wants with it.  I ask donors & the community to look at her & this organization carefully & really know what you are giving to.
PAL Humane Society	65765		/users/profile/71886	Kati T.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/09/2011	I worked for PAL for just 3 short months thinking going in that i had the best job ever..i worked at a humane society where i could help care for animals and get paid for it? wow i guess that was too good to be true..it was too bad. I have never in my life met such a horrible person as Kathi (PAL owner). She has a lot of people fooled by starting a humane society, it was the most ironic thing having a person like her owning such an organization. She was rude, selfish, anda  two-faced liar. She treated her volunteers and employees like trash. All she cared about was money and would do anything for a dime. True story and what was the final straw for me leaving-There was a program at PAL that granted the funds to certain people to get VET care for thier pets who couldnt afford it. This one couple came in with thier application very upset because one of thier dogs needed immediate care. So i took thier application and told them i would let Kathi know and i would get back to them ASAP..well Kathi was too busy all day long to acknowledge this issue when all she had to do was sign a peice of paper. The couple called me several times asking about the application and i had to tell them she was igoring it. And do u know why?! she was BAKING A CAKE for a dog's birthday..a paying customer..and she was in a hurry to get it done and didnt have time to step away for one second to help these poor people and thier dog. She was only concerned about the 20 bucks for the cake she was making. I could not believe it and quit shortly after. She also would tell people that came in that she dressed unprofessional beause she spent so much time with the animals..um NO..for the 3 months i worked there i maybe saw her with the animals once.  Another reason i quit was because she would stand over me while i was on the phone with our volunteers and then tell me i wasnt strict enough with them and i was too nice.It's really too bad because the place had tons of potential..  
PAL Humane Society	65563	1	/users/profile/71665	The Kraken R.I.P.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/09/2011	I was an employee at PAL Humane Society for the past three years.  I am taking the time to give my opinion because I feel the public deserves to know what goes on behind closed doors.To begin with, the founder has no clue how to run a business. Think about it, PAL has been in business since 1993. Why is it that they havent grown?  Their current office consists of a unit behind a Mexican restaurant. In 2007 PAL was given half a million dollars. Where did it go? Most of it was squandered away fixing up rented spaces at the Apple Valley Inn. One building was converted into a clinic but never opened as a clinic. It eventually became a glorified kennel area. By glorified I mean that dogs were kept in one of the six rooms.  Another had a full kitchen installed and stocked for baking treats. Treats were baked for a few months, and then the kitchen stood empty for the remainder of time she paid rent on the building. Yet another was gutted and made into a training room. But, training was virtually impossible because the majority of dogs were housed in that room behind a partition wall. How can proper training take place with dogs outside huge windows, barking at the students? Several other buildings were converted into kennels and catteries just to be abandoned when money became short and PAL had to downsize.  In November of 2010 PAL was given another half a million dollars. It was specified by the deceased that the funds be used only for the care of the animals. Not rent or wages. Im curious how over $100,000.00 in debts plus two months of employee wages, mine included, got paid off after PAL received the money. When it was not supposed to be spent that way. They say they have alot of programs but in reality the low-cost spay/neuter clinic never happened. I know of several veterinarians in the high desert that refuse to even work with PAL. And the medical manager at PAL is self taught. They say they have developed an extensive humane education program. What does that mean? They started a Prison Dog Program in San Bernardino County's High Desert Juvenile Detention & Assessment Center. I was responsible for running that program. Its original intention was to bring in rescue dogs from the facility to be rehabilitated by the juveniles. Since I quit, a volunteer has been going into the facility with her personal dog to teach the classes. And, at the Federal Prison System in Adelanto, they only taught two rounds of classes and havent gone back into the facility since. I know this because I was also part of that program. There is no grooming salon. The groomer was laid off back in October 2010 because she had to ask repeatedly to be paid. There is no training facility. Where would it be?  And gift shop consists of a hallway area as you walk into the facility doors. Its funny how the first sentence in their mission statement says Prevention of cruelty to animals by any reasonable means Unfortunately, when the cruelty officer took a leave of absence to donate her kidney to her mother, the program was eliminated. I know through behind closed door conversations, that the program was eliminated as an excuse to lay off the cruelty officer.  And finally, I feel everyone should know. When I quit, PAL had two of the four remaining dogs in their care euthanized because they were falsely deemed unadoptable. The other two were taken to Apple Valley animal control and had to sit in their cells to wait their obligatory three days before being euthanized. So, how is it that they can boast they are the only no-kill shelter in the high desert and get away with killing perfectly healthy dogs? These and many more secrets are kept hidden from the public, volunteers and even board members. Think about this the next time you pull out your checkbooks.  
PAL Humane Society	65384		/users/profile/71471	Justice for the animals	Volunteer	1	02/09/2011	I would not reccomend this organization to anyone. I have donated my time and my aeroplane for fund raising activities and will never do so again. PAL is totally mismanaged and funding is not spent how it should be. Animals have died from lack of medical treatment. My wife played a key roll in the Prison Dog Program and finally left after not being paid for 2 months. She was extremely dedicated to the cause and was very much torn between staying and leaving. There were times when she would come home almost in tears because of what she saw. As far as I am concerned PAL is there for the money not the animals. I have two words to discribe one individual who has been working for PAL for a number of years: lazy and self centered. She does not deserve to be there. This is a harsh review but, it is honest. As stated the best thing that could happen to PAL is replace the managment. 
PAL Humane Society	63726		/users/profile/69669	Bruce	Donor	5	02/05/2011	We were impressed with the dedication of the workers and the overall operation of the organization.  The cleanliness of the facility stood out, as well as how orderly everything was.  The lady in charge of the sanctuary not only was concerned with the present - day-to-day operations, maintenance and upkeep of the physical plant - but it was obvious that she had a vision on where she wanted to take the organization in the future.  Overall very positive feeling from an organization filling what is generally viewed by society as a sad and negative function, i.e. abandoned pets.  We made a sizeable donation and later donated all the grooming equipment we had used on our two pet dogs.
PAL Humane Society	63685		/users/profile/69627	Ashbrook	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	Thanks to PAL, once a month I deliver donated pet food and supplies to the elderly who need assistance because of financial hardship.  Without this assistance, many of the elderly would have to give up their pets.  This would be a tremendous loss as these animals often are viewed as "family" to them. Their cat(s) and/or dog(s) provide the love and companionship in too often very empty lives. I have delivered supplies  for almost two years.  During this time, I have come to know each of them and their wonderful animals, and it has absolutely enhanced my life with new friends, both in the elderly and their pets.  I look forward to my monthly Saturday deliveries when I can catch up with them all; it enhances my life. Thanks, PAL, for providing very necessary support for seniors and a rewarding experience for me.   
PAL Humane Society	63246		/users/profile/69148	sandiquilter	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	I don't really have a story, but  I have known others that do have a story.  The stories are heartwarming, tear filled, even heartbreaking at what these dear creatures have endured before P.A.L. rescues them.  I have watched and listened to the caring and dedicated  personnel and volunteers at the Apple Valley P.A.L. group.  The High Desert can be a very harsh place for abandoned and stray animals. We have the intense heat with  very few water sources for animal life.  Freezing temperatures and worst of all for strays or abandoned animals is the constant threat of attack by natural wildlife. The P.A.L. people remember these 4-legged souls deserve to be warm, fed, loved and living in a safe enviroment.  This takes time and money.  Time they give in abundance.  Funding, they don't haven in abundance.  That is why P.A.L. Apple Valley needs donations.  Their doors need to be kept open.    
PAL Humane Society	63245		/users/profile/69147	lotospots	Donor	5	02/04/2011	What would we do without folks like those at PALS to help animals who can't help themselves.  I wish there were not so many people to who abuse and abandon their innocent peds.  Kudos to PALS Apple Valley, CA.
PAL Humane Society	63126		/users/profile/69018	twenger	General Member of the Public	4	02/03/2011	I love Pal Humane Society and the work they do here in the High Desert. It breaks my heart to see so many abused and deserted animals and I can tell that Pal gives their all to protect these wonderful little creatures. I have attended one of their fundraisers and was very impressed. A great organization!!!
PAL Humane Society	63108		/users/profile/68998	mmb2010PAL	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	I can't tell you how much our community of the High Desert, California appreciates the great job that PAL is responsible.  They continue to struggle through low donations and forced relocations and yet the animals are always their first priority! The PAL organization is an outstanding non-profit organization and one I hope continues to find their way in our current economic times.  It seems more animals are in need during people's strife, so the PAL agency is in greater demand than ever.
PAL Humane Society	63096		/users/profile/68986	A1dame	Client Served	5	02/03/2011	I was fortunate enough to adopt two wonderful cats at different times from PALS -- Tallulah and Irving.   Of all the cat's I've lived with over the years these definately are two of the very best.  They are funny, sweet and have impeccable social habits.  I'm so fortunate that I found them before anyone else had a chance to adopt them.   If you are looking to adopt an animal I strongly suggest that you check out PALS first.   The staff there is so helpful and truly have the welfare of the animals and their future companions at heart.   Please residents of Victor Valley, help PALS protect our 4 legged friends.  You won't regret it.   
PAL Humane Society	63073		/users/profile/68961	Paula B.	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Awesome Place that LOVES it's animals. Have know of this organization for many years and the strugles it has just to stay open. Their love for the animals always suvives. 
PAL Humane Society	63048		/users/profile/68933	vickioster	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	If volunteered at PAL's and found them to be extremely dedicated to the animals they received, even when they couldn't really afford more.  They always find a way to take care of them and care for them.  Unfortunally, we do not live in an area where there are people that make a lot of money, so it's hard to raise money - but they have always found a way to have the money available to feed and take care of animals in their care. 
PAL Humane Society	63046		/users/profile/68931	enomis36	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I have been a volunteer dog foster mom with PAL for  the last year and half. Through PAL I met the most incredibe dogs who have thought me love and patience. The work PAL does is a labor of love and I am happy to be a part of it.
PAL Humane Society	63000		/users/profile/68881	dogmom	Board Member	5	02/03/2011	I've been a volunteer and Board Member with PAL for 3 years and the organization is wonderful!  The work that they do rescuing so many dogs and cats in the High Desert community of Apple Valley, CA with so little resources is nothing short of a miracle.  PAL not only rescues animals but humans as well, last year, with the help of Sr. Pauline Quinn of Pathways to Hope; they started two prison dog programs.  These programs help youth at risk and adult offenders rehabilitate their lives in a unique way, with the help of compassionate humans and the unconditional love of a dog.  In addition the program offers vocational training that can be used when the offenders are released.   This program truly makes a difference in the lives of all that it touches from offender, prison staff, PAL staff and the dogs and adoptive families. It is a win, win, win, win program!!!PAL does so much more, humane education for local schools, a senior pet food program for low income pet owners to insure they can keep their furry friends well fed, spay/neuter voucher program for low income pet owners to help control the pet population, low cost vaccine clinics  Well you can see this little Humane Society it a little town with very little income does a lot of great work!Im proud to be associated with them!

My son wanted to be a cop since he was 4 years old.  He worked hard to get there and works harder to stay in such a un appreciated career.  I worry every minute of every day and will till he is finished with his career in law enforcement.  I hurt as they all do when another officer is taken by such a meaningless way and leaves another family hurting but remain proud.  That is the meaning of the thin blue line and I am happy to support and will wear my bracelet with pride.

OfficerDown.US	241758	4	/users/profile/328411	ScottPurcell	Board Member	5	04/27/2015	We started this because, quite honestly, I wanted to donate to help the families of officers that I read about online. But there was no way to do it (the local law enforcement charities have zero online capabilities and have even less transparency or accountability, so not only could I not donate, but even if I could I had no idea how much of my donation was actually going to the families). So we started OfficerDown.us as a way for people everywhere to help, and so people could know that their funds really are going to the families they designate. We are very proud of what we've built, and amazed to see so many people pitching in to help LEO's and their families in the times of greatest need.

My son has been faced with so many challenges in his young life and music has always been a shelter in the storms. On top of everything else, I became unemployed and his mother was diagnosed with cancer.  With these two things our financial resources quickly dried up. Derek has been playing double bass for several years now and he has had to borrow instruments to practice and perform with. He has goals of one day playing in college and possibly professionally and desperately needed his own instrument to help him along this path.  We had no way to provide this for him. It was at this point that FAYM entered our lives. We were told of FAYM  by a good friend.  We contacted Mr. Weller and he and his network of wonderful people took a personal interest in our son. We are just so humbled and grateful for the amazing work that FAYM did searching for and finding an instrument for our son.  Mr. Weller and his colleagues found an instrument, met with us and the former owner, inspected it and, quite unexpectedly, even purchased it for Derek! We are absolutely blown away by the generosity, kindness and compassion of FAYM and we are eternally grateful for all they have done for our family.  We look forward to building a relationship with them and doing what we can to help another child have the kind of smile that my son had when given the gift of music. Thank you FAYM! Rob GraceLas Vegas, NV

I would like to give a big thanks to Mr. Harold Weller, Trustee of the Foundation to Assist Young Musicians for his generous donation of a brand new full size Kurzweil Electronic Keyboard! And also a big thanks to Mr. Bob Thompson, the original donor! If not for this generosity, I would have a fairly difficult time with my work. The keyboard is a big part of my life now, as it is the most important resource that I use while I compose. So far, I have only used it for composing, but as a musician trying to get my foot in the music scene here in Las Vegas, I see great potential in its uses for performance as well. Keyboards are just the most useful tool for any musician! Although I have had limited interaction with FAYM, I would love to be more involved with such a fantastic organization, where the love of music flourishes in the hearts of today's youth.

Last but not least I just can't say enough good words about the wonderful man behind FAYM. Hal has proved to me that there are still honest people who want nothing else than to accomplish something greater than yourself. He has served as a great mentor, role model, father figure and friend. If you want to give to an organization that impacts the lives of young musician's directly, please give to FAYM!

He is a 15 year old flutist and after only 2 months at the school he was declared the winner of its prestigious Concerto Competition. This is the TOP performance honor awarded by the school and this means that Anthony has been recognized as the best of the best on a worldwide scale. The mission statement of FAYM is to "encourage and support gifted young musicians in early training, advanced study, and professional career development, specifically those who are in need of financial and/or mentoring support."  FAYM is succeeding in fulfilling its mission. Anthony would not have been in this most incredible position without Hal Weller and FAYM.

He put me in touch with Teller (of Penn & Teller) - a wonderful magician and one of the greatest creative minds in the world of theater. The foundation arranged for private meetings with Teller in Las Vegas, NV. Collaborating with Teller has been extremely inspirational.As a pianist and a magician, I've encountered mixed reviews from the conservative classical world regarding my concept of blending the two art forms into one performance. Mr. Weller, however, was always open to my new ideas. I'm impressed with the breadth of vision and imagination demonstrated by the foundation's principles.Thank you Harold Weller and thank you Foundation to Assist Young Musicians for making my dreams come true.

This would have never been possible to me, if Maestro Harold Weller hadnt given me a helping hand in 2007. After having listened to my recordings, learning about my difficult financial situation and inviting me to concerts in December 2007, Maestro Weller has offered me FAYMs  incredible financial support and what most has been standing by me for all the days since then giving constant support and encouragement, what I appreciate and value so much. I am really grateful to Maestro Weller, the Committee members and all the FAYM  collaborators and supporters for  the GREAT chance I was given. I watch and admire how the Foundation is growing and expanding. It's great to see that FAYM takes care of more and more talented kids and young musicians from needy families.

My  entire 27 year career was dedicated to 'at risk' student populations.  I currently  volunteer my time to FAYM by bringing violin instruction to a population that is not able to afford it.  We start with 5 year old students and intend to teach and mentor with the intent of guiding them to college. We are not trying to create professional musicians, but are attempting to provide a a way to fund a college degree with music scholarships. We currently have 15 kindergarten students taking two lessons per week.  In December they played their first 'concert' which lasted approximately 6 minutes as they played 'The Pepperoni Pizza Song' and 'Los Pollitos.'  Their next concert will be this March and will feature our students playing 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' along with several variations of this song.  For their first concert they only used open strings.  For this concert they will be using thier left hand to 'finger' more notes thus making their music more beautiful!  Each week I see and assist the children with their lessons as their parents actively participate in the teaching and learning. It is my privilege to give my time to FAYM with the hopes of making a difference in the lives of children.

In fact this wouldn't have happened  as because of the financial difficulties we had never even dared to think about Krzysztof's studies abroad and especially in the USA.   It was Mr Weller who noticed Krzysztof's performances on youtube, wrote to him and after having learnt about Krzysztof's situation offered him a helping hand. The beginnings were very difficult, as far as I know, and Mr Weller had to put a lot of effort, energy, time and heart to be able to bring Kris to the USA for concerts and recitals launching the Foundation to Assist Young Musicians which allowed to collect some money that enabled Krzysztof's studies in the USA. Mr Weller managed to find many devoted people with big hearts who have become Krzysztof's friends and still support him in his studies.I can find no proper words to express our gratitude for supporters of FAYM and especially for Maestro Weller who decided to devote his life to helping young musicians. The money go to the kids and support their education and development. I know this for sure! Great cause and I'll support it as much as I can. Thank you Maestro Weller!

The guy didn't have any more money and was sent away.  He came to the human society to give his dog up because he could not afford any more medical bills and did not want his dog to suffer.  He was sobbing.  Instead NHS treated the dog, fixed the leg and gave the dog back to the man.  They told him good homes are hard to find, this dog should stay in his.

One of the greatest joys I experience are in my meeting people whom comment about the shelter when they see the NHS logo on my hats as I where them around town. The devotion to the animals while dealing with very large #s of them is a tribute to the staff and volunteers. 
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	131441		/users/profile/176997	kimbies46	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I moved from Connecticut to Nevada 2 years ago having to give up my family's cat in the process. When I arrived in Reno I sought out an animal shelter to get my animal "fix" for both cats and dogs.  Over these past 2 years, I have come to volunteer in many different ways that I never could have imagined. I have seen and heard stories about the plight of some animals that I would never have believed if I had not witnessed them first hand. I have become engaged with people whom are willing to give up so much for our little friends without voices. And most importantly to me, I have been touched (and hopefully touched in return) some wonderful 4 legged friends. The devotion, dedication and ongoing sacrifices made by the folks at NHS is inspiring and in a very short time span, I have witnessed the effect it has had not only on myself and some other volunteers I have come to know, but also on an entire community to the betterment of all, not just animal lovers. NHS is a true one in a million and it's recent success in promoting "no-kill" as a way of life is truly amazing. 
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	136313		/users/profile/182226	a853simone	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	Soon after losing my last cat (had several of them for 20 years), I went in to see the Nevada Humane Society and its new building.  It was a positive, cheerful facility that didn't smell bad, thanks to all the volunteers and staff who keep it so clean. After an orientation, I went "to work" there. The Volunteer Coordinator and I put together a mentoring program, not required, for those who want to know, in depth, about how we do things there, where supplies are located, etc.  Now I schedule the cat mentoring and also mentor, a very rewarding job in that volunteers are happy to have gone through this process, so vital to knowing safety guidelines for the public, our volunteers, and the staff.  There is a very good feeling when working there - we volunteers are greatly appreciated and know it.  Aslo we are all proud of the high adoption rate the NHS has.        Anne Simone
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	135814	2	/users/profile/181701	cortreno	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	  To whom it may concern, I would like to write in support of Nevada Humane Society. In my 35 years as a resident of Washoe County, I have seen this fine organization morph from a rag tag average animal rescue shelter to a premiere no-kill shelter under the direction of Ms. Bonney Brown. The NHS facility is a model for all animal shelters. Their record save rate of 94% is the highest of any metropolitan city in the USA and far exceeds the national average of around 60%. NHS has over 7,000 local volunteers and raises private donations every year through their numerous fund raising events in the community such as, Walk for Animals, Duck Race and Lights of Love. The physical facility itself is amazing. Every time visiting there as a volunteer, I feel warmly welcomed and appreciated by the staff for taking time to socialize the orphaned cats and dogs. The NHS needs to be recognized for the excellent work it has done for our community under Ms. Brown's administration.  Regards,CortFV de PeysterUA (Retired) 
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	134759	1	/users/profile/180634	Sharon McCl	Donor	5	11/07/2012	In 2006, after taking in our fourth homeless cat in four years, I began to realize that we would not be able to continue doing this forever.  Eventually we would reach the maximum number of cats that we could care for.  So I made the decision that if I could not personally provide a home for every cat that needed one, the next best thing would be to give to Nevada Humane Society to help them care for homeless cats and find them permanent homes of their own.  Over the last 6 years, my involvement with NHS has grown from being just a donor to being a volunteer for special events.  Having the opportunity to see the organization from behind the scenes has only increased my admiration for it.  The management and senior staff are focused and dedicated, intelligent and creative.  The entire staff of employees cares about the welfare of each individual animal in the shelter.  The organization works with other animal welfare organizations in the area to help create an entire no-kill community.  As a donor, I have been pleased to see how carefully funds are spent, never wasted.  Most important of all, they have achieved amazing results.  Last year, 2011, the save rate for both dogs and cats at NHS was 93%, compared with a national average of approximately 58%.  I can't imagine a more incredible nonprofit organization to which to contribute either money or volunteer time!
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	133999		/users/profile/179765	Ruby6	Donor	5	11/06/2012	Nevada Humane Society is a critically needed and successful animal welfare operation for Northern Nevada which so many of our population depends upon.  Residents who are no longer able to care for their pets, for whatever reason, to those who want to adopt a new pet into their family, will find the perfect resources at Nevada Humane Society to place an animal into a loving, caring new home.  The management and staff are peerless:  the systems and procedures that all at NHS employ ensure that: (1) the immediate care of the animal is superior; and (2) the long-term quality of life in adopting into a good fit of ownership is abundantly apparent.  The animal adoption success rate is unparalleled compared to most other regions of the country.  This, in large part, is due to the diligence, conviction, and compassion to save animals of NHS's Executive Director, Bonney Brown. The Northern Nevada region is very fortunate to have at the helm of it's major animal saving workforce the talents of Ms. Brown, who has a long lineage of animal welfare accolades, both national and regional.  This organization truly deserves the recognition of the 2012 Top-Rated Nonprofits List.

Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	131296		/users/profile/176852	debby dinsdale	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I became aware of the Nevada Humane Society (NHS) 2 years ago after loosing my cat and being left with a big hole in my life. My husband and I went to the shelter and picked out our new family member. We were helped by amazing staff and volunteers. One year later and i began working there as a volunteer myself. I am very sensitive when it come to animals and thought that I could never volunteer in an animal shelter, but decided to give it a go, and I am so pleased that i did. NHS is a no-kill shelter, and without that I would have had no interest. Everyone from staff to management has a passion for animals and cares about what they do and the animals they serve. The animals are very well looked after until their fur-ever homes are found, or have a place to live out their lives if necessary. When animals are struggling in the shelter, the staff identify these and send out emails to get these old or sick animals homes - it works, i personally 'foster' a 17 year cat who had been there for 2 years - and i would not now be without her. NHS is very creative with it's themes for attracting people into the shelter to get animals adopted, and also does many off-site adoption events too. Fundraising is also a key activity and again they are creative and it's amazing what they achieve - saving approx 10,000 animals per year, with a 95% save rate - on a very limited budget. As a volunteer, when people say to me, looking at all of the animals - "poor animals" -  i always reply that theses are the lucky ones!
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	131158		/users/profile/176711	ginapaulcole	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	Volunteering at Nevada Humane Society is the most rewarding adventure I've ever had.  Sometimes it's difficult looking into the eyes of dogs and cats whose owners have surrendered them.  You can see the confusion in their eyes because of being forced to live in new surroundings.   But that initial sadness is replaced by such happiness when you see their cage empty a week later and find out a loving family adopted them into their new forever home.  When we hear the bell ring at the adoption desk and everyone cheers, it sometimes bring tears to your eyes because you're so happy that a good dog or cat was adopted.
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	131011		/users/profile/176541	Lisa153	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	When people find out that I volunteer at Nevada Humane Society, frequently their response is "I could never do that . . . it's too sad."  While the circumstances that bring the animals to the shelter may be sad, NHS is anything but a sad place.  The shelter is bright and clean and filled with people -- staff and volunteers -- devoted to caring for and finding new families for homeless pets.  And when the bell rings to signify a lucky pet has found their forever home, NHS is one of the most joyful places to be.  Those happy endings are the reason that I volunteer.  So whether I'm writing thank you notes, reading to cats, taking pictures of dogs, or fostering kittens, I am proud to be part of the organization that makes those happy endings possible for so many pets.
Nevada Humane Society, Inc.	130965		/users/profile/176486	MargaretFlint	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	I have been volunteering at Nevada Humane Society for three years. My primary area of focus is dog walking although I also assist with legislative issues during Nevada's Legislative Sessions.We currently maintain a 94% no kill rate at NHS...This due to a combined effort between administration, staff and an incredible, devoted and loyal core group of volunteers. Our combined efforts allow us market our animals, work with those who through no fault of their own may possees mild behavorial issues and place these animals into appropriate and well rounded loving homes. I am happy to spend as much of my free time as possible at NHS and proud to be a part of this wonderful orginization.

The organization provides interview suiting, coaching,  and career clothing, yes, but the real impact is in the confidence boost the clients receive!  The Dress for Success boutique is unpretentious yet elegant giving ladies of any socioeconomic background the experience of being pampered and cared for during their employment search.

Dress for Success Southern Nevada	130778		/users/profile/176275	lisamws	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	Dress for Success is an incredible organization that helps women from all walks of life who need suiting for a job interview.  As a volunteer image consultant, I have the privlege of working with women from all different backgrounds, but whose need is the same:  A suit for an interview.  I have worked with college graduates who have the skills, education and resume to get the job, but just needed a suit for the interview.  I have worked with women who have been abused, women who are down on their luck, single moms, and women who have just needed the empowerment of owning the clothing that would take them forward in their journey to secure a job and better their future.  I have learned so much from these women, and look forward to working with new clients to see the light in their eyes when they feel confident in how they look.  It is not just about the clothes, it is about each and every woman that walks through the door, and how we can empower them by helping them to feel confident and ready for that interview. From providing a nice suit, accessories, shoes and handbag, to talking with them and giving them interview tips.  The smallest thing can mean the most to them, we have a magnet where we write three empowering words from a short form that the ladies fill out, and we reinforce those three positive words with them, and the smiles on their faces just light up the whole room.  Dress for Success has been by far the best non profit that I have volunteered my time to, and I plan to continue for a very long time.
Dress for Success Southern Nevada	130772		/users/profile/176270	ksunderwood	Volunteer	5	10/29/2012	This organization empowers women by giving them things needed to return to the working world - clothing, job readiness training, opportunities to network with other women in Las Vegas and most importantly - a support network!

The Churchill Foundation	318537		/users/profile/409728	Debbi H.	Donor	5	11/08/2016	I first became aware of The Churchill Foundation at the inception.  The founders passion alone was enough to grab my attention.  Although, still a relatively new organization, I've watched them grow, flourish and succeed time and time again.  What started out as a grass-roots, passion project turned into a way of life for those responsible for making the decisions.  As a donor, it's of the utmost importance to me to know that my hard-earned dollars are going to the cause, and with TCF, I know that is the case.  Among their highest priorities is total transparency.  Time and time again, with my own eyes, I've seen their bills for their medical dogs, and those bills oftentimes go well into the thousands.  Time and time again, I've witnessed the hard work and dedication that goes into raising money to pay their bills and remain in good standing with service providers and specialists.  The bottom line is, I know they're putting my money where their mouths are.  The animals taken under TCF's wings are not only cared for, they are WELL cared for.  Time, money, effort and lots and lots of love  are invested in each and every pet they rescue, rehabilitate and re-home.  I will proudly continue to be a supporter of this fine organization.  Their ethics are unquestionable.  TCF is truly #forlife!
The Churchill Foundation	318457		/users/profile/409635	DannysDogs	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/07/2016	The Churchill Foundation from inception has gone above and beyond for each of their dogs. They ensure each one is suitable to be adopted. Meaning, they are not only medically taken care of but behaviorally as well. I am honored to be entrusted to assist with the training of the behavioral challenged pups to assure a successful adoption. Many of these dogs would have never been saved if it wasn't for TCF taking them in "for life". I am overjoyed they take the time and do the research to find the best match for each dog that is adopted out. This shows responsibility and truly caring for each life saved. Keep up the great work Churchill, you'll always have the support of Danny's Dogs!
The Churchill Foundation	318414		/users/profile/396860	sue272727	Volunteer	5	11/06/2016	I have followed TCF since it's beginnings. Was totally over the moon in love with Churchill. I have watched them take done of the most challenging pups (medical and behavior) and help them become some of the most loved family members. They also scoop up other critters to save them from the dreaded E word. You should only be lucky enough to have watched Phelps become the boss of his people's after being saved by TCF and sent to be rehabbed by amother great org. Oh the stories of love trumping all!
The Churchill Foundation	318413		/users/profile/409583	Jen_73	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2016	TCF is amazing.  Their motto "For life" is more than a statement.  It's how the rescue is run.  Not just lifelong homes and returns (if needed).  Adopters and dedicated volunteers become family.  There's no better rescue for a medical case.   They go above and beyond for the medical dogs that end up at the city shelter.  I for one strongly admire how far this rescuse has come.  Looking forward to seeing the wonderful things ahead.   
The Churchill Foundation	318409	1	/users/profile/409579	jewel1506	General Member of the Public	5	11/06/2016	the thing that amazes me the most about the Churchill Foundation is they take Dogs from the kill shelter that anyone else would look at and say "No way...I'm not taking on that 'burden'.."  The lost, sick, scared and hopeless cases. My Girl is from a rescue Lara previously worked with and to this day she tells me "For Life" when I ask for help and guidance with my Angel. They never give up or turn their back. Thank Dog for Churchill Foundation. 
The Churchill Foundation	318405	1	/users/profile/409575	Jaime16	Volunteer	5	11/06/2016	This organization is truly incredible!

The Churchill Foundation	318385	1	/users/profile/409553	cspinuzzi	Client Served	5	11/06/2016	The Churchill Foundation does  a great job of not just rescuing dogs in need, but ensuring that every dog finds the right forever home.  The trial adoption process helps make sure that the dog's personality fits with the family's lifestyle which really helps ensure a successful adoption.  The best part is that when you adopt from them you become part of their family which means they continue to check in with you to make sure you have all the tools and resources required to make sure you are the pup's forever home.

Pico and I have been senior fosters and one foster fail (Mariah was suppose to be a weekend foster sleepover and we never gave her back lol)  since day one and we  always save one spot on the sofa for any rescue seniors they save. They just don't stand for foster and adopt but also they stand for educationwhich is so important in the community.Maybe one day we will stop seeing all animals I'm our local shelter but especially seniors. The community give back with their dog and cat food pantry for those that need emergency food to the Lukas Angels program that helps those in need of humanly helping their loved one cross the rainbow bridge and the support going through such a difficult time.

The dedication of the employees and volunteers is beyond measure and I have personally experienced their generosity first hand. Animals that don't have a chance get one when TCF is involved. The unwanted, the unloved, the forgotten all have a place here. I wish I had a million dollars to donate. I wish I could devote all of my time to make sure this organization got everything it needed. I love The Churchill Foundation and all of the people and 4 legged lives they help. Best Ever!!
The Churchill Foundation	318249		/users/profile/409399	Paulina B.	Client Served	5	11/03/2016	We adopted Pickles about one year ago from Churchill ,therefore eternally making me the happiest person in the world.   I was on Petfinder and found Pickles. From the day I filled out the application, to when I got approved, Lara was in contact with me close to every day. The process took about 2 weeks. First you speak with the adoption coordinator, then they check your references and then if approved you get to meet the dog. There is also a two week trial to ensure that its the right fit.  Don't be intimidated by the process at all.  After adopting Pickles we have been so happy.  She can be a diva at times, but she truly is a sweet little creature.   I cannot express in words how amazing The Churchill Foundation is..and it's due to the amazing people involved.

They have spared no expense once committed to an animal in their rescue, which is an admirable trait in a rescue.

I wanna say it's been 2 years now since pepper has been in our home. She started as a foster since we already had 2 of our own but after a few months of possible adopters meeting her and deciding on another pup we couldn't  take it anymore and decided to make her our 3rd child. To this day we can contact the Churchill team if we need anything and they are right there to help. Thanks for letting us be part of the family. Peppers siblings Dotty and Rocky say thanks Church fo all you do.
ACCEPT	201930	1	/users/profile/263514	professionallifepreservers	Volunteer	1	06/05/2014	I am not to put the bad mouth on people who are supposed to lead you in the foot steps in the word of God; "but clearly Gwen is a train wreck" Maybe the organization back in 2010 was great, but now it suffers due to poor management the bad attitudes that you don't see coming from behind the scenes. Upon my strongest belief after volunteering although Gwen paperwork may be in tact; she is not a tactful person but only when she feels it is important to be for example: "WHEN THE TAX AUDITS COME ABOUT OR WHEN IT IS TIME TO RENEW A GRANT"  Her tact skills in 2014 are just not on point and people look at you all across the board especially how you treat your clients and volunteers. In my opinion; I think she is misusing funds, having people come to the meetings just to get signatures to show to the GRANT people that people are attending so that she could get more funding, and continue to use Anne Cates in her office as a do-girl which is also running her into a rain wreck because of how Gwen runs her to death with absolutely no kind of organization or order and using her for other collateral matters not pertaining to her job description. I witnessed her talk bad about her clients, point out the ones who were HIV/ AIDS infected, ones with mental health issues, as well as talk about Anne and how they bribe people into coming to the meetings by giving them $50 Walmart Gift cards and a hot meal every now and then to keep them coming. I really think she is not providing resources of her center to help these people and is careless and sending them to other organizations and pocketing the funding. I can never/ will never volunteer for her organization again and most definitely would not recommenced this organization in 2014 for your community outreach needs, counseling, meetings, nor to any kind of help because sincerely you will not get it, but you will get talked about behind your back. Now if Pastor Glenn Taylor comes to put that organization back in order; "you might have some hope" But clearly Gwen is messing things up, unfair to her clients, volunteers, and Anne Cates and is a train wreck. She need to go set down and have several seats. The nature of this rating was not to be vindictive, but to let the deserved public know the real deal about this organization, which makes me even question the making a visit back to the church in connection with the organization.

ACCEPT	45666	6	/users/profile/46544	mzkreni	General Member of the Public	5	06/25/2010	For many years, ACCEPT has worked to increase community awareness on the signs, symptoms of AIDS/HIV as well as prevention strategies for the same. Their tireless efforts have greatly enhanced the quality of life potential for teens and other at risk populations as every presentation/demonstration is presented in a way that is easy to follow. The message is always clear & concise and every person served is treated with dignity & respect regardless to race, creed or color. The enthusiasm for their program is evidenced by their obvious personal experience via product knowledge where at a recent community event in the park the Program Director was able to express in detail the use of a female condom because she had actually used one herself! ACCEPT is a valuable asset to the Reno/Sparks community, far exceeding the norm!

When I lived in Reno, I participated in their World AIDS Day Events and the Reno AIDS Walk for the past three years.  They give so much to the families of men, women, and children living with HIV/AIDS in Washoe County.Thank you ACCEPT for your time and support of individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS.

Gwen Taylor's is a unique speaker that can grab young peoples attention and get them to understand the importance of this training.I was so impressed with impact that accept has on young people who are unaware of the impotance of the information on safe sexual behavior. The ACCEPT program has helped students take accountability for their actions. It is not an exaggeration to say that I have never known anyone with Gwens qualities.  Her performance and attitude is remarkable.  One of Mrs. Taylors outstanding characteristics is her creativity and excitment in teaching about the awareness about sex and our community. I highly recommend this program to you without reservation.
ACCEPT	45442	7	/users/profile/46335	vasars	Former staff	5	06/24/2010	While working for ACCEPT one of my duties was to conduct HIV 101 classes at Job Corp.  The young adults at Job Corp looked forward to the weekly classes and I believe received very beneficial information.  We were able to debunk the myths about HIV/AIDS and how to protect themselves.  We also empowered them with the ability to discuss this topic with their partners.  Through ACCEPT I facilitated Creating Lasting Families Connection classes.  CLFC is a federally funded program that is administered all over the nation.  These classes teach parents and children how to communicate with each other about everyday and sensitive subjects such as drugs and alcohol.  ACCEPT has done an awesome job in reaching out to the community and making a difference!
ACCEPT	45438	7	/users/profile/46332	henryowens7	Board Member	5	06/24/2010	Accept has been one of the most positive and influential forces in the Afro-American culture here in Reno NV. What you must understand is that the population of black people in reno is only 5-7 thousand people, so to see someone start a non-profit agency, out of their own pocket, because they see the need within a community is to be commended. Before Glenn & Gwen received one dime from the federal government, they were out helping people with the horrific disease. They were doing the work before it was the cool thing to do. Now thank God everyone can see that this disease is destructive to the human family as a whole, not just one group of people. They have been out in the community educating the masses on safe sex, and taking the fear and the ignorance out of this disease. If anyone comes to Reno, if you give them 30 days or more they will hear about accept, which says alot about this non-profit's impact on this community. Now they have branched out into family care and well being, which i think is great. I sat through a parenting wisely course that I wish I could have taken 20 years ago, it would have helped me be a better father to my to grown daughters now. And in my personal opinion they should become the primary agency in NV. Because a lot of other agencies are using accepts method now of touching the community, which means they are someone to be followed.
ACCEPT	45429	9	/users/profile/46323	cj-hunter03	General Member of the Public	5	06/24/2010	ACCEPT is without doubt an organization second to none.

People forget that parents weren't born with a manual and sometimes we act and react due to lack of knowledge.  This class has helped me and others better relate to our kids (especially teens) and strengthen our relationships through communication.  I have even spoken with some of the teenagers that have attended the training and most have admitted the communication is better and theyu at least see their parents trying to use some of what was learned.  The family is the backbone of our society and if we commit to strenthening our core family structures, we will see a change in our homes and communities.

Art and Fire (http://compression.controlledburnreno.com) and 2012 will be its 5th year in existence. For three of those years, the talented performers and management of eNVision Performing Arts have been an integral part of our festival. They bring a unique and exciting show to our day time audience, we have been blessed to have been able to collaborate with them on joint performance pieces, and their management and professionalism both before, during and after the show makes this group world class! They have participated in events outside the festival, and they came to our attention because someone saw them perform at a UNR basketball halftime show, where they also wow'd the crowd. They have additionally helped us promote our event by showing up before 5am to do a live TV remote.  Their dedication and commitment to excellence in all they do is teaching valuable lifelong skills to those participating and furthering the art of percussion!

It has placed in the top ten the past three years in their division at the Winter Guard International World Championship.  They have reached many performance minded students in the Reno/Sparks community who would otherwise not have an outlet to perform.   eNVision also performs year round within the community at various functions including fundraisers, conventions, University Men's and Women's basketball games, elementary schools and grand openings.   The organization is working hard to overcome a few economy driven hurdles including proper equipment, rehearsal/practice space and transportation.  If the organization is able to get over these they can continue for years to come.  That will also allow them to open up instruction to a younger audience that they just can't facilitate right now.

I see members working their hardest because they want to be better and want to do the best they can for themselves and the rest of the group. eNVision members come from several high schools in the area as well as the University and Community College, so they are able to interact with people outside of their normal group at school. I have seen friendships made despite school affiliation or age group. They support each other both at rehearsals and in life. At a recent marching band competition, I saw several eNVision members taking, and helping each other with uniform parts despite coming from different schools and competing against each other.

Envision Performing Arts Inc	99246		/users/profile/118782	drumset	Volunteer	5	10/12/2011	Enclosed is my letter of nomination to the Governor's Arts Awards, State of Nevada, for eNVision Performing Arts, 2010: Nomination Statement:Why eNVision Performing Arts should receive theLeadership in the Arts: Organizations, Governors Arts Award  	The Nevada Arts Council Governors Arts Awards should strongly consider the candidacy of eNVision Performing Arts for the Leadership in the Arts Award: Organizations. eNVision is a unique organization which serves and draws from Northern Nevada and the surrounding areas.  Its invitation is extended to school aged children from high school through age twenty-two, and middle school and upwards for Summer Arts, those who are interested in percussion, dance, color guard, and theater.  The older and more experienced members assist to mentor the younger ones and provide an example to them both in technique as well as in cooperation and leadership skills.  Since 2005 the organization has grown and continues to demonstrate exceptional artistic achievement, outstanding programming, and has stimulated excellence, growth, support, and availability of the arts in Nevada.  	In 2005, the Reno High School Band created a unique show combining the elements of several emerging musical styles. Synthesizing influences of Rock, Brass, Theatre, Cirque, Stomp and the Blue Man Group, EDGE! was born. In 2008, eNVision Performing Arts & Youth Art Works teamed up to give EDGE! a permanent home.  eNVision continues to build on what was created since this initiation.  Nevada's finest young entertainers now have a permanent outlet to bring to the community cutting edge percussion, guard, and dance. 	eNVision engages in world-class competition in music, dance, and theater for those involved. It is one of those rare organizations which offers weekend long, (during the school year), as well as summertime activity for this age group and enlists instructors in music, coordination, and artistic skills while including teamwork and athletics. It is exciting and entertaining for everyone and the only program of its kind in our area.  Lessons, such as discipline, perseverance, and collaboration will assist these youth throughout their adolescence and into adulthood. 	Extensive awards and honors places eNVision Performing Arts as a viable contender on a recognizable scale and includes the Winter Guard International Competition and other regional championships.  The Winter Guard International World Championships in Dayton, Ohio is a  week long event which comprises groups from all over the United States as well as from Canada, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Ireland, Korea, Japan, and Africa.  It is the Olympics of this activity! 	Steady growth since its inception in 2005 and its continued mission within our community is demonstrated by hosted indoor shows for 2009 and 2010.  This continues to grow and has now developed into the Northern Nevada Indoor Association with the first Championships in 2010 attended by the various Guard and Percussion Ensembles from Yvonne Shaw Middle School, North Valleys High School, Spanish Springs High School, Reno High School, and Reed High School.   	 	eNVision has also hosted the PIE Festival (Percussion, Individual, and Ensemble) for 2008, 2009, and 2010, a showcase opportunity open to all.  In past years, the eNVision Color Guard has performed as a part of the Summer Arts group, as has the eNVision Brass Line which has also participated as a part of  the eNVision Entertainment group - entertainment for all venues. 	Reviews from university, non-profit, periodical and marketing executives, and competition organizers underscore the contribution that eNVision has made.  An extensive events schedule which includes EDAWN, non-profits, athletic and university appearances, international institute conferences, competitions and conventions, and patriotic and local festivals demonstrates an intensive community impact. 	eNVision is a thriving organization of which Nevada can be proud. Artistic Director Aaron Hines is thorough, consistent and persistent in his endeavor and luckily for us has focused his talent in Nevada.  With a Governors Arts Award eNVision can earn a prestigious place in the continued efforts of showcasing the diversified programming that has become a significant role of the arts in Nevada, and our community will delight to watch eNVision Performing Arts grow as a vital part of it. It is important for Nevada to make its mark in all areas of performance art.

I came to know about Nevad Council on Problem Gambling when I was working on my certification as a problem gambing counselor. The staff were so encouraging and helpful to work with me so that I could pursue my certification and work in the field. I attended educational courses to build-up my hours and was educated by Carol on how gambling is an addictive disorder.

Nevada Council on Problem Gambling Inc	144035		/users/profile/190531	Judge Moss	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2012	In 2001, when the Nevada Council was asked to assist with the development of a Problem Gambling Assessment for the Clark County Family Court (the first of its kind), the Council stepped up and came through with a successful testing tool and network provider list. Over a decade later, the Problem Gambling Assessment is still being widely utilized by the Family Court, thanks to the Council.  
Nevada Council on Problem Gambling Inc	144015		/users/profile/190509	Karen146	Client Served	5	11/28/2012	I believe that my first awareness of Nevada's Council for Problem Gambling came when I was gambling and would see these annoying brochures around the casinos "When the Fun Stops" and I glanced through it and said 'that's not me, I can control my gambling'.  Well, another two years of misery, thousands of dollars gambled and the emptiness inside was creating suicidal thoughts, I not only called the number on the brochure but got help through a 12-step program.  Almost 11 years later away from the bet, I got to know Carol O' Hare and her remarkable, dedicated, and hard-working staff in the last five or so years.  I have volunteered to help put together conference materials and participated (and completed) the 30hour course with the thought of pursuing another masters degree in counseling, specifically gambling addiction.  I know that the Council participates in many health fairs around the valley and provide numerous training sessions for the gaming industry to help their employees recognize problem gamblers.   It is a shame that their funding has been so drastically reduced over the last couple of years because they currently do a lot, with the limited resources they have, heavily relying on volunteers to provide labor and love for those utilizing the Problem Gambler's hotline.

They get to explore all different dance styles. That is remarkable. For young children to learn and retain that much information while having fun is outstanding. They also benefit by: the Healthy Habits Nutrition Program, performing at Lecture Demonstrations, learning Career Competencies and much more. LWDA comes HIGHLY recommended.

This program provides exactly the type of after school enrichment/artistic outlet that I desire for my child. It meets my requirements in almost every way that is important to me. Eating healthy, great physical activity that's fun, lifelong learning and the ENJOYMENT of learning. The LWDA program is a way to keep children headed in the right direction.

Leah Willis Dance Arts	282373	2	/users/profile/372528	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/15/2016	This is a life-altering nonprofit organization. The curriculum that they offer gives children an outlet not just in Dance but in life in general. It teaches teamwork, hard work, and allows them to see what progress looks like. It shows the parents how creative, focused, and positively daring their children can be, and that they can achieve something great. The feeling that these children have being part of the LWDA program is second to none. The Innovative Arts program gives children the opportunity to connect dance with academics. This organization helps children to learn the fundamentals of movement as well as the science behind movement. It is a worthy investment in the children's futures. This organization exposes children to professional elements in the larger Performing Arts Community such as theater, professional artist workshops, as well as performances at venues that they themselves host. LWDA also gives them a head start on creating their own professional career portfolio through photo shoots and building a choreography repertoire. I recommend this nonprofit organization highly, as it gives life to all organizations that do not have Performing Arts Outlets. Organizations like this do not come around often.

The passion that Leah Willis and her husband have in changing the youth is contagious. You cant help but want to give back as much as you can. I grew up playing cello and dancing, and I believe that giving children the opportunity to develop through the arts is an amazing thing. I hope that LWDA will continue to change the world through dance, education and determination.

I am always struck by what is happening in the Assistance League building at any given time:  women are working in the Thrift Shop, the Senior Sampler, the food pantry, the office, and in meetings, organizing our many programs.  The fact the Assistance League is run totally by volunteers makes this organization even more impressive, especially considering the impact we make on children, the elderly, victims of abuse, and Veterans.  Every program is well organized and carefully evaluated.  I have been most closely associated with Links to Learning, a program that awards teachers (208 this year) money to bring books, math manipulatives, technology, etc., to their students.  On a personal note, a friend whose 15-year-old daughter was sexually assaulted began to cry when I asked her if her daughter had received one of our sexual abuse survivor kits.  She told me her daughter had slept with the teddy bear in the kit every night, and she felt that teddy bear had saved her daughter's life.  Indeed, we do make a difference.

Since I did not know anyone in the area, the members and voluteers became my family. But it was through the Operation School Bell program that I  realized what a wonderful and worthy organization this was. Seeing the looks on the childrens' faces as they receive new clothes - many for the first time in their lives, and the looks of appreciation on parents' faces, is so rewarding. I have continued working with this program as well as taking part in many of the other programs that serve this community so well. This organization is made up totally of hard working volunteers, and it is truly doing such good work for so many!!

Working with the students during Operations School Bell is very rewarding.  The organization has also given me an opportunity to keep my computer skills updated and exercise my mind.  This worthwhile group is a real asset to the Reno and Sparks communities.
Assistance League of Reno-Sparks	142387		/users/profile/188852	Katie99	Client Served	5	11/25/2012	This past year, I received an award from the Links to Learning program. I was able to help many of my students who were behind in their math skills because of the award which allowed me to purchase math skills workbooks that could be used for extra practice at home.  Thank you, Assistance League for providing the funds to help my third graders.
Assistance League of Reno-Sparks	142367		/users/profile/188831	sichi35	Volunteer	5	11/25/2012	Four years ago I was introduced to the Assistance League of Reno-Sparks at Women's Expo. Little did I realize I had stepped on a gold mine. This non profit  is  an all volunteer  organization. We have 12 wonderful programs that provide services to benefit individuals in need in our community with empasis on children, seniors, veterans and victims of abuse.Our programs are funded by grants, fundraisers and other donations as well as proceeds from our Thrift Shop located on Vassar Street. I  believe strongly  in giving back to the community in which you live and that is exactly what Assistance League of Reno-Sparks does. All services stay in Washoe County.
Assistance League of Reno-Sparks	141986		/users/profile/188403	jerry_waroff	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	Visitors to Assistance League of Reno-Sparks' building on Vassar Street in Reno are amazed at the flurry of activity that goes on there:  Six days a week volunteers man the Thrift Store and Senior Sampler consignment shop; the Food Pantry buzzes with members filling bags of food supplies, getting them ready for distribution to local low income seniors; Operation School Bell committee members organizing the next shopping event to clothe  low income elementary and middle school students; puppeteers rehearsing their next The Kids on the Block presentation to local school children on topics such as bullying and physical disabilities;  Links to Learning members completing their selection process to award grant money to teachers for school projects for which funding is not available; volunteers receiving and sorting donations for sale, with unusable items going to other area nonprofits; and meetings and administration involving all 12 philanthropic programs.

Assistance League of Reno-Sparks	141963		/users/profile/188381	L J Minotti	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	I joined Assistance League a year ago this past September.  They take the time to inform you of all their charitable endeavors before you even join. Because I serve as the PR photographer I go to most events to document it with photographs.   I have never been involved with a group of women where so many show up to help whether its to man the Thrift shop, help bag food for the food pantry or read to preschool children.   The camaraderie and friendships that develop from this 100% volunteer group is nothing less then inspiring.  This is by far the best volunteer group I have ever encountered or been involved with in my life.

ALRS' sophisticated organization is a 100% volunteer membership, governed by its formal By-Laws, Policies, Standing Rules and 12 diverse and impressively managed philanthropic programs...ALL run like clockwork. The Board is nurturing and communicative, open to new ideas from the membership, even new members who want to see an idea developed, vetted and worked through to completion. ALRS' motto is 'Caring and commitment in action' which perfectly describes our membership's united dedicated actions.
Assistance League of Reno-Sparks	142433		/users/profile/188903	jessie Scott,	Board Member	5	11/25/2012	Why do I volunteer at the Assistance League of Reno-Sparks?  Because I believe in what they do!  The League has more than 12 different programs that:  help feed the seniors, clothe the low income back to school children, help the veterans, help with assault victims, help to supply needed supplies to teachers in the local school district, sell hand crafted merchandise to customers that the local seniors have made and this helps to supplement their income, plus many more programs that the League does.  Through the League I can help to make a difference in our town.  I always feel this enormous pride when I see the difference that it makes to those who receive these benefits.  I know that I am volunteering in the right place.  Jessie Scott 
Assistance League of Reno-Sparks	141801		/users/profile/188189	lyle99	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2012	I am extremely impressed with the work done by the members of Assistance League of Reno-Sparks.  These hard-working volunteers put tremendous hours into a program which dressed needy school children in our community.

Next thing I new, I was joining the organization as a volunteer. Then I started to learn about all the philanthropic programs. I was particularly struck by how well things were organized. I am so happy working with this wonderful group of women who all have busy families but they all want to give something back to their community. I am proud to say that I am part of the Assistance League of Reno-Sparks where I get a chance to make a contribution to the work being done by them.
Assistance League of Reno-Sparks	141743		/users/profile/188123	Karen McGee	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	I'm astonished at the number of committed women in Assistance League who work together to better the people in our community, and I'm proud to be one of them.  The initial draw for me to join this organization was one program called Operation Schoolbell.  As a former teacher, I loved the fact that community folks were willing to dress many of our children living in poverty.  Today, I continue to work with children, but now through a program I helped start called Read to ME---a preschool literacy program whereby Assistance League volunteers read one-on-one to children ages 2-5  three times a week in the Boys & Girls Club preschool in Reno.  Recently, Assistance League joined forces with the Associated General Contractors and the Washoe County School District to raise 3000 books to start a lending library in that preschool.  The beauty of our organization is that women from every walk of life can find a niche where their energies, passions, and efforts provide needed and necessary aid to folks in our community.

Shane Victorino Foundation	283981		/users/profile/373963	teenshelpingteens	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/29/2016	Amazing group who does so much to help youth in Las Vegas and Hawaii too! Generous, organized, professional and though it's founder is a famous athlete, he is as down to earth and kind hearted as anyone I have ever met. He truly cares about making a difference and his wife likewise and always by his side for their charitable events. His staff is amazing too.

He is part of a team that is committed to the communities they represent. Whether it is Philly, Boston, Las Vegas or home on Maui, this Foundation has made a difference in countless lives of children year round.  I live on Maui and have first hand seen the results.  I volunteered last year and am looking forward to helping again this year.

Mr. Victorino came to the Philadelphia areaas part of a professional sports team, the Philadelphia Phillies. Soon after, he was more than just another baseball player but a member of this city and truly cared what happened here. His foundation Has provided numerous support to the children of the city by their generous gifts and the kids now lovewhen Mr. Victorino and his family come to visit so they can show them how much they have done. Even though he is no longer a physically part of our city, he will always be from our city!

Shane Victorino Foundation	72474		/users/profile/79232	Johnelle	Donor	5	02/21/2011	Most professional athletes with even greater fame and fortune than Shane, DON'T give back to their communities. Almost as soon as Shane received his first "real" contract, the Shane Victorino Foundation. They didn't go out and buy a plane, vacation homes in foreign countries, or other ridiculously lavish things. This just goes to show the ultimate character of these two amazing people. I have seen, first hand, the grateful recipients of Shane & Melissa's generosity. Giving the $900,000 to the Boys and Girls Club in Philadelphia, although a large sum, is but a tiny contribution in the greater scheme of things. I have no doubt that the Shane Victorino Foundation will continue to help the communities that it serves. For the first time, in a long time, the underprivileged kids in Philadelphia and on Maui have one thing money can't buy: Hope.
Shane Victorino Foundation	69853		/users/profile/76352	Jwybar	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	I am proud to be involved with the Shane Victorino Foundation for many reasons.  Despiite the short history of this foundation, they have already done so much for the communities of Philadelphia and Maui.  In my opinion it is more rewarding to be involved with a charity that has a specific focus and is making a dramatic improvement in that area.  This foundation has targeted the Boys and Girls Clubs of Philadelphia and Maui.  Both of these Clubs are in desperate need.  They don't have the books they need.  They can't provide food for these hungry kids.  The buildings are literally falling down.  The Shane Victorino Foundation has set out to change that.  Shane Victorino personally made a huge financial commitment and positive change is already taking place.  I look forward to doing what I can in the future for this great cause.
Shane Victorino Foundation	67649		/users/profile/73934	neilahmed	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2011	Neil-The Shane Victorino Foundation deserves a lot of credit for what they have done to better enrich communities in Philadelphia and Maui. Any one who can give back to their community, especially the youth is well deserving of praise. The foundation is working hard to renovate a boys and girls club in a "not so good" part of philadelphia and by doing this, are teaching the kids in the area that through hard work and persistence, anything is possible. When someone like Shane who is often looked up to because of on-field activity becomes a role model off the field, it shows how committed he is to use baseball as a tool for the bigger picture of helping the communities that have been supporting him his whole life. This foundation has helped many kids believe in themselves and trust that they too can do something positive with their lives.

Advisor	4	02/11/2011	I just recently got involved with the Shane Victorino Foundation and considering that it is not even a year old the work they have done and are doing is very impressive. I wok with many non profit organizations and few have the clear vision and direction that this one does, especially so early in its existence.  Shane is using the platform that baseball has provided him to do terrific things for kids in Philadelphia and Hawaii and I applaud him for that.  He has put his time and his money ($900K towards a Boys and Girls Club in Philly) where his mouth is...go Shane!
Shane Victorino Foundation	62284		/users/profile/68081	Michael	Donor	5	02/01/2011	Here is an organization that approaches fund raising in such a fun and unpretentious way.  They have a way of making you feel important no matter how you support them.  And unlike other organizations that raise funds for needy people/groups, there is never any pressure to keep giving, no one bothering you frequently...just plain good information and caring that makes you want to stay supportive for years to come.

LIGHT OF THE WORLD CHILDHOOD CANCER FOUNDATION, Inc	317476	1	/users/profile/408635	Patricia165	Client Served	5	10/31/2016	The cancer world can be a very scary and feel like a world that you live alone in. There are times when you feel like nobody else understands the pain that you are experiencing. It was two and a half years ago when I set by myself next to my little two-and-a-half-year-old son Darrien and was given the horrible movies that he had a very rare and terminal cancer. They were the worst words that I have ever heard and my world came to a crashing halt. I remember holding him as we said in the hospital trying to find a treatment and wondering what we were going to do. We had a very large family and we have many children at home while I sat with  my son at the hospital. It was at that time but a lovely lady named Mary came into my room and I just me  to light of the world. I all the sudden did not feel so alone and you thought there were others out there that are feeling the same way as I was and fighting the same fight. So a lot of the other mothers we have a son fighting the exact same cancer as mine it did not matter. We were a family and they were there to help me through whatever they could. They Have been there to help us financially when we were in need and to give us opportunities to make memories that we may never have a chance to make again.Can change what you were going through if there are people they can help you through it and maybe lighten the load just a little. Light of the world Foundation has been there for us help your spine does other mothers give us that emotional support needed. When you're faced with the cancer world and your little one is fighting for his life every moment, every memory, and every bit of support makes a world of difference. We are so grateful to have a lot of the world and all of those involved in our lives.
LIGHT OF THE WORLD CHILDHOOD CANCER FOUNDATION, Inc	315682	1	/users/profile/406988	Riobravo1	Client Served	5	10/27/2016	My daughter was diagnosed in January 2015.  Those 4 words (Your child has cancer) shattered our world. Immediately after diagnosis, was more surgeries and chemo.  Everyday was a blur and trying to adjust to this "NEW" normal was not easy.  My job let me go soon after her diagnosis, so we were left with just 1 income.  When you live off 2 paychecks, and then are handed this news that is now costing more than what you earned, it's just added stress. We do not have any family here either which also made it hard to keep up with all of the appointments & then school, the household & my husbands job.  We went to a fundraiser that was held by the Oncology clinic and it was overwhelming!  We were among other families facing the same struggles.  This is where I met Mary Ricciardi.  She was a breath of fresh air.  So loving and caring and a big smile that lit up the room.  She gave me a "Comfy Cooler" and listened to my situation.  This cooler was packed with things that I would be using but had no idea at the time just how important those items were!  Shortly after our meeting, she came by to our home and brought a "Blessing Box"  for my daughter.  The smile that this box brought to my daughters face melted my heart.  It was so nice to see my little girl smile even though she wasn't feeling very good.  In addition to this gift, LOTW also provides money to families in need.  Every little bit helps and to receive this gift made me cry.  I cannot thank this organization enough for all of the help they have provided.  NOT just the gifts, but the group itself.  I had a place I could go to that allowed me to share my thoughts & feeling with other cancer moms and it helped to know I was not alone.  Mary has created an amazing organization & I am blessed to call her a friend.

To walk with them through that battle and provide not just for monetary or physical needs, but emotional and spiritual needs as well. It has been a privilege and honor to volunteer for this organization, to visit families in the hospital, drop off "comfort coolers", watch children's faces light up over toys received, and to be able to pray over the families and in some small way, encourage them. Light of the World has been integral in shedding light on childhood cancer, bringing awareness to the community, and pushing for more research for the kids and families facing childhood cancer. This organization is a tremendous blessing to the families, volunteers, and community wide.

Light of the world offers financial assistance, emotional support and provides a close community of other families going through the battle of childhood cancer.  Through the financial grant it helps with costs occurred while your child is going through treatment, light of the world provides blessing boxes for the siblings who often feel pushed aside while their parents are desperately helping their other child go through treatment. Light of the world provides comfort coolers to families newly diagnosed, in these cookers you will find all the essentials to get you by during the initial diagnosis and treatment. Light of the world is very unique because it is faith based and offers prayers and spiritual grounding which is important during this battle, providing guidance and prayers from others who are either still fighting in this battle with their kids, or once were, is important because you can only truly understand if you've had a child diagnosed with cancer.  My family and son who was diagnosed at 2yrs old with childhood cancer is blessed to have community and support from light of the world. It's more than just a foundation it's a family!!!

The volunteers are such caring and compassionate animal lovers and make great sacrifices to foster and find forever homes for homeless cats and kittens in Las Vegas. A few years ago I found a stray pregnant cat. I didn't know what to do. I called Heaven Can Wait, ASPCA, and several other organizations, all whim told me they would help me abort the kittens and return the mom to the streets. Darci at All Fur Love Animal Society came to the rescue. She placed the momma with one of her fosters and within a few months, placed all 6 kittens and the momma cat with forever homes. I will always support Darci and her volunteers and hope to continue to spread the word of what a great organization AFLAS is.

I have adopted from a Cat Foundation before, along time ago for my previous cat. And there is just NO comparing to the difference in the quality of care that my kitty obviously got while I was waiting for her to come home (for one). And in bringing her home & being alone with her for the first time, it was obvious she had been well attended to, down to her diet even. She hasn't even had fleas, and this is the Desert. And the whole process Darcy & her team takes for the cats and for the new owners is just so wonderful & inspiring!!  We appreciate seeing all the Foundations out there doing the right thing & saving lives, but AFL is down right the best! They also have the cutest & sweetest kitties and seem to have blessed so many families with their work. And I'll tell ya, my Bella is a rescue (blessing) kitty alright - she rescued me & has been a tender, loving new companion for my other adopted older cat. I recommend AFL.

I've adopted from other rescue groups and you don't always see this, so it made me feel like we made the right choice in adopting from them. Oliver has been an amazing addition to our family and he makes us smile everyday. In the future if we decide to adopt another cat we will definitely be adopting from All Fur Love again !

Even though we work with another agency to Trap Neuter and Release cats in the mobile home park, we still get the occasional couple of kittens that need to go out for adoption.  Just one call and All Fur Love makes arrangements for a foster home and takes over all the care of the kittens. Sometimes the kittens are fostered at a non profit where special needs adults work during the day.  It's a great experience for them, too.

All Fur Love Animal Society	237225	2	/users/profile/321658	FurMomForever	Volunteer	5	01/23/2015	I have been a foster/volunteer with AFL for 2 years now. After having bad experiences fostering for local groups, I checked out AFL for a few months, on line,  before contacting Darci and Mark. Everything this group does is above and beyond for the cats/kittens. My husband and I foster kittens from birth to 3 months, sometimes with the mom sometimes without.  Knowing that homes are checked, dog greets are done, kittens are microchipped, spayed and neutered with up to date shots before they are adopted makes it all worth while and much easier to "give up" our fosters - knowing they are going to the best possible homes with loving families.  There is nothing Darci and Mark would not do to ensure the safety, health and happiness of any cat/kitten that crosses their path. It is truly a pleasure to foster for such a wonderful and dedicated group as All Fur Love!
All Fur Love Animal Society	237221	1	/users/profile/321652	jorockarr	Volunteer	5	01/23/2015	I volunteered with All Fur Love Animal Society by making a few home checks and helping in their office. Mark, Darci, and everyone else who has had a part in their rescue organization have been great and are continuing to save lives. That is what matters! And I fully support anything they do.
All Fur Love Animal Society	237220		/users/profile/321651	Reddiva2	Client Served	5	01/23/2015	We adopted 2, soon 3, cats from AFLAS. Besides the fact that they have the most  wonderful adoptable kitties, they are, by far, the most dedicated rescue organization I've ever known. They are very carefully screening the applicants for adoptions, hold fantastic fundraising events (the annual Kitten Pageant and the social Cat-Tails are great fun!), their calendar is just a must-have (the quality of the pictures is incredible!), and they really, really care about the animals. They are creating more responsible pet owners in this town. The cats we adopted from AFLAS were spayed/neutered, micro-chipped, healthy (with a coverage for health for 30 days) and, mort importantly, happy! Since the cats are in foster families, volunteers know the cats well, and they will tell a lot about them and help you find your perfect match. AFLAS is a wonderful organization!

All Fur Love Animal Society	103418		/users/profile/137784	dianecan	Volunteer	5	01/14/2012	This small local all volunteer non-profit animal rescue has great HEART!  All rescued animals are provided loving volunteer homes until they can be adopted.  And no animal is put up for adoption until it has been thoroughly checked by a certified veterinarian; received all necessary vaccinations; been spayed or neutered; micro-chipped; rabbies vaccination; deworming and more.  I am proud to be one of the few very dedicated volunteers of this humanitarian organization.  In addition, this small sincere group must do continually fundraising to continue rescuing another homeless animal.  
All Fur Love Animal Society	103322	2	/users/profile/137548	SusanRussell	Client Served	5	01/13/2012	My brother was running a construction site here in Las Vegas. A cat ran through the job and was killed by the equipment. He called me to tell me he found the kittens the cat was nursing and asked me for help. I sent out a plea to a list of hundreds of animal lovers, volunteers, rescues and others here in town and Darci from All Fur Love responded immediately. She said she had a nursing cat and to bring the kittens to her immediately. I ran them to Darci and was able to go inside her rescue. What I saw was a spotless clean rescue, free of any odor and perfectly groomed property with happy,purring and playing cats. I went where the mama cat was and saw how the kittens would be care for. Darci told me not to worry, but I did not have to. I saw the perfect scenario and the perfect set up and I knew everything would be fine. As the hours passed, Darci kept me informed as that time was crucial to make sure the milking cat did not reject these babies. As the weeks went by, Darci kept me informed with photos and updates. I have also worked as volunteers at the NSPCA Family, Fur and Fun Festival with Darci and her other partners at All Fur Love, which are her husband Mark and Mother Diane. Darci and her family worked tirelessly to help put on the event from start to finish and contributed many things including proving the generators for the entire event 4 years in a row. They also were instrumental in the success of the NSPCA Motorcycle Run. I can not say enough about Darci, Mark, Diane, All Fur Love and all they have contributed to Clark County. Thank you for all you do! Susan Russell

All Fur Love Animal Society	103238	2	/users/profile/137342	Suzie E.	Volunteer	5	01/12/2012	All Fur Love is a great organization.  They give their all to help cats find loving homes. And they truly LOVE each and every cat they rescue!   They are active in weekly adoption events and have a great ability to get animals adopted.  Plus, All Fur Love tries to educate people they meet about the benefits of spaying/neutering pets.  All Fur Love does so much with the limited funds they have, and I often wonder about how much more they could do if they could expand their financial capacity to reach more people.  If you are looking to donate to a 501.3c animal rescue in Vegas, and you want to make sure your donation will make a HUGE difference, All Fur Love Animal Society is the rescue for you!
All Fur Love Animal Society	103187	2	/users/profile/137110	rhquacker	Client Served	5	01/11/2012	I found myself thinking about an addition to the family, to keep the construction site rescue kitten entertained.  My 12 year old female tabby wasnt the slightest bit interested in the antics or energy of a young kitten.  So the search for a new family member began.   I meet the All Fur Love folks at a local cat show, explained my situation and got some online contact information.  After giving an addition to the family one more final thought, filling out & submitting an application and a little more discussion of my needs it was decided to look at males a few years old.   Then I was informed Id be contacted for a home inspection!  I was terrified!  What if my house was too small for three cats?  What if for some reason, one that loves her cats so much could be denied a new baby!  It was quite a relief when the inspector explained it was for health and safety reasons and that I had passed.   Soon after I was introduced to Tony the Tiger aka The Gentle Giant.  He was perfect.  A big 3 year old male tabby that was laid back enough to put up with the babys endless energy, yet still playful enough to keep up with her most of the time. I was assured if bringing a third cat into the home didnt work out with the crabby 12 year old, they could take Tony back into foster or if anything ever happened and I could no longer care for him they would find him a new purrfect furrever home. I dont think anyone really knows Tonys story.  A women had been feeding him in her back yard for a year until her husband said it was time to contact the County Animal Control to pick him up.  Thank goodness she contact All Fur Love instead.  Hes a good boy, my thought is he was probably abandoned in a foreclosure near by.    Tony came to us clean, handsome, altered, micro chipped and healthy on May 2, 2011.  He even smelled good!  Other than some initial resistance from the 12 year old female, Tony has fit into the family perfectly.  I cant imagine our home without him and will be furrever thankful to All Fur Love for bringing us all together.

I delt with the major transition of high school to college all while struggling with the stress of not having a a place to call home. I was a student working towards an honors degree and needed a safe place that would help support my goal of attending the university the following year. Finding NYEP has been a true blessing. There I was able to focus all me energies into graduating successfully, transitioning into college, learn skills vital to being fully independent, all in a loving and supportive environmentSince successfully graduating the program I am 11 credits from receiving my bachelors degree at the University of Nevada, Reno, have lived in my own apartment, held a job for nearly 2 and a half years at an office job, and studied oversees.I know the value of this program in young womens lives because of my personal experience and the ladies I have met go through it along the way. I have grown to care so deeply about this program that I have started a volunteer running group.  I encourage you to visit the program and meet the girls who are apart of NYEP and learn exactly what it is that they educated and prepare these young ladies to be successful in. Thank You NYEP for all the help and support you have given me and the help you give to the many other young women in our community!

I started volunteering with the organization over a year ago and, since then, I have been continually impressed by the staff and the clients.  I 100% believe in their philosophy and strategy for helping young girls turn into successful, productive adults.  The staff does everything they can to keep their clients from that slippery slope on which it seems necessary to rely on some form of life-long welfare.  More than that, they provide a loving home where young girls are able to safely and comfortably explore their interests and develop their personalities.  The girls are awesome, the constantly inspire me, and I can't wait to see where they go in life.  The feeling of hope and love that hits you as soon as you walk in the front door is a recommendation in itself.  I challenge anyone to get involved and not fall in love with the organization.   
Nevada Youth Empowerment Project	177147		/users/profile/233665	Neaner82	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/12/2013	NYEP is an organization that does exactly what it says it does. If you look at what they put out into the community - what they say when they speak in public, how they represent themselves, what they put on their website and on Facebook - and then you go and visit the site, you can see that they are the real deal and they are actually even more impressive than they make themselves out to be. A lot of young people you come in contact with - especially those in transition - seem unhappy, disrespectful, and like they don't care and have no direction, but when you meet the girls at the NYEP program, they are so vibrant and happy and you can tell how hard they are working on themselves and how proud they are to be part of the program. They volunteer, they help each other, and they have respect for themselves and others. They are like a family. The staff is awesome and you can tell they really care about what they do.

Hopefully in two years or less they leave the home and start enjoying living their life.

Josh Stevens Foundation	161181		/users/profile/213705	bekind	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/21/2013	     About three years a ago I attended a break-out session at one of our annual professional development days.  I am a High School Counselor and Drew Stevens (father of Josh Stevens) was the presenter.  He told his heart-breaking story about the tragic death of his son, Josh (11), gave us the background story about his son and his experiences, and explained the concept of the Be Kind campaign....in hopes that our schools would consider implementing it.  Drew was very well-spoken, yet completely heart-broken.  You could hear a pin drop, and there was not a dry eye in the room.  I left that meeting a different person after hearing his story.  It touched everyone.  The Josh Stevens Foundation that he started in honor of his son is a remarkable and unique concept to encourage students of all ages to "Be Kind."  The concept addresses "bullying," but in a more positive way.  Rather than give all the attention to the "bully" (negative behavior), the Josh Stevens Foundation casts a wider net for entire school campuses to implement a campaign to "Be Kind" (focus is on positive behavior).  It rewards and recognizes students for being kind, and gets everyone involved....teachers, administration, staff, students.  It's a school-wide commitment.  We need programs like this now more than ever!  Drew Stevens was just getting things off the ground when he presented his program to us a few years ago.  He's been on a mission ever since, and I've watched the Josh Stevens Foundation grow more and more through the years.  Many schools in Clark County (Elem., Middle, and H.S.) have adopted his program and he has even traveled to other states to present his story and help schools implement this amazing "Be Kind" program.  (Along with tangible rewards/recognitions, the t-shirt concept alone is super fun for schools to be creative with- and effective).  The tireless work that Drew Stevens is doing for his son, his family, our communities, and the Josh Stevens Foundation is worth recognition and implementation.  This program is relevant, simple to implement, and effective.  My hopes are that this outstanding program spread like wild fire through-out our nation.  BE KIND....like Josh.  :D

Josh Stevens Foundation	161172		/users/profile/213691	Jennifer269	Client Served	5	06/21/2013	I had the pleasure of meeting Josh Stevens and his family prior to his enrollment as a 7th grade student at Bob Miller Middle School.  Josh was a well spoken young man with a bright smile and an eagerness to learn.  Tragically, Josh's accident happened the second week of school - one month before his 13th birthday. Josh's family and friends rallied together and started the Josh Stevens Foundation.  The driving force behind the foundation was to honor Josh and the legacy of kindness that he left behind.  Josh's dad, Drew, has tirelessly traveled around the country speaking to church groups, little league teams, parent groups and schools about his son and the affect that Josh's kind heart had on others. Bob Miller Middle School was the first school to adopt the Be Kind program.  The goal is to "catch" students in the act of demonstrating genuine acts of kindness.  As you can imagine, this simple yet profound idea has taken off in most schools in the Clark County School District.  The Foundation has also made its way into different states and countries outside of the United States. The rapid growth has been amazing to watch.  The Josh Stevens Foundation has been able to fine tune their ordering process as well as their delivery system.  Every staff member is willing/eager to provide the help that is needed in order to implement the program. It is a privilege for our school to be a part of such a special Foundation that honors a special boy!

His message of kindness is spread throughout our school district. At my school all the students and staff have the goal of being kind like Josh. It has made a huge difference in our school climate!
Josh Stevens Foundation	161162		/users/profile/213682	jowen	General Member of the Public	5	06/21/2013	I learned of this charity at the workplace before I retired.  The compassion and true desire to overcome the family loss of Josh is expressed continually in all that they do to promote KINDNESS.  A tragic story has turned into a beneficial act of kindness.    Kindness needs to be continually out in front as I think the world is too busy and into themselves to have kindness as top of mind awareness.  It warms my heart when I have my" Be Kind ...like Josh" shirt on and meet others.  Exchanging conversation with others  on  how we got involved or just know about this truly wonderful organization is so inspiring.  We are all helping to spread the word daily because of the work they do.  Outstanding organization, outstanding family who are so humble.  Truly my favorite charity.
Josh Stevens Foundation	161158		/users/profile/213678	Soozy N.	Volunteer	5	06/21/2013	I became a volunteer with my daughter when she was a freshmen in high school.   We were looking for a some where for her to volunteer.  Then I remembered when we where at a conference the summer before. The Josh Stevens Foundation was there and how they touched all of us.  We called them asked them if they needed volunteers and they said sure.  We have been volunteering since.  I can't even explain how the volunteering I do makes me feel full in my heart.  I have a good relationship with the family and they have one with mine. I feel like we were meant to cross paths in life.  I receive e-mails to see how my family is doing and that makes my feel even happier and fuller in life for the volunteering that we have done for the Josh Stevens Foundation.  They Rock!!! Be Kind Like Josh!!! Is the message that is the message that is going across the nation.  I hope to see it in every state in 10 years.
Josh Stevens Foundation	161152		/users/profile/213672	thaley	General Member of the Public	4	06/21/2013	I first learned about the Josh Stevens Foundation at the elementary school where I work. The Stevens family's story is incredibly touching. We implemented the Be Kind program this past year with the students and staff. It was so amazing to see kids being kind to one another and being recognized for it. The kids were so proud to wear their Be Kind bracelets and t-shirts. I feel the program really encourages students and staff to be courteous, have patience, participate in acts of kindness, and discourage bullying.Around town, any day of the week, I can find people wearing a Be Kind shirt and it just makes me smile. My own little guy, who isn't even in school yet, has a Be Kind shirt and wears it proudly and reminds his little friends to be kind. I feel the Josh Stevens Foundation is doing big things here in Las Vegas and across the nation.
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	224207	1	/users/profile/287957	girlcat830	Advisor	5	10/19/2014	I've been a supporter of MHR since 2006.  I learned about MHR through the Fans of Barbaro website, and soon came to know Stephanie and Rob Pierce personally.  I have visited MHR three times for lengthy stays, and have sponsored a horse, Trooper, since 2008, in addition to being a regular donor.  MHR takes wonderful care of the horses, who are happy and healthy.  I have seen frightened, abused horses learn to love and trust under Stephanie and Rob's care. The horses' needs always come first with Stephanie and Rob Pierce.  MHR maintains transparency for all medical and financial transactions, so you really know where your money is going and why.  MHR also requires screening of adopters and adoption contracts, which requires that any adopter no longer able to care for or keep an MHR horse must return the horse to MHR.  I know from personal experience that MHR holds adopters to this requirement.  MHR also staunchly supports anti-slaughter and other equine welfare initiatives.  MHR does not take on more horses than it can care for, and Stephanie and Rob know each horse very well individually.   --Susan Eckles, St. Louis, MO
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	221312	1	/users/profile/285015	jeric	Board Member	5	10/09/2014	I have been associated with MHR since 2006 while following Barbaro.  I too was drawn to MHR through the owner, Stephanie Pierce and her genuine love for the plight of horses in need because of abandonment, neglect and abuse.  I have visited MHR several times and have since become a friend and supporter of the ranch.  Stepanie and her husband Rob care for and love these wonderful creatures like no other. Recent times have been difficult for the economy and it always seems to be the animals that suffer the most.  Financial support is essential and would be greatly appreciated.  It is necessary that Stephanie and Rob often use their own funds.  The horses always come first, always! It is an honor to support MHR.      
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	221245	1	/users/profile/284951	AlwaysnForever	Client Served	5	10/09/2014	I had a horse I could no longer care for due to major life changes.  It was a difficult decision but one that I had to do.  I visited a couple of other rescues and when I first visited Miracle Horse Rescue, I knew this was the place for my guy.  The horses in their care are well cared for and I can attest to the fact that donations are used where they are suppose to be, for the horses.  In these economic times I know it is difficult for many to give, but if you can please help as this organization wants to grow and it wants to rescue more horses from going to slaughter.  Please help if you can, as they helped me and my guy in our time of need.
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	221241	1	/users/profile/284946	nikkitta1982	Donor	5	10/09/2014	Professional individuals that far exceed the expectations of a non profit organization.  They are willing to sacrifice their personal needs to take care of the horses needs first.  As a donor I feel completely confident that my money is truly being spent on the horses in need.
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	221206	1	/users/profile/284913	Theguy	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	I had the honor of meeting the operators of this rescue.  Amazing individuals who run this organization.  Dedicated. I was given a personal tour and what I observed was former rescue horses, healthy and well cared. There is nothing hidden, donor funds are utilized for feed and veterinarian care and it shows.  The facility is clean very well organized.  They know the horses personally, and additionally the horses responded in a positive manner towards them, vying for their attention.  Animals with fear do not respond this way.  Stephanie could walk in the middle of these horses and they would crowd around her seeking a touch from her.  Would I continue to support this organization, absolutely because I personally witnessed where my money is spent.  They are hard working, and as I stated dedicated 1000 percent to these horses, that would not be here if they were not taken in my Miracle Horse Rescue.
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	221169	1	/users/profile/284880	brunoandmax	Donor	5	10/09/2014	I discovered MHR in 2006 thru the Alex Brown website which was formed during the vigil for Barbaro. Of all the rescue activity that was going on at that time on this venue I was drawn to MHR because of how genuine the owner Sephanie Pierce came across to me. Little did I know then that I would have the privilige of visiting MHR three times; watch 5 wonderful horses born; take part in rescueing 2 PMU horses and watch their babies being born: become a mom with 9 others to one of the first horses born and watched him grow into a beautiful , magnificient horse.Stephanie and Rob Pierce run MHR with so much love and care, the horses want for nothing--they are beautiful,hearty,well cared for animals. Any horse would be lucky to be a resident of MHR. It is a paradise on earth.
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	219553	1	/users/profile/283166	myhund	Board Member	5	10/03/2014	  I found MHR while following Barbaro.  I am not a horse racing fan but the plight of horses that have been mis -treated and/ or sold for "horse meat" tore at my heart. MHR takes  the disabled, mis-treated, no longer  wanted, only wanted for their urine type of horses and gives them a  dignified home for the rest of their lives. The owners put the horses first and their  lives second. Everything is done for the horses. They receive medical care and the best hay possible.  I have been fortunate to watch the births of foals whose mothers were slated for slaughter because they were no longer wanted.   MHR has a great adoption policy and the horses are followed after an adoption takes place. No rescue horses are sold but rather adopted out with a "take back" clause written in the contract.   So many non profits ask for money to pay "salaries" of the non profit. This is not the case at MHR. All  donations received go towards the care of these magnificant animals. 
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	218076	1	/users/profile/281581	SpiritMom	Donor	5	09/28/2014	I found out about Miracle Horse Rescue (MHR) through another website and was so excited to find out they were located about 60 miles from me.  In 2007 I was able to make my first visit to MHR and immediately fell in love with all the horses.  From babies to senior citizens, each individual horse is treated with love, kindness and compassion - the majority of them never knowing what that was like until they were taken in by MHR.  Some of these horses arrive severely abused and neglected and are evaluated by a veterinarian to determine their special needs to get them to their optimal health.  Every horse I have witnessed come through the gates of MHR receives top notch care and their needs always come first.  Stephanie and Rob have made these horses their top priority.  I am so proud to donate to Miracle Horse Rescue because I have personally witnessed how the donations are used for the welfare of these beautiful horses.  I am also honored to be part of a group of moms who adopted one of the babies who was born there.  
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	217821	1	/users/profile/281362	lucy836	Donor	5	09/26/2014	I have been an avid supporter of MHR for the last seven years.  It has been an honor and privilege to be a part of this amazing equine rescue.  Rob & Stephanie devote their love and care to these majestic creatures.  Some have been thrown away,neglected, abused.  Once they enter the gates of MHR they are greeted with love and compassion.  They live out their remaining days in this atmosphere.  Nothing is expected of them except to just be a Horse.  In the past years I have seen pregnant mares who would have gone to slaughter if not for MHR.  Instead they had their foals in a loving environment.  We watched this on MHR's live Web Cam.  If you can donate any amount to help Rob & Stephanie continue their plight to rescue and care for these beautiful equine.  As they are indeed Angels on Earth. Thank You  Lucy
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	217809	1	/users/profile/281350	LufJonah	Donor	5	09/26/2014	I first heard and became aware of Miracle Horse Rescue in 2006 and have been a supporter since that time.  Stephanie and Rob Pierce run a class act horse rescue.  Their deep knowledge of horses and their unconditional love of them shows in every aspect of the running of MHR.  I have visited MHR at least 5 times and always I feel at peace there because the horses in their care are at peace. They were all abused, neglected or not wanted anymore, but they have now an equine and human family that loves them.  The horses and mules at MHR are now safe and happy and will always be cared for.
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	217664	1	/users/profile/281201	1horselover	Donor	5	09/26/2014	I met Stephanie and Rob Pierce in 2001 soon after Miracle Horse Rescue opened.  Most of the horses at the facility have been abused, neglected, or just thrown away by their previous owners. I have visited the MHR facility many times over the years and have seen the love and care these horses receive.  It is a wonderful safe haven for thwm! Every penny received goes to the care of the horses. I am honored to support such a wonderful organization as MHR.  
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	217511	1	/users/profile/281035	ceela	Board Member	5	09/25/2014	I discovered Miracle Horse Rescue in 2006 or 2007 and have been an enthusiastic supporter ever since. I've visited the ranch in Pahrump several times and have had the honor of getting to know the owners/caretakers, Stephanie and Rob Pierce, very well, as well as other members of their family. They all have the magic touch in dealing with the various equines under their care. They know right away if one of the critters is ailing or injured and are dedicated to making sure they get appropriate care/food. Times have been especially tough in Southern Nevada and the stories of people and animals suffering through it are heartbreaking. Sad to say that right now (at the end of September 2014) MHR is at capacity in order to support the current equine population. There have been many wonderful adoption stories over the years, but right now people are not adopting. In addition, many/most of the horses at MHR are not suitable for adoption because of age, physical or mental condition. But they all have what they need and will be taken care of very well until their times do come. ANY financial support is very much appreciated as every dollar goes to the care and feeding of the equines and truly helps. It's my privilege to support this wonderful organization and I hope you will too.
Miracle Horse Rescue, Inc.	155715	1	/users/profile/206668	Patti V.	Donor	5	04/23/2013	I have been a supporter of Miracle Horse Rescue for nearly a decade now.  Although located in Nevada, and I am in Virginia, I had the pleasure of visiting Miracle Horse in February 2013.  This sanctuary is a haven for horses who are no longer wanted, needed, or were abused by their previous owners.  The facility is exceptionally well run by Stephanie Pierce and her husband, Rob.  Their obvious love of these gorgeous creatures is obvious.  I highly recommend Miracle Horse Rescue!
Shakespeare Animal Fund	250780	1	/users/profile/338672	Jeanne41	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2015	They were not able to help our family financially because of my location. However, their quick response to my application, caring words and efforts to refer me to another organization helped us in other ways. They showed me that they are truly an organization that cares.  I am sure that location specific charity organizations get bombarded by people that mass apply without bothering to read or review anything on their site. My thought is that such organizations are probably so overwhelmed by such applications that they would reply to out of area applications with a form letter or just ignore them. I did actually review the site and requirements for qualification, but apparently missed the geographic requirement. Facing an emergency situation I am not thinking all that well. But, as I previously mentioned, they replied with a personal email and phone call, and not only did they reply but they went above and beyond sending information about other organizations. So, if you are in the Northern NV area I would highly recommend either donating to this organization or contacting them in the event that you have an emergency and need assistance apply to them. Little Shakespeare must be proud!

I know that you felt that your contribution to a very special doggie's surgery wouldn't make much of a difference, but it did. Every bit added up to reach the goal and help her get what she needed. She had the surgery Tuesday evening and was able to come home a day later. She's got a lot of healing to do, but loves her post-surgery special diet. If not for people and agencies like yours, this would not have been possible. Many, many thanks.

It is exemplary in every way and a model for any cause, whether it be pets or humans, as we all know that reaching out is the best gift to oneself.

Shakespeare Animal Fund	103611		/users/profile/138544	M Ward	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	The Shakespeare Animal Fund in a wonderful 501(c) nonprofit organization that fulfills a very special niche in todays society.  All of us love our pets, and to some their pets are literally like their children; however, all of us do not have the same financial resources for dealing with catastrophic medical emergencies that can develop.  What does a senior citizen living on a fixed income or a disabled US military veteran living on a disability pension do when their beloved companion animal suffers from an accident or injury that they are unable to pay?  Do they chose not eat so they can provide for their pet?  The Shakespeare Animal Fund helps resolve such troubling dilemmas by providing funding for emergency veterinary services.  The compassion and enthusiasm for this organization and its volunteers is amazing. 
Shakespeare Animal Fund	103553		/users/profile/138441	Allen G.	General Member of the Public	5	01/17/2012	When I first heard about Shadespeare Animal Fund (SAF) I was both amazed and grateful. I did some research and then met the founder. The folks who work with this organization are PASSIONATE about saving animals. They are well organized and have  desire to grow accross America. Their time is donated so that the funds raised help more animals well being or save them from execution. This organization cares more about the animals than who the animals belong to, and that is truly a nondiscriminatory practice that should be modeled by all. Whether you are senior citizen who is losing a deared companion, an HIV+ patient who can hardly afford your medications losing the only friend (pet) you have, or a middle class family losing one of children's pets, Shakespeare Animal Fund will do their best to help. I am so amazed at their love to care for the animals and their open policy all who are in need are welcome that I too will commit to their cause. My magazine will be running a story on SAF next month. I urge all who can help in anyway to do so in your own way.

I have been a volunteer only for a few months, and have enjoyed seeing the possibilites of what an organization like this can make.There is too much suffering from our pet population......especially in this area......and too much stress comes from not having the necessary funds to take care of one's sick pet.  If Shakespeare Animal Fund exist's ------An Elderly Individual might not have to make a choice from having to buy their own medication to taking care of their sick pet.

All pet owners know, or learn quickly, how much vet bills can be. What happens to sick or injured pets whose owners can't pay for emergency treatment for them? In Northern Nevada, we're here to help them. The stories we hear are very sad, but as our founder says, we provide happy endings.

When owners cant afford to pay for much needed emergency veterinary care, Shakespeare steps in.

Torino Foundation	290384		/users/profile/380703	Katherine44	Volunteer	5	05/19/2016	When I first heard about Torino Foundations camp for children with autism I was excited and nervous at same time for my daughter. I was excited for the opportunity she would have of experiencing camp and nervous because I was not sure how she would react to the new environment.  Camp TLC was a life changing experience for Kealani.  Torino Foundation has given her the opportunity to experience camp just like a typical child.  She looks forward to going to camp, seeing her friends and meeting new friends. Torino Foundation has also made an impact on my sons life.  Alec has been a peer buddy for Camp TLC for a few years and has moved on to become a junior counselor.  He volunteered as a junior counselor for Camp TLC, Camp Heart and Sole and Camp Core in 2015.  He plans to continue to volunteer for Torino Foundation every year.    Torino Foundation provides a fun, safe and loving environment for the children who attend camp. The people on staff are trained and are amazing with the children.  They go out of their way to make everyone feel accepted not only during camp, but also outside of camp during other events they provide for the children throughout the year.

Torino gives special needs children opportunities they would never have otherwise, and helps create memories for a lifetime.

Torino Foundation	290324		/users/profile/380637	atagirl	Client Served	5	05/18/2016	As a young child with autism, you are unable to participate in so many milestone events that typically developing children attend.  Whether it be due to your sensory issues, your challenged social skills or your struggles to communicate your wants, needs or feelings, living in a body with this neurological disorder is tough.  The Torino Foundation offered my daughter the chance to attend summer camp in a safe, accepting and nurturing environment that this mom never thought would be possible.  She's 18 now and has so many happy memories of her camp experiences that she still proudly displays her Summer Camp door plaque on her bedroom door that she gets to see every day.  She talks about the friends she made, the fun she had swimming, dancing, games around the campfire and sleepovers all the time.  Thank you, Torino Foundation for bringing some normalcy to Jamie's childhood and giving her life lasting memories that she cherishes and helps her embrace her abilities.  Navigating the world of autism has brought us to many non-profits.   They all have the right intention but Torino Foundation knocks it out of the ballpark for us.  I just hope you're around a hundred years from now because you know how to make that difference.  From the bottom of this mom's heart,  THANK YOU.

Torino Foundation	290307		/users/profile/380618	cindyhuebner	Volunteer	5	05/18/2016	I would give them 10 stars if I could. My son went to their autism camp for the first time last year. As a nervous mother, I didn't want to just send him without finding out what really goes on. So I volunteered.  I saw firsthand how they accepted my son and made sure every need was met, that he had fun and it was all done safely! They have it down, thinking of everything.  The way the med shed functioned really impressed me. So many kids with different meds at different times. How do they keep track of it all? Well, their system is efficient and runs smoothly. Also, same thing with the dietary needs of each of the campers! How do you keep that straight? Again, saw firsthand how they operated and everything ran smoothly. But most of all, the kids had fun! Away from therapy and doctors, they made sure kids can just be kids (safely, of course). My son ate and did things I never thought he would. Looking forward to this year.  I would 110% be comfortable sending him alone (he's on the lower end of the spectrum) but I also got so much out of it, I'm honored and more than willing to volunteer again. Also, we have been invited to all of their amazing events such as the Hop N Bop (don't have to worry about kids pushing your child over because they are slower for Easter eggs), movies, they help with parents night out, etc.  We have become part of their family and I can't thank them enough! Feeling included instead of excluded!  Love all of those dedicated hard-working saints at Torino!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!

My son isn't healthy but he is happy.  He becomes even happier when he goes to summer camp at the Torino Foundation Ranch.  It is the one single thing he ask for and talks about.  When he was granted a Make a Wish trip, he said he wanted to go to Camp I am.  The people involved with this organization are amazing and this mother can not say thank you enough for giving my son a weekend of fun and just being treated as a normal kid.  The love I feel for this group is amazing.

Torino Foundation	289787		/users/profile/380037	Julie258	Client Served	5	05/13/2016	My son, Jacob, has participated in Camp I Am for children on the Autism spectrum sponsored by the Torino Foundation for the past two years.  It has been a life-changing experience for him.  He has been given the opportunity to attend sleep-away camp like a typical child, swimming in a lake, making arts and crafts, and singing songs at a campfire.   These activities are usually out of reach for my child due to his frequent inappropriate social behaviors.  But with the carefully selected and trained staff at Camp I Am, he is accepted for who he is.

What can I say about Cardte, she is a warm loving person that believes in giving back. Sure hope that someone will finally sponsor her programs with more than she has been giving. I have known her to put up her own money just to make sure her kids would be able to attend her camps for free. I wish her the best and yes I would volunteer anytime if asked.

Street Teens A Nevada Non-Profit Corporation	179460		/users/profile/236104	haysrpcv	Board Member	5	10/18/2013	Nevada Street Teens is an exceptional organization in the way it runs its daily operations and manages its finances.  The executive director is a caring individual, an amazing grant writer and conservative manager of resources.  She is able to write successful grant proposals due to the interaction she has with the youth and can share real stories with potential donors.  Other organizations often lose touch with those they serve but Street Teens is large enough to be effective and small enough to maintain contact with its beneficiaries; while maintaining contact with those who have improved their circumstances.
Street Teens A Nevada Non-Profit Corporation	165250		/users/profile/219670	Amy_94	Donor	5	08/17/2013	I learned of Street Teens' work back when they operated out of a van to minister to homeless teens in the Las Vegas area (late 1990''s, I believe).The gravely needed support Lisa's team now provides is thanks to all the contributors, both great and small (like me) ,who know the value of being loved unconditionally. The young adults who drop into Street Teens see the unfettered devotion that all the ST volunteers share every day. God love you all!!!!    Amy
Street Teens A Nevada Non-Profit Corporation	165020	1	/users/profile/219339	valarie7	Volunteer	5	08/14/2013	My experience at Street Teens began in 2003.   A friend told me about this amazing organization that opened its doors every evening to help the homeless you in the Las Vegas Valley.  I was touched by the work they were doing.  I completed the volunteer training and started helping out.  The nights I was there we helped an average of about 25 youth per evening.   Street Teens provides the simple things that mean so much to those youth, and it was so rewarding to be a part of the organization.   I later organized a group of my co-workers to visit the center and mentor the youth on job seeking skills.   Street Teens gives back to the community every night of every year and I am honored to be associated with such a dedicated group of people.

Street Teens A Nevada Non-Profit Corporation	164419		/users/profile/218498	Lisa258	Volunteer	5	08/07/2013	I just love Street Teens! it was in 2003 that I started volunteering there.  I started at the old location and we had sometimes up to 20 kids coming in each night.  I can't imagine what these kids would have done if Street Teens was not there.  There is such a great need for this type of organization.  It meant a great deal to me to know that they were getting a hot meal, a hot shower, clothing, resources to help them find jobs, a place to rest their head, food, toiletries and an ear to just listen. These kids became family.  All the people that are associated with this organization have their hearts fully into these kids as I did.  I became a donor and to this day will volunteer or help in any way needed to help these kids that have to live on the streets in Las Vegas.  They are now in a newer location which is very nice for the kids.  We need to come together as a community and help.  If you are looking to find a place to make a difference, please think of Street Teens.  You will not be sorry and you will put a huge smile on a teens face.

The youths they serve are being taught skills they wouldn't otherwise learn, and they are being given a chance to improve their lives in a meaningful and empowering way.  To mimic a previous comment, I am a third year student at the William S. Boyd School of Law and a colleague of the student mentioned below who was supported by Street Teens when things got tough.  She is a brilliant woman and less than a year away from becoming an attorney in Nevada.  She's giving back to her community; paying it forward.  All in all, every organization is going to have a few people that think they know how to run things better, but this particular organization has definite results that validate all of the hard work of the volunteers and staff.  
Street Teens A Nevada Non-Profit Corporation	164374		/users/profile/218449	Pjohns	Board Member	5	08/07/2013	I began volunteering for this fantastic organization in December 2001, under founder, David Mereaux, who passed away in July 2002.   I currently serve as President and I am proud to say that we run a very "tight ship"; 84 cents of every donation dollar is expended on direct services for the homeless and at-risk youth we serve every day of every week over the last 12 years!   Just 16 cents is expended on operations activities. I am proud of my hard working, dedicated fellow board members; a small business owner, banker, METRO police department detective, high school teacher and retired UMC employee.   Our executive director has been tirelessly running our business since 2003.   I can say that there was NOTHING more rewarding than attending graduation ceremonies at UNLV for Pandora who completed her studies in under 4 years and is currently attending the Boyd School of Law!  And, in June 2013, I ran into Rooster at Costco in Henderson.  When we hugged, he apologized for being sweaty from work!   He has gained weight and looks incredibly healthy and happy.   He said he was considering coming back to Street Teens as a volunteer!   The work we do IS LIFE CHANGING! Our doors will remain open every night of every week . . . whether we have 1 homeless teenager or 50.

Members of the public, volunteers, donors, were always allowed to attend board meetings (except during portions that were "closed" to protect confidential information, as all boards must do).  Street Teens is run by committed, caring people who are doing their best to help homeless and at-risk youth.  I have never met a group of people who always go above and beyond to try to do what is right.  I met many youth whose lives were changed by this organization.  
Street Teens A Nevada Non-Profit Corporation	100660	1	/users/profile/123888	Marcia23	General Member of the Public	2	11/15/2011	I find it sad that almost half of the income taken in goes out in salaries and most of that is to the director.   I notice that she also received a $3,000 raise in these financially trying times and I wonder who is authorizing this action.In 2010 I worked there and was not allowed to attend the board meetings,  donors also were not.   I have been told that since moving into their new building  they have been averaging 5 to 8 clients PER DAY , certainly not the amount they claim.  It's a great idea, but over paying for staff and overstating amount served is not right.

She is at St. Jude's Ranch 3 days a month (if it coincides with her board meetings over at Boyd Gaming where she makes $220,000). She makes $476,422 a year at St. Jude's, stops in fires a few dedicated employees, creates a culture of fear and backstabbing and leaves. The pictures in her office are at least 8 years old. The employee turnover is 80% and the occupancy rate of the youth is below 50%. There are multiple EEOC cases for terminating employees that were on work comp leaves and Harassment lawsuits currently filed. The place sucks all around. DFS needs to step in and clean house. Finally the idiot HR Director is gone, Spadafor has been demoted out of CEO and 9 Board members have run for cover. Get rid of Carlye DuPart and the idiot running the thrift store who is egotistical and stealing, the transitional living program director who sells the stuff she steals from the kids warehouse and sells on local Facebook yard sales and the place might have a chance.
St Judes Ranch for Children Inc	207039	4	/users/profile/159477	0-10	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/23/2014	St. Jude's Ranch for Children has come under intense scrutiny lately for abuse by the very people that are supposed to be creating a safe haven for abused children. In the last 16 months that I have been sub-contracting for this organization, I have seen upper management fire some very fine, loving, hardworking individuals that truly cared for the children. The CEO, who is seldom even at the headquarters shows up, creates a great deal of chaos, then leaves. I have spoken with the employees about the CEO and they say that "whenever she shows up, someone gets fired". The employees are in constant fear of losing their jobs, which the children pick up on, creating fear in the youth that are already suffering from reactive attachment disorder. It is a very toxic environment for everyone involved. The board members, who should be evaluating the CEO, and other Directors do not hold the CEO accountable for the out of proportion turnover of employees. I was told that the Director, Christina Vela, quit and walked off the campus without saying anything to the youth. I later found out she was fired by the CEO, who then lied to everyone one by saying that Christina did not care enough to say good bye to them. The organization is falling apart, being investigated for several State and Federal violations and the Board of Directors are sitting by doing nothing. Shame on you St. Jude's Ranch for Children! Step down Christine Spadafor you are doing more damage than good.

I have seen a little girl mistreated at the library by a St Judes staff member. I see St Judes residents mistreated in the local schools.I regularly feet and nurture a resident at St Judes because he is not being fed at the ranch so before you want to go around giving 5 stars to an organization you know nothing about, do a little bit more investigation other than taking the word of a woman named Christine who rake in over 2 million dollars a year in profit from her nonprofit. there is no accountability for how they treat the children there or rather, mistreat the children.many of the children grow up lost tossed out into the street upon turning 18 the staff members are basically just sitting around collecting salaries for nothing very similar to a welfare check.  A better idea what to be to leave these children with their neglectful natural parents and let them collect a welfare check.

Board Member	5	06/28/2012	St. Jude's Ranch for Children is an extraordinary organization that provides much needed services for children. They provide homes that are loving and welcoming, educational programs that create a strong foundation for necessary life skills, and they ensure that the children who arrive on their doorstep are safe and secure - physically, mentally, and spiritually. St. Jude's Ranch is a wonderful community partner, and my family and I have had the great pleasure of participating in the numerous holiday programs and other special events that take place regularly at the Ranch. Meeting the children and hearing how their lives have been enriched and saved by St. Jude's confirms that supporting the Ranch through volunteerism, or financial support, or both, is simply the right thing to do. We are so very fortunate to have an organization of this high caliber in Southern Nevada and I challenge everyone who cares about children to find a place in their heart to support St. Jude's Ranch. 
St Judes Ranch for Children Inc	117064		/users/profile/159252	kwbollom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2012	I have seen the work of St. Judes Ranch for Children first hand. I have worked for them for the past two and a half years at their Pregnant and Parenting Teen location in New Braunfels, Texas. Our Staff is dedicated to breaking the cycle of abuse and neglect for these children in our care. While they are residents in our facility they learn the proper skills needed so that one day they may be the kind of parent to their child that they did not have growing up.
Women Of Diversity Productions Inc	42248	6	/users/profile/42974	msd1	Volunteer	4	05/31/2010	Women of Diversity is the consummate source of contributions made by women to the history, community and legacy of this city, this state, and elsewhere. My first experience with this organization was as an audience member of a project they supported for Black History Month. I immediately got involved in all of their projects and productions. I worked the Shower of Stars with popular performers from the Las Vegas Strip; several Black History Month projects, beginning with Sojourner Truth; and the 100 years Centennial project about women - which became a lesson in Nevada History for me as well. I've been an audience member of their ongoing film projects. The conscious, diligent commitment of their founding president, Marlene Adrian, ensures that no major accomplishment by a woman will go unnoticed in our community
Women Of Diversity Productions Inc	41835	10	/users/profile/42624	lisa30	Volunteer	5	05/29/2010	In 2001 I was looking for a job after recently returning to Las Vegas, Nevada. I found Women of Diversity in the phone book and the name alone inspired me to call and seek employment. As a non-profit the organization works on a very tight budget so no paying jobs were available. I was so impressed with the mission of the organization that I became a volunteer. What a wonderful, needed organization here in Las Vegas! There has been so much history made in this community but for the most part only the well-known are highlighted. Women of Diversity sees to it that the contributions of women who have made a significant mark in their community are recognized. This is an organization that needs so much support in order to continue its good work. I am proud to be a volunteer and an advocate for Women of Diversity.
Women Of Diversity Productions Inc	41686	8	/users/profile/42482	dgh	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	I got involved by helping at all functions.

Women Of Diversity Productions Inc	41244	6	/users/profile/41990	women-of-diversity-productions	Former staff	5	05/27/2010	I worked with Women of Diversity for 13 years. I helped with many projects. I helped get grants from Nevada Arts Council, Las Vegas City Centennial, Nevada History Project, Nevada Humanities, Meyer Foundation, along with others. We made videos of Influential Women and created a Wall of Women that hung in the state Capital as well as libraries throughout Nevada. The mission of Women of Diversity is to enhance the lives of women and therefore of society.
Women Of Diversity Productions Inc	41167	8	/users/profile/42045	hew	Volunteer	5	05/27/2010	Several years ago, I offered to maintain Women of Diversity's [WOD] web-site; eventually to reDesign and maintain it. I was attracted to this organization due to the passion I observed by Dr. M. Adrian; a passion for truth and a need for public awareness of women who have and do contribute greatly to our community. The whole organization rings true with a unified passion and their message is presented as documented, personal truth. Those who view WOD's productions are reminded and encouraged to become of aware of one individuals ability to enhance their environment, even over and through the harshest opposition.In particular, I have seen Kim Russell portray Sojourner Truth in a monologue at the library celebrating Black History month. WOD was filming the live performance that captured this impassioned person recapturing a monumental story of a woman claiming and proclaiming herself when at one time she was not her own to claim. The production that WOD released can be checked out of our Las Vegas library and viewed by all. The film reminds me that freedom is not free and that I must assert myself to become the best I can inspite of oppostition.As a participant, I enjoyed a hands-on workshop where Dr. Adrian worked with a group of locals. Her focus, her passion, and her profession, "Women in Motion" [also the title of one of Dr. Adrian's books] took our group through motion. I took home the message that simple and proper motion does not have to be strenous in order to promote health. It was a fun workshop and ended to quickly for me.For the 100 Years project, I helped photograph schools as well as update their web-site.Dr. Adrian gives of her time generously, driven by her passion for the projects she works on. One of the first projects I assisted her with was teaching at the local youth center. Her goal was to give these youth a self-expression in the form of a web-page. And as needed, I helped moved whatever needed to be simply becuase I enjoy the interactions I have with the members of the organization.In short, from President Marlene Adrien to its active members, Women of Diversity is about honoring and empowering women by acknowledging past achievements as well as motivating future accomplishments.

I have been involved with this wonderfulorganization for many years. The advocates have helped many of the families that I come in contact with.Many families experiece frustration when looking fro educational supports for their children.Nevada PEP works closely with many districts throuchout the state of Nevada to provide assistance for the families of these children.Students have a far greater chance to succeed within an educational setting when Nevada PEP is involved!!
Nevada P E P Inc	78577		/users/profile/85859	Cblanch	Donor	5	02/27/2011	Most parents do not even realize the extra emotional strain, physical effort, and expense it takes to care for a child with disabilities. We take it for granted that we wake up our children, we feed them and take them to school. It is NOT that easy for a parent with a child with special needs.  I have seen first hand the labor of love that my very best friend has undergone with the constant care for her son.  She has been blessed with the assistance from the Angels at Nevada PEP. They have assisted her with her sons challenges with school and therapies, etc. They offer monthly IEP clinics to help parents understand the special education process. Nevada PEP offers assistance to Parents with training, resources and support to children with disabilities ages 0-26.

It was not until I found NEVADA PEP, that I was able to cope.   We have been with NEVADA PEP, for over 9 years, and all through ALL of the workshops that they continue to provide to families of children with disabilities,  they just quite simply make "our world" a better place! The entire staff at NEVADA PEP, just somehow makes you feel, like hey, "everything is going to be oaky", and with all of the training and strategies I have learned, WE ARE OKAY.

He was having many difficulties in this transition, and noone could help.  That is until someone told me to contact Nevada PEP.  From that third grade until his high school graduation and beyond, Nevada PEP was always there for us.  With workshops and information and the latest in the laws, to attending and assisting in getting him the best IEP's possible, they were always there for me.  That is why I turned around and volunteered, and sat on the Board for eight years.  To give back for all they did for us.

I have called numerous times just to ask questions like "Is there anyone in town who can help with . . ." or "Is there a such thing as a therapist who helps with . . ."  Any question I have related to my child's special needs has been answered.  They have helped me understand more about the school system and the IEP, even going with me to an IEP meeting to help me in getting my daughter's needs met.   The best thing is that when something happens and I am really upset, they are just a phone call away.  They listen, sympathize and help me to solve my problem.  Don't know what I would do without them!

The Iam Workshop Tour E0703212007-6	80769		/users/profile/88158	Michele B.	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	I met the founder at my church. I am a recovering addict and I know from personal experience through Carson City's rehab centers that the I AM Workshop Tour-Pure Compassion is the best recovery program there is.   Meth is a big problem in Carson City alone. I know this because I was a victim to Meth for years.  I know that with the ProMeta Treatment Program that the I AM Workshop Tour-Pure Compassion has will help anyone who honestly and sincerely wants help from their addiction.  The I Am Workshop Tour-Pure Compassion is faith based where the other rehabs in Carson City are not.  At other rehabs you are not allowed to read a bible or do anything that is based on religion.  I was told that if I was allowed to study my religion then everyone would be allowed to and that would cause a conflict within the rehab.  Since volunteering with I Am Workshop Tour-Pure Compassion and helping with organizing the events I have become closer with my creator, my Father and my Savior.  Thank you Alan for your support in my recovery. I wish that I could have gone through your program as it is faith based and I believe I would have gotten stronger in my religion.  But through you I am getting stronger in my faith, because we have the same beliefs.  Thanks again!!

Personally, I have know Alan Sweet for over three decades and have observed him going full-circle.  As well, my wife and I have family members who have struggled with substance abuses and therefore know what it takes.  And yet the IAM Workshop is at least one step beyond: they offer hope upon hope, for it is in the context of the Gospel of Christ.

The cause of helping people break drug and alcohol addictions is a serious and noble matter. We all know somebody...  I have been involved almost daily, now, learning more about addiction treatment issues, various treatment approaches, Non Profit organizations in general and now am learning grant writing in particular.I strongly believe the I AM Workshop Tour can and will one day be a leader in drug and alcohol addiction treatment programs; provided we can get proper and sufficient funding. Week in and week out we receive kudos and many kind words of encouragement and support of our endeavor.Its both an honor and privilege to be associated with the I AM Workshop Tour.

When you lose close friends, family members and colleagues to alcohol and/or drug abuse or you witness their lack of functionality and accomplishment when they are under the "spell" of this disease, you soon realize that eradicating this vicious "monster" is in ALL our best interests. The I AM Workshop ,and Alan and Michelle Sweet have proven that their intentions, work and heart-felt efforts are not only valuable but also critical. I applaud their work, their core beliefs and ethics and their willingness to unselfishly assist this terrible and MUCH too common affliction.

These people wait patiently in line for their turn for food or shots.  While waiting we talk with these people.  Their stories are heartbreaking, however, one thing in constant, the love they have for their pets. All of them will go without food in order to ensure their pet has food first.  They love their animals with all their heart and many times, their pet is their only companion, friend and family. God Bless Pets of the Homeless and Street Petz for all you do!!

Many others want to do even more by volunteering to pick up pet food from the collection sites and deliver it to the many distributing organizations that have partnered with us.  Some volunteers even take the pet food to where they have seen encampments.  It is through all these efforts that Pets of the Homeless grows stronger each year.  Now going into our fifth year we can report that as of today with your help we have spent over $120,000 on veterinary care across the country that has helped over 8,600 pets.

We are the first in the nation to organize a Spay/Neuter day at a homeless encampment along with one of our partners/rescue group.  Our volunteer veterinarian spay/neutered 20 dogs and cats, administered vaccinations, and minor aliments. We are proud to belong to such a supportive non-profit organization who truly cares about the best friends of the less fortunate. 
Feeding Pets of the Homeless	57991	1	/users/profile/61521	Jan Baron	Volunteer	5	11/28/2010	I am a realtor and have seen many foreclosure pets in the past three years. I see Pets of the Homeless as a way of keeping pets out of shelters.  This is a great organization doing their part to save each pet from being surrendered to a shelter. Companion pets are essential to the well being of the homeless and those who have been hit by the recession.
Feeding Pets of the Homeless	95349		/users/profile/50489	kathi4	Volunteer	5	08/09/2011	Pets belonging to the homeless have no choice or voice about their life situation or experiences.  Volunteers for Pets of the Homeless have directly changed and improved the lives of these animals.   Genevieve Frederick, Executive Director and Founder, is a selfless person who has touched many lives.   Her tireless efforts have made Pets of the Homeless a national non-profit organization with an outreach to animals across the country.   Pets of the Homeless volunteers have a passion for animals in such circumstances and they become directly involved to make things happen.  Volunteers organize community collection sites for donated pet food.  Because the homeless have no way to carry or handle large amounts of pet food, they repackage pet food into smaller quantities which are easier to manage. Volunteers recruit distribution sites such as soup kitchens and homeless shelters where the pet food can be given to the homeless for their pets. Volunteer veterinarians with grants from Pets of the Homeless organize and provide special clinics for these animals.  Clinics include wellness examinations, immunizations, treatment for minor conditions and sometimes includes spaying and neutering. Pets of the Homeless will provide animal crates free-of-charge to any shelter which will allow the homeless refuge with their pets. This is an incredible organization which reaches beyond the United States into Canada and includes influence in Australia.  The lives of animals are changed and on occasion literally saved.
Feeding Pets of the Homeless	49221	5	/users/profile/50489	kathi4	Volunteer	5	08/05/2010	Of course, as a volunteer board member and newsletter editor, I have a soft spot in my heart for Pets of the Homeless.  This is an amazing, non-profit organization with a volunteer outreach across the United States and in Canada.Pets of the Homeless provides grants to veterinarians who go where the homeless are to provide clinics, at no charge for their pets.  Volunteers collect food and pet supplies which are taken to distribution locations to be given to pets of the homeless.  Often, when the homeless seek assistance for their pets, they are able to find resources for themselves.           Most homeless shelters do not allow animals.  Upon request, Pets of the Homeless Crate Program will provide free crates, cleaning supplies and bowls to shelters that will allow pets with their owners access into the shelter.
Feeding Pets of the Homeless	58468	1	/users/profile/62269	crittersincourt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/04/2010	I'm an animal law attorney in the D.C. metropolitan area, where there is a significant, growing population of homeless and near-homeless folks.  I've watched people in my community 'transition' from being 'middle-class' to being homeless in a matter of weeks or months.  Most homeless shelters don't allow pets and many homeless folks are faced with the horrible choice between losing a beloved companion to a shelter, where the pet may be first  in line for the gas chamber as an "owner givaway" or taking the pet to a feral colony and hoping for the best---the odds disfavor the elderly and infirm.  Thank goodness for Feeding The Pets of the Homeless; this service has more value than we can quantify in raw dollars and cents, which I would gladly contribute if I (and my four elderly cats) weren't standing on the precipice of homelessness ourselves.
Feeding Pets of the Homeless	44576	1	/users/profile/45483	stephanie19	Donor	5	06/19/2010	This charity was recommended last Christmas on Cake Wrecks, where we were all giving money to commemorate the holidays.  The picture at the top of their home page fair broke my heart, and being a lifelong dog-lover, and having been homeless for nearly a year (I was *very* fortunate being able to get my Section 8 so quickly), I know how hard it is to keep connected to society at large, and what a tragedy it is there aren't any homeless shelters that allow pets.  Knowing if my baby-girl dog had still been alive when I became homeless that I'd have made the same choice as these folks, I want to help them as much as I can.  Pets of the Homeless makes sure these precious companions are kept well-feed and healthy, giving their mommies & daddies one less thing to worry about.Our four-legged companions are so often overlooked in times of human tragedy, and yet it's often our four-legged companions that keep us going.  I'd highly recommend anyone who has a few dollars to spare to give the cash to Pets of the Homeless, or buy some dog or cat food and take it to a connection site.  You'll make two souls' journey on this Earth a bit easier.
Feeding Pets of the Homeless	25820	1	/users/profile/26822	tinac	Volunteer	5	01/19/2010	Feeding Pets of the Homeless is an excellent organization.  I found this organization after encountering a homeless person and their pet.  After I called and sent a few emails I realized just how great this organization was.    It encourages people to become involved by setting up collection sites for pet food so food can be distributed throughout. I liked the way that everyone can be involved. They also post financials on their website for you to view. I recommend this organization to anyone who would like to help or donate.

There can't be a more underserved and necessary cause!   The Little Miss Hannah Foundation has worked closely with the National Gaucher Foundation and other rare disease organizations to target the unmet needs in the rare disease community.

Additionally, each year a huge family fundraiser is held on Hannah's birthday to raise additional awareness and funding.  The LMHF has become an important organization for families who have children who are seriously ill.

I watched their family grow in leaps and bounds and watched them as they fought for their daughter Hannah to get the best medical attention for the disease she had, Gauchers Disease. They were determined to spend what time they had loving Hannah, comforting Hannah and fighting along with her to live.  When Hannah passed, they wanted to help others who have children who also were diagnosed with rare diseases.  The foundation helps families enhance the quality of life they have in the short time that is left. It could be in the form of financial assistance, resources, workshops or a simple hug.  While they help those in need in Nevada, I reside in NJ and have had a few families contact them for advice and what not as I know that Carrie and Robert are extremely knowledgeable and simply just care.

The Animal Foundation	290563		/users/profile/380927	BarnCats	General Member of the Public	1	05/22/2016	Not impressed, makes it difficult for other rescues to get animals out.  With stellar organizations, such as Nevada Humane Society, in such close proximity, this group fails miserably at getting healthy and  fixable animals out.  Nevada Humane Society became no-kill with one remarkable person, who simply said "no more killing" and followed through.
The Animal Foundation	250234	2	/users/profile/338067	anonymous12345	General Member of the Public	5	07/27/2015	Great charity helping animals in need.  Yes, they are a kill shelter.  They HAVE to be under contract with the government.  They do not want to kill healthy animals.  Every year their numbers go down. The more help they get, the less they will have to kill.
The Animal Foundation	242103		/users/profile/328857	PuppyLove702	Volunteer	2	05/04/2015	The only reason I give the Animal Foundation two stars is because, despite all the killing, they do adopt out animals so some good is being done here.  I agree with another reviewer that this 'shelter' is not a humane shelter. They needlessly kill animals and blame the County Commission for their regulations. They are a glorified animal control pound that kills perfectly adoptable animals because they are 'required to do so' under their contract with the County.  If they are held to certain laws/regulations that are beyond their control, then call a spade a spade and stop touting themselves as a humane organization.  They mislead the Las Vegas community and should be ashamed of that.  The Volunteer Orientation Coordinator (a paid staff member of the Animal Foundation) blatantly lied to me and a room of at least 60 other would-be volunteers about the circumstances that require them to euthanize dogs.  I only walked dogs at the Animal Foundation twice before I learned that a dog I had walked was killed.  I know from personal experience that the dog wasn't vicious and didn't deserve to die.  In my opinion, the Animal Foundation isn't a charitable organization and it doesn't deserve your hard-earned dollars.  
The Animal Foundation	235514	3	/users/profile/319105	littleduck	General Member of the Public	1	12/15/2014	Fake non-profit. They kill animals. They kill dogs and cats and other animals. They are a kill shelter. They sell dead dogs to the dog food manufactures. They get $100 per dead dog or cat, so the dogs are worth more dead than alive. Don't bring your dog, cat or other animal there and think somebody will adopt it. They are a kill shelter.

The Animal Foundation	165480	5	/users/profile/219942	bgood2	General Member of the Public	1	08/20/2013	The Animal Foundation claims here on this page to have transparency, but in reality they are anything but transparent.  They hide information from the public and won't answer questions about what happened to certain animals that "disappear" . They also fool the general public with overpopulation myth.. this is a proven myth. They kill healthy adoptable dogs daily. They profit plenty and won't even make simple repairs in the dog kennels that are safety hazards. This non profit is ALL ABOUT profit.  Its despicable how they operate. 
The Animal Foundation	165474	4	/users/profile/219937	Dawn56	Client Served	1	08/20/2013	What AF doesnt tell you is that they euthanize 63% - or over 24,000 animals - annually, despite a surplus of over 4.7 million dollars in 2011.  Pet overpopulation is a myth.  Seventeen million households add a pet every year, and 4 million healthy, adoptable animals are euthanized every year.  The issue is not overpopulation or community failure to step up.  The issue is that it is easier and more profitable for AF to kill than it is to work their butts off to find homes for the animals that end up in their facility.
Sierra Nevada Journeys	206641		/users/profile/269094	cmian,	Client Served	5	07/19/2014	        Thank you for what you do!  The program was wonderful, and everyone on staff was exactly what each circumstance needed them to be.  I dream of  schools where learning is experiential, not just memorizing information about other peoples experiences & data.   I work for change within my classroom, and having a resource such as Grizzly Ranch is such a gift.  For many kids, its the first experience of mountains, creatures, hiking, etc and hopefully the beginning of a life-long relationship with outdoors.Just so you know, many of our students have had painful, scarring events in their lives and have trouble remembering whats good and true.   Yet in every picture their faces are lit with joy.  Im not making that up, its all true. I'm sure our students will have great memories - they can't stop talking about all they experienced!

The opportunity to work there is more than work, you build relationships with others that eventually become life-long family, or like what I would like to call the SNJ family.  There is great leadership among administrative staff, and the people that you meet during employment give life-long memories.

Their summer camps are wonderful and I really feel comfortable leaving my child for a week. The Halloween Carnival is so much fun, and provides Plumas county kids with something safe to do for Halloween.  I am looking forward to seeing what else they can do in the future!
Sierra Nevada Journeys	217565		/users/profile/281098	Cheryl112	Client Served	5	09/26/2014	My daughter, Leah, attended this camp 2 years ago when she was in 5th grade.  Then again this past summer just after 6th grade.  She had an amazing experience.  She cannot wait to go back again next year.   Leah learned so much and had such a great time in a safe, supportive and inspiring environment.  She talked so highly of all the staff - how positive and encouraging they all were. The location is beautiful but it really is the people and the activities they do that make this such an enriching and worthwhile program for everyone involved. Everyone should have an opportunity to experience this spectacular place!!

They have something for everyone - so our little ones are happy, our teen is happy, and both adults are thrilled!  The counselors are amazing, develop a great rapport with the campers, and are so knowledgable - they are a joy to be around!  The grounds are lovely, the accommodations are clean and comfortable, and the food is delish!  Can't say enough good things about SNJ!!  What a gem!!

My daughter loved every part of your program- the facility, the counselors (a bunch!), the food, the activities.  I cannot thank you enough for providing such a memorable time for her.  She loved it so much she came back for a second week.  I wasn't sure she would be able to have the same awesome experience twice but she actually had more fun the second time around.  There's not many programs I can say that about.  Please pass on my thanks to all of your staff.  My daughter is sad camp is over but she will have the memory in her heart forever!  We will be back next year and many more after that.

She will definitely be returning in future years. The staff are all very professional, pleasant and knowledgeable. We felt very comfortable leaving our 9 year old with them for one week.  My daughter also had the priveledge of working with them when she was in third grade. She always looked forward to their monthly school visit and raved about heir lessons.  I would highly recommend participating in anything they have to offer.

The organization that stimulates community growth, helps to ease a jump start with F# language and provides many ways to learn more and more by helping with meetups, talks organizing and other. And, of course, a place where you can just meet and talk with other people that share your interests.
F# Software Foundation	314825		/users/profile/406177	Chet H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2016	The FSSF has been a huge hand in stabilizing, growing, and contributing to the growth and success of F# as a language, as well as its developers' personal growth.  From its inception the board members have worked tirelessly to arrange training, encourage the creation and nurturing of user groups, promote the language, and build up a community around both the language itself and functional programming as a paradigm.  My interactions with board members have been largely informal, but to a person they are kind, hardworking, personable individuals that see the Foundation as a way to give back to the overall community of F#ers worldwide.  The work the Foundation has done promoting Mentorship alone has been a huge boost to the community, bringing in new blood and forcing us to work on educational materials to bring newcomers up to speed.

This is a kind community and foundation willing to help anyone with pleasure, even a young programmer like me. I have built a type-safe communication library (a generative type provider)  where the generated types, method signatures and their order are described by a communication protocol and are statically checked.This sounds great and thanks to the foundation I have been able to build that from scratch, with no knowledge whatsoever of F# at first.

Trauma Intervention Program of Northern Nevada, Inc.	289216	2	/users/profile/379437	sharbond,	Volunteer	5	05/09/2016	I was a volunteer with the Trauma Intervention Program of Northern Nevada for several years; when I had to resign because of a health issue, it broke my heart.  I wholeheartedly believe in the work the TIPNN is doing.  Trauma can be paralyzingly and trauma that is not worked through will leave lasting repercussions.  I have seen the  look of relief on the faces of first-responders when we come on-scene; they are now free to effectively continue with their jobs.  I have seen how grateful those who have been involved in a traumatic situation are to find that there is someone reaching out to them, listening to them, helping them move positively forward through the recovery process.
Trauma Intervention Program of Northern Nevada, Inc.	320090		/users/profile/412209	Wen C.	Volunteer	5	12/13/2016	Before becoming an volunteer, I never realize the huge impact that I may bring to the community and the people that I help. Imagine the worst day of you life, and you are all alone trying to endure the unbearable pain, wouldn't you like someone to just be there with you and assist you through your grieving process. I couldn't be more proud of what I have done as a volunteer of Trauma Intervention Program at Northern Nevada. As a volunteer, you are directly making a difference in the community and a difference in other people's lives. 
Trauma Intervention Program of Northern Nevada, Inc.	320042		/users/profile/412099	cindyinsparks	Volunteer	5	12/12/2016	I have been a volunteer with TIPNN for over 2 years and it has been an incredible experience. It can feel like a huge commitment but is very doable if you are willing to honor that commitment and plan for your shifts. I have met some incredible individuals and know that I am helping citizens in my community. I would encourage anyone who is looking for an opportunity to give back to their community to take the leap and become a volunteer for TIPNN.

I have seen a lot of tragedy and have helpedprovide comfort and guidance to people who are having the worst moment of their life.Even though it is hard to be with them those few hours after an unexpected death,I can't think of anything that matches the compassion of being with someone at atime like that.  I also know the police and the medical examiners are grateful for myproviding a service that enables them to do their job in a complete and respectful manner
Trauma Intervention Program of Northern Nevada, Inc.	319997	1	/users/profile/411999	CFCox	Volunteer	5	12/09/2016	If you don't know what to do if your loved one dies today, you're the kind of person we help out. Emergency responders can respond to emergencies, but not to the aftermath. For emotional wreckage, responders call the Trauma Intervention Program.TIP gives people emotional and practical support in the hours immediately after a tragedy, like a suicide, a fire, or a car crash. Without us, people who experience these things are often on their own for hours until friends or family can be there for them. That's a problem. Growing up in Nevada, I've noticed that few people have a support system. Anywhere else in America, you can rely on your community for things. Out here, good luck meeting your neighbors before they move! People need to watch each others' backs more. By providing aid to people who have been through trauma, I think TIP provides the connectedness that we need, when we need it most. It' a great non-profit.
Trauma Intervention Program of Northern Nevada, Inc.	319979		/users/profile/411962	nonvcitizen	Volunteer	5	12/09/2016	I am still technically in training, but this is the most well-run organization I have ever been involved in - volunteer or otherwise, in addition to it providing a valuable resource to community.  The passion of those who have been involved beyond traineeship is palpable.  It also provides a way to honor emergency responders, who do an amazing job,and very often go unrecognized for the public service they provide every day in our community.  Trauma can happen at any time to any one and TIP is always available to help those affected by it.

Trauma Intervention Program of Northern Nevada, Inc.	289168	2	/users/profile/379392	Gabrielle5	Volunteer	5	05/09/2016	I had no idea how profound the power of presence is until I became a volunteer for TIP of Northern Nevada.  I was always the one who had a wealth of 'good ideas' on 'how to help' when friends or family were faced with trauma or tragedy.  Turns out, I can't help at all.  But I can be there for them.  I can sit silently with them, while they process.  I can offer my ear and my heart to give them a sense of support while they navigate difficult situations.  TIP training was undoubtedly the single most influential training I have attended in my life.  Sounds like I'm being extravagant with my support, but it is truth.  Not only does my TIP training serve me so well on TIP calls, it also serves me incredibly well in my personal life, at work, and with friends.  I call upon my skills darn near every day.  Becoming a TIP volunteer has been a life altering experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.  I am more confident, more comfortable in my own skin, more aware, more empathetic (as versus sympathetic), more sensitive.  I am so proud of the work I do with TIP.  Proud to give back to my community in a way that is so HUGE, yet done on such a micro-level.

I have been wanting a pup for my and my husband of 8 months. Yorkie was my first dog and my family loved how affectionate they are. I've been missing my Yorkie who is with my family back in Japan, and I've been begging my husband to adopt one. I saw a white Maltese Yorkie mix on HHAS website, went to the adoption center yestetday, but he was already gone. I went back to their adoption site again today, and boom! There was my pup. She was shaking and nervous, and I couldn't resist but to take her home. Adoption process went very smoothly. Staff and foster parents were very helpful and they were genuinely happy for us! They gave us all the information I needed, including good and bad. I can't thank them enough for a new addition to our family! Mimsie is doing great so far, considering HHAS just received her today and having limited knowledge about her. I love her so much already!

High School years are extremely formative, as we all know, and an extremely vulnerable time as well. NCCF introduced me to Camp Cartwheel in its second year of operation and invited me to be a Counselor-In-Training which was an opportunity I leapt at. I was hooked instantly! I graduated to Counselor, Cabin Director, and am now the Assistant Director in my 12th year of volunteering at NCCF. I cannot tell you how much Camp Cartwheel does for its campers; children with various catastrophic illnesses including cancer, HIV/AIDs, various hematological and immunological diseases, and various renal problems. Camp offers many of these children, and their siblings who also attend camp, the opportunities to feel normal in a society that values "homogenous" appearances. For many of these campers, its the only opportunity they'll receive to feel normal and to leave their disease or disability at home. Kudos to NCCF, its Staff, Volunteers and Board of Directors. From a Survivor's perspective, you are amazing.

I was instantly impressed with NCCF because they focus not only on patients with cancer, but other patients with chronic diseases such as blood disorders. They also help the siblings and family of patients, not just the patient! They've worked hard to meet the needs of the chronically ill children in Las Vegas and the surrounding area. They also took initiative to meet the educational needs of hospitalized and chronically ill children who could not attend school by creating a school program in the local children's hospital. This was a growing need that I saw every day as I worked with the chronically ill population. Now that I no longer work for the hospital, I volunteer time with NCCF and am in fact volunteering for their camp this summer.

I recently heard a grandmother thank us through tears of joy, that we can provide this experience. Yeah, I think Goodie Two Shoes deserves to be on the list of the best.
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation	41078	8	/users/profile/41975	skip1	Volunteer	5	05/27/2010	To be able to create such joy in a child by providing them with something so many of us take so very much for granted... a good pair of new shoes... gives me great satisfaction. Goodie Two Shoes makes it very easy for volunteers to do their part. You can sense the heart in the whole staff and it comes through in the smiles, fun and respect they show to those who are helping, and those who are being helped.
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation	40191	1	/users/profile/41115	dixie-serrio	Volunteer	5	05/23/2010	Goodie Two Shoes Foundation has provided a much needed service to the children of Southern Nevada.  Many of us do not ever think about what it is like to be without the "simple" things in our life, like a single pair of well fitting shoes.  My experience with this wonderful foundation has opened my eyes to the vast need the Las Vegas area has for such a program.Every volunteer opportunity brings many new stories, however, the one that sticks in my mind the most occured on December 23, 2008. Goodie Two Shoes Foundation was providing new shoes to children from a local shelter.  The children were brought in by bus and a few of their mother's were along. I was assisting a teenage brother and sister with their shoe selection.  Of course, the teenage girl found the shoes she wanted immediately and she was so excited to have new shoes just in time for Christmas.  However, her brother was not as easy to please.  We looked at every single pair of shoes his size, and after at least 30 minutes, he said that he just didn't want any of the shoes.  I told him that we really did want him to select a new pair, however, he remained firm that he just didn't want any.  I discussed this situation with Nikki Berti, and she told me that if he didn't want shoes, we could not make him take any.  I then went and assisted another young child in selecting a new pair of shoes.  When I was through with this other child, I noticed that my original teenage boy was still looking at the shoes.  So, once again, I asked him if maybe he found a pair that he would like to try on.  At this time, he asked me if his sister could pick another pair instead.  When I told him that we could give one pair per child, he then said that his mother wears the same size shoe as his sister and "mom only has slippers to wear".  Sure enough, mom was in the store and was wearing worn out slippers.  At this point, I told Nikki about the request, when she walked over to the teenage boy and said, "We would be happy to give your mother a new pair of shoes as long as you take a pair also".  It was only then that he selected the shoes he had in mind all along.  What a fine, responsible young man I had standing in front of me. I was so proud of the way that Nikki and Goodie Two Shoes handled this circumstance with such professionalism and ease.  More proof as to how important and necessary this foundation is.

We at the Mesquite Club of Las Vegas, Evening Chapter sure hope so. For two consectutive years, our largest fundraiser, our Holiday Craft Auction has been a huge successes with the proceeds donated to The Goodie Two Shoes Foundation.  Our members have personally participated in both a shoe distribution at a local area Boys and Girls Club and also, on site, at area schools in which children receive new shoes, several new pairs of socks, as well pack-backs filled with needed school supplies. GTSF has these events very well organized.  The children's feet are sized and then volunteers personally assist a child in picking our shoes that fit them properly.  We have seen children coming in with shoes with the backs cut from them as they have outgrown them and children with toes curled under due to having to wearing shoes that are too small.  The children arrive with their heads held down and after being treated so special by the volunteers that call them by name and let THEM pick out the style of shoes they want, (with a little bit of growing room), the children leave with their heads high and big smiles on their faces.  It is truly a wonderful thing to be a part of.  GTSF founders Nikki and Toni Berti are an inspiration and make the volunteers feel so very special and have all the information, training and supplies to make sure the shoe distribution is a very positive experience for everyone involved.  Our members look forward to a long term relationship with Goodie Two Shoes as far as fundraising and volunteering.Connie MacauleyThe Mesquite Club of Las Vegas, Woman's Club702-378-1325
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation	40013	7	/users/profile/40952	bsmith7023aolcom	Volunteer	5	05/22/2010	I initially volunteered to work with the Goodie Two Shoes Foundation as part of the "Give a Day, Get a Day" Disney promotion.  It was such an honor to work with them to provide these wonderful, deserving children with a decent pair of shoes that actually fit them.  This foundation not ony serves to provide for the "felt needs" of our children but also helps to boost their self esteem.  Everyone involved with the Foundation is positive and encouraging with the children and with us as volunteers.  I have served with Goodie Two Shoes again since my first time and look forward to the opportunity of serving the children of Clark County with them again as much as possible.
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation	39993	2	/users/profile/40935	1-broker	General Member of the Public	5	05/21/2010	Off the charts. That is how I would rank the effort and benefits of Goodie Two Shoes.So many children get to feel better about themselves every time they tie their shoes in the morning.Every morning the kids know that someone in the world is trying to help them feel better about who they are. Perhaps the benefit of have a new pair of shoes will lift their grade average just a little or maybe a lot at school. Perhaps the benefit of a good pair of shoes will improve their posture and health. Its is great that a few can reach so many. Keep up the great work.
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation	39853	1	/users/profile/40808	cmewhiting	Volunteer	5	05/21/2010	Good To Shoes Foundation is one of the few charities that serve a purpose for the true meaning of service.  They help not only children develop a postive attitide by empowering them with something so small as a new pair of shoes but also empowers the volunteers to want to make a change.  To most people we can't stuff enough shoes into our closets, but to these children that they reach out to, it is like watching a child on Christmas morning!  Nothing compares to the feeling of being involved with something so special, and the fact that it helps our local children who will in turn be our local adults someday is even more gratifing.  I love how the foundation is run and more than proud and honored to be a part of it!
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation	39675	9	/users/profile/40638	wendy11	General Member of the Public	5	05/20/2010	Goodie Two Shoes Foundation is amazing! Obviously providing shoes to kids who don't have any is a wonderful wonderful cause. . but what makes GTSF so special is all of the little details that they pay so much attention to. The kids aren't herded through a line to pick up their donated products, each child is treated individually empowering them with choice and attention. Each child selects the shoes that they WANT all the while each child is carefully fit so they receive the shoes they NEED.  Organized, kind, energetic and just wonderful to work with are all phrases I have used to describe GTSF. I can't wait to work with them again!
Goodie Two Shoes Foundation	39668	1	/users/profile/40631	maureen4	Volunteer	5	05/20/2010	Having been connected with the Goodie Two Shoes event for over 7 years now, I have seen from an observer's point of view just how this event impacts the children of Nevada. I know what its like not to have the coolest shoes or even a new pair of shoes that fit to go back to school wearing. During this event, each child is partnered with someone great whose only quest is to find a pair of shoes the child loves. And when they are found, you know as their eyes light up and they smile from ear to ear. Along with the shoes they receive so much more...a backbpack filled with school supplies, lunch and the individual attention that kids this age love. This organization is ran by an amazing woman and her staff is just as fabulous. The impact they have on thousands of kids every year can't be measured nor even quantified, but anyone that witnesses this, knows that these kids will remember this for a lifetime and just maybe they will turn around and do something great for someone else when they get older.Bottom line...it is an amazing organization doing a fabulous job of reaching out to those that have a need and doing it with a level of professionalism and warmth that is unmatched.
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	297606		/users/profile/388412	JaniceS	General Member of the Public	1	07/21/2016	I read the comments below regarding the law suit against Dawg.  I quit this group because of it.  What bothered me was that Dawgs own members conspired the suit behind the backs of its officers and members (me included as a member!)  Yes they fabricated a lie and went forth with a conspiracy theory.  I could not remain a member because of this and the cost involved with the defense and insurance problems.    After a recent election in 2016 some of the same people that conspired against Dawg in the suit are now serving as officers and directors.  I can't even put into words how angry that makes me.   (why they were not removed from the organization a couple years ago is beyond me)   I decided to donate directly to the county shelter.  I wish Dawg best of luck in the future.  
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	279105		/users/profile/369147	12345anthony	General Member of the Public	1	02/04/2016	Honesty is the best policy.  Records signed by the organization's officer show  $745 of public money was paid towards a law suit filed against it.   The records also note that the civil suit  could have been avoided had the members chose to communicate with each other.  I feel that there is a  lack of internal respect and the organization takes for granted people wont find out what goes on with public donations.    I support animal care  and deeply care what happens to them, but a charitable organization that gets a civil suit against them raises red flags, which is why I do not want to donate here.  
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	264316		/users/profile/353034	JoycieC	Board Member	5	10/15/2015	I am a member of DAWG and have been for over 4 years. It is a great group that helps in many ways the animals of Douglas County NV.  It is a great non profit organization that has made a difference in the lives of many animals. Some activities include helping shelter animals by providing medical care, training, grooming, socialization, foster homes, purchasing specialty food if needed, reducing adoption costs, holding adoption events, advertising the shelter animals on facebook and petfinder and more. For the community DAWG also provides programs such as low cost spay/neuter program for dogs and cats for low income residents, a low cost spay/neuter of pitbulls for all residents, and a community assistance program to help members of the public get veterinary care for the their personal animals.  Also to clarify a comment and reviewer made earlier DAWG funds and donations were NOT used to pay for the lawsuit since DAWG has insurance and the insurance covered the costs. I know this for a fact since I was on the Executive Board when this event occurred. 
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	259931		/users/profile/348461	Carry	Volunteer	2	09/27/2015	After one year as a volunteer, I quit.  The leadership was good,  but there was too much backstabbing behavior from  other volunteers.   I am now volunteering directly with the shelter and their  volunteers and find it much more pleasant.  
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	71106	1	/users/profile/77734	DianaF	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	Douglas Animal Welfare Group, otherise known as DAWG, was founded in 2000. I am a charter member. I have served as former President and held several other exective positions and on the Board of Directors.  DAWG serves to improve the lives of the homeless dogs and cats in the Douglas County,NV,  Animal Shelter.  DAWG members provide funds for medical care for ill or injured animals which come into the shelter either as strays or surrendered formr pets.  Members assist in facilitating adoptions, hold many adoption events and post flyer through the county about the animals available for adoption.I coordinate the monthly events at Petco,  helping the people who come to Petco to find a new loving companion.  Senior dogs like Buddy and Tasha were adopted at our Petco event and are living active, well-loved and healthy lives with their owners. As a member, I am proud to have started such programs as paying for Senior Animal Vet Exams for new older arrivals so we will know what conditions these older animals may have so we can treat them early and help the new owner know how to care for the animal from the first day.  This exam may result in the removal of tumors, dental cleaning and or removal of broken or diseased teeth, or treament for thyroid condition or incontinence and many more medical needs.  If the animal is found to be very unhealthy and have little time to live, a loving and caring foster home with a knowledgable member is recruited and is supported by DAWG until the dog or cat passes on.  The animal will know love and care in a home until the end.  
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	71095	1	/users/profile/77722	Marianne Weidenbenner	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	I rescued my dog, Casey, from the Douglas County Animal Shelter 12 years ago.  She's been a wounderful pet and very healthy for many years. However, recenty she had a medical condition that required a veterinary visit.  I have been working only part time and could not afford the cost of the office visit so I called the volunteer group who worked with our animal shelter, Douglas Animal Welfare Group or DAWG and asked if they could help me.  They contacted the vet's office on my behalf and arranged an emergency visit for me that afternoon and had the office bill them for the visit. Without their help I would not have been able to get the help that my dog needed at the time.  She has been healthy ever since and we are both extreamly grateful for the assistance they could provide.
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	71045	1	/users/profile/77669	Pat Matthews	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	I have been a member of the Douglas Animal Welfare Group since 2002.  I have seen the group grow from 8-9 active members to 30-35 active members.  This has all been accomplished through hard work. The Douglas Animal Welfare Group has members at the shelter 365 days of the year to walk, play, socialize and clean liter boxes. The Douglas Animal Welfare Group sponsors adoption events to increase the adoption rate.  There are monthly adoption events held at the Shelter and at Petco.  Everyone benefits from these events - hopefully there are good adoptions and the dogs and cats are seen. The Douglas Animal Welfare Group provides medical assistance to the dogs and cats in the shelter beyond the County will cover.  By doing this, we have made more dogs and cats ready for adoption. The Executive Committee and Board of Directors work very hard to ensure that we stay committed to our mission statement. When dogs are cats are adopted, the Douglas Animal Welfare Group provides free-of-charge micro-chipping, training help from a local trainer. DAWG members go above and beyond what is expected of them.  For instance, when the County was going to close the shelter on Sunday due to lack of funding, our members got to gather to cover the front desk so adoptions could still be available to the community.  Our Sunday coverage has provided for many adoptions. I am proud of being a member of the Douglas Animal Welfare Group for the reasons  I joined.  DAWG has professional, dedicated and loyal members whose mission is to find good homes for the Shelter dog and cats. Sincerely, Pat MatthewsVolunteer
Douglas Animal Welfare Group	68710	2	/users/profile/75076	jfjcpa	Volunteer	3	02/15/2011	DAWG started in 2000 and and in 2002 it incorporated as a 501-c-3 charity.  I joined in the fall of 2004 or 2005, i cant remember, and there were about 25 members with very little money.  since then they have over 100 members and are no longer almost broke.  There main function is to volunteer at the Douglas County Nevada, animal shelter.  DAWG (Douglas Animal Welfare Group) and its volunteeers do the following:  1. There are about 100+ volunteer/members.  35 do most of the volunteering and the rest are supporting members who can volunteer anytime they wish.  Some of them go to the shelter and walk the dogs and pet the cats on a daily scheduled basis, 365 days a year.  They try to teach them a few tricks, find out something about the animal for adoption purposes, and give them some affection so they dont go stir crazy in the kennel. They play a little ball with the animals weather permitting. They clean the cat cages, check the animals for medical problems, and discuss any problems with the shelter employees.2. When the kennels fill up, or a dog has a bad injury some of the members take the dogs home until the kennels empty out and or the animal gets better. They act as foster parents. 3. The main goal of the group is try to get the animals adopted. If they can get them adopted that will help reinforce the no-kill shelter approach. (If there was no DAWG the county would probably have to kill the animals if they cant adopt them.) They hold special adoption events throughout the year. They take pictures of the new dogs and cats and advertise them on the Internet, and sometimes in the newspaper and television. 4. When the shelter is full, they may pay for spay or neuter of animals since the shelter has no spay or neuter funds.  This helps increase the adoptions since the adopter normally pays the cost. 5. They have fund raising events.  The money they raise is used to pay for expenses the county will not pay for.  The county normally will pay for emergency medical expenses, or for injuries in the shelter. If an incoming animal is hurt or injured DAWG may pay for medical check ups, lab costs and other costs to make the animal adoptable.  6. DAWG uses its money to pay for printing, postage, and miscellaneous expenses to the vets that are necessary to help adopt the animals.    7. Sometimes an animal needs a special operation.  If possible, DAWG will pay for that or try to raise the funds for the operation. 8. DAWG has to pay for advertising in the newspaper for fund raising events, adoption events, and special problems such as overflowing kennels. 9. They sometimes drive the animals to the vets, groomers, or other appointments. 10. DAWG sometimes pays for canned dog food for animals that will not eat the dry or kittens that need the canned food instead of the dry.   Sometimes DAWG asks the community to donate cans of dog and cat food.  Dry dog food is free as donation from the Pedigree dog food company. 11. DAWG may pay the expenses for some piece of equipment or training for a person who has adopted an animal and is having a problem with their animal, in order for the person to be happy with their animal rather than returning it to the shelter. 12. DAWG may pay boarding expenses or the expenses involved with people who have a foster home for a dog who is injured or when the kennel is overflowing. 13.DAWG educates people about responsible pet ownership. At some of the events they have speakers about training, animal behavior, emergency preparedness for pets, printed materials about pets, and microchip clinics.   14. DAWG and Douglas County split the cost of major kennel improvements in  2007 which resulted in the demolition of all the concrete kennels and installation of modular kennels.  This was possible because of a donation from an individual who was in favor of spending the money upgrading the shelter kennels.15. DAWG microchips all the dogs that enter the shelter that are not microchipped. Honors and Awards   Nevada Appeal picked DAWG as the organization of the year in 2005.  This honor was recognized with letters from the Governor Guinn, Senator Ensign, and Assembly Minority Leader Hettrick.  See the website for the letters. The Chamber of Commerce picked DAWG as the service club of the year in 2006. Douglas County Historical Society honored Cherie Owen, Founder and President of DAWG in 2006 as a Woman of Honor for her historical contribution to improving the quality of life in Douglas County for founding DAWG.  The American Red Cross honored Cherie Owen in 2007 as an Animal Real Hero, for her work in rescuing animals for the last 33 years.   In 2007 Cherie was awarded a  Daily Point of Light, by the Points of Light Foundation & Volunteer Center National Network, in Washington D.C. for her 33 years of volunteer work rescuing animals. She received a certificate from the foundation, congratulatory letters from both President Bushes and Senator Reid acknowledged the award. In 2007 Nevada Assemblyman, James Stettlemeyer, awarded DAWG a Proclamation for DAWGs work and Cheries Real Hero award.  She also received a Certificate of Special Recognition from Governor Gibbons, which read  In honor of your selfless commitment to ensuring the safety and well being of all animals in Douglas County. You are a true Real Hero.   In 2007, U.S. Congressman, Dean Heller, awarded Cherie Owen, a Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition. It said  Thank you for your hard work and dedication as a volunteer. Your Service to the Community and love for animals is greatly appreciated. In 2008, Cherie Owen was a finalist at the Nevada Appeal Community Awards in the Volunteer of the Year category.  She received a recognition certificate from U.S. Senator Harry Reid, John Ensign and Governor Gibbons. In 2008, Laura Winking, President of DAWG, was honored nationally by the Points of Light Institute, in Washington D.C. as a Daily Point of Light, for her seven years of volunteering for the animals at the Douglas County Nevada Animal Shelter. She will receive letters of congratulation from both President Bushes.  Governor Jim Gibbons and Congressman Dean Heller acknowledged Lauras award with certificates of recognition.  U.S Senator Reid sent Laura a letter acknowledging her award. In 2009, Cherie Owen, president and founder, received the Jefferson Award from television channel 4 and Wells Fargo bank. In 2009, Laura Winking, past president was nominated in the Red Cross in the Animal Rescue category for the Real Heros breakfast. She received a certificate and recognition certificates from Governor Gibbons and Senator Reed. In 2009, Grace Bower, member-volunteer, was honored by the Douglas County Historical Society, at the "Women in History" awards on Saturday, March 28th2009, for Graces historical contribution to improving the quality of life in Douglas County, Nevada. She received a certificate and recognition certificates from Governor Gibbons and Senator Reed. In 2009, Active Volunteers in Douglas, AVID, selected Trish Vandersluis, who was Vice-President, as Volunteer of the Month. In 2010, Tina Murphy, who was Vice-President was selected as Volunteer of the Month by Active Volunteers in Douglas, AVID.  The most difficult problem that DAWG has is getting enough volunteers because volunteering is not mandatory for the members. We have supporting members and volunteer members and no one is reqired to volunteer.

I am simply amazed at what ThinkArt has accomplished for local artists in the Las Vegas community over the past 5 years, through the efforts of our gifted chairperson and dedicated board members and volunteers. Las Vegas has a number of talented artists. As a not-for-profit organization, ThinkArt along with its corporate sponsor promotes local artists by providing venues where artists can exhibit and promote their work in a number of juried shows and platforms throughout the year at no cost to the artist. ThinkArt does not receive any profits for its efforts. ThinkArt is a free and extraordinary resource for artists of every genre where they can develop, grow, and exploit their talents.
Think & Wonder Inc	261130	2	/users/profile/349726	kowntakrilowz	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	I have participated in Think & Wonder's art program for the last three years and have participated as a volunteer for the last 18 months. The planning, organization, and communication within the Think & Wonder team has resulted in amazing art exhibitions that include professional hosting, catering, and a venue that goes far beyond what any non-profit gallery can imagine. The board members, advisory board and director all exceed the efforts that would be expected from a volunteer-based organization. The networking capabilities of Think & Wonder along with support of local and corporate sponsors  have created an artist community that benefits local artists of all ages and backgrounds that would have been unimaginable prior to the creation of the organization. The dedication and passion towards art and artists by the members have turned Think & Wonder into the greatest non-profit organization in the state and I plan on seeing the organization prosper as it reaches national and international recognition. 
Think & Wonder Inc	261000	2	/users/profile/349590	Don_44	Client Served	5	10/02/2015	Think & Wonder has been a wonderful resource for me. They have connected me with high quality collectors as a fine artist. As a graphic designer they connected me with the opportunity to be art director for a movie short. They are invaluable in helping talented people find opportunities to fine-tune their craft. In our community they have been a valuable asset in connecting school-age children with opportunities in the art world, theatre, and other art forms.

Not only do young artists in all disciplines have a platform in which to gain exposure and the experience necessary to continue in their work, but established artists can also contribute with their presence and talks about their work. It has been a great idea, and a wonderful contribution on both ways of the spectrum, to and from art!  My warmest thanks for this opportunity to make the world understand that we, being human, need beauty and a higher spiritual perspective for our every-day challenges. Maria-Teresa Guzman, author
Think & Wonder Inc	196171	4	/users/profile/256371	Herbarb	Volunteer	5	03/22/2014	There are very few art businesses that can afford to put the artist above the need to make a profit.  Think Art/Athink & Wonder do put the artist first.  They value all artists, students and experienced, equally, offering their combined knowledge, to help the artist grow in their creative process.  Think Art produces several venues for exhibiting artists during the year at which art and socialbility reighn.  Las Vegas is climatically arid in land and is stuggling to grow culturally.

Think & Wonder Inc	195980	3	/users/profile/256254	77dare77	Donor	5	03/20/2014	This non-profit is definitely not for profit.  They run on no budget but still incur expenses such as insurance.  The people involved in this organization believe in their cause with the utmost sincerity and I believe they are really trying to make a difference in the Art Community of Las Vegas. This group is founded by a UNLV Alumni from the Fine Arts Program and has set a goal to enrich this city with art since she became a part of the Las Vegas Community over 15 years ago.  I believe this organization has the right mind set for not for profit which is: help in any way they can money or no money. They are a true asset to the COMMUNITY.
Think & Wonder Inc	195966	4	/users/profile/256242	pi_dream	Board Member	5	03/20/2014	It's one of a truly altruist organization that I've the privileged to serve as a board member.  The organization stays true to it's mission and offer programs that connects with real people working in the creative field.  Beyond the wonderful work, this organization is able to function without a budget for 4-years, able to provide excellent resources and services in the arts.  It's truly amazing to part of a completely philanthropic organization made up of volunteers: from our chairperson to governing board.  Each one work many hours without pay, offer their personal income to help carry out the mission, and not once have charge a fee or collect any dues from the artists they serve.  They don't even push for donation.  The philosophy of the organization is, they are here to serve not make money.  A truly hidden gem of philanthropy - nonprofit organization.

Advocates To End Domestic Violence	233930	4	/users/profile/297964	4susieque	Client Served	5	11/18/2014	I stayed at this shelter many years ago. at first I didn't like it. there were a lot of rules, i did not like shearing a house with strangers. many times I thought of walking out and I almost got kidded out ! i felt the shelter manager was a bear. but I stuck it out and it turned out to be the best choice I have ever made. After I quit fighting what the place was trying to get me to do, it was smooth sailing. But it took a while to get through my thick head that they did want what was best for my kids and I. It was not until  I was ready to move out and I could see the new people coming and saw a gal with a bad attitude about the place  that I truly appreciated all that thy had done for me. i still miss that ol bear coming in and checking on us each night. who would have thought i would miss something I hated so much at one timeWhen I was there we did not even have a bus. how nice of them to try to help out with the cost of bus passes. that could rack up some money if the shelter is full.Thank You Advocates! my kids  and I have a grate life ,because you did not give up on me.

Your program empowered me when i felt weak and vulnerable. Thank you for your compassion. ~Client in emergency shelter program
Advocates To End Domestic Violence	194092	3	/users/profile/253572	HappyCamper67	Client Served	5	02/10/2014	I wanted to express my appreciation for all the staff including management at this particular shelter.  I'm not sure what one of the writer's is talking about because I never saw anything she is referring to.  When I had to go into the shelter, I was treated with the utmost respect.  I came to Advocates broken, and left with self-esteem and respect for myself that I'd lost so long ago while being in an abusive relationship.  I taken and picked up for job interviews and eventually I was even given a car.  I was given ample amount of food for 2 children and myself.  I could go into the office and not only work on my resume, but given advice on how to present myself.  I was given the golden key to go into the thrift store and get whatever necessary items I needed for myself and children, since we had to leave in a rush, we had no clothing with us.  I was even encouraged to take on classes through the college, with the shelter taking care of the expenses.  The shelter had a few rules to live by and to ask us to be in at a certain time certainly was not an inconvenience.   My life changed drastically with the legal and professional help I received.  I am now a thriving mother of the most happy kids and I couldn't have been able to bless my children without the tremendous blessings of Advocates.  I am working towards my social degree because I too want to give back to an amazing organization that did everything they could to put me back on the right path to my success and happiness. Thank you Advocates.
Advocates To End Domestic Violence	193835	5	/users/profile/253207	Wyominggirl	Client Served	5	02/05/2014	I would like to share my story and the impact that Advocates has had on my life. 16 years ago I was a 23 year old, with three toddler children. I had been in unhealthy relationships my whole life, and had made several visits to Advocates in a three year period. I was receiving every type of government assistance out there, I had low self esteem, living day to day just to survive, and only had one goal..to be a good mother to my children. I just wasnt sure how to achieve this goal when I was too shattered of a person to leave an abusive spouse.  Advocates provided the counseling I needed to become self-sufficient, and build self-esteem. They provided parenting classes, food for my family until my assistance came in, clothing that actually fit, and a safe place for us to stay. Most importantly, the Director and her staff gave me the push I needed to meet my goals and be a strong single parent, and not just another statistic. The staff taught me that no one could change my situation but me. Although they were willing to provided the courses and support I needed, they wouldnt do the work (of change) for me. Today my children are grown, we live a violent free life, and even with all the obstacles we faced from our injustices I am a strong single parent and my children have thrived and became advocates for those less fortunate.  I have received my AA and a BSW degree along with 2 Minor certificates. Our accomplishments would not have happened if it wasnt for the Director and staff at Advocates. I now share my story to battered women, so they can hear and see that a violent free life is possible.   THANK YOU ADVOCATES FOR GIVING MY FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY WE NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

When you speak with them on the phone they seem nice,helpful and understanding. During theintake process they tell you they will help you with transportation to welfare ,court, school, and job search. They also tell you that everything is confidntial  and  that they will help us out with essential items (laundry soap, shampoo ,feminine needs) .  Iv been here for a month  and seen much unhappy clients including myself . Ive been denied rides to jobsearch because they said that they dont have enough funds or staff and they dont want to "help us too much" some advocates! They only provide us with ONE 10 punch bus pass on entire stay(cost is 8 bucks) . Essential products are supposedly limited when they are donations from public and they revenue 900,000 . When my case worker from welfare called in concern with transportation the director revealed information about "confidential" things i spoke to with the AEDV case worker. Now how would the director know personal things i told my AEDV case worker? The staff gets together on mondays to discuss our buisness we were told was confidental. And it doesnt end there , they take pictures of our room secretly and when i expressed my feelings about this to the Director she said that "this is my house and i can do whatever i want " she also said she could "kick me out whenever she wanted, for no reason at all" .Overall staff is rude, not helpful and have no sympathy for thier clients. I feel belittled, bullied and like my privacy is invaded.
Living Grace Homes, Inc	89045	1	/users/profile/100852	Cynthia J.	Client Served	5	05/23/2011	Five months into the pregnancy of my second child, I moved to Living Grace. Even though I was dealing with drug addiction, domestic violence, and legal problems, I was welcomed there with open arms. I had dropped out of college. I had never had a job. I had no insurance and nowhere to go. I got assistance in finding an internship that soon led to a job, one that I have been at for two years. I stayed at Living Grace Home for the duration of my pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy baby girl. Eventually I went on to live in a transition home, but the love and support I received from everyone never ceased. Now I have my own home for myself and my daughters. I work full-time and I attend school full-time. I'm so very grateful for the everything I received from Living Grace Home. I don't know where I'd be had I not been given the opportunity to be blessed by them.
Living Grace Homes, Inc	71373		/users/profile/78045	path	Donor	5	02/19/2011	Living Grace Home is a continuous flow of God's goodness in the lives of expectant mothers who have chosen life and provides transition as well.  As the only home of its kind in the whole Las Vegas area, it reflects that speck of faith that illuminates the world, a ray of hope that ripples outward, and charity from hearts to hearts (of mom and baby). 
Living Grace Homes, Inc	71246		/users/profile/77897	KimT1129	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2011	Without Living Grace, I can only ponder what alternative our young mothers-to-be could be forced into.  Would they be left homeless, would they be unable to benefit from counseling, medical treatment,  learning home skills as well as caring and tending of a newborn, continue their education or continue to work as some of them do?  And worst of all, be so  overwhelmed and feel pressured, that they would make a rash decision to terminate their pregnancy and suffer emotiionally for years to come.   All of  the above are serious problems and endanger the health and well being of  not just the mother-to-be, but the child within.  However, small as it may be, Living Grace offers the answer, alternative and accepts the responsibility for our community to provide shelter and care for young women who are going through a very difficult time alone and need a helping hand.47 years  ago, I  too was an unwed mother, and benefitted from the help of an unwed mother's home.  Today, life is great for not just me, but my beautiful  47 year old daughter.  "It  takes one to know one", and I know that Living Grace fits the bill  when it comes to contributing to a community which offers none or very little assistance toward  maintaining the life of an emotionally, physically, struggling, pregnant young lady and the innocent of our society.  I have  contributed  and visited the home, and I have seen and heard, first hand, what a viable and most needed shelter Living Grace is for our community.  I highly recommend that they be  applauded and most generously awarded for what they contribute for Life!
Living Grace Homes, Inc	69747	1	/users/profile/76232	luvmygrndhg	Donor	5	02/16/2011	This organization is one that I have had the privilege of donating to in the past.  I strongly support it's mission to help young women who have exercised their "choice" to give the gift of life to their baby.

General Member of the Public	5	02/16/2011	I am a former elected official in Las Vegas and have seen the great works of this organization firsthand.  The young women who are fortunate to find Living Grace Home find a supportive environment in which to prepare for motherhood.  They are in a home environment and are assigned roles of responsibility.  They also have access to family counseling and medical care.  Living Grace Home is truly making a difference in the lives of young women in Southern Nevada.
Living Grace Homes, Inc	63149	1	/users/profile/69042	kalarmore8	Volunteer	4	02/03/2011	As a part-time volunteer at Living Grace Homes, who works on the house and books, I have a special view of this organization. My view is from the  Inside-looking-out; I see how the moms enter our home as little, scared girls and leave as more mature, confident young mothers, ready to care for themselves and their charges; and from the outside-looking-in; I see Living Grace is a beautiful home, full of concerned, loving adults who give of their time, and talents in unique ways to help young women in need. It is  a privilege to be a part of this organization, which has taught me so much and helped me grow to be a more caring and involved member of the Las Vegas community.  Every mommy who has walked through our doors has a story to tell and if we take the time, we may become part of their stories.

Clark County Museum Guild	115594		/users/profile/157409	bornandraised	General Member of the Public	5	06/18/2012	My husband, son and myself visited the museum for the first time this week.  I'm ashamed to say I was born and raised in Southern Nevada and this was my first visit!  It was a remarkable experience for all of us.  We loved visiting the historic homes and thoroughly enjoyed the current Casino/Gaming exhibit.  I think anyone living or visiting Southern Nevada should treat themselves to a trip out!  Thank you for the time and care put in to maintaining our wonderful history.

Hidden Valley Wild Horse Protection Fund	243751	4	/users/profile/330583	Therese5	Volunteer	5	05/28/2015	My husband and I are both volunteers and donors to HVWHPF and other wild horse and burro advocacy groups. HVWHPF consistently does amazing work for the horses, and I have no doubt every penny they receive benefits the horses of the Virginia Range. The leadership and key players of the group are working people with limited time and personal resources, who nevertheless manage to  make it happen for the sanctuary of up to 150 wild horses, as well as being on 24 hour call for rescue and emergency situations.  I am honored to be a part of this amazing organization, and excited to work with them and through them to unify and educate wild horse and burro advocates. Please help support HVWHPF. Your money will be well spent!
Hidden Valley Wild Horse Protection Fund	238605	4	/users/profile/181914	Margie R.	Donor	5	02/26/2015	I have been involved with this animal advocacy group for just under a year, participating in group sponsored activites and as a regular monthly donor. This group is currently caring for more than 100 wild horses removed by the State of NV from the Virginia Range and you can literally see donations in action in the form of care and board for the horses as well as in the bales and bales of hay purchased to feed the horses. There is no question that the monies I, as well as others, donate is used effectively. I highly, highly recommend this non-profit animal advocacy group and if I could give it more than 5 stars I would. 
Hidden Valley Wild Horse Protection Fund	194441	3	/users/profile/254089	ShannonWindle	Board Member	5	02/18/2014	One of the most noteable aspects of being associated with this all-volunteer organization is the true dedication and hard work of all the volunteers who work tirelessly in the best interest of the historic Virginia Range horses, both wild and free as well as the rescued horses that make up our herd of over 140 horses.I am proud to be a volunteer and Board member of this organization.  Our Board members are all professionals and business owners who work long hours to develop programs and raise the funds needed to feed and board our horses.  We have successfully adopted out 35 horses and have 13 more horses in training programs with clear prospects for adoptions at the completion of the training event.Our goal is to protect, preserve, and rescue the wild horses of the Virginia Range.  We have volunteers who work daily to ensure the horses remain safely in the hills and out of our congested streets; volunteers who install and repair fencing that keeps the horses and the public safe; volunteers who work year round to raise funds that go directly to benefit the horses.Hidden Valley Wild Horse Protection Fund has rescued 150 horses since September 2012 and 32 of its mares, pregnant when they were rescued, have given birth to some beautiful babies.  One of our goals is to find good, quality homes for as many of our rescued horses as we can, ensure the wild horses remain wild and free and create an ecotourism industry around the historic Virginia Range horses that reflects the value they bring to our community and wellbeing. 
Hidden Valley Wild Horse Protection Fund	188317	2	/users/profile/245677	horsewhisper	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/11/2013	This non-profit advocacy group adopted 150 wild mustangs who were destined for slaughter during October 2012 through January 2013. Although the group was motivated by compassion, neither their expertise in managing or budgeting for the care of this large number of horses was or has been professional in nature. This non-profit group tends to ignore experienced advice, requests for accountability, or a willingness to focus on the horses that they already possess. Their passion is to save as many horse from going to slaughter. While their desire is admirable, it is neither practical nor realistic, given the abscence of financial means to take care of the 100 plus horses they already possess. In this reviewer's mind, they run their organization through their emotions verses their intellect. This leads to a very unprofessional business, driven primarily by emotions rather than by common sense and good business ethics. When tasked with keeping the wild mustangs within their natural habitat, this non-profit served the community well and could manage their expenses and fulfill their mission. Once they move beyond this area of their advocacy, they have become quite dysfunctional, overwhelmed and guided by unqualified leadership. If they changed the leadership and management aspect of their non-profit organization, return to what they have the means and capability of accomplishing, this non-profit business could re-emerge as a vital wild horse adovoacy. Until that time occurs, my sense is this company will flounder and not succeed.
Hidden Valley Wild Horse Protection Fund	177902	2	/users/profile/234499	Larry Pintergraz	Client Served	5	10/15/2013	I adoped 2 virginia range horses from this group. they were so helpful in my selections of horses that would end up fitting my needs for my children, the ready help when i call to get training information or to talk of issues I have with one or the other every now and then. The horses are wonderful and coming along so well i may just adopt a couple more once these are ready for my kids in a couple more years. Caring group of people i would do business with again. THANKS

My donations have always went for what they are supposed to and been very well spent.  I support them with 5 stars
Incred-A-Bull	280207		/users/profile/370050	Writer	Client Served	5	02/14/2016	I had such a great experience with incred-A-bull. I had my pit bull puppy spayed by them. The entire staff was so kind, helpful and patient. I am so thankful for this organization! I recommend this place to everyone!
Incred-A-Bull	259717		/users/profile/348236	Dennis47	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/25/2015	As a local trainer and Bully breed lover, I think Jesica and the team at Incre-a-bull are doing a great job with owner assistance and community awareness. I am happy to be associated with this team 
Incred-A-Bull	255960		/users/profile/344346	JD48	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	Incred-A-Bull is a wonderful organization promoting positive support for pit bull type dogs and aiding their owners. I first became aware of them a couple of years ago at a bookstore. They were raising donations by doing Christmas wrapping. Of course, being a rescued pit bull owner, I had some books wrapped, made a donation, and looked them up on Facebook. I love that they provide spay/neuter assistance and have told several friends about the program. Also, about a year ago, a dog dragging a leash came wandering down the sidewalk so I called to her. We had her for a couple of days while we made flyers and posted notices on various dog rescue Facebook pages. Within a few hours of notifying IAB, Sparky's owner saw her picture. Apparently IAB was assisting her with Sparky's care and that's why owner visited their page. Incred-A-Bull is incredible. 
Incred-A-Bull	255868		/users/profile/344252	lvjbird	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2015	I  made a donation to Incred-a-bull awhile back for a bonded pair that they were trying to re-home.  When the deal fell through, (the former owner's son decided on a different decision for the pair) they offered my donation back to me.  I did not want it back, but this told me that this was a very upstanding organization.  I have had interactions with some terrible rescues.  My daughter has worked with quite a few of the rescues locally and this is one of her favorites.  When I am retired I plan to volunteer with them!
Incred-A-Bull	255023		/users/profile/343388	Ann_113	Volunteer	5	09/05/2015	I volunteered with Incred-A-Bull a year ago when I moved here from New York. The IAB team is a passionate and fun group of people to be with who care about all dogs, not just the Pit Bulls but focus on breaking the false stereotypes which have labeled America's Pit Bull. Since joining this group I am happy to say that I have learned how to calmly speak with people who challenge me with accusations regarding the reputation of Pit Bulls. I also enjoy our Events and Outings which include all breeds, not just our Pit Bulls.
Incred-A-Bull	255008		/users/profile/343372	Mdinn	Volunteer	5	09/05/2015	I volunteered with Incred-a-Bull for a couple years until I moved out if the Las Vegas area. They are one of those rare organizations that is truly in it for the good of the dogs.  The IAB team is a perfect blend of compassion and innovation. They are always looking for new ways to be a positive force in the community. Their work in fighting breed specific legislation is so important to ALL dogs - not just those labeled as pit bulls. If you want to help make a difference, this is a great group to be a part of!!
Angel's Power Ltd	294605		/users/profile/385353	kbtoad	Volunteer	5	07/04/2016	I met Danielle Smith in Cali when she was speaking at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts where she goes to college. Angel's Power Ltd was started by Danielle and her mom, because they were victims of family sexual abuse, Danielle was molested by her stepfather when she was 7. Danielle was a couragous and genuine speaker as she talked about how sexual abuse can affect you when you are a child. Danielle was talking to me after the speech and told me how Angel's Power Ltd was going to build a "Danielle House" (the shelter) in Cali next year and we discussed myself being a volunteer, what an exciting day for us both!
Angel's Power Ltd	291533	1	/users/profile/381961	peacenow	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2016	Stopped by their garage sale this past weekend.  I met and spoke with several of the ladies working and learned about their organization.  I was really impressed with how knowledgeable they were and their commitment to this cause.   I support this group and know they will succeed.  On a side note, they were selling a nice variety of items (something for everyone).

Our Founder, Lori Power, has been awarded the Fox 5/Findlay Chevrolet Shining Star, Channel 3's Hero of the Month and Channel 13/American First Credit Union's Give Back Winner this year.  This is a small indication of how passionate Lori and Angel's Power Ltd. is about the work we do and the community we serve.
Angel's Power Ltd	291308	1	/users/profile/381712	Writer	Client Served	5	05/29/2016	I highly recommend this organization in the unfortunate event you need their services.  Most of the people you come in contact with are survivors and truly understand what you are going through.  Also, I found the founder, Lori Power, to be compassionate and straight forward.  
Angel's Power Ltd	290708	4	/users/profile/381054	Writer	Donor	5	05/23/2016	Met these ladies at a fundraiser and found them to be 100% dedicated to their work,  looking to donate to a much needed service, you just found it.    
Angel's Power Ltd	290491	4	/users/profile/380838	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/21/2016	Angel's Power Ltd., is run by the most caring staff.  They are professional and your contact with them is kept confidential.  If you or someone you know is being sexually abused I can tell you first hand that they will help you.  My experience was better than I  could have hoped.  I hope that you never need their services but if you do I recommend you give them a call.  
Veterans Guest House, Inc.	107982	3	/users/profile/146686	fibrin	General Member of the Public	1	03/17/2012	The Veterans guest house uses dishonest marketing tactics to get donations from the public, claiming they do NOT take government funds when in fact they do! The City of Reno and HUD gave them over $200,000 last year that was supposed to go to help the homeless. Have they no shame?
Veterans Guest House, Inc.	100764	2	/users/profile/124571	Snoopythb	Volunteer	5	11/17/2011	I have been helping out a little bit at the Guest House for many years. Noreen and Kathy run a very tight ship and make sure almost every penny does some good for someone, be it a veteran or a member of his or her family.Of all the good I have tried to do in my life, helping these people help veterans gives me the greatest satisfaction.Lead on, Veterans Guest House, Lead On.
Veterans Guest House, Inc.	100330		/users/profile/122033	nets	Volunteer	5	11/06/2011	I have volunteered at the veterans guest house for about 3 years. They give a home away from home, support ,food, and much much more.It takes a great deal of time and effort put in to meet the needs that are rappidly growing with in are vets. But the gust house would not be the place it is to day without those working there giveing so much love and care. With in my time there  I have seen many vets meet and become great supporters for each other  through the lose of a loved one or trials  with cancer ending in great  friendships. But just to see there faces when the worry is over come with joy knowing they have some were to stay is enuff to bring me back.
Veterans Guest House, Inc.	100299		/users/profile/121968	RandomlyRamblingRick	Board Member	5	11/04/2011	Last month I observed, with great humility and extreme gratitude, a personal landmark of 16 years serving on the board of directors of the Veterans Guest House.   There certainly are many worthwhile causes and projects to support, but I have found none more heartwarming or rewarding to the human spirit.Seeing the eyes of our guests, our veterans and their family members / care givers, hearing their words of appreciation, and witnessing the healing power of their camaraderie one with another, is beyond any experience I have ever enjoyed elsewhere. Every day is Veterans Day at the Veterans Guest House. We owe our veterans much, we owe our veterans everything.  I am proud to be a part of this effort and would encourage all who are able to participate.  Richard G. Shuster
Veterans Guest House, Inc.	100264		/users/profile/121899	radarman	Client Served	5	11/03/2011	Many veterans in Esmeralda County travel to the Reno VA Hospital (270 miles)  for the quality services they provide.  Another veteran told me about the Veterans Guest House when I was scheduled for appoinments at the hospital.  On my first visit to the guest house I was stunned.  Stunned in the fact that this facility exists and  is top quality all the way.  The citizens of Reno and Sparks can be extremely proud.  Many veterans  in Esmeralda county tried to keep the guest house a secret, but it is much too vital to keep it secret.  The staff is wonderful and over the years have become friends.  When able, I volunteer to assist with special events.   God Bless!
Veterans Guest House, Inc.	100261		/users/profile/121895	katmeow	Volunteer	5	11/03/2011	I have volunteered for the Veterans Guest House for several years now.  It is a fabulous place that gives Veterans and their families a safe, clean, loving place to stay when their are medical issues in their lives.  They turn no one away for lack of funds.  I have seen compassion and a sense of genuine care that you do not find normally associated with Veterans.  The Veterans and their families are treated with dignity and respect and every effort is made to meet their needs and accomodations on an individual basis.  It is truley a one of a kind House that most guests call their home-away-from-home during stressful and life threatening situations.  The staff is awesome!  The decor is warm and inviting.  As a non-profit that has no government funding and relys strictly on private donations, I am rewarded with a sense of having done something right everytime I volunteer.  What a marvelous way to give back to the men and women who served for all of us by volunteering at the Veterans Guest House.
Spirit Therapies	290296		/users/profile/380608	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/18/2016	Ive been volunteering at Spirit Therapies for the past 5 years and love it.  There are 9 horses (including 2 miniature horses), 4 dogs, 3 cats and 13 chickens on the ranch.  Its a family-like, supportive, calm environment, which encourages teamwork, social skills development, and problem solving skills.   Everyone, including the program participants, volunteers and staff are treated with dignity and respect in an atmosphere of inclusion.  The Executive Director, Laurie Willmott, has the unique ability to listen to everyone  without judgement, which is a skill that few people have.  It is also the only Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship (PATH) accredited premier center member  in Southern Nevada.  (PATH  is an association which ensures that strict safety guidelines for the horses, volunteers and staff are adhered to.)  Spirit Therapies assures these safety regulations are adhered so no one gets hurt while learning and having a good time.  While Ive been volunteering at Spirit Therapies, Ive seen clients progress through the centers programs.  Clients who never talked start speaking, their physical abilities, and confidence  have increased. Through the Horses Healing Heroes Program,  which services active duty/retired military personnel, the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress (anxiety, social isolation)  have decreased. For me, its a fantastic, indescribable feeling, and I feel privileged to be a witness to the clients progress. When I relocated to Las Vegas, I knew no one. Through volunteering at Spirit Therapies, Ive met so many people and established friendships. My horse knowledge was limited as well when I started volunteering.  Now  my knowledge has increased, as well as my confidence.  Its a great organization. I strongly encourage those people who are looking for a sense of purpose to volunteer at Spirit Therapies.

My husband and I had moved to Las Vegas for his health and I told him that when we moved, I was going to find something to do that involved horses.  That is how I started at Spirit, I just wanted to be with the horses.  But the first time I side walked and interacted with the kids, I fell in love with them.  I watched as child after child would come in, their bodies twisted or with illness such as Down's Syndrome, MS, Muscular Dystrophy, Angelman's Syndrome, spinal cord injuries, emotional distress, and other disabilities experience the expansion of their worlds through the magic of connecting with horses.   Parent's cry when their child talks or takes their first steps on their own.  They had been told by doctor's that their child would never be able to do any of those things.  These children were so often looked down on, but on the back of the horse, they grew stronger and learned to trust and communicate.  They were now looking down on us as we were now looking up to them.  One young man in particular, so loved the horses that he decide that when he graduated, he wanted to work around horses for a living.  Counselors at his school told him he would be only be qualified to hold a small job at maybe a McDonald's or some similar place.  Our Founder spoke with some friends who owned a boarding stable and he has been working there for a few years now, doing a fantastic job of caring for the horses there.  He was able to have his dream job.  His parents were ecstatic as he is so happy with his accomplishments.  Children who had suffered abuse or been trafficked came through our gates and I saw the wonderful ways they changed and evolved as the relationship between the horse, rider, and  volunteers evolved.  They began to see that they could trust and that they saw their own self-worth develop.  Some began to come back to work as volunteers, giving back to others and being so glad to help others.Then the Veteran's program was developed, Horses Helping Heroes started on 9/11/09.  First one Veteran came for therapy, he suffered from severe headaches and PTSD, it was slow work but he developed a strong relationship with one of our horses.  As time went on and as their bond grew, his headaches were less severe and did not occur as often.  We now serve a great number of veterans, and not just them but their families as well.  Family members of those with PTSD or any form of Special Needs receive indirect help as well, seeing their loved ones get better and being able to accomplish as goal.  The intercommunication with parents and care givers going through similar problems and gaining ideas and support from  others helps them as well.Then there are the horses.  Most are rescue horses, they were given a new purpose.  Mustangs, Rodeo horses who could no longer compete, horses whose owners could no longer care for them, now have a great live.  They have love, great care, and purpose.  They are so special and each one unique in the ability they have to help the different riders.Last but not least are the volunteers, we cold not operate without them.  Our volunteers give of their time, care, financially, and most importantly; they give their hearts! You see our rider's and clients are not the only ones receiving therapy.  Many a volunteer comes to help after a long stressful day and find that the aid they give and camaraderie from other volunteers helps them as well.  We work as a team to aid in anyway we can to keep Spirit Therapies the wonderful organization it is.Spirit Therapies was started by Laurie Willmott over 11 years ago and is the only PATH Certified Therapeutic Riding Center in all of Las Vegas.  She and Spirit were featured on CNN News for the work done for Veterans .I started for the horses, fell in love with the kids, and decided to become involved as much as possible.  Less than 3 months after finding Spirit Therapies, I joined the Board of Directors; serving for two years as the Vice-President.  I have been on the board now for 8 years and I wouldn't change a thing.  Diagnosed with Graves Disease over a year ago, I had to stop volunteering at the Center for almost a year, but stilled served on the board and starting to volunteer again.  I know how much Spirit personally helped me!  I cannot imagine not being a part of this wonderful organization.Our motto is: "Spirit Therapies is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization. Someday through support of our friends, riders, volunteers, sponsors and the public, we will be able to offer our services free of charge through our Pegasus Program."I want to say, 'Thank you' for this site to be able to write about this amazing facility and its' team members.
Spirit Therapies	289658		/users/profile/379648	Trisha49	Volunteer	5	05/12/2016	When I moved to Las Vegas 5 years ago, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my time. I tried other volunteer positions, but they didn't fit.  I heard about a horse place  and decided to check it out. I had owned horses and love them. When I walked on the property, I felt a sense of belonging. The other volunteers there welcomed me and Laurie,  CEO and instructor, welcomed me with open arms. I had never been around special needs children. They quickly stole my heart and I knew I had found where I was suppose to be.Spirit has become my extended family and second home. So much so that I am now their volunteer coordinator and train new volunteers.Everyone who comes through the gate is a part of this wonderful organization. I have made so many wonderful friends and seen the horses work their magic on so many kids and adults. Spirit is truly a place of peace and healing.
Spirit Therapies	289373		/users/profile/379616	megnjus2	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	Spirit Therapies has been an amazing experience for my teen who suffers from Epilepsy & Intellectual Deficit Disorder, as well as myself as a volunteer. I have witnessed miracles of healing through horseback therapy & Equine Assisted Learning, which is the program my daughter has been involved in for the past year. She had aggressive, almost suicidal issues. But, the programs at Spirit have helped her to express her emotions in a positive way! We have a saying at Spirit, "Came for the horses, stay for the kids." This holds very true for any volunteer who walks into the gates of Spirit Therapies!! It's truly a place of peace & healing for so many sweet special needs children. I have also seen great healing for Heroes suffering from PTSD through the Horses Healing Heroes program. It's all about releasing through ground training, helping these Heroes to release all their anxiety. My daughter & I are thankful everyday for Spirit Therapies & the impact the programs have had on us!! 
Spirit Therapies	289146		/users/profile/379364	amandaaa702	Volunteer	5	05/09/2016	I have been a volunteer at Spirit Therapies for a little over a year now, and I have to stay it has been an amazing experience! I started volunteering here because I love horses and children and I needed volunteer hours for a high school project. Many of the volunteers are teenagers, like myself, but we are all professional and hardworking. There is a "family feeling" at Spirit, we are close with not only each other, but the horses and the kids as well. The horses are always well kept after, groomed, and their stalls, water, and hay are always clean. Everyone at Spirit is so kindhearted and is always ready to greet you with a smile. My year at Spirit Therapies has been the best time I've had volunteering, while making a difference.

Food Bank of Northern Nevada	221203		/users/profile/284896	MikeReminick	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	All you ever hear about is how fantastic this org is, it is not hype.  They have an enormous need to meet in a rather small community.  Said in a different way, too high a percentage of Northern Nevadans are food insecure and the Food Bank meets this enormous need.   I have said before, the really great groups in this community don't get the pub they deserve.  This is another case.  This is an impressive non-profit.   
Food Bank of Northern Nevada	69658		/users/profile/76119	beckyczar	General Member of the Public	5	02/16/2011	I am an avid supporter of the Northern NV Food Bank. This organization efficiently and effectively moves food from its warehouse to a multitude of distribution sites.  Through many innovative programs the hungry of Northern Nevada are fed in a compassionate and caring manner without the fan fare of glitz or glamour.
Food Bank of Northern Nevada	63455		/users/profile/69378	NorthernNevadan	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	The Food Bank of Northern Nevada plays a huge part in helping to keep our community a wonderful place. They are truly dedicated to helping those in need and the staff are all wonderful, caring individuals.
Food Bank of Northern Nevada	63368		/users/profile/69283	ShazInNV	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I volunteered at FBNN when I was between jobs and found everyone to be genuinely concerned about hunger in NoNV and ensuring they did their best for all those in need.  What a great group of people!

The organization is well run, efficient and effective.  As the need continues to increase, please consider helping meet the basic needs of our community members through The Food Bank.
Food Bank of Northern Nevada	63169		/users/profile/69061	flayrah	General Member of the Public	4	02/04/2011	The Food Bank of Northern Nevada is an invaluable contributor to the community and region.   They work tirelessly to collect, warehouse, and distribute food and necessities to those in need.  They provide food and nutrition assistance not only for the homeless, but also with schools, under-employed, and shelters.  Although working with a limited budget and resources, the Food Bank of Northern Nevada consistently ensures that the value of every dollar in funding is multiplied in the resulting meals and assistance.   Without the support and leadership of the Food Bank, local food pantries, shelters, relief organizations and individuals would suffer and the community and region would face an unbearable burden.

Womens Resource Medical Centers Of Southern Nevada Inc	84684	1	/users/profile/93979	wjma	Donor	5	04/02/2011	WRMC is providing a God send to women who need  the truth.  They do it in such love and compassion that the results speak for themselves.  I attended several of their classes to learn first hand the alternative to abortion.  It melted my heart.  From that day forward I've put aside a set amount for a monthly donation.  I hope to do it the rest of my life or until abortion is overturned in this country.  With man all things seem impossible but with God all things are possible.
Womens Resource Medical Centers Of Southern Nevada Inc	83494	1	/users/profile/92511	Dr. Candy	Volunteer	5	03/28/2011	I was stunned to find out about WRMCSN 4 years ago, when I rushed in to become a trained volunteer counselor/minister and community speaker touting the virtues and grace of WRMCSN.  I am so grateful for the opportunity to be a part of a safe-place for people who come to find "a way out" and actually find "a way in" to sanity and peace and life and to the right decision for their future and the furture of their little babies.  It's the only place I know where anyone can come and find out the truth without being lied to and/or frightened into making a REAL choice for LIFE, both LIVES, all the LIVES connected to the miracle of Life itself!  WRMSCN is a MIRACLE, staffed with MIRACLES and making MIRACLES everyday the doors are keep open through donors and a fully dedicated staff, paid and unpaid.  Even the paid are unpaid for all they do...it is a true labor or love...how I wish it had been there for me 30 years ago when I needed someone to help...At least now that I know THE TRUTH, through WRMCSN, I can help others never have to live through the devastation that I did...WRMCSN just keeps making MIRACLES....LIVING ONES!!
Womens Resource Medical Centers Of Southern Nevada Inc	83427	1	/users/profile/92412	globyrd	Volunteer	5	03/28/2011	Since 1986 I have in various capacities been affiliated with WRMCSN and I remained partnered with them because I think that it plays a crucial role in giving woman a place to turn for real honest help when it would seem for them, there is none.  Being faced with an unexpected pregnacy is a scary thing, especially if no job, husband/boyfriend  or family member is pressuring you make decisions you don't want to, also having needs for their children they are unable to meet is daunting and those are just a few situations  that clients come to us in that we are able to help.  Sometimes it's just wanting an ear to listen  and in that  we are able to assist as well.   At the present time I volunteer as an interviewer/counselor to assist in best finding how to aid a client if a postive test or not.  Many woman that come to the center for pregnancy tests turn out negative, but we are able to give them referrals  or guide them in figuring out how to make wise decisions to help them through the circumstance (s) that brought them in.  When the test is positive we are able to offer ultrasounds  allowing them to see the baby and the heartbeat, it's thrilling to see the aw factor and realization, that the little life inside them is real, alive  and thiers.The joy from being part of this whole process and knowing we not only were a small part of at times saving a life, I believe we save the mother and all involved much trouble that could arise in the future without this opportunity to give them this valuable insight or service.
Womens Resource Medical Centers Of Southern Nevada Inc	83366	1	/users/profile/92321	peggy	Volunteer	5	03/27/2011	Women's Resource Medical Center of Southern Nevada is a great blessing to women and families in need of assistance in so many areas. They provide materials and education. They provide spiritual and emotional counseling. They make it possible for women to keep and raise their babies. They show women were they can go to get  much more help in the valley. It is one thing for someone to say "Oh she shouldn't do this or that, its wrong" But the WRMCSN gives women a viable alternative. They show them the love of Jesus Christ and they give them hope for their future and hope for their babies future. 
Womens Resource Medical Centers Of Southern Nevada Inc	83345	1	/users/profile/92294	jishmo	Volunteer	5	03/26/2011	This center does so much above and beyond to help the clients out.  They not only provide free pregnancy tests, and sonograms, but they also are there to counsel the clients, provide resources, give them emergency diapers, food, formula, baby clothes, maternity clothes, baby furniture and anything else that they have they give.  It is awesome and I am blessed to be able to work with such a wonderful organization.
Second Chance Animal Rescue	309784		/users/profile/401142	HarlowsMom	Client Served	5	10/11/2016	I adopted my little baby Harlow from them! They were so great and took time to go through everything with me. Harlow is my first dog (besides my family dogs) and I had A LOT of questions. They helped me even weeks after I adopted her. Love them. I am going to get Harlow a friend soon and will be coming back!
Second Chance Animal Rescue	309406		/users/profile/400772	LanaL702	Client Served	5	10/10/2016	This rescue saved my puppy when I could not afford to help her. My puppy was diagnosed with parvo and I had no money for treatment so I was going to have to just take her home and see what happened, but Second Chance paid for my puppies treatment and now shes back home and safe with me. 
Second Chance Animal Rescue	272860		/users/profile/361993	VegasSoccerMom702	Client Served	5	11/24/2015	I adopted my sweet, loving puppy from this rescue. We were unsure how my current dog would react to other dogs so they came to our house and did an introduction, and spent over two hours with us to make sure the transition went smooth. Even though everything went great we still were unsure about adding another dog, so they allowed us to keep her for a week before deciding to adopt! Our new puppy fits in great, and we love her so much! Penelope is the new love of our lives!

Second Chance Animal Rescue	223687	1	/users/profile/287432	Foster Life LV	Volunteer	1	10/16/2014	After 5 months fostering for this rescue, I learned the hard way that all rescues ARE NOT THE SAME. I found that this rescue DOES NOT DO ANY HOME CHECKS WHATSOEVER. I dealt with only THE OWNER. I did not get fully reimbursed like "promised", so I am out about 100.00, maybe more (not really a concern) I found the owner to have no respect for the the animals she takes in..based on what i call "dump and run", on several occasions she dumped fosters to "just anyone". The owner did not care about the dog we fostered..we wanted to adopt her after 5 months she became part of the family...after the owner took Gypsy...she ignored myself and my 11 year old who is devastated.  My 11 year old daughter left so many voice mails crying, who could ignore that?? THE OWNER!! My daughter went from an A to D in just 3 weeks over this..again..the owner would not call back, changes all information about Gypsy and she basically made her disappear everywhere. The least she could have done is send us an update..but NO. She blocks EVERYONE on her facebook page that asks how their foster is doing...how odd...she did this to other fosters as well. And one foster i spoke with said that that foster experience cost about 1,200 out of pocket....and the owner did not thank any of  us... I found the owner to be a habitual liar..though she acts so sweet..just an act.  And leaving fosters with bills!  Instead of teaching my daughter to help the community, she learned about sociopaths and Cruella Deville.   
Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada	84235		/users/profile/93400	Renee G.	Donor	4	03/30/2011	I discovered Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada when I started to donate to the Camp Foxtail campaign. On my tour of the remote camp I could envision the smiles and laughter and even the challenges a girl goes through during her week stay.  I think it's amazing the organization helps with scholarships to girls who might not be able to afford camp. I worked at a kids camp for three years and it is amazing to see how they grow and discover themselves year after year. 
Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada	83971		/users/profile/93082	vegasdaisy11	Client Served	5	03/29/2011	As a lifetime member, Girl Scouts has meant a great deal to me. I earned my Gold Award and was able to go backpacking in Zion National Park, canoeing in the Boundary Waters, and attend a music camp in North Carolina, among other things. I became passionate about the outdoors, community service, and travel. After working in my field for a number of years I served in the Peace Corps in the Phillipines and am now a Park Ranger at Everglades National Park. My thirteen years as a girl scout in this council introduced me to a wide world of experiences that led me to where I am and who I am today.
Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada	83774		/users/profile/92136	ashsmith96	Client Served	5	03/29/2011	I was a troop leader for many years and I have to say, I was impressed with the safety standards of the organization, and the training and ongoing support they provide their volunteers.  To volunteer as a troop leader, I had to provide references, had a background check, and a co-leader who was not related in any way.  The organization looked after everything and provided me training before I ever held my first meeting.  Admittedly, I was a little nervous at first because I had no idea what I was doing.  But the organization and its volunteer support system helped me to feel included and gave me a wealth of resources to rely on for support.
Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada	83521		/users/profile/92547	AimeeS	Donor	4	03/28/2011	I was a girl scout for six years growing up in Las Vegas. I left the organization due to my interests at the time, but always had fond memories of my time spent there.  I was so happy to learn about the Thin Mint Sprint several years later - it was a great way to get the community involved with the girl scouts and for a chance for me to once again touch base with this organization. I also appreciate how it involved healthful living through running and walking activities - It's great to enjoy all the girl scout cookies (which I did at the end!), but it's important that the kickoff to the selling season was with activity as the two should go hand in hand.  Kudos to the Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada finally bridging the gap of their No. 1 selling/fund-raising initiative with activity to promote healthy living. It's good for the women and girls in Girl Scouts as well as for the community. 
Girl Scouts of Southern Nevada	40875	8	/users/profile/41761	lvnay	Donor	5	05/26/2010	I became a Girl Scout in Southern Nevada when I was 6 years old.  I participated all the way through my senior year in high school.  As a senior I earned my Gold Award, the highest level award you can earn in Girl Scouting.Girl Scouts builds strong girls that know what they want out of life.  It gives girls the courage to go after what they want.  The program builds their confidence and character. It shows them the world is bigger than just their school or city and asks them what they will do to change it.I am who I am today and have succeeded in life due to the skills and relationships I built in Girl Scouts.
Music for Hope, Inc.	97221		/users/profile/113916	casper	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2011	I have had the pleasure of seeing this organization in action. They are helpful, knowledgeable and sincere in what they do. Keep on showing the passion...it does make a difference
Music for Hope, Inc.	97218		/users/profile/113906	Mike2345	Volunteer	5	09/06/2011	What a great idea!  Getting musical instruments in the hands of kids who otherwise might not be able to afford them.  Music For Hope works through schools and other organizations to get donated instruments where they can change a life!  Music has been so important to me in my life, and the folks who work with Music For Hope are so dedicated, that it gives me great pleasure (and warm fuzzies) to see the horns, violins, guitars, drums, etc. being delivered to youngsters.  Just imagine the excitement of handling an instrument, where there wasn't one before!
Music for Hope, Inc.	97199		/users/profile/113822	lunaincognita	Volunteer	5	09/05/2011	I found Music for Hope after looking for an organization that not only provided a valuable community resource but also matched my strengths and interests. It did not take long to discover that the people involved in the organization had a tremendous amount of heart and determination for doing what they do. Everyone involved is constantly pushing the organization and each other toward higher goals. Most importantly, the end goals of helping children who lack the resources for participating in music and increasing community participation in music are always at the forefront of the organization's aim.
Music for Hope, Inc.	97185		/users/profile/113791	Renee Blue O.	Volunteer	5	09/05/2011	Music for HOPE is an exceptional organization.  To empower young people with the gift of music is one of the most inspirational things anyone can do.   Playing an instrument in a band gives kids many positive skills to be successful in the world.  As it is said, "music in the universal language" and as a child embarks on the path of learning music, they learn ways to communicate with people of all walks of life.  What Music for HOPE does is help kids find their voice in the world.  It gives them hope and experience to make a positive difference in the world.  In these times when the arts are being cut from the school programs,  organizations like Music for HOPE are more needed then ever to help kids gain access to musical participation and expression.  It is a joy and an honor to volunteer with Music for HOPE!
Music for Hope, Inc.	52154		/users/profile/53005	kissthis161	Volunteer	5	09/10/2010	Music for Hope is one of the most addictive non profit organizations that I have had the distinct pleasure of working with on a notable cause. I have seen first hand how these kids transform their thinking, attitude and passion to succeed. Children deserve a fighting chance in our society to experience many opportunities that will give them a well rounded education and tools to be successful in their endeavors throughout life.I was a poor kid and had to rely on family and friends to be able to get involved in a music program. We didn't have a program such as this. I wish we had! I can say that music has played a major part in my life since I picked up my first instrument. I have gone on to teach music privately and also go into under developed schools and help with music programs on that level as well. I have also pursued music in my own life and have never given up on that dream. I want to instill in others that they to can do this regardless of economic situation. I want lie and say it is easy because it isn't but when you have something to shoot for then it makes all the hard work pay off.Guess I have said enough but when you read this I hope that you can feel the passion in which it was written. Have a beautiful day and keep music alive!
Give Me A Break Inc	69212		/users/profile/75636	Lori	Board Member	5	02/16/2011	I am one of the founding members of GAB, Inc. who formed this organization with other mothers of children with special needs.  As parents to a child with special needs, our resources were limited.  When forming this organization, we thought other parents/caregivers were probably dealing with similar situations as ourselves.  This foundation has strengthened many families in Southern Nevada by giving them the necessary support to take one day at a time.  I am proud to be part of this organization and what GAB has done to support families. 
Give Me A Break Inc	68884		/users/profile/75273	Kate	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	I have been an active volunteer with GAB Inc. for over 5 years.  This is a grassroots organization that was started by a small group of  parents with special needs children. Together, they would mentor and assist in supporting each other to develop a skill base, educate and share in each other the trials of raising children with a 24/7  365 day need for additional support. What an inspiration. From this small group, GAB has grown to help those in the community facing the same challenges. GAB provides a much needed service, Respite.  Each third Saturday of the month families are welcome to come to our Respite Activity Day and let their children learn, grow, develop and play. While the children are being taken care of, the caretaker/parent is given at leat 6 hours  to rejuveniate and renew. As a volunteer, I see the children happy to be apart of the program but what I notice is who those 6 hours has helped the caretaker/parent. Some come in with on overwhelmed feeling only to return with a sense peace.  Volunteering and being a part of this wondering program and how it effects families is in some ways my sense of peace. GAB Inc. is a worthwhile and much needed community program.

The love that goes into caring for an individual with special needs is shared by our staff and volunteers.  Respite is like taking a deep breath knowing that your loved one is being cared for while you "Take a Break".   We are not there to replace you.  We cannot do that.  But we can be there for you when you need the time.

Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary	179830		/users/profile/236476	April L.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/19/2013	Wee Paws does a great job of finding animals it can help, and accepting with healing arms the animals that come to them. They have the resources (well--they always need help with financial resources, like all rescue organizations--I meant they have intelligence and training!) and the will to assist all animals, even those with health problems, and the love to carry it out. Their knowledge and love is inspiring to everyone who hears about them, and the animals they've helped (and saved). They also have good people skills :) Bravo on Wee Paws!
Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary	179822		/users/profile/236466	KittyLover17	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	I love that they have an absolute passion for saving cats and providing a loving and caring home for them. I also love cats and have rescued 3 of my own.  The fact that they save cats with disabilities or FIV+ who otherwise would most likely be killed in a shelter have a safe haven here and it absolutely warms my heart. I love seeing the growth of the no-kill movement throughout the nation and this sanctuary is among them saving the lives of so many sweet kitties. Keep it up!
Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary	99966		/users/profile/121393	JAClarke	Donor	5	10/29/2011	We first visited Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary in April 2011 to deliver two senior cats from Orange County Shelter as we were enroute to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Utah. Wee Paws immediately reminded us of a small scale Best Friends where cats receive the best of care. At Wee Paws cats are free to roam the sanctuary, which is remarkable for its cleanliness and variety of spaces for cats to play and sleep. There are no cages. Each cat has one-on-one care from Leigh-Ann and Nancy: fresh food is prepared daily; Leigh-Ann monitors the health of each cat and provides a detailed analysis of any sickness. It is truly a cat paradise. Wee Paws provides an essential and compassionate service in giving senior and disabled cats abandoned by others the chance to live out their lives in comfort, knowing love, and with dignity. We are enthusiastic in our support of Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary.
Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary	99336		/users/profile/118980	kch917	Donor	5	10/15/2011	Last weekend I made the 5 hour (each way) drive to Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary to take my sweet rescue kitty, Mayfair, and a gorgeous senior, Jackie, who was saved from the kill shelter, to their new home.  I finally got to meet Leigh-Ann and Nancy, who share their home with about 40 cats and 4 dogs.  There were birds too, but I forgot to meet them - I was too busy petting kitties.  There are so many rescue organizations out there and I never know which one(s) I should support.  Most of the time I have only what I see online to go by, and I click some Paypal links or mail a check and hope it does a furry creature some good.  I always had a good feeling about Wee Paws from what I've known of them online, and I'm happy to say I was correct.  Leigh-Ann and Nancy are wonderful people.  Their house is huge and well suited for a cat sanctuary and CLEAN.  No matter how much I sweep up at my own house, I always find cat fluff in corners of the room, kitty litter tracked down the hall, and the occasional hairball - and I only have 6 cats.  I saw none of this at their place.  The only stray bits of fluff were the ones clinging to my shirt after a gorgeous deaf white kitty with beautiful blue eyes (Lucy) purred and rubbed all over me.  The cats were happy & healthy - some playing and others napping comfortably.  The only growls in the place came from the cats I brought, Jackie and Mayfair, who were really annoyed by the 5 hour drive.  I wish my 6 got along as well as the cats at Wee Paws!  It was a really difficult thing for me to do, giving up my sweet little rescue, Mayfair, but I could tell that she's going to have all the love and excellent care she deserves.  I have every intention of supporting Wee Paws as much as I can in the future, by donating and by going back there to help with whatever they need. 
Wee Paws Animal Sanctuary	97890		/users/profile/115569	DebbieWow	Client Served	5	09/21/2011	Wee Paws looked after our cats for free until we could find a new place to live.  They looked after our cats for three months and didn't charge us anything, and when we picked our cats up they'd been groomed and had even lost weight on a diet.  Wee Paws showed us how to feed our cats canned food so they'd loose weight and be more playful and cleaner.  They even delivered our cats to our new home.

This woman who believes she is so special that she and her brainwashed followers call her God. I truly feel sorry for these people that go to this cult. They have been scamming people for years all in the name of the Lord. This so called "prophetess" has so many aliases I think she should change her name to Lucifer. Next time she starts frothing at the mouth and babbling her so called truths, ask yourself "is this God?" Cause if you believe it is just remember she has claimed to be so many other people when really she is a mentally unstable wackadoo. Stay away or "line up" and be decived.

I personally enjoyed working with Stacy Martello. As a breast cancer survivor, you can really see the passion that comes through her. It is this passion and the drive of the organization that will continue them in the right direction for years to come!Fight Pink is an excellent organization and I am happy to be able to say that I am involved with it.

I was touched and honored when Stacy invited me to share my survivor story on her site. Since then (2 yrs ago), Stacy and I have collaborated together on many events and Fight Pink and The Empty Cup Runneth Over are now joined together on each others website.
On My Way Home Rescue	245212	2	/users/profile/332334	Desertdawn321	Volunteer	5	06/13/2015	An amzing grouo of dedicated volunteers. We adopted our darling Hank from them. He is a wonderful addition to out family. This rescue group is so thorough in addending to their foster dogs medical and social needs. They match these precious dogs that, no one else wants to new living forever homes.  What a wonderful group!
On My Way Home Rescue	245210	3	/users/profile/332331	Trish19	Volunteer	5	06/13/2015	My Dad stumbled upon this charity via Twitter about 3 months ago. We were originally going to adopt an older dachshund. Once we met with the rescue, we discovered their needs were greater. We have become volunteers and fosters to 3 dachshunds. They truly care about each and every dog that comes through the rescue, and any dog for that matter.  They go above and beyond to care for the dogs, regardless of the condition they arrive at the rescue. Sick, injured, or a dog that needs a little love and reassuring, no dog is turned away. I'm so glad we found them and we're able to work with them. 
On My Way Home Rescue	245194	2	/users/profile/332309	LoveHaight	Volunteer	5	06/13/2015	I fostered an amazing pup, Yoda, through this rescue group. This is a relatively small but VERY supportive, closely knit group of dedicated, ambitious, productive and compassionate rescuers. They are so well organized and consistently on top of their game. Never does a phone call go unreturned. They picked up my foster pup and took him to adoption events when I wasn't able to. They set him up for BEAUTIFUL professional pet portraits. They tended to any concerns or needs that the pup had AS WELL AS myself... I couldn't be in greater company. They have monthly events at Lake Las Vegas called Bottles for Barks that are fun, interactive, well-networked, beautiful and successful. I truly can't say enough about this rescue group. Steph is especially wonderful, tirelessly devoted and active with genuine care and concern.

Nevada Fair Housing Center Inc	321009		/users/profile/414149	PeaceNquiet	Volunteer	5	01/10/2017	I volunteered with the Nevada Fair Housing Center many times during 2016. We cleaned up several properties that had been vacant for years. Funds were low because they weren't operating under any grants or donations and the previous Director had died recently, so it was hard for them to keep the doors open, yet they managed to find homes for three homeless families. I'm looking forward to continuing to volunteer with them in the future.

The employees paychecks constantly bounced--I had to keep going back to their bank for two weeks with my check before funds were available to cash it.  Grant checks would come in and vendors would constantly call for payment.  CEO/President/Attorney  needs to be investigated.  The service is needed for the community, but under respectful, professional management.

I was prepared for high school students so thought I'd have to modify my power point for the middle school aged girls.  As I started to interact with them, I found this not to be true.  The young  ladies were well versed and interactive.  I'm thankful for C4S and what they are doing for At Risk Girls in our community.

One young lady's mother has nothing but praise for the Club.  She watched her daughter grow from a shy timid child into a well spoken young lady and not afraid to be different. The program offers a positive support system and help them to maintain their self Esteem.  We are committed to helping young girls at risk ages 9-14 years old; gain emotional, social & behavioral skills for a more positive future. The program is unique, because there is no other one out there that addresses all the issues that is covered in our 20 week Life Skill Program.  This program is very much needed for that age group.  Please endorse Corner4Success Foundation to help more at risk girls benefit from our program.

We do adoptions but it is slow.  Many of our dogs have been with us for years and are older dogs that people don't want.  We have a Thrift Store at the ranch that helps us feed our animals.  We've been established since 1995 and became a 501C3 in 2002.  We have very little help from the community and we only have 3 volunteers that come in on a regular basis.

Empowering Parents Inc	64556	2	/users/profile/63990	Teresa P.,	Volunteer	5	02/07/2011	I am gladly giving this food bank a 5 star rating. It's important to share that it's self-sustaining. Not only do the participants take ownership in it, they also staff the facility. The "hand-up", not a "hand-out" really suited my desires to be helpful also.My first experience, waiting in the line, was a humbling one for sure. I was lost in where to go for food resources and I didn't want to dig out every piece of identification just for a couple cans of food or maybe some rice.My name, how many in my household, and a "maintenance fee" is all that was required. That in itself was a relief. My heart was pounding as I made my way down the bread isle and picked out 10 loaves of bread. I could hear laughter and people chattering away in front of me, but I was still scared.I was making my way to a red counter where this woman was eagerly saying "hello" to everyone and seems truly concerned about what everyone did during the past week. People were donating money to get flowers that were offered too.The lady in front of me didn't have money for flowers so I offered her my change. The lady behind me offered me hers and it just kept going down the line. Needless to say, they ended up with extra donations and about 4 families walked out with beautiful flowers.I was truly in shock at this point. This was no ordinary food bank! I got to the red counter and found a pre-packed box of perishable foods. Not one can or bag. Milk, eggs, fruits, veggies, and even some hot dogs. The lady at the counter introduced herself as did I and we laughed about the flower incident. She put a sheet cake on top of my box and asked me to come back and volunteer. I've been volunteering every since.
Empowering Parents Inc	96104	1	/users/profile/111857	JJSany	Volunteer	1	08/20/2011	Disgusting place to volunteer for any length of time. Once a week should fulfill any desire to get out of the house and participate in the community. There's another great volunteers to socialize with. This place needs new management! Elaine (the executive director) seems to always be a mental basket case. She yells, shows favoritism (as long as you agree with her every word your her pet), is a control freak, and can't seem to keep her religious views from taking over the place. Paul, (Elaine's husband and president), never seems to want to take on the emotional crisis within the facility. It must be the husband thing to do! This place is always in turmoil. Scrambling around like chickens with their heads cut off and yelling at volunteers for being that way. Most of the volunteers appear to be happy as long as they stay clear of management. From what I understand, Elaine is the only paid employee. She makes money for being rude, disrespectful, hurtful, crying in despair, messing up accounts, and yelling at participants and volunteers? This is why I saw volunteers constantly walking out of the facility. Oh...and don't forget to say, "thank you Elaine" when she tells you too or you'll get the evil eye!

The Rape Crisis Center	39020	3	/users/profile/39953	margaret5	Board Member	5	05/14/2010	I joined the Rape Crisis Center Board of Directors in October 2009. Before making the decision to join, I researched the organization and interviewed with other Board members to determine if I would be a good fit for the Board.  Since that time I have been active in several fund raising ventures. I am on the Audit Committee and Building Committee. I am very impressed with the commitment made by the people serving on the board as well as Lu Torres the Rape Crisis Center, Exectuve Director, and her staff.The Center is very well managed and serves the local community well. I recently attended 12 hours of the training classes offered by the center and was very impressed both by the quality of the teachers used and the materials. I also was able to tour the area set aside at UMC Hospital for the rape victims. This was very important to me as I wanted to know what the hospital procedure was for the vicims, as well as understand as much as possible the gathering of evidence etc. The more education that I receive about sexual abuse, the better I can  serve on the Board and assist with continually improving the services offered by the Center.

HopeLink of Southern Nevada	287028	1	/users/profile/377100	Donald_M	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Almost buried treasures.24 billion computers in the world and not a single one will ever carry the story of Lois, the 91 year-old award-winning poet, prairie woman and mother of ten.  The ranch is gone, the children are gone and her binders of rhymes on the living room shelf will soon be tossed in the dumpster behind her one bedroom apartment, as forgotten as the unclaimed plastic box of her cremated remains.People, like icebergs on a slow melt, are not always what they seem. White and pale for years on the surface, they conceal so many layers of translucent centuries-buried colors, rarely seen by a disinterested mankind.  Like pages of a novel dissolved away  by the waves, the iceberg and its colors will soon be no more.And no one will know any different.I had done her a favor.Lois had lost most of her sight in her old age and told me she was tired of pouring watery canned julienne carrots over her pasta.  Her tiny food pantry was mostly proceeds from the food bank  and she could no longer tell the difference between a label of vegetables over one of marinara.  Id printed out stickers in 48point Helvetica bold and finally arrived to organize her pantry so that she could now tell the difference with a flashlight and the large magnifying glass she kept within easy grasp at the window sill.She offered me toast and marmalade as a thank you which I declined mostly because I didnt have the heart nor stomach to eat Frenchs mustard on a slice of bread.  Mental note for a return visit: refrigerator labels.While I needed to soon return to my regular post at the senior center outreach for which Id left a note Back in 45 minutes, I didnt know  at the time it would be at least two hours before my return.Walking behind her in her walker toward the sofa for a brief chat before leaving was tedious until I noticed the many white notebooks on the shelf, labeled Olivia, Jenny and the names of many others.  Inquiring, she invited me to take the volume Christopher home for the weekend knowing I was also a writer and much less of a poet. I think youll like that one, Don.  She went on to explain she wrote poetry as a young woman and had been published more times than she could remember.  Many of her poems had become greeting cards for Hallmark and before that, smaller card companies across the U.S. and abroad.  The bookends bracing her impressive collection were trophies for writing and poetry whose engravings had blurred and tarnished over the many years since she lost her sight and could only rub to read, which shed done probably thousands of times since.We talked of many things, including the ten children for which her binders were named, her little house on the prairie, the brevity of her fame before losing her sight, and her enduring fondness for capturing inspirational moments in her prose.  So immersed in her colorful stories of the past, I finally looked at my phone to see the time had come and gone to return to my post.  We said our goodbyes and it was my Friday, so I took Christopher and headed back to the office to pack up and enjoy my three day weekend.          The saddest story in all of history will always be the one which went undiscovered and untold to no person nor pen and was buried alive eternally in an old soul.These were the words that came to me while I sat on my bed and had coffee with Christopher for three hours that Friday evening.  Reading the poems and prose, I didnt cry even once.  It was probably a half dozen times or more.  The richness and antiquity of the words of that 91 year old prairie woman melted my soul, imagining that someday, with no one to claim them, the orphaned binders  Christopher, Olivia, Jenny and the seven others might end up in a dirty dumpster and a landfill, and probably very soon.It was the weekend, and the days when I take care of my own aged mother .Though 35 years Lois junior, I wondered what stories I will have missed of my own family history if I didnt take the opportunity that weekend to have a chat with her on the sofa that rainy afternoon.  I primed the pump with a few nostalgic recollections of our family and we had a few laughs as she played solitaire on her Kindle.  I could tell Id begun to brew something more.  Her game slowed as small oral vignettes of her own family history emerged piecemeal and at random until she was telling me complete stories of times growing up in Storm Lake, Iowa on the farm.  Each story she told seemed to revive another shed perhaps never told another. The kids she played with in the church across the street and the scolding of the pastor for playing hide and seek among the pews.  The memories of her parents and aunts and great grandparents were flowing in alternating waves of sadness and laughter.  Though they werent poetic, they were the stories of her life, and by distant relation, those I valued as my own.Each of us has a story to tell.  But in these electronic days, few take the time to listen in the way stories should be told.  Indeed, storytelling, the old fashioned way that families passed on their histories, values and expectations to the next generation, is a lost art.And out of 24 billion computers in the world, only a handful will find it important to pass on the stories of people who will otherwise soon be buried with them undiscovered and untold forever.It was Monday morning again, and my day to return to the low income senior center where my outreach first introduced me to Lois and her many children. With Christopher tucked neatly under my arm, and a handful of refrigerator labels,  I arrived, closed up, and affixed a note on the door.It read Back in 2 hours.There are so many older Americans whose fame was never counted by measures of celebrity, celluloid or column inches in fabulous magazines, but whose life stories are noteworthy nonetheless.  And I have found that the aged ones who have never sought an audience for them, sometimes have the most engaging of all to tell.Especially if you will take the time, ask, and then sit back with a coffee and some mustard toast, and listen.And bring your computer.Don Miller  #mygivingstory
HopeLink of Southern Nevada	287027		/users/profile/377099	Don_M2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Selfie.All he wanted was a photograph.I took his picture, but he may never get  the one he wants most of all.I always leave my door open when Im on site at the senior center twice a week.  I set up shop there to meet low income senior citizens and try to engage with them to show them the kinds of services I can offer  free of charge.  Ways to save on utility bills, plans for having food when the money runs out before the month does, budgeting help, how to escape from being prey to the payday loan companies and so many other services that can make a meager fixed income go much further and last much longer.This generation of senior citizens are a unique breed.  They are the aging baby boomers and what I consider the last of the moral few. They grew up with the idea that you should always work hard, scrimp and save, pay your bills and be willing to sacrifice if you cant.  They grew up without computers or computer education and today know very little about how to navigate most things younger people do from their phones in an instant.And, sadly, they are a generation of lost people.  There are no large scale wars that unite them as a group. Their children were born in the me generation of self-centeredness and permissiveness and who, for the most part,  have found keeping generational ties unimportant.  As a result and more often than not, they abandon the older generation as if it is somehow the respectful thing to do.  Todays seniors are also a generation first to experience the insufficiency of social security income to buy the retirement they had hoped. What are so errantly called the Golden Years are truly as thin and flimsy as aluminum foil.I work the saddest shift at the non-profit charity I chose to join a year ago today.My  open door policy, however, seems to make it a little easier for these needy but ashamed old people to be willing to break the ice.  Like rescue dogs beaten down from years of abuse, they often are afraid to make the first contact. Fortunately, Im pretty good at that and regularly seek out and engage many solo seniors who have had nobody to talk with for years.  Their lifetime friends are either six feet under or six hundred miles away and they dont have money for milk much less travel in these Aluminum Years.Again, I made the first move.For three weeks, hed passed by while I was in what they called the Library at the senior center. Its not much of a library, really.  It has a cache of donated old books and magazines piled neatly as if they were new editions.  Nobody is fooled by the name of the room which doubles for bingo on Tuesday afternoons where winners receive rolls of toilet paper as prizes.I never heard him coming down the hall and mostly only got a glimpse of his profile as he would  pass through the light streaming in the doorway so many times before. Each trip, he always turned his head and proceeded at a steady pace as if on a conveyor belt to nowhere.It took some coaxing. I got up from the computer and stood by the door so that the chance meeting might be a little easier for him if it was to happen at all.  He was far down the corridor, head down and without direction.  But he must have heard me or seen my friendly gesture somehow, for as I sat back down, he was right there at the door, seemingly in reciprocation.Hey there!, I spoke loudly as most of the people around here are hard of hearing or not used to being selected for a conversation.He looked up and through the doorway. As he came closer, I could see great depth in the crevasses in his face and his long, black feeble shadow met me long before he did.Hows it going on this beautiful day?He looked around as if perhaps I was addressing another, more important passerby.  I introduced myself and my reason for being here and asked the same of him.Im Al, and I just need a photograph.I invited him to sit awhile and tell me about this photograph he wanted.At first, he wasnt well spoken but when he did, his long grey beard moved in synchronicity with each syllable.  Obviously anxious at the thought of talking with a complete stranger and worse, having a need to present to one, he chose his words very carefully.Al hadnt seen his three kids in some time. It had been years for two, perhaps a decade more for the oldest.  He knows he must have grandchildren by now and wonders if one of them might be an Albert or Alan or Allisonnamed in his memory as if he were already dead and gone.  Its not likely.  After his wife died in 84, the kids moved him to this senior living community in the desert where hed have a really fun time with all the people his age and the games and the bingo and all that list of lies he was told as he managed the last $700 of his savings as a deposit when he signed.He was all of 81 now, and in addition to winning a roll of toilet paper  now and then, he spends holidays, birthdays and anniversaries alone except when he can get a ride to the library or the cemetery where his wife was laid to rest 30 years earlier. To make best use of the ride and the welcomed time away, he  goes grave to grave to pull weeds, straighten dirty plastic flowers and talks to all the horizontal people mostly his age and older. Except of course Sally, his wife, who only made it a half century before a drunk in a pickup truck ended their marriage and for some reason,  the only real connection to the children and family.Today, he was missing them and wondering about their well-being. He had their addresses on some scraps of paper he pulled from his wallet as I offered him a cold bottle of water.  There were no phone numbers, just penciled addresses which had blurred illegible after so many years in his wallet next to what looked like high school pictures.Al hadnt had a picture taken of him since he could remember.We talked of his history and my own in extended groups of topics from fishing to art to puppies. Id come to discover he was quite a well-rounded man of experience who had evidently cared so much for his wife and children when he was a younger man that his kindness had been taken as weakness and his family had exhausted most of his time and assets before he was shipped out to the desert to wither and die with the hundreds more just like him.  As he became more comfortable, we even talked about death itself and speculated how each of us might eventually kick our respective buckets.I didnt share it with him but by the look of his frail, taut face and thin weathered body, he was sure to die of starvation if something wasnt done soon.  I told him we have a food pantry I bring every Thursday morning and suggested he be first in line with a couple very large bags. It was the first smile he had given me all morning.I  used that smile  as an opportunity to fill him in on some things I thought we could do to help his situation and stretch his $718 monthly social security income and $14 in food stamps.  That brought the second smile of the morning.  I was on a roll and thought I might go for three and asked him to sit back against the wall as I used my IPhone to do for him what hed come for.He obliged, licked his fingers and briefly ran them through the few hairs on his head, straightening his beard in what was obviously his own idiosyncratic method  for many, many years.  I laughed as he did his little routine and told him my beard would never be as long as his but surely as grey.  And the instant he laughed, I snapped the picture  and showed him how great he looked in it.Id have easily guessed he had not seen himself in a mirror for what might have been years the way he held my phone and gazed at his own image. His last picture was at the DMV four years prior.  He had aged quickly in four years. Very quickly.Wow, you look very different from your ID picture, Al.I kinda guessed I might.   A lot has changed in four years.Al shared with me had been diagnosed with inoperable colon cancer 3 years prior and at the last visit to his doctor, was told he probably wouldnt make it to Thanksgiving.Al wanted a final picture of himself that could be displayed on his own grave wherever he might be buried like the many horizontal friends before him.  It wasnt likely that his family would make the trip to see dad and grampa before he passed but if so, he wanted them to see the man hed become just in case someday they became curious about what happened to old Al.He said he could never figure out what hed done wrong for them to not contact him again and hoped this picture of April 7th, 2015 might be different enough from how they knew him years before and that even from the grave, he might get a second chance to show them how much he had thought about them over the years and hoped theyd made lots of babies,  perhaps one named Al.I printed the picture and presented it to him for the fourth smile of the morning.  I dont think he had had mustered four smiles in a morning for as many years.With our work doneor perhaps just begunhe got up and shook my hand and thanked me for having stood in the doorway an hour ago.And as he left through the sunlight of that same doorway, I extended an invitation to Thanksgiving dinner at my house with my own three kids.The fifth smile.I took another picture.

Shes thinking about what she can make for three school lunches that need to head out the door in a few hours, how she will pay her overdue rent and if she can get just three hours sleep before leaving to her other job.Important things are happening in the world tonight.I know John has been up most of the night not because hes a night owl, but because hes an 81 year old vet whose gas was shut off last week. Hes cold and cant get a warm meal until next week sometime when his $700 check arrives to pay the bill, the rent and a ride to the food bank to pick up leftovers others have donated.Important things are happening in the world tonight.And here I sit in shiny black shoes and a borrowed suit at 430am at my office, because I know theyre awake and they are the important things and because I think Ive crafted a plan that might help their tragedies.Important things are happening in the world tonight.Im always in the office at this time of the morning. Its quiet and Im alone to think about these important things. Im not generally wearing a suit and shiny shoes, but tonight I will be at an event with over 400 people who need to hear about whats important.I honestly dont care about winning, but I do care about the possibilities it may bring to our little non-profit in old Henderson and how, if translated correctly, some important people tonight might pause and hear about people like Megan and John and 10,000 more like them. And maybe theyll give a dollar to help.Our agency, HopeLink of Southern Nevada, was nominated for Outstanding Non-Profit of 2015 and the winner will be announced this evening over a gourmet dinner in a room full of suits at a luxury hotel. Win or lose, all nominees will win something for the people they serve every day. A voice.People dont like sad stories, but sad stories can move the right people to do the right things to help make fewer sad stories. I believe thats important.So Ill sit there for a few hours, maybe win, likely not, but Ill have the captive ears of a privileged few who need to know the important things that are happening in this world, right here at home.And taking off this suit and uncomfortable shoes, I can sleep well tonight, knowing I went to bat for the tragedies which begin at home and end with charity.

SAINT GABRIEL FELINE FOUNDATION	254348		/users/profile/342685	Nicole128	General Member of the Public	1	08/29/2015	I wanted to adopt a kitten, but the Saint Gabriel Feline Foundation (Marie/founder, located inside of PetSmart) told me no for the following reasons: 1) I wouldn't always be available for home inspections due to being in the military, 2) I have a 15 year old cat that is front declawed (the founder herself has 2 cats that are declawed) so she assumed I would declaw this kitten, 3) concerned that my 15 year old cat would injure or kill the kitten (my cat is not aggressive what so ever). Out of the 7 minutes I was on the phone with the founder, I was lectured 90% of that time about the negative effects of declawing.  I never said I would declaw him, I let her know he'd have pet health insurance and routine care, he'd be in a loving home, and be an indoor cat.  The founder was mad that I wouldn't be able to come back at 7:30 pm (which was 2 hours later) and then said she will say no to this adoption.  I also want to add that this founder chose to bad mouth me to PetSmart and other customers. She is falsely stating that declawing is illegal. Very unprofessional!
SAINT GABRIEL FELINE FOUNDATION	254347	1	/users/profile/342684	Chuck22	General Member of the Public	1	08/29/2015	Well firstly, Nicole is my girlfriend.  Today, I decided to make contact with St. Gabriel Feline Foundation (Marie/Founder) while at PetSmart on Craig Rd., Las Vegas, thinking that maybe there had been some miscommunication and we would be able to adopt the kitten that we really loved and that seemed to love us too...not the case.  I answered the questions asked about the household pets truthfully and as soon as Marie made the connection that I was Nicole's boyfriend she was immediately attacking with a vengeance!  Nicole had let the manager at PetSmart know how Marie had treated her yesterday.  Needless to say, Marie immediately started ranting about how awful Nicole was and how Nicole was extremely adamant about getting this kitten declawed (with Marie not knowing that I had been standing next to Nicole during this phone conversation yesterday and that Nicole not once mentioned trying to get this kitten declawed whatsoever).  Also, she stated that Nicole wouldn't pay attention to anything Marie was saying...quite the opposite!  Aside from a few responses Nicole made in regards to information Marie had asked, it was nearly 10 minutes of Marie ranting about how declawing cats is illegal and how abusive it was, etc.  Not to mention as Nicole stated, Marie has two cats that she has had declawed as well.  Needless to say, I confirmed that having cats declawed was NOT illegal (even though we hadn't planned on it) and that Marie was just seemingly upset that she had a complaint filed against her for her awful behavior against a PetSmart customer.  She is lucky that I didn't complain as well as that would have been TWO complaints filed within 24 hours. We would have really loved to adopt that lovely kitten.  Don't adopt from this lady.  She's shady and rude.

Family Promise Of Reno-Sparks, Inc.	23854	1	/users/profile/24993	DreamwalkerJB	Former staff	5	12/11/2009	In addition to being former staff, I was also a volunteer, both before and after my service as staff, both within my own faith community and at other congregations of various faiths and at the day center directly.  This organization not only provides shelter and meals, it assists families dealing with homelessness to obtain and maintain permanent housing.  Since opening its doors on June 24, 2001, Family Promise of Reno/Sparks (formerly Interfaith Hospitality Network of the Truckee Meadows) has been all about community.  It welcomes homeless families as members of the community at large, it depends on volunteers from various faith communities, and it cooperates with other community organizations to avoid duplicating efforts and to provide the most comprehensive service possible to the families it serves.Family Promise brought together Temple Sinai (a reform Jewish congregation) and members of Northern Nevada's Islamic community to provide shelter and meals for the homeless families during Christmas time when the Christian churches are so busy.Unlike many faith-based programs, the guests (homeless families) are not proselytized, but rather empowered to develop their own plan for obtaining and maintaining both gainful employment and a stable living situation through the cooperation of people and organizations throughout the greater Reno/Sparks community.I know of no organization any more integrated into the community or more deserving of community support.Although I moved away from the area in April of 2008, I still keep in touch with some of the former guest families, many former board members and staff, and several still current volunteers.  When I visit the area next week, dropping by the Family Promise day center is on my list of things to do.

Empowerment Center	61998	1	/users/profile/67758	BenC	Volunteer	5	01/31/2011	I came to the Launching Pad from prison, with no where else to go. The staff at the Launching Pad made me feel welcome and excepted me for who I was and not for what I had done. They made me feel like a regular person who had a purpose in life and helped me in every thing that they could. Because of the Launching Pad I have been able to clean and sober, have been able to help others in thier recovery, have been able to find full time employment, and been able to make contact with my family and build a relationship with them. I am a firm believer in the Launching Pad and in it's mission. I am supporting the Launching Pad in volunteering my time in any way that I  am able. The staff, volunteers, residents of the Launching Pad have made a me feel like a new person who has a purpose in life and has given me a positive direction to go in. To all of them all I can say is Thank You and may God Bless them all.

Nevada Policy Research Institute	237256	1	/users/profile/319105	littleduck	General Member of the Public	1	01/24/2015	No, I don't think so. They need to do some restructuring and careful research within its own organization. 
Nevada Policy Research Institute	118173	1	/users/profile/160730	cbarishman	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/12/2012	This institute seems to send out spam and biased emails out to educators.  In particular an email was sent out telling us how much we can save by not joining our Union/Association.  This reflects biased and predatory research for the purpose of proving an opinion not fact.  This same email was has been sent out at least every week for the past month.  An educated person has to ask 'If this was just research, why would I continually be receiving the same email?'

Grant A Gift Autism Foundation	168605	1	/users/profile/223541	dwebber8600	Board Member	5	09/09/2013	I joined  the Board in January 2012, after volunteering for the annual walk.  Immediately it became evident how dedicated the Founder/Board Members/volunteers were, and the tremendous job the Foundation was doing in providing families with services that were not available in the community until the Foundation was established.  It is an honor to be associated with such a wonderful Foundation and to know we are reaching so many local families.

Temple Beth Or Reno	107382	1	/users/profile/145405	Rivka I.	General Member of the Public	4	03/01/2012	Rabbi Beyer encourages her congregation to learn and thus to practice Judaism in their lives as a product of their learning.  Thus from learning comes observance with kavanah.  She is also doing a great job of pulling the great Reno-Tahoe area together as one greater Jewish community rather than being members of diverse congregations.
Temple Beth Or Reno	98695	1	/users/profile/117252	Barbara M	Volunteer	5	09/30/2011	I have been affiliated with TBOR for about a year. This is a wonderful, warm, welcoming group with a lot to offer. Rosh Hashonah services were interesting, musical, and inspiring.

INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM GAMBLING CENTER	237270	1	/users/profile/319105	littleduck	Client Served	1	01/24/2015	I went to one meeting, then never returned. I heard the program is effective. However, when I was there, The psychologist, Dr. Robert Hunter cursed in front of all of us. He was lecturing to the group and he cursed. He said the F word and the SH word. I just found his manners very insulting so I never returned.  Psychology books teach us that people who curse in front of others means that they don't respect that person. He looks down at the people he is suppose to be treating. He disrespects the gamblers he treats. 
INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM GAMBLING CENTER	113715		/users/profile/154722	bchen21	General Member of the Public	4	06/04/2012	This is a really great organization that helps families struggling with gambling problems.

Tahoe-Pyramid Bikeway Inc	160189		/users/profile/6495	Tahoe Pyramid Bikeway	Board Member	5	06/10/2013	The Tahoe-Pyramid Bikeway is a long-term vision of following the Truckee River from its beginning at Tahoe City, California to its end at Pyramid Lake, Nevada.  After 10 years in operation, the 116-mile distance is open for 65% of its length.  The June 2013 opening of Fleish Bridge was a major step, demonstrating (again) the Bikeway's ability to collaborate with landowners, in this case the utility.
Tahoe-Pyramid Bikeway Inc	154821		/users/profile/205683	Chris Askin	Volunteer	5	04/15/2013	The Bikeway is a terrific vision, is well run by 100% volunteers, has already made a big impact on health, the environment, our local history, and access to beautiful landscapes, and accessed millions of dollars in its cause for a tiny cost.  A truly amazing group of people run this great project.

HORSES 4 HEROES INC	206870	2	/users/profile/269357	Cynthia72	General Member of the Public	5	07/21/2014	I do not know very many organizations that put out as much for families as Horses 4 Heroes. They are always giving, giving and more giving!!! The community events they put on are spectacular and full of fun for families. Good old fashion family fun. Filled with games, rides and free giveaways. Their mission is to help heal those broken and hurting through the amazing gift of these incredible horses. It amazes me how the leader of this organization has put so many countless hours and money to the families of Las Vegas. I am more than impressed by Syd's dedication to the community and her mission to serve. Thank you so much for all you have done to persevere through what you have endured to make this such a huge success.

Inter Faith Ministry	287009		/users/profile/377081	Carolyn_K	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Of all the deprivations of being homeless, the worst was believing I had nothing to give.A few years ago I found myself homeless. There was no good excuse for it. I had an excellent upbringing, I have a college degree, I had had a career in public relations, but then several things happened at once - I quit working, my mother died, I let my clinical depression go unchecked and  untreated and simply lost all my savings, then my home, then my belongings. The only thing I had left was my pride, which isolated me from my friends and family and prevented me from getting the help I needed.Oddly enough, it wasn't the possessions or the stability I missed most - it was the fact that I didn't feel like I was contributing. I wasn't using my talents, and I wasn't donating to things which had always been important to me. I wasn't even volunteering.I finally got help, entered a shelter run by Inter-Faith Ministries, started taking an anti-depressant, reached out to people and began the long journey back to a productive, happy life. The staff at Inter-Faith Ministries might have saved my life. They provided support and friendship when I was still unwilling to involve my friends and family in my 'shame.' They then gave me a job - I started working in one of the homeless shelters as a house manager, something I still do one day a week in spite of the fact that I now work full time as Marketing Coordinator for the organization. While the marketing gig is exciting and certainly in line with my talents and education, I enjoy working with the residents in the shelter too much to stop. I also like to think that my story can help some of them get over the despair and shame of homelessness and regain their lives.One of my proudest moments was when I was financially able to begin contributing financially again. My first step was to reinstate my monthly pledge with the local public radio station. That came before I even bought a bed because giving to and supporting others was more important to me in my road back to a 'normal' life than getting my mattress off the floor!I still don't advertise the fact that I have been homeless. I recently gave a talk to a group that included a couple people who had known me 25 years ago when I worked at the symphony. While it was great to catch up with them - and while it was great to hear them both say they really missed me and were so glad to know I was working with Inter-Faith - I didn't announce that it was because they had housed me for a year while I become whole again. There will always be some shame that I allowed this to happen to myself.Inter-Faith Ministries, while it focuses on services for homeless and low-income people (three shelters, 104 low-income apartments, lunch program, holiday food/coat/toy distribution) also, as its name implies, brings together different faith groups. The organization has been around for 130 years and has always strived to celebrate both the diversity and the similarities of various religions. I like that in one day I can work and talk with Catholics, Hindus, evangelical Christians, Muslims and agnostics. We do it on a shoestring budget. We have a wish list a mile long - improvements to our shelters, which all suffer from inadequate kitchens, plumbing and broken beds. We want to start a produce garden to use for meal preparation and to give our residents the opportunity to help and perhaps learn a marketable skill. We want to reinstate an inter-religious study series. The main thing, however, is we want...need... to continue to shelter those most in need and save lives. Just like IFM saved mine.

Association Of State And Territorial Dental Directors	238621		/users/profile/323976	Concerned12	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/27/2015	This organization of aging cronies lacks both transparency and accountability.  Its internal processes and overlapping committee responsibilities lack transparency. Its original non-profit charter in New Bern NC, Executive Director in Sparks or Reno Nevada, and former Executive Director funded in Texas ensures that it is difficult, if not impossible, to track funding and allocation of personnel and resources.   Use of Federal funds for lobbying purposes cannot be ruled out.  The funding stream for the opening of an ASTDD-DC virtual office cannot be determined, headed by a former ASTDD president in Maryland with a dual role of policy committee lead.  A call for auditing of its travel budgets is needed. This includes supported travel from a remote New Mexico town to Bethesda during 2012-2015- as a screen for meetings in DC with registered dental organization lobbyists and Congressional staff.

Faith Farm	304802		/users/profile/395986	Carol237	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/15/2016	I am currently an employee of Faith Farm Ministries in Boynton Beach and love serving our God through our students in recovery as well as the community.  But I also have a history with FFM going back 15 years or more with my daughter.  Before I even knew about Faith Farm's Free 9 month Drug & Alcohol Recovery Program, like many, I only knew about the thrift store, and the free pick up of donated items of all kinds.  God's glory has truly blessed Faith Farm in so many ways.  As a single mother supporting a young child on my modest income at that time, it was the only place I could take my daughter shopping and allow her to load up the cart.  It was so refreshing to not have to tell her "No you can't have that, or you have to choose because you can only have this".  So we both have very fond memories of Faith Farm and our parent-child bonding.  And now that I know my patronage was/am transforming the lives of other's who were shackled to the bondage of addiction, and now are free, I feel God's goodness even more.  I love being part of an organization that has so many success stories happening every single day.  I too have been affected by drug and alcohol addiction personally and with relationships and know the destructive cost to the users and everyone around them.  Since it's inception in 1951 when Rev. Garland "Pappy" Eastham founded Faith Farm, not only have addicts been given an opportunity of recovery into a sober life, but are taught job skills with the Work Program as well as faith Based curriculum to allow our students to live a drug and alcohol free life with the guidance and love of Father God.I am thankful to our Lord in so many ways, and I praise God's blessings in the positive changes in the lives of people everyday at Faith Farm Ministries.

I thought it would be a noble sacrifice of my time. It's no sacrifice, it's a true pleasure. It's 45 minutes, one day a week. The joy I get seeing these great seniors, chatting with them, bringing them a hot meal--it can't be matched. The folks at SCBC always thank me, as do the seniors on my route.  You are actually making a difference in someone's life. It is the ultimate cure for all the cynicism a person encounters in their everyday. I look at it this way. I can't do a thing about so many rotten events going on around the planet. No world leader is seeking my input. But I can do a good thing here in my town. In that way, I am making the world a better place, a little bit at a time. All I can say to the seniors and SCBC is "thank you!"

I adopted an adorable little quaker.  She would have come to me with a cage but I didn't need one.  She had received a complete physical and blood work before I adopted her.  They gave me food and answered all my questions about her care.  I even called a few times afterwards to ask additional questions.  They followed up to make sure there were no problems and offered any support I might need.  If someone out there is looking to add a bird to their family, big or small (the bird)...

Reno Monthly Meeting Of The Religious Society Of Friends	182644		/users/profile/239514	RSloan	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	The Alternatives to Violence Project (AVP) came into my life 10 years ago, and has increased in priority in my life since then.  This outstanding program impacts prison inmates and outside volunteers in amazing ways, and I personally can testify to my own increased awareness of how we all -- myself included-- contribute to the world's violence in many subtle ways (e.g. language, attitude, dismissive behavior).  AVP consists of 3-day workshops primarily in prisons and youth facilities.  The workshops are called "experiential," and often we hear, "When I came in here the first day, I did not think I could get through a 3-day workshop; now that it is coming to a close, I don't want it to end."  The program originated in Greenhaven Prison in New York, a project of inmates and the local Quakers, in the 1970s.  Today, the program is in over 40 states and over 40 countries. Testimonies abound.  Some of the comments we have heard more than once include: "Thank you for making me feel human again."  "This program really made me think! ('I like that!' or 'I'm not sure I like that!')."  "I never knew people who were so good!"  "I have a long way to go to forgive (myself and others)."  "I have never shared so personally with others; in here, it was easy!"  "I don't want to live my life with hate anymore." We are AVP Nevada.  Each local group is responsible for its own funding, and all who participate and facilitate are volunteers.  In Reno, the small congregation of the Reno Friends Meeting has been funding us, but as we continue to grow (waiting lists for workshops in all those prisons where we work), we realize that the local Friends (Quakers) cannot keep up with our expenses such as motel accommodations for the prisons located at far distances.  Many of us do not ask for reimbursements for all our expenses, but again, as we grow, it becomes more expensive.  This year, we did a record number of workshops, and we have decided we need to supplement the Friends' allotted budget for AVP. We often say in AVP, "Trust the process!"  Truly, there is something magical about the combination of exercises (whole large group of 20-25 persons, small group tasks and discussions, one-to-one tasks and discussions), which include deep and serious moments and also a great deal of fun and laughter.  I always come away from a workshop feeling hopeful for this broken world.  Individuals can and do change; I have witnessed this is myself and in others.
Goodwill Industries Of Southern Nevada Inc	237261	10	/users/profile/319105	littleduck	General Member of the Public	1	01/24/2015	Corrupt non-profit.  While shopping in one of the local las vegas thrift stores, I watched a homeless man try and buy a jacket in the middle of winter time. He tried to pay with coins that he begged off people. He was $1.00 short for the $4.00 jacket, and the cashier/ manager would not give him the jacket. She let him walk back outside in the freezing cold with no jacket. This is a bad non-profit.

I have birds from a rescue site and they are like a family member now. The Hyacinth is an endangered bird and  here in the U.S. people just do not understand what is hapening to many species of animals. It is very hard to do rescue of animals, but birds require much more than animals such as dogs and cats. I personaly had 13 birds at one time and it is very expensive and time consuming. We had 30 birds come up for adoption in one month but had no room to keep them. 
Soldiers And Families First	187558	1	/users/profile/244579	Loumisgm	Donor	5	11/02/2013	Soldiers and Families First was started by two retired Nevada National Guard Families soon after our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In those days, the State was not doing very much to help the Soldiers and Airman who were deploying - particularly the families that had problems with rent and the reduced income that Guard troops experience when called to active duty.  They also sponsored children of Guard troops to attend Summer Camp.   I am a retired Army CSM and first heard about this small charity from Sergeant Major of the Army (Ret)(Deceased) George W. Dunaway.   I worked with him trying to raise community awareness of the good works of this no overhead organization.  They now obtain and furnish bicycles, diapers, donated items such as furniture and appliances to those active duty and veteran populations locally.    They have recently started a limited food pantry.  The best part of this small charity is that the military service member does not have to go through the embarrassment of the paperwork drills required in official channels.  They have helped many in uniform though their efforts.

St Judes Ranch For Children-Nevada Region Inc	193652	1	/users/profile/252929	Maat14	Client Served	1	02/01/2014	A staff member of this organization hasnt been there for me since I was moved to St Judes Ranch after being ripped away from the arms of a mother who loved me, and torn apart from my younger siblings who needed me.the state of Nevada decided my family didn't deserve to be a family for whatever reason. My family was broken apart and scattered and blown away in the wind all in different directions and for me personally, blown into the direction of St Jude's Ranch, where I have been subjected to the care and custody of a 'house parent' who doesn't care if i eat, and won't even take the time to buy the groceries she is required to provide with the money given to the organization to feed me. Its to the point to where I often go to bed hungry. How can this so called 'houseparent' not provide the food paid for by donors and taxpayer dollars? This organization profits over 2 million dollars a year, but ask this organization how it utilizes their two million dollar profit to help the children they claim to care about? What bicycles toys phones computers or games have they bought us with their two million dollar profit? everyday, I see daily, St Judes staff members getting paid take care of children they themselves neglect.  We 'clients' have all been taken away from our families because supposedly our families weren't fit to take care of us, and we have been imprisoned in an environment where not only are we neglected, but we are mentally abused, manipulated and not even fed. Our medical needs are neglected and for my opinion, staff members get paid for nothing. There is no accountability for their actions or inactions. We are actually threatened when donors and visitors come by to observe us like animals in cages. We are forced to act  happy and pretend were cared about by the staff members fails to protect our interest in th schools we attend in the community, they fail to protect our interest and fail to abide by what is in the best interest of the child which is according to the law of the land, the reason why we were ripped away from our family and real homes through child protection services that don't even protect children from institutions like St Jude's.

This club provides NOTHING ,but charges $ 1050.00 per team with no late fees,yet they only pay the Referees $26.00 for the center,and linesmen $15.00. They pay for NO Water,NO Food of any kind for the Referees.#2 The lawbreaking recurrence of NOT PROVIDING WATER FOR THE WORKING PEOPLE that run in officiating the matches.Coaches beware your parents HARD EARNED MONEY is paying for other personal items for the people running this club. The  money  is NOT being spent on paying for expenses for the Referees. No Referees no matches,no fun for anyone.
A Second Chance For W I N G S	288945		/users/profile/379150	rubenm	Volunteer	5	05/06/2016	We are a Nevada nonprofit organization committed to helping homeless women and homeless women with children throughout Clark County, Nevada.  We became officially incorporated in March 2004.A Second Chance for W.I.N.G.S. believes we all can fly. Sometimes we need assistance to fly away from those things that causes us stress and despair.  We enjoy having the opportunity to provide individuals with the tools to obtain wings or repair those that have been broken by life's challenges.  We realize with the proper training, assistance, encouragement and support - all people can fly.  Though we all fly in different directions and with different missions, A Second Chance for W.I.N.G.S. desires to offer a positive direction through hope.  As individuals walk through the doors of A Second Chance for W.I.N.G.S. the healing and growth process will begin. We offer positive reinforcement and tools for success.  We are aware that our State programs are helping homelessness rebuild their lives by giving them a second chance back into our society.  With our dedication for the past 11 years we have waited patiently for this opportunity to apply for Federal funding; to support homeless women and homeless women with children.  After researching, A Second Chance for W.I.N.G.S. (Wellness-Independence-Goals-Success) will be the first and only facility in Clark County to provide all supportive resources under one roof.  We aim to help decrease the unemployment rate by providing job opportunities to our clients and unemployed individuals in Clark County.

Nevada Disability Advocacy And Law Center Inc	240301		/users/profile/326410	NVAdvocate	General Member of the Public	1	03/31/2015	Received a right to sue letter for sexual harassment against this agency after being fired for filing a witness report for two co-workers. It receives lots of federal dollars intended to improve the lives of people with disabilities, but they have no visible online 990 results nor are they a member-based organization that is transparent in their operations. I did not sue, because it is THE protection and advocacy agency for the state of Nevada, but it does very little legal work, mostly just social work. 
Pet Network Humane Society	212057		/users/profile/275004	TahoeBev	Board Member	5	08/23/2014	I retired and moved to Incline Village 13 years ago.  When I walked into Pet Network the first time, I knew I had found a place I could make a valuable contribution.  In our small village, Pet Network manages to find homes for about 600 pets  each year.  There are many amazing dogs and cats who transition through the shelter.  Some find new homes quickly; others are cared for in the shelter for months and occasionally years before finding their new homes.  No animal runs out of time.  We never give up on a pet.Pet Network receives no government funding.  Each year we must raise enough money to cover expenses.  We appreciate all cash donations, large or small.  We hold an annual Fur Ball and other fundraising events.  And we provide boarding and day care services, sell pet supplies, and provide onsite veterinary services through Quail Ridge Animal Hospital.  Visit the shelter, consider volunteering or adopting.
Ron Wood Family Resource Center	58751	1	/users/profile/62805	DuskHwy	Volunteer	5	12/13/2010	I collaborated with the Ron Wood Family Resource Center at their offices to offer two summer classes for teens on transitioning into adulthood.  My co-teachers (one from Ron Wood; one from a State agency) presented the material in a way that intrigued the youth.  They made sure our students knew about several other resources available through the community.  They made the class a safe, fun, engaging place to learn about the rights and responsibilities that come with adulthood.  (The Ron Wood Center also provided refreshments, which was just plain awesome!) The Ron Wood Family Resource Center offers many other services.  I've seen schedules for other classes (nutrition, breast-feeding, early childhood development, etc.); I've seen families get groceries; I've seen teens get help applying for college admissions, financial aid, and internships.

Rural Center For Independent Living Inc	58748		/users/profile/62805	DuskHwy	Client Served	5	12/13/2010	When I first came to Carson, staff members at the Rural Center for Independent Living (RCIL) and Do Drop In Center helped me to find housing.  Dee Dee, the director, went with me to tour apartments.  I immediately found one that suited my needs, and she helped me to convince a landlady that, though I don't make much money, I would still be an upstanding tenant.  I got the place!  I'm very happy with the assistance from Do Drop In/RCIL - I was treated with respect and dignity and given optimism.  I get the impression that Dee Dee and the other staff and volunteers sincerely care about their clients. My line of work is related to the work done at RCIL/Do Drop In, so I've visited several times since then.  Over the past two years, Dee Dee and others at the RCIL/Do Drop In have trained me as an advocate and introduced me to other agencies and advocates in the community.   I'd like to add that clients have access to a clean, fully stocked galley and a comfortable living room while they wait for expert housing and advocacy services.  It's a safe, clean, peaceful place to get warm in the winter or cool off in the summer.  Services are available to people who are in need of housing and to individuals with disabilities.  As far as the disability scene goes, it's remarkable how this Center for Independent Living is so inclusive; anyone with any disability is equally eligible for services.  At the RCIL/Do Drop In, people with and without disabilities are treated the same.  If you choose to disclose your disability, you'll still be treated as a unique individual (they don't stereotype people by diagnosis).

100 Black Men Of Las Vegas Inc	277289		/users/profile/367083	akw4116	Board Member	4	01/20/2016	The 100 Black Men of Las Vegas, Inc. is a membership organization whose mission is to mentor young minority boys who are in the 3rd-12th grade in school.  The organization was founded in 2000 by Larry Mosely because of the concern that to many minority boys were being sent to special education because of behavior problems. We mentor in three schools, Joe Mackey, Wendell P. Williams and the Imagine 100 Academy of Excellence., a charter school started by the 100 Black Men of Las Vegas.  We get our support through membership dues, the United Way, Combined Federal Campaign, and corporate support from Cox, MGM, Harrah, and State Farm. Our goal is to change the behavior of minority youth to reduce behavior problems, improve attendance, get better grades, and succeed in school and the community.
Sandy-Mesquite Valley Educational Foundation	161042		/users/profile/213524	Mister Roberts	Board Member	1	06/19/2013	I volunteered for  this organization in 2011 & 2012 in Sandy Valley. After a great deal of monetary donation, material  donations and labor, I came to realize that the foundation was simply a fundraising ploy for personal projects and the donations were poorly recorded. Additionally, many projects and improvements were made against the wishes of the valley residents. One particular insult is that the membership is comprised of anyone who attends the meetings. Subsequently, anytime money is asked for or a project proposed, the word is put out to those in favor so that they would gather their friends for that meeting, guaranteeing the vote be  passed.  Since the foundation is run by the local Justice of the Peace the actions and decisions of the board are predetermined and do not represent the community. Nor are they ever questioned for fear of reprisal.
Step I Inc	99858		/users/profile/121216	Marina Pelz	Client Served	5	10/27/2011	I started my recovery by coming to meetings at Step 1. This was in 1995. I had never been free from drugs and alcohol before and had been in alot of trouble. There was a little old Italian man by the name of Eli Maritano who was kind and who told me "we treat everyone like they are the one who is going to make it". And he did. Every single person. I went to lots of meetings, got a job, and learned how to become responsible. Even when I moved into my own place I was still came back to Step 1 to talk to the new residents and have dinner. I was always made to feel welcome there. I am still clean today, 2011, and go visit Step 1 whenever I am in Nevada. Being in recovery has allowed me to live my dreams and become a productive member of society. I will always be grateful to the men at Step 1 for giving me a second chance at life.
Quilts 4 Cancer	125905		/users/profile/171054	VA Quilts	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	 Quilts 4 Cancer has been providing beautiful, warm quilts for the patients at Nathan Adelson Hospice in Pahrump for over 9 years. With the dedicated assistance provided by 50 to 60 volunteers Quilts 4 Cancer leader, Barb Johnston has shared her passion of quilting in order to provide warmth and comfort to the most fragile in our community.   Nathan Adelson Hospice has received and distributed several hundred quilts over the years. Delivered by a member of the field staff, either a nurse, certified nursing assistant, social worker, spiritual caregiver or volunteer, the quilts make a lovely ice breaker when going in for a visit with a terminally ill patient. As one social worker tells us, I had a very difficult first visit with one family and really wanted to find a special way to get a little closer, the quilts had just been dropped off. I looked for one that I thought my patient would enjoy and brought it with me on my next visit. She continues, This time smiles greeted me when I presented this beautifully crafted quilt and laid it on the lap of the patient I explained about Quilts 4 Cancer and the ladies that create these beautiful quilts for no other reason than the love of doing for others.  It was a beautiful experience for my patient and for me and one I now experience over and over again. The experiences of each of the field staff after they have presented the gift of a quilt to a patient have been equally touching and meaningful and it gains even more meaning after the loved one has passed, because now the family has this lovely quilt to remind them of someone they held dear and the work done by volunteers to help make their days a little more tolerable.  Quilts 4 Cancer also was the first quilt charity to provide quilts for the New VA Hospital in N Las Vegas, NV. A quilt for every bed, plus extra were provided.    Homeless and nursing homes   also receive quilts.     Comfort quilts warms the mind body and soul of the recipient,  made by volunteers with great big warm hearts !

U S Missionary Corps Inc	163127		/users/profile/216559	Nila A.	Donor	1	07/20/2013	Dateline NBC has investigated this Charity and has discovered that their business is nothing but a fraud that has the Public believing that they are collecting monies to help the homeless. They do hire the homeless, but do not pay a living wage. They only get a percentage of what they collect. In return for collecting money. They are giving room and board. But if has come to light that  The city of Las Vegas Zoning commission has since shut the home that the homeless volunteers were residing at. Because of too many people living there. Us missionary does have a license to collect funds. But you should know that it is not going to help any of the homeless with programs to help improve their situations. And the majority of the money is going into the pocket of Carole Dye. Beware of this Charity and do not give them a dime. Do your research before you give to a charity to make sure that they are legitimate. And you will not find any information on US Missionary Corps  I did a online search there is nothing .
Nevada Legal Services Inc	237248	3	/users/profile/319105	littleduck	Client Served	1	01/24/2015	I've been unemployed for 4 years. I asked Nevada legal services for help with an unemployment hearing. Staff attorney Dawn Miller was the attorney assigned to my case. She never showed up for my unemployment hearing, causing me to lose the case.   Attorney David Olsham the managing attorney, could care less. David Olsham told me on the phone that he's going to put false information in my file.  Nevada Legal Services is a fraud non-profit. They don't care about indigent people. They are suppose to help indigent people with unemployment claims, but they could care less. I guess they don't know what it's like to have hunger pains and no job.

It failed to file the 990 IRS form for years 2007, 2008, and 2009 until late 2010.  Money is mismanaged and restricted funds are not used propoerly.

Then someone sees what a wonderful pet they are and chooses to adopt your foster. Mine went to a loving home in another state. They were transported by wonderful volunteers who cared for them just like I would. The dogs got to their forever home and are with a happy new family. This organization cares for and rescues dogs, vets them and makes them part of very loving families. This is a rewarding volunteer effort because of the beautiful success stories each and every dog that touches your life.

Josh Farler Helping Hands Foundation	253396		/users/profile/341579	CharmaineC	Volunteer	5	08/19/2015	Josh was born July 27, 1985 and lived in Bakersfield California until his parents moved to Yerington Nevada. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer in July, 2004 at the age of 19. He had surgery but it had spread so rapidly through-out his body and he had to have several rounds of Chemo. He travelled from Yerington to the cancer hospital at University of California, Los Angeles for each treatment. His parents were with him the whole time and had to pay for travel, housing, and food out of their own pocket. Josh was in a catch 22 situation. He had enrolled in college and moved into the dorm but had not attended any classes as school had not started, when he was diagnosed. He went home to have the first surgery, then to Los Angeles for a second along with all of the Chemo treatments. His insurance would not pay for any of his medical bills because he was not in school! His parents eventually obtained a private, very expensive, insurance which covered some of the costs but still left them with a tremendous financial burden. This is the situation that a lot of people find themselves in when loved ones are hospitalized for treatment. It can get very expensive to live in motels and eat out for long periods of time. Most of the time family members stayed in the room with Josh, which can be exhausting. He and his family made this trip numerous times in the following year and a half. To help offset the costs, Josh Farler Foundation of Bakersfield, Ca organized the first benefit poker tournament for Josh. They were very successful and raised close to $13,000. Josh was very positive and patient during his illness. He loved to play poker and we would have games when he came though Bakersfield to rest at his grandmothers home and visit with his family here for a few days before making the trip home to Nevada. Then the cycle would start all over again. Josh lost his long and hard fought battle with cancer on December 26th, 2005. We will forever miss him. Our goal now is to help other young people near his hometown, with travel and lodging expenses while seeking treatment. We have applications for anyone you think can use this help, maybe someone in your family or your church or school. Perhaps your child has a schoolmate undergoing cancer treatments and has mentioned it to you? If so, please let us know. We do this in memory of Josh Farler whom we all loved and miss!

They are all after my 90 year old father, they work on him and use his patriotism to get him to give them money. They prey on him, they are nothing but vultures. He is confused and senile and they take advantage of that also.. Once, they received a $460 donation from him , then turned around a few weeks later and asked him for another donation and would he increase it. Are you kidding me? That is when my brother and I got involved.

Jodi's Voice	54656		/users/profile/56315	Teresa C.	Volunteer	5	10/09/2010	Jodi's story changed my life forever. I have been the victim of a stalker for the past 8 years (and counting) and Jodi's Voice has enabled me to finally turn such a horrible, life-altering experience into positive change. I identified with Jodi and her ordeal...I saw myself in her when I realized my stalking situation wasn't all that different from hers. Our stalkers exhibited several of the same behaviors, we had absolutely no relationships, romantic or otherwise, with our stalkers, and we had both been stalked on and off for many years. I realized just how easily what happened to beautiful Jodi could happen to me and other victims of stalking. And knowing how she was tortured, brutalized and viciously murdered broke my heart...how could I NOT get involved?? Through Jodi's Voice, Jodi is healing me. She is saving me. I am eternally indebted to her for giving me the strength and courage to speak out and take control of my life back. Her beautiful smile is going to change the world :)

Open Door Ministries	286950		/users/profile/377022	Amanda_A2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Cover the City Project benefits Open Door Ministries of High Point and expands to help the homeless in our community. In November of 2014, I knew the need was going to be great for ODM this winter, with over 100 men in their homeless shelter programs; they were running low on everything from blankets to soap. I created the Cover the City Project to support Open Door in collecting blankets for the homeless in our area. This is an all-volunteer and donation based project. With only 2 weeks to get together items and participants, we thought that we would only get around 200 blankets; little did we know God had other plans for us. For our first blanket drive the city of High Point had over 15 drop off locations, 4 private businesses donating, and 6 giveaway donors, we ended up collecting over 800 blankets last year and helped more than just Open Door. We helped four other non-profit organizations last year as well and were able to serve over 700 people who needed something to keep warm during the winter months. During my lifetime, I have been very blessed to have positive role models to show me that you should always help others and do good for those in need. Being able to give back to the community in which I have grown up in is very important to me and my family. This blanket could be just what someone needs to be comforted. I have volunteered at Open Door Ministries for several years and this project was something that I created because I knew there was a need and without the help of volunteers and donors, it may not happen. We decided last year that this would be an annual project to help Open Door and anyone else who just happened to be down on their luck. For the 2015 blanket drive we have expanded to Greensboro, Winston Salem and Asheboro, North Carolina and also to Spartanburg, South Carolina in order to reach more of the people in need. Giving back is something that I enjoy and if I could do it full time life would be amazing but God has other plans for me so I will continue to do this as long as possible, but only with the help of like-minded people and the trust that Open Door gives me to be able to do a project like this. Attached are the recent news articles about my project to help give you a better idea of what we do and how we do it. http://www.odm-hp.org/http://www.wfmynews2.com/story/life/2015/10/25/cover-city-blanket-drive-expands-keep-more-cities-warm-winter/74580510/http://www.hpenews.com/blanket-drive-doubles-goal-for-second-year/article_9d47a85a-7d90-11e5-88d8-efc8ec985103.html

The perform home visits to ensure safety and keep tabs on the dogs throughout their life to check in and offer support. They have the most caring and loving volunteers.

Nevada Partners Inc	237268		/users/profile/319105	littleduck	General Member of the Public	1	01/24/2015	Nevada partners discriminates against skin color. They give preferred to treatment to blacks, and tell all the white people that they are out of training money. I've been unemployed for 4 years. I went through their orientation and other courses required to receive job training. I was told to go to the back trailers to discuss job training. The employees were all black. They looked at me like I was some white blonde alien from outer space that walked into their office. I was actually told by the black male employee that mostly he trains blacks only. He told me doesn't have any training money left. His manager who was also black was sitting across aisle and stared me down. Nevada Partners are a bunch of racist. They only train blacks.
