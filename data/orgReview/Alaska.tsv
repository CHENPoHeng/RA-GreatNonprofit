Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	243573	3	/users/profile/330349	PleaseVaccinate	General Member of the Public	1	05/26/2015	This is an awful not for profit. Please do not give money to this group! You would be far better donating money to immunology research so that vaccinations can be improved. This website is unscientific and makes false claims that it is providing fair and balanced information when it is clearly picking and choosing information that suits it agenda. Please stop spreading such dangerous lies. Vaccinations are important, and have done a lot for the health of humanity in general. The worst non profit group I have ever come across!

During that entire time, there has never been a more comprehensive site covering vaccine news stories of the day than this one. It makes my work go so much more efficiently.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	216078		/users/profile/101932	CStolten	Board Member	5	09/20/2014	I have known Sandy Gottstein for 14 years. She has dedicated many years speaking out for the vaccine injured, helping many along the way with her time, talent, and  treasure. Vaccination News has helped millions of people become informed on the both sides of the vaccine issue. She has battled for our rights, and our children's rights. Thank you Sandy for all of the long hours of work you have put into the vaccine issue, and for the wonderful resource Vaccination News. You truly are among those who paved the path from the beginning. 
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89609		/users/profile/101932	CStolten	Board Member	5	06/04/2011	I first became aware of the vaccination issue when both my sons had adverse events from vaccines. I decided to do some research, and was fortunate enough to meet Sandy Gottstein President of VN. The information on the website is all-encompassing, which enables readers to see both the pros and cons of the issue. The news which is posted daily on the website keeps you up to date on all the breaking news on the subject. Much of the news articles posted will not be easily accessible through mainstream media. Vaccination News helps countless numbers of people from around the world understand this issue. It has helped parents, journalists and medical professionals find the information they need to help their children, write books and journal articles. The archives are extensive and include articles that can no longer be found elsewhere. 
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	216054		/users/profile/279497	Cynthia76	General Member of the Public	5	09/20/2014	Sandy's blog is great: her information about vaccines is detailed and accurate, and has helped me learn the facts on many occasions, which I'm then able to use in my comments on the Web. I'm grateful to her for having done so much work to serve the public interest. 
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215949		/users/profile/101935	Rita	Board Member	5	09/19/2014	Vaccination News is a very valuable resource -  an archive and library of all news and views of the vaccination debate for well over a decade.   The website is unique in that worldwide news from all sides of the debate are presented.   President Sandy Gottstein's timeless, fully referenced and highly regarded columns are also housed on the Vaccination News website, as well as numerous other columns by medical professionals and others.   No matter what the hot news of the day is, be it the recent CDC Whistleblower revelations or some other hot vaccine story, visiting the Vaccination News site daily allows me to see pertinent news reports and blog posts in one place.   Invaluable!   
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89612		/users/profile/101935	Rita	Board Member	5	06/04/2011	Vaccination has been called the "Issue of Our Times" by Mothering Magazine Editor Peggy O'Mara.  The reason I value Vaccination News is that you can view/read/search for all viewpoints on the vaccine issue.  Unlike any other website, Vaccination News provides a daily snapshot of vaccine news and views going back to 2002 on a searchable database.  Founder Sandy Gottsteins and her contributor's columns are well researched, referenced, timeless investigations of vaccine issues.  Vaccination News is an incredible history, archive, and a great asset to parents and the public.
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215907		/users/profile/102182	David P.	General Member of the Public	4	09/19/2014	Sandy is really committed to the cause.  It is strange how such dedication only seems possible outside the world of politics.  Yet, politicians have a 50% chance of becoming a millionaire through their commitments... although it is always difficult to know what those commitments really are and we never seem to reach a conclusion.  Today we seem to have an even greater disconnect between We the People and those elected to Represent us. Vaccination is a notable example. 
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89740		/users/profile/102182	David P.	General Member of the Public	4	06/07/2011	I would like to commend Sandy Gottstein for sticking to her guns in spite of the personal costs, both in time and money, that is required. After all, the Big Guns won't sponsor information that reduces their market. Her supporters are mostly wise after the event and struggling with a child that has been harmed, ostensibly by vaccines but they are usually told that the cause must lie elsewhere (and the related medical costs not to mention social and psychological burdens). This limits the time and donations they are able to donate. Indeed, why aren't government health agencies and politicians carrying this fight? That is their sworn duty and elected purpose. Cynically, grants and contributions mean more to them.Hopefully, being voted out of office will prove the greater evil than forsaking some grants and contributions. Above all, women voters never forget and impaired children can never vote.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215836	1	/users/profile/279289	Cwaters	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2014	I have been helped so much by Vaccination News because they are so informative. When I had my children I had no idea about vaccines and only knew what I was told by my son's Pediatrician which was that they are 100% safe...period. It is essential that Vaccination News continue their efforts so that parents can continue to give parents the tools they need to make an informed decision. 
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215766	1	/users/profile/279214	TrudyS	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2014	Vaccination News has been instrumental in my search for reliable and well sourced information on vaccines. I greatly appreciate that I have a good source to turn to when needed. I also refer my friends and family to VN when they have questions that even their own doctor may not have the answers to in regard to the side effects of vaccinations. It's about informed choice and VN gives you the tools to do so.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215561		/users/profile/203980	gbroadart	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2014	Sandy Gottstein's Vaccination News website is the most informative website I have found that focuses on the topic of vaccines.   Vaccination News lets consumers know about recalls of certain vaccines as soon as they occur, vaccine manufacturing problems and concerns, vaccine issues and concerns around the world, and vaccination side effects-- something that parents would not likely hear from the lips of their children's pediatricians, their own doctors, or from the mainstream media.   Vaccination News is a vital, highly educational website for all parents.  I visit the site daily, and it never disappoints. 
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	153127		/users/profile/203980	gbroadart	General Member of the Public	5	04/07/2013	Vaccination News is an important website for new and even not-so-new parents.  Vaccination News is a vital website for information concerning vaccinations.  Without a website to advise others of the potential risks and dangers of vaccination, how would anyone ever come to know that vaccine injury is even real?  The vast majority of doctors and pediatricians refuse to acknowledge that vaccine injury can occur, even in a small population of patients, and this refusal to acknowledge vaccination damage and harm, after it occurs, leaves parents completely in the dark, without any insight at all.  I have been able to help my own children greatly, due to information I read at this particular website.  Vaccination News must continue to post articles concerning the other side of vaccinations, the side that those in the pharmaceutical industry, in public health and in the media wish to hide and bury.     
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215553		/users/profile/102615	Darrel Crain	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/18/2014	Vaccination News is the go-to web site for news on vaccination, the place where you can find links to articles on all sides of the vaccination debate. It is a great service for parents and health care professionals. Now that a top researcher in the CDC has become a whistle blower and says our government agencies have been engaging in fraudulent research and reporting about vaccines and autism for over ten years, now more than ever we all need access to this information.
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	90044		/users/profile/102615	Darrel Crain	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/08/2011	Vaccination News provides a tremendous public service for all who are interested in the evolving clinical, scientific and political controversies swirling around the topic of mass vaccination. As a researcher and writer on the topic, I find Vaccination News to be a reliable resource for finding links to breaking news and journal articles, as well as links to the growing number of online communities of parents addressing the devastating health challenges of their children. We live in a time of increasing legal and even criminal enforcement of government sponsored one-size-fits-all medical interventions. Vaccination News stands as valuable asset in grassroots struggles to prevent the erosion of medical freedoms and establish laws of true informed consent.
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215531		/users/profile/278970	MYLES1	General Member of the Public	5	09/18/2014	Sandy Gottstein, through Vaccination News is serving a large population of families who are learning of their children's vaccine injuries, and those who have known for many years about the risks and consequences of vaccines to children who are medically compromised.  The information she provides is objective, unbiased and is vital for parents to make more informed decisions prior to immunizations. She has an extensive career helping the Autism community through her advocacy work.  We have an epidemic of developmental disabilities and Autism and parents rely on sound research and reporting before making such potential life changing decisions.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	215517		/users/profile/278954	Shelley T.	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	So many parents need unbiased information these days especially since 1 in every 6 children now have a Developmental Disability which occurred only after the US took away your rights to sue a vaccine maker in regular courts in 1986 and consequently kids went from 7 vaccines to 80. Autism, ADHD, Cancers, Diabetes , immune disease from the Aluminum, thimerosal (Mercury) cells of fetusesdogs, pigs, caterpillars, monkeys, cows, ether, sulfates, MSG, dyes and others have made our kids Chronically ill. Let's not forget the deadly peanut allergies (Peanut products in vaccines) and more.Vaccination News is willing to outlay this information when TV news and the Times is not due to the funding sources in the pharmaceutical industry.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	162042		/users/profile/215000	Ramkumar Rajagopalan	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/04/2013	I would like to appreciate the wonderful work doing by Vaccination News, but I would like to suggest why they were not suggesting the other Non-Profit Organizations like Gates Foundation, Clinton Foundation and others  the importance of Vaccination against Polio with IPV to Childrens Born with HIV. I am currently living in Nigeria and every year 75000 babies born with HIV. More over more than 360,000 childrens living with HIV, this is also one of the reason the polio is not able to eradicated in Nigeria. Because these immunocompromised childrens are taking the OPV ( Live vaccines will not protect the HIV babies ) and they are not protected properly. These childrens indirectly spreading the polio in the community.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89975		/users/profile/102521	Barbara L.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2011	IN SUPPORT OF VACCINATIONS NEWS! I met Sandy Gottstein (aka Mintz) through my late husband, Nicholas Regush. At the time, Nick had just begun publishing Red Flags Daily, a website devoted to probing health and medical scientific issues in a manner that one rarely encounters in mainstream news reports. Nicholas was an internationally renowned journalist, famous for his penetrating writing about many issues in the field of health and science. He was very careful with his time. So when I heard him spending hours on the phone with this mysterious woman from Alaska, Sandy Gottstein, I knew it must be about important business. And so it was.  Like Nicholas, Sandy was a tireless worker in her own field of expertise, vaccines and vaccine policy. She and Nicholas had met (in cyberspace) while he was still a producer at ABC TV in New York. He was also writing a column for ABC's Web site called, Second Opinion. When Sandy sent him an e-mail about one of his columns, she discovered that he had been checking the news on her website almost daily. Nick believed in Sandy's mission to provide all sides of the vaccination controversy; that it was imperative that people should have a broader understanding of what was being published about vaccines so that they might grasp the complexity of the issue. I am not the fiery wordsmith that my husband was. (He died in late 2004.) But I can say with strong conviction that Vaccination News remains a vital resource that is desperately needed in these times when it is often near impossible to find reliable and honest information. Sincerely,Barbara LewisFormer CEO/Publisher, Red Flags Daily
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	154095	1	/users/profile/204923	Seonaid	Volunteer	5	04/10/2013	It must be nearly ten years since I came across Sandy Gottstein and Vaccination News.My son was injured by vaccines and his life destroyed. He was 15 when they gave him MMR, polio and diphtheria / tetanus. One month ealrier his head teacher told me he was university 'material' and could look forward to an interesting future. That was 19 years ago. Once I discovered that vaccines were involved in his catastrophic transformation, I made up my mind to do everything I could to warn other parents of vaccine dangers. It would lend some purpose to my son's experience. I joined forums and chat groups galore, and enthusiastically shared relevant news from Sandy's site! More than once I was asked where I found all my links - and happily told them. Vaccination News has proved to be invaluable in my mission and long may it continue.  If I have succeeded in saving anyone from the fate suffered by my son, it has to be thanks to Sandy.God bless you Sandy for the hard work and time you must spend keeping the site up-to-date with information not found elsewhere. 
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	154070		/users/profile/106246	The Refusers	Client Served	5	04/10/2013	Vaccination News is an incredibly valuable resource for scientific information about vaccination and its under-recognized adverse reactions. It's a daily must-read for me. I use the articles posted on Vaccination News for blog and facebook posts. There is really no other resource that has such comprehensive news for this scientific information. I'm a graduate of the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business and I use statistical models to advise financial institutions.  One of the mottos of the UC Berkeley Haas Business School is: 'Challenge the status quo.' The medical status quo is the 3rd largest cause of death in the US (medical mistakes).

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	90516		/users/profile/103258	Hilary B.	General Member of the Public	5	06/12/2011	Vaccination news is THE one-stop shop for all vaccination information both pro and anti, and is the easiest way to find information rather than trying to find individual needles in all the haystacks.  You can equally quickly find provaccine, or people questioning vaccines, and it enables a parent to make a much better balance decision than just going to any of the dedicated PRO-VACCINE sites.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	153239		/users/profile/108858	Louise H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/07/2013	Vaccination News is a vital source of current and archived information--news and special reports--about vaccination for professionals and lay people. This is especially important because the mainstream media continues to be one-sided and unreliable in its reporting. In the words of the late Bernadine Healy, MD, "There are unanswered questions about vaccine safety... There are no sides--only people concerned for the well-being of our children." We can count on Vaccination News to post comprehensive information on vaccination for all of us who are concerned about vaccine safety.
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	94206	1	/users/profile/108858	Louise H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/22/2011	For over a decade, Vaccination News has provided a critically important resource to many communities, that care about health and wellness, truth in science, holistic living, industry corruption, and our fundamental rights (parental, human, personal, religious, constitutional).  Questions, concerns, and controversies about vaccination abound.  People need a dedicated, reliable clearinghouse focused solely on this topic.  
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	153222		/users/profile/204058	mhirzel	Donor	5	04/07/2013	Vaccination News is, simply put, the very best site for anyone who is looking to sort through the propaganda and hysteria too often found on other sites, including those of vaccination promoters such as the CDC. I have depended on Vaccination News for years to help me recognize the unanswered questions regarding vaccine safety and informed consent.  I know of no other as reliable and comprehensive.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	153120	1	/users/profile/203973	PG K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/07/2013	As a researcher in the area of vaccine safety and effectiveness as well as vaccination program effectiveness and cost effecftiveness, I have found Vaccination News to be a good ite to keep up with relevant news items from around the world. These reports and articles have, at times, helped guide the focus of my studies as well as provided valuble insights into the views of others around the globe. Since measles is one of the areas that piques my interest, Vaccination News' coverage of the current situation in the UK (especially Wales) has been helpful in confirming that the public articles are being less than forthcoming about the reality that, because the MMR vaccine is a live-viruses vaccine, it actually infects each child inoculated with the vaccine in an abnormal manner that spreads the risk of measles through shedding as well as, at a steady rate causes clinical measles cases in a few of those inoculated with them. Also, Vaccination News provides a valuable platform where the parents of those adversely affected can share their stories and inform others of interventions that have helped their affected children to recover. Sometime these stories have provided valuable insights and tools that seem to aid in the recovery of vaccination-damaged children. Hopefully, this valuble Internet web-site resource will be available for the foreseeable future.
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	153076	2	/users/profile/203935	Deborah60	Client Served	5	04/07/2013	After my son was diagnosed with "autism" in 2000, one of the first people I met in the virtual world, and whose website site I relied heavily on was Sandy Gottstein. I obtained enough information to realize even then that there was a connection between autism & vaccinations. Sandy's website vaccinationnews.com is still to this day a wealth of information where one can find articles dating as far back as 2000 and beyond. At a time when finding these articles, one had to dig. Not many knew then or even cared. Many people know today, but alas, sadly few in the position of power care! Sandy was one of the first to express concern for the conflict-of-interest between an industry, namely the FDA; that was suppose to regulate safety of vaccines and their ties with the pharmaceutical industry. The industry they were suppose to regulate.  Many in my family were not convinced of my concerns until they started researching this issue, and they relied very heavily on Sandy's site for their information.  I used articles found on Sandy's site for my own yahoo group, autism & vaccinations (now defunct).  Sandy is dedicated to educating the masses on vaccinations, both the good and the bad. She's non-biased about her approach. She just puts it out there for others to decide. See, Sandy doesn't have a child effected by autism. THAT is the one thing that impresses me the most about her. She's trying to educate others on an issue that she has NO PERSONAL STAKE IN!!!  God bless Sandy for all that she has done and continues to do to this day. All though she lives in Alaska and I, in Pennsylvania and we only met in the real world a few times in DC during the Dan Burton hearings of thimerasol and vaccine safety; I truly consider Sandy a true friend and champion for those who can't fight for themselves!

The site is invaluable in providing extensive references to the scientific literature regarding vaccines and in providing a balanced, empirically-oriented critique.  I have a PhD from a high-powered research program so I am especially interested in a critical evaluation of empirical research regarding vaccines, including flaws in the research, and whether or not conclusions of studies are actually justified.  I am also interested in observations and the implications of same for vaccine issues since observations are always the first step in empirical research.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89981		/users/profile/102528	Stan	General Member of the Public	5	06/08/2011	Vaccination News is an excellent source of information regarding all aspects of this subject.  When I began researching this sort of material on the internet, early on I came across Sandy Gottstein's site, and was immediately impressed with a) the breadth of her researching, and b) her fairness.  She was not 'anti-vaccine' per se; she just did her research, and let the chips fall where they may.   It was on her site, eg, that I came across solid information about the role of vaccines in SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).  If that sort of information had been more widely known about, many a parent/child carer would not have been sent to prison for a 'crime' that they didn't commit, just because the medical profession's 'experts' either didn't know about the link, or didn't want to know.   In sum: Sandy has engaged in an important public service.  I hope the public at large comes to know just how important her work has been. If you read it on Vaccination News, you can be assured that it has been well researched.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89951		/users/profile/102490	doone	General Member of the Public	5	06/08/2011	The general public needs honest and unbiased information in order to make appropriate choices about vaccinations. 'Vaccination News' encourages people to make their own decisions and gives them the tools with which to do it. My nephew suffered profound hearing loss as an infant after receiving his doctor recommended measles vaccine. The medical community could not or would not offer any explanation to his parents as to how it could have happened. Websites such as this can help to educate parents to make informed decisions.
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89946		/users/profile/102481	Catherine J Frompovich	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2011	As a Consumer Health Researcher for 35 years with particular interest in vaccine damage to children, e.g., Autism and other adverse health events/reactions/anomalies as reported by thousands upon thousands using the CDC's VAERS reporting system, I feel Vaccination News performs an outstanding public service in keeping the health consumer, and parents in particular, informed with current research and data regarding vaccines/vaccinations that the general news media overlook.I applaud Vaccination News for its outstanding performance over the years.

Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89936		/users/profile/102469	Mikies	General Member of the Public	5	06/08/2011	First, Vaccination News comes the closest to an historical archive of valuable health information from a wide variety of "vaccination news" for longer than I can remember.  Sandy Gottstein was covering the valid scientific concerns of this medical intervention, long before there was an Andrew Wakefield, long before Autism and related childhood neurological, physical, and immune dysfunctions became the epidemic now ravaging our children.    Vaccination News was there, when very, very few others were: Writing, informing, and rendering compelling reasons for concern over the evidence  on "why" so many children do not and were not fairing well from routine childhood vaccinations.    While so many were asleep at the switch, and the medical community largely uninformed, Vaccination News provided what was missing in the information gap for those truly wanting to exercise informed consent.

Her information jumpstarted me into studying the grave problems with vaccines more than 20 years ago. I think her work, website, and dedication are exemplary, and a prime reason why vaccines are getting national attention as a major risk to health. Robert Rowen, MDwww.secondopinionnewsletter.comwww.doctorrowen.com

Whatever your views on vaccination are, this is a vital and useful site.
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89606		/users/profile/101928	Beth B	Donor	5	06/04/2011	The Vaccination News website is one I visit every day for the most current information on the issue of vaccination and vaccination policy around the world.  During the H1N1 Swine Flu scare of 2009-2010, it was important to know what was happening around the world, in real time, and to understand how very close we all came to mandatory vaccinations against this virus here in the USA.  I find this website to be extremely helpful and enlightening regarding all issues regarding our national vaccine policy, and those of other countries.  New parents need to know that vaccines, like all other medical procedures, carry the risk of harm or death, especially as their pediatricians do not disclose this information to them.  
Vaccination News A Nonprofit Corporation	89595		/users/profile/101911	brook200	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/04/2011	When I wrote my book, Evidence of Harm, Vaccination News was an essential resource I could not have done without. The site is a required daily stop for anyone who is researching, writing about, or simply interested in many of the vaccine safety issues currently being debated in the United States and abroad. The site offers a comprehensive offering of daily and weekly news items pertaining to vaccine development, marketing, safety, adverse events and potential links to disorders such as autism, and others.   David Kirby

Even though we live 100 miles away, we visit often and it is a 'must' on our list when we have visitors.  The research, rescue, education, and entertainment provided here are priceless.  We visited Sea World in San Diego and were both surprised and pleased to find that the Alaska SeaLife Center is more impressive!

We are very proud to support this beautiful, educational facility and the research that is done there.   We have guests from the Lower 48 every summer and AKSC is always on our  "must see" list of places to share with them.  Because the exhibits and presentations change frequently, we don't just drop off our guests, we visit the center with them.   
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	72825		/users/profile/79608	iscream	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	We are local Bed and Breakfast owners and are thrilled to have a facility of the Alaska Sealife Center in our community for guests to experience.  Our grandchildren and personal family visitors put a visit to the center as a main activity when in Seward.  Nothing beats the memory of my 3 year old granddaughter up past to her elbows touching the sea life - even though her sweater was still on!  
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	71004		/users/profile/77620	bunnyli	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	After 13 years living and working (and volunteering) in Alaska, the Alaska Sealife Center is among our favorite places to visit regularly.  It is an exciting learning experience unlike any other.  Our ecosystems can only be understood and respected through real scientific research; and the ASLC provides such by studying marine populations and passing on the knowledge to the public.  In addition to education, it offers vital rehabilitation to animals in need. 
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	70826		/users/profile/77429	Meg1212	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	The Alaska SeaLife Center holds a special place in my heart.  I first visited the Center when I was a teenager, and now that I'm a young adult I still hold that same interest.  Every time I visit the Center, I learn something new about the ocean, life in the sea, and useful information to making our environment a better place.
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	70793		/users/profile/77390	barrc7783	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	The Alaska SeaLife center is one of the high lights of our campus visit program for prospective students.  Our students really enjoy comparing their combined weight with the sea lion and sticking their hands in the touch tank.  Keep up the good work and i forward to bringing another group down soon.
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	70686		/users/profile/77262	stephanie	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	We have enjoyed the Sea Life center since it opened.  Now that my kids are teenagers, they still like to visit, and we are members.  My personal favorite activity is to go downstairs and watch the birds "fly/swim" under water.  The puffins are so graceful even though they are kind of awkward in the air!  My kids love the sea lion that seems to play with the people watching through the glass.  Every time I go, there is something different to see and I always learn something.  We love it!

She has enjoyed it since she was only 4 months old.  She loves to look at the fish up close and really enjoys the birding area with all the sea birds.  We know she will learn a lot from all the displays as she gets older.  We go at least once each time we are in Seward--sometimes 2 or 3 times!  
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	70233		/users/profile/76762	Asia	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	A trip to the Alaska SeaLife Center was part of one of my first college classes when I came to Alaska. I enjoyed the many displays and getting to see things that not everyone in the world gets to see (ex. what the birds look like when they are diving under the water).  Over the years I have enjoyed all of my visits and have been fortunate enough to participate in their internship program and work with the ASLC on a school project. My internship experience was amazing and allowed me to visit and be part of a number of departments within the center. Although I will always be an aquarium nerd I must admit the center opened my eyes to how cool marine mammals and birds can be too.

In addition, it provides an economic engine for the community of Seward by encouraging tourists to spend extra time there. The Center's ability to rehabilitate marine mammals and water fowl and return them to their natural habitat when possible is heartwarming. The Center is blessed with outstanding leadership and a caring, hardworking staff.

While the mission is stongly focused on education, research and rescue, a visit carries all the pleasure of any large aquarian with a much smaller facility. They are truly a gem for Alaska in all ways. The staff is first rate, always welcoming, always ready to teach young and old alike.

My seventh grade son is wants to go to school for marine biology and he always has a list of questions when we arrive.  The staff takes their time and explains all answers in detail.  We have lived in cities where there were bigger centers but have learned that bigger is not better.

It is just incredible.   Once at the Sea Life Center you find all of these amazing exhibits.  Almost anything you want to see is there, and you will find some surprises as well. The staff is awesome.  Always ready to help and answer your questions.  I am sure they hear the same questions time and time again, but you would never know it.  Very friendly and cordial.

It is an excellent adventure for visitors from out of state and helps me to share my excitement about Alaska and it's wild inhabitants. I especially love the tanks where you can observe wildlife swimming. This facility is so rich and engaging that I got a family pass this year so we can go as often as we like. We are looking forward to meeting Eden, the new Sea Lion. And, I have to admit, I look forward to spending money in the gift store. They have excellent educational products, and I like to gift shop there. I feel good about spending money to help support the Alaska SeaLife Center.

My granddaughter and I drive down as often as possible, as she loves to come and visit. Her favorite is the tank where she can touch and feel the starfish and sea cucumbers. The staff is great and their love of the kids and of course the sealife is obvious. We enjoy watching Woody, the many fish and of course the birds. I can't wait for the opportunity to bring my other grandchildren. We enjoy not only knowing that marine animals are being saved, but the education which is available. Keep up the good work.

We are lucky to have  such beautiful and informational exhibits in our small town. I know there are several exciting science and research projects that are conducted "behind the scenes" and I would like to know more about these. The facility is a great place to spend a few hours, and the salmon exhibit is really informative for everyone. I'd love to see some updated information about Salmon returns to Resurrection Bay. Some additional information on local whale species and research following the EXXON Valdez Oil spill would be good too.

We are a family of 4, 5 and 4 year kids.  We went to visit the Sea Life Center for the first time this past summer.  The staff was wonderful, offering us a family membership that saved us money too.  Loved the gift shop, could have bought one of everything!  We get great emails on events and happenings.  I wish we lived closer so we could go more often.  I absolutely love sea life and the ocean.  Our whole family does.  It is really wonderful to have the opportunity to share this love with our children.
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	69719		/users/profile/76199	Rhonda	Donor	5	02/16/2011	The Seward SeaLife Center is one of a kind.  I have sat in front of the glass watching the Stellar sea lion for hours.  More fascinating are the families and kids who come and go -- some sit down in front of it and watch for nearly as long as I do.  Many children are absolutely awed at the sight of this magnificent, gigantic mammal swimming effortlessly past them, again and again, from different directions.  Children learn so much about our ocean animals through the wonderful, well-planned SeaLife Center.  I live in Anchorage, a two-hour drive away (one-way), and won't miss stopping in to see what's new.   The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and helpful, and it is always a real treat to visit.  Who would think that our state would have such a great facility!  Keep up the good work, ASLC!

When we first moved to the Kenai Peninsula I was amazed to hear about the Sea Life Center and my admiration continues to grow towards both the facility and staff each time we have the opportunity to visit. Our children (ages 4,4,6,8) have enjoyed learning about marine animals and conservation - especially with the touch pools. This past year we purchased a yearly pass - which was incredibly affordable. The staff is highly educated, available and strive to make sure everyone is getting the most out of their visit. Our children are in love with "Woody" the Stellar Sea Lion and run downstairs each time to watch him! Our oldest daughter's class this year will get to go there for their field trip and she couldn't be more excited! We are so fortunate to have such a top notch marine facility that is so family centered - teaching children at a young age about marine animals impacts more than just the community, it impacts society.

Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	67312		/users/profile/73571	Neds	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/12/2011	   The Alaska SeaLife Center plays an important and unique role in the state. Its education program, which reaches school groups and teachers, as well as the general public, stresses the urgent need for understanding and conserving Alaska's marine resources, which are vital for the long term health and sustainability of its beautiful environments as well as for the Alaskan economy.    As the only animal rehabilitation center in this vast state, it has become a focal point because of its expertise in animal husbandry and animal rehabilitation. Thus, it is poised to respond to various kinds of environmental emergencies as no other institution can.    Last, and centainly not least, its role and importance as a research institution is vital to the state and to the nation .  The work that has been done on animal populations in the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering Sea and other areas is critical to the sustainability of its animal populations and of the Alaskan economy. Because of its geographic location, it can easily address important research questions about such things as variation in the productivity of the artic waters. In addition, as a public place that houses research scientists and exhibits the animals used in their research  projects, it is positioned to give its visitors  insights into the ongoing process of research itself.     Clearly this unique institution is worthy of support.

It is very educational and after all education is what is vital when it comes to the environment and protecting that environment.  The research they do is vital to a healthy marine ecco-system and the creatures who live in that system.   One of my most enjoyable visits was with my grandchildren, who live in Austin, Texas.  They learned so much that day and for several days after they drew pictures to share with friends at home.   I am not an expert in any area of marine biology but thanks to the Sea Life Center, I am an informed layperson.   Vivian K.
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	67192		/users/profile/73435	sehazzar	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I worked at teh ASLC as an Intern in the stranding and rehabilitation department.  I have to say it was by far the best experience in my entire life.  The staff at the ASLC are always so helpful and involved in every aspect of teaching and education.  I learned more through their internship program over the course of four months then I think I did in my entire four years at college.  There is no better experience then real hands on learning from people who really know what they're doing.  Even staff members of other departments were always willing to help out with anything.  I always enjoyed going into the center on my days off.  Something about being surrounded by the tourists with all their smiles and seeing them interact with all the staff who also always seemed to be wearing smiles made me feel so good about everything that takes place in the center.  It truly is a magical place filled with amazing creatures and wonderful people!
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	67161		/users/profile/73400	Janice T.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I worked at the Sealife centre as a volunteer in the Avian Department in the captive breeding program for steller and spectacled eiders from may to july 2008. It has become one of the most memorable experiences of my life to date. The people are amazing, friendly and so welcoming, and I can't wait to come back one day and visit or volunteer again. I was captivated by the eiders in the program and I watched a  hatchling for 8 hours without leaving its side only to see it had to be put down due to birth defects of its limbs the next day. I was heartbroken beyond measure, as was the team. But it made me realise how much I just want to help, and over my time at the centre I fell  in love with these species and every other species the centre try to help rehabilitate. The passion of the people who work and volunteer there is incredible and life changing and has a massive ripple effect. They endure the toughest of times and celebrate the best of times when they succeed. They do an amzing job, I wish I could have stayed a lot longer. My last night there I felt like i was leaving my home and it was hard to go. I will return there one day soon. It holds a special place in my heart as do the people i met and worked with.

The facility is wonderful and is always filled with exciting marine life, new exhibits and caring and professional staff! The research at the Center provides relavent information that addresses key arctic marine mammal and ecosystem questions that arrise at within the state as well as arctic-wide. The Center is a vital facility for the state of Alaska providing critical lab space for both marine researchers of today and those young people [students and interns] it inspires for tomorrow. I beleive more funding would enable the staff at the Center to reach its full potential answering the growing questions that marine species and the people that depend on them face in the changing arctic environment.

I am always impressed by the fun, yet informative displays found at the Center. The ability to view such a variety of sea life in a realistic environment makes learning very enjoyable. As lodging providers we are constantly hearing praise about the Center from our guests who visit it.If I had to make one suggestion, it would be to try to lower the cost of admission. While I know that the funds are used very efficiently, some of our guests have been put off by the cost of admission.
Seward Association For The Advancement Of Marine Science	66933		/users/profile/73154	Chris C.	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	The Marine Science Center in Seward is one of the Highlights of our Alaska Tours. We send about 150 of our guests through here each season. The knowledge of the staff and their willingness to share their obvious dedication to the animals and inhabitants of the Alaskan waters is evident everywhere. The facility is clean and the signage is very informative to both the casual visitor and the more informed. The layout of exhibits helps the visitor understand the relationship of the animals to the environment. We have taken the behind the scenes tour and backstage is clean and well cared for, as well. Very fun, educational and informative.

Anyone can request assistance for their own situation or for another dog on the neighborhood that might need extra shelter. Education and fostering (when needed) also available to help keep dogs and their people through  the cold Alaska winter. Nice people providing comfort (in the form of shelter) to dogs that might otherwise be cold.

After spending the better part of an evening with us as we introduced him to our other dogs, we all agreed to give it a try.  They were again easily available when our new foster dog became sick within days of moving into our house.  Once that scare was over (and one neuter surgery later) we decided to officially adopt our old-timer and we still consider ourselves to be part of the Straw for Dogs family.  It's such a great organization and we're so glad we saw them on Facebook.

They go out to help animals that others overlook because they are not cute or cuddly and are in bad situations. From delivering straw to building dog houses to just walking dogs, the volunteers at S4D will do anything for animals in need, whatever the situation. The staff are long time Alaskans with many connections in the local community, getting many organizations to donate straw, food, doghouses, and even delivery services to remote areas! I have volunteered with S4D for about 2 years, and have seen animals in a wide variety of situations, and S4D has done everything possible to help every one of them. They are dedicated, hard working people who love all animals!

My friend Travis has cerebral palsy and wanted and needed a service dog.  we found a perfect  match at Anchorage Animal Care and Control, an adult lab mix, named Xena.  Travis had a 6 foot fence along the back of his house but needed both ends blocked off with 6 foot tall fence and a gate that he could open (he uses a power wheelchair).  Straw for dogs provided a custom made gate and installed both ends of his back yard wit6 foot tall fencing to make a perfect dog run for his dog.  Travis and Xena are well on their way to becoming a legal service dog team.  Straw for Dogs made all the difference.

Straw for Dogs	166673	1	/users/profile/221424	chantielleorr	Client Served	5	08/31/2013	What has Straw For Dogs not done for me? I think the hardest thing is figuring out where to start. I first met them about two years ago when they showed up at the house. They had already stopped by but I had missed them. They were offering goodies, toys, dog food, and straw for my outside boys. They played with the boys and when they left I thought that was it. I was surprised at the kindness and willingness to make sure my outside boys were taken care of. And their kindness just didn't stop there. Near the beginning of winter the year after, and year after that, they stopped in with more straw for my boys, leashes, new collars, treats (the boys loved the treats), bowls, etc...for them. They also helped take my old guys to the vet as well as took the time to accompany me with them. We also had to make a trip to the SPCA and they were right there to help me get the guys inside. A hard decision came over the summer when one of my boys needed to be put to sleep. And I don't think I could have had the strength to do it alone. And I didn't have too. Straw For Dogs were the first people I called. I cried on the phone and Metis just listened and then she cried with me. One of the volunteers for Straw For Dogs came over at midnight to pick me and my boy up and take him to a wonderful vet clinic. Most of it was a blur but what I do remember is the volunteer giving me emotional support, speaking to the vet when I couldn't speak, and simply being there for me and my boy even though it was so late at night. She was amazing, and her kindness was real, nothing like that could be made up and trust me, no one wants to go through that experience of dealing with a blubbering woman and holding her hand but at the same time soothing the dog and speaking with the vet, but straw for dogs did and I am so grateful.  Lastly, I was staying next door to someone who was suppose to be family. I ended up needing to leave the situation for the safety of my physical and emotional being. I tried hard to find a place that had a yard so I could take my last boy but it wasn't working out and my living situation was getting worse. I ended up giving my last boy to straw for dogs and I was happy because they found him a great home. I got to meet his new parent and he now has other brothers and sisters, and chickens to harass. Straw For Dogs always made sure to assist me with the boys whenever I needed it, no matter what help they needed. And they helped me too by helping them as well as providing emotional support for me through these last couple of months. And although I am no longer an owner of an outside doggie, Straw for Dogs still text me and check up on me and that is truly amazing. I also get lots and lots of picks of my old boy and I love everything that he is able to do at his new home. If you get anything out of what I've written it's that Straw For Dogs is absolutely willing to help your dog the best way they can and they don't get paid for doing it. It's a rare thing these days but they truly are a group of caring people.

Arranging transport proved to be challenging and even tho SVEN was not in the "care" of Straw for Dogs, this amazing organization stepped up to the plate on behalf of husky SVEN. Straw for Dogs worked over and above the call of duty to successfully arrange ALL travel arrangements ~ including but not limited to numerous calls, texts, emails between participating parties, visiting SVEN at his temporary care, locating a suitable airline approved crate for his long flight, introducing him to a crate, ensuring he had ALL proper paperwork for border customs, travelling in the early morning hours to personally send him safely on his journey ~ a long flight from Anchorage AK to Vancouver BC. We drove the 16 hour trip and picked up our beloved SVEN and travelled home to introduce SVEN to his new family pack.  Sven was indeed a perfect match for our pack and has already taken his turn at being LEAD DOG !!Huge paws up to S4D for all of their efforts, for us, for SVEN, and for all of the outdoor dogs who have received much needed straw, fencing, houses, toys, and all they require to provide comforts of life!!!!
Straw for Dogs	163892		/users/profile/217691	Carmen7	Volunteer	5	07/30/2013	It is hard for dogs in Alaska to be out in -15 degrees in the middle of winter.  Straw for Dogs understands that not everyone believes a dog is an indoor dog whether or not they have tons of fur or not.  Donating houses and straw to keep outdoor dogs warm and out of the elements is a blessing for the dog.  And when an outdoor dog is no longer cared for by the owner Straw for Dogs opens their home and brings them inside where they will stay until a new family comes.  Without Straw for Dogs many more outdoor dogs would not be here today.
Straw for Dogs	163859	1	/users/profile/217625	ArcticRose A.	Volunteer	5	07/29/2013	My first volunteer experience was with Straw for Dogs, a little over 4.5 years ago on a very cold winter night.  I received a phone call from a good friend that there was a young man asking Straw for Dogs for help. He told us of his family dog that lived outside her whole life, they could no longer provide for her. As I went with my friend to offer some dog food and support, we learned the dog needed so much more than just food.  This 13 year old McKenzie River Malamute, was in very poor shape, laying on a garbage pile and unable to stand on her own. It was 7 degree that evening. Working with the family, Straw for Dogs offered medical support and I quickly opened my home to offer her a warm soft bed to live out her golden years.  I am lucky to be a part of an organization like Straw for Dogs. They have a strong mission and are focused on their goals. To improve the lives of animals and to educate people on how to provide a better way of  living, not only for the animals but for the humans too.

For those two weeks, and for two weeks out of the next three years, I met friends that I would have for the rest of my life, and learned an incredible amount in an incredibly short amount of time. I can safely say that Fine Arts Camp changed my life. Without it, I could very well have gone in a different direction, and would've missed out on some precious memories. Thank you SFAC!!
Alaska Arts Southeast Inc	98822		/users/profile/117460	Ariel L.	Client Served	5	10/01/2011	SFAC Changed my life. For the better. I'll have to look back and review, and I hope SFAC got on the list of top non-profits, cause they deserve it, but I think everyone must have had the same words. SFAC changed my life, and was life for so many of the people I met there. Many of my closest friends are still the people I met nine years ago at SFAC. I knew many middle and high school kids who survived isolation and alienation in their small communities for 50 weeks a year because they knew for 2 weeks a year they would be held up, supported, loved, and accepted. Young students with not much going for them would spend the year seeking out and writing grants, asking for the support of local businesses, and working every job they could find all year to send themselves to camp for those precious two weeks. SFAC is a place where young people thrive. My artistic inspiration and life inspiration still draws so strongly from my experiences at SFAC years ago - when I am feeling not-so-artistic or inspired, I think back to my time there and the words from my instructors and friends and feel a wave of inspiration, motivation, encouragement, and dreams. Those two weeks a year did more for my art than the years of classes I have taken since. Thank you so much to SFAC and all the people who make it up! I am so glad it is back at SJ campus where all my happiest memories thrive, and flourish. SFAC is a breath of fresh air in the stress of youth and life. I would not be who I am today without SFAC. If every week was like those two weeks, the world would be a radically different place and we could accomplish anything. 
Alaska Arts Southeast Inc	98820		/users/profile/117449	Tracy234567	Board Member	5	10/01/2011	My first experience with Sitka Fine Arts Camp was as a camper back in the '70's.  Each summer I spent 2 weeks in intense training and exploration in my chosen art courses. I had  small classes led by professional artists. I bonded with other kids who, like me, heard a different drummer. It was magical.   My kids became campers during this past decade. They received the same kind of high quality, compassionate and just plain FUN  arts experiences that I did. I know that they learned more about who they are, what they want and where they are going. They learned to take risks, to overcome challenges and to explore with passion. They learned through the examples of their teachers and counselors, to be respectful and supportive of other explorers.  All three of my grown childeren are bettter people for having attended.I believe that the arts are an integral part of education. The arts help to foster creative and indepent thought. They help teach communication and adaptability. In a world that is changing at an inconceivable rate, these are the traits are most sought after by businesses, the most capable leaders. Sitka Fine Arts Camp is growing artists, but more importantly, it is growing great people.

The teachers are the best in their field and they have an invested interest in their students. I honestly would not be the person or artist I am today without this camp.

The students come eager to learn and to interact with each other and the faculty and counselors.   One of the unique aspects of the camp is the opportunity for students to not only pursue their particular interest but to experience and try other disciplines in the arts and see how those compliment and enhance the training they've already received.   The evening Art Shares programs showcase faculty and student talent both individually and in groups.  This develops a camaraderie amongst the camp participants that draws them back each year to continue learning in a postive supportive atmosphere.  SFAC embraces students of any skill level and seeks to build them from where they are. The beautiful setting in Sitka just adds to the asthetic experience.

This camp helped me develop my artistic abilities and build confidence more in the two weeks I had the privilege of attending every summer than my whole year at school and in other programs. I owe so much of myseld to those who continually support and recognize this camp as the invaluable asset that it is.

Because of the hard work and dedication of Alaska Arts Southeast (AASE)  staff, board members, volunteers and financial donors, she will be attending camp on the historic Sheldon Jackson campus, the original home of Sitka Fine Arts Camp. Since we live in Sitka, we are lucky enough to benefit directly not only from the presence of Sitka Fine Arts Camp, but from the Sheldon Jackson Campus rejuvenation project AASE has taken on.  In the last 9 months, AASE has turned a boarded up eyesore back in to a welcoming, vibrant educational facility.

We had attended many of the art shares and performances in the past, but the jr. high camp far exceeded our expectations.  I would call it a life changing experience.  To be surrounded by such talented teachers and students who were all excited about the arts for 2 weeks is a joy.  Although she is primarily a dancer, the camp encourages exploration of many different art forms and I believe this makes it unique.

When my daughter decided to go, it became a family commitment.  The arts are being brought to the world, not just Sitka through this experience.  The teachers are top rated, provide a great atmosphere and teach challenging lessons.  It has been a great experience and the setting is beautiful.  Even more so with the addition of the Sheldon Jackson campus.  It is wonderful to see the commitment of all to the improvement of the campus, SFAC and the communtiy.

I home school them at their parents' isolated wilderness lodge on Prince of Wales Island. With both BS and MEd degrees and 30 years experience teaching in public schools, I know they are well educated. However, I cannot give them interactions with other children or the fine arts taught by highly qualified instructors. These they received abundantly at SFAC. I am so appreciative that this opportunity exists. The girls learned joyfully and can hardly wait to return in 2012.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2011	I have been following Sheldon Jackson College for many years as they struggled with sustainability and finally folded. The Sitka Fine Arts Camp took a huge risk and rallied the community to not only save a historic set of buildings, but they had the vision to create an amazing asset for their community and the state. The number of volunteer hours alone that have been donated in a very small community has got to be some kind of record. This organization deserves financial support.
Alaska Arts Southeast Inc	98032		/users/profile/115994	Artsedfan	Donor	5	09/23/2011	This is one of the most exciting, interesting and valuable organizations I've come across.  Taking an open and nurturing attitude towards education of young people from not only Southeast Alaska, or even just Alaska, but across the country, the Fine Arts Camp run by Alaska Arts Southeast gave my children memorable experiences that increased their understanding, appreciation and abilities  from grades 7-12.  My son is looking forward to returning in a year or two as a counselor, adviser, or maybe just volunteer.  If I lived in Sitka, I'd be reporting to volunteer duty on the newest project of Alaska Arts Southeast--the renovation and rejuvenation of the historic Sheldon Jackson College campus, for use by the Fine Arts Camp and other arts and education groups who may want to help support and use the campus outside of the camp's needs.Current director, Roger Schmidt has ushered the camp into exciting  new directions with the backing of a strong and remarkable board.Every penny is well-spent and Alaska Arts Southeast seems to be able to increase each penny a hundred-fold to take the organization in captivating and wonderful new directions.

The simple idea that those of us who have extra resources should lend a hand has stuck with me as I have grown up. Now I have volunteered both in the Bean's Caf kitchen and admin offices. The staff are incredibly hard workers and they treat everyone - donors, volunteers, and clients alike - with dignity and respect. A fun place to volunteer and an extremely important need in our community.

They are truly making a difference in the Anchorage community. From great staff to wonderful volunteers, Beans Cafe has always found a way to care and provide to those better than any organization I have ever seen. Thank you to all of you who work so hard everyday to make a change for the better for all of those who cannot do it themselves!

The kitchen staff has been wonderful to work with and they genuinely care about the food that they prepare for the people in need. I try to help out whenever I get an opportunity. Most recently, I had the opportunity to work in the office. Ken Miller and the WONDERFUL ladies who work in the office are always working to raise funds for the cause.

They do so much more than serve good to Anchorage-area folks in need...they have creative programs like that foot care program to give new clean socks and footwear and therapuetic foot massage and health treatment in the winter time, when Anchorage homeless are in desparate need of warm, dry clothing and attention to their feet. Bean's does amazing fundraisers that promote education and awareness in addition to raising financial support for their services. I particularly appreciate their attitude toward helping others...they do not look down on anyone or try to judge people against a moral standard. They don't discriminate, and they try to care for people while also empowering them.

Beans Cafe Inc	132564	1	/users/profile/178212	pat.corkery	Board Member	5	11/02/2012	Bean's Cafe has that rare combination of an amazing and selfless staff, a committed Board of Directors, generous in both time and treasure, and a deep pool of volunteers quick to respond when help is needed.  Bean's Cafe enjoys a community which (largely) supports the mission of Bean's, as demonstrated by the hundreds of turkeys and side dishes donated for Bean's annual Thanksgiving feast. While still thought of as a soup kitchen for the homeless, today's reality is somewhat different. Many of Bean's clients are Alaska's working poor, struggling to keep a roof over their heads, their kids in school and hunger from their doorstep.  Bean's mission has broadened in recent years.  Bean's now serves an overflow shelter when temperatures plunge and our neighbor, The Brother Francis Shelter's demand exceeds its capacity.  Bean's "The Children's Lunchbox" has a mission of 'feeding hungry kids in a safe community environment!".  Children's Lunchbox has served nearly 240,000 meals to hungry kids in 2012, up from less than 100,000 in 2010.  To learn more about Bean's Cafe and its programs, visit beans cafe.org and thechildrenslunchbox.org. While you're there, why not "Donate Online".  Thanks.
Beans Cafe Inc	132434		/users/profile/178071	Abbe Dunning-Newbury	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	I have served as a board memberwith Bean's Cafe  for over 30 years' ,starting in the late 1970's when it occupied a small warehousey fronting on an alley. We served hot food with coffee made by re-brewing used coffee grounds from a local hotel. With the support of many people, we  moved in 1985 to our present building at 3rd & Karluk, with a wonderful commercial kitchen that produces high-quality nutritious meals and consistently receives the highest health inspection ratings. When I first joined the board, Bean's was not yet a member of United Way.. I have seen it grow to a highly rated United Way agency , blessed with broad community support.   Our mission remains the same-- to provide hot meals and warm day shelter to homeless people . The need is enormous and we are now serving many people who are not chronically homeless, but who have been affected by job losses in the present economy. Through Children's Lunchbox, a program of Bean's Cafe, we are now also serving nutritious meals to needy children at numerous sites around Anchorage.  All this is possilble because we continue to be blessed with generous community support.  Our mission remains the same -- to serve the hungry and the homeless 365 days a year, Our underlying premise, as always, is a deep belief in the dignity of every person and a dedication to treaing all out clients with kindness and respect. I am excited and proud to serve on tghe board of this wonderful organization which makes such a difference in many peoples' lives.  Abbe Dunning-Newbury
Beans Cafe Inc	132214		/users/profile/177828	Hillary Strayer	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	I have had several opportunities to volunteer with Beans Cafe in Anchorage, Alaska, so have had a close-up view of their staff and operations.  They provide meals, resources, and some health care opportunities for people without homes in Anchorage, an environment much more of a challenge for homeless persons than where I came from in Southern California.  Beans staff do an excellent job of advertising opportunities to assist them and then coordinating the event, whether it is working in their kitchen or helping sell item at a grocery store or fair to raise funds for the kitchen.  They have collaborated with artists in the area for years on an annual fundraising event, the "Empty Bowl", where local artists contribute pottery art, mainly bowls, and attendees buy tickets to compete for the best artwork.  All of these efforts make Bean's Cafe universally recognized in the community and a successful and ongoing resource for many of those in greatest need in our area.  The most inspirational moments I have had that demonstrate the positive effects of Beans Cafe is when I have been at a venue selling items to raise money and am approached by someone who tells me "I used to eat at Beans.  I'm making it on my own now.  I'd like to make a donation."
Beans Cafe Inc	129859		/users/profile/175290	Audrey Scott	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2012	Beans Caf is a great help to the community, they provide a place for the homeless, no matter what their situation, to acquire the most essential needs. The amazing part is that they do not pick and choose when they do this or who they will help; they have dedicated themselves 365 days a year to anyone that walks through the door in need.  The staff and even their families as well as others from the community spend an immense amount of time helping these people. It is the personal sacrifices the team is willing to make that are so amazing.  Even on Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Years they spend time away from their homes making others more comfortable and spreading joy. They are an inspiration for everyone to stop and take a look at what we each do to help the less fortunate.                                                                                                                                                                         The events they hold to raise funds so that they can accomplish their mission, which is to feed the hungry and shelter the homeless without discrimination during the day, are always enjoyable and they allow the community as a whole to participate in solving one of Anchorages most unfortunate problems. A perfect example is the Empty Bowl, there are thousands of community members that attend and join the fight against hunger. This one event helps feed, clothes, warm, and provides countless other services to hundreds of homeless people.Beans Caf takes it a step further than just feeding the homeless. They work to place the homeless in a home they can call theirs, they fight for jobs for those that need employment, provide transportation, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, legal help, medical help and they help to educate those that want it. Beans Cafs dedication to this community is undeniable and incredible. This should make everyone stop and think What can I do or what can my company do to help Beans Caf continue the amazing work they do.

Beans Cafe Inc	93988		/users/profile/108473	Leslie E.	Board Member	5	07/18/2011	Any organization that serves over 313,000 free meals and provides over 35,000 medical items in one year is a monumental support to society, but Beans Caf goes above and beyond those outstanding numbers. Theyre more than just a soup kitchen; Beans Caf actively assists those who need it with help finding jobs, medical care, housing and more. They are trusted community partners, a resource for those who need help with the most basic human necessities and a valuable asset to Alaskans  especially Alaskans in need. Credit Union 1s partnership with this crucial non-profit has been beneficial for over a decade and we fully support them in their mission by hosting annual fundraising events like Pour, helping to promote and advertise for The Empty Bowl, and incorporating them into events like the Mountain View Street Fair whenever possible because we believe in what they do. This is a great non-profit organization and others would benefit from following their model to support their communities. 
Beans Cafe Inc	93814	1	/users/profile/108172	meg baldino	Board Member	4	07/13/2011	I wasn't always a board member at Bean's Cafe.  Although I recently moved into a new job, I spent the last decade as a journalist in Anchorage.   For years I covered Bean's cafe in the news.  Mostly the good the organization was doing for the homeless community in our city.  In recent years however I continually found myself reaching out to Bean's as several members of the homeless community were dying on our streets.  Bean's and director Jim Crockett were always there to offer insight into the death, or even humanize the person who had passed away.  It's easy to forget that homeless people have families too and stories and lives that matter.  Jim made sure the public knew who the "homeless person" really was. When the issue came to a head in the last year, our station decided to host a Town Hall on the issue and asked Jim if we could use Bean's Cafe for the live televised event.  Of course he agreed and we had an extrememly successful event.  But perhaps most importantly, it wasn't a room filled with lawmakers and politicians, but a room filled with people who think of Bean's as their home.  They offered important and essential insight into what was happening. When I left television a few months ago, there was no question which organization  would join as a board member and I expressed as much to Jim.  Not only was I committed to the mission, but as someone whose family had once faced significant financial difficulties and was forced out fo home, it is a mission near and dear to my heart.   I am now a board member and learning so much more about Bean's.  I had volunteered in the kitchen several times through my church, but  now I get to see a new side of Beans. The mission is simple "Feed the hungry and shelter the homeless without discrimination during the day." But by doing that each day Bean's offers members of the homeless community they don't get anywhere else: respect and dignity.  That is perhaps the geatest gift of Bean's. I think that Bean's is working to become more tech savy and use the web to its advantage.  I agree we need some younger members on the board.  Also, as funding for other non-profits gets tight, we should look to strategic partnerships to leverage opportunities for growth.   As a new board member, I hesitate to offer too many suggestions as I am still learning about the internal workings of theorganization.  So far, I have been impressed with Bean's board.

It's a message that needs to be delivered on a continual bases, as even one death due to drinking and driving is one too many.  The mission also provides support and direction to  the victims of drinking and driving.  There isn't any other mission like this in Alaska and we have one of the hightest rates of drunk driving.

The Forget Me Not Mission II has help remember people that have been killed by a drunk driver and given the ones still alive a chance to speak out. They are all victims but they have faces, names and loved ones and I believe Forget Me Not Mission II gives everyone a chance to speak. They are no longer just a number.

Their first book, Soul Shaking Grief, has been an incredible resource for allowing the public to peek into lives that have been shattered and impacted forever by the selfishness of drunk drivers.  Nancy & Royal Bidwell work tirelessly often 10 hour days to insure that every person, both adult and teen, are made aware of the consequences of choosing to drink while impaired.

Forget Me Not Mission II	91006		/users/profile/103968	EMC2	Volunteer	5	06/15/2011	The Forget Me Not Mission is inspiring in its commitment to actively fixing a problem through outreach. The cause is very real, and their Soul Shaking Grief books promote awareness through emotionally touching firsthand accounts as well as the bare facts associated with distracted driving. By working directly with the public, particularly young people, Forget Me Not gains a personal aspect that sets it apart from other well-meaning organizations. Dangerous driving can affect anyone, so it is up to every citizen to stay focused and sober behind the wheel. Forget Me Not brings awareness to the public through their publications, posters and presentations, and is contributing to a shift in values for what is acceptable when driving.

This foundation is working in collaboration with state high and middle schools to educate young drivers about the importance of safe choices while driving and how easily it is to be involved in distracted driving accidents.  Their message is real and personal and I have witnessed the transformation their story makes when teens understand the reality of the devastation drunk and distracted driving causes.  Their work makes kids aware and more importantly, makes them want to be involved in making others aware.

It was an amazing experience for my students to work through the stories of victims of drunk driving and to be a part of such an influential publication. Many of my students shared how they had been inspired or touched by the stories of both the victims who passed on and those who survived and now face life-altering challenged.

Forget Me Not Mission II	90683		/users/profile/103504	Darkon	General Member of the Public	5	06/14/2011	I first came across the Forget Me Not Foundation through the social network facebook. I am very glad that I did. I am a victim of a drunken driving accident from many years ago, and when I saw the nature and purpose of what the foundation was all about I contacted them and friended them immediately. I shared my story with the founders of the foundation, the Bidwells, and they ask if I would share my story. I was glad to do so. My story and 100 others were included in a book they produced called "Soul Shaking Grief". It is an awesome culmination of stories from individuals and families whose lives have been disrupted som horribly as a result of drinking and driving.  The work goes on though, and sadly, it will probably not end in our life time. The Forget Me Not Foundation is an inspiration to many of us who have survived the wreckage of lives as a result of impaired driving. I know the Bidwells and the Foundation will carry this work on as long as they are breathing, and many of us in the community will continue to be right there beside them every step of the way. God Bless and Keep The Forget Me Not Foundation.

I was approached for input as to how to extend the message that drinking and reckless driving can ruin lives to other teenagers. Through many meetings and brainstorming other students and myself came up with new ideas to make the Forget Me Not Foundation projects appealing and impacting to students around the community. A book was produced earlier for the general public, but a new one is under construction geared towards the younger generation with more stories similar to their situation. This organization does a phenomenal job at reaching their target audience through discussion and interactions with the rising generation and sincerely attempting to get their message across to help teenagers and young adults make better life decisions.

I have been aware of the immense problem with drunk and impaired driving there. Royal and Nancy and their volunteer staff have devoted their time, money and efforts to educate and inform Alaskans about the cost in human lives that drunk driving has caused. I am especially aware of their book "Soul Shaking Grief" which gives accounts of accidents caused by drinking drivers and the victims both deceased and living who are impacted. The organization used high school journalism students in producing this book which literally changed the students' lives as they read the accounts of those affected. Royal and Nancy have also been advocates for the families of victims of drunk drivers as they offered support by attending court cases and law making sessions where stricter laws were being proposed that would discourage drinking drivers. I would highly recommend this organization as worthy of any campaigns they apply for. Their hearts are in their work and they work unceasingly. Alaska is fortunate to have them! 
North Star Youth Court	119795		/users/profile/162850	zmancooks99	Volunteer	5	08/01/2012	Youth court is a fun and interactive way to learn about the justice system and at the same time helping to get kids who made a mistake back on their feet. The entire courtroom is youths (attorneys, judges, clerks) but the youth court has real attorneys to teach the training and appear in court with you in case there is some kind of problem that can't be resolved easily. The youth court is an amazing program that I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to try and get involved with.
North Star Youth Court	99326		/users/profile/118954	Meep	Board Member	5	10/14/2011	Youth court is a fun interactive way to let you become a attorney at law. This organization lets you get a taste of what life in the court room is really like. I love youth court i have always wanted to be a law attorney and this was the perfect taste of law that I've always wanted. Youth court is real cases with real people with real crimes! if want to be involved in the law early this is perfect for you. 
North Star Youth Court	97567		/users/profile/115059	ashak	Client Served	4	09/16/2011	I contacted North Star Youth Court for help with parent/teen mediation. Betty Noreen arranged an appointment the next day which was critical for our tighht schedule. They provided a safe non judgemental place for me, my son, his dad and stepmom to each tell our story and try to resolve our conflict. While we were not able to reach an agreement, just having a chance to talk helped us avoid escalation of our conflict. Thank you so much to our mediators for listening. 
North Star Youth Court	96060		/users/profile/111795	Domenik D.	Volunteer	5	08/19/2011	I worked with this program for five years and loved every minute of it.  An incredible organization that focuses on helping the youth in our society.  I love the feeling of doing something useful with my time that makes me want to do something other than play video games all day. The program really offers something to do and a reason to do it. 
North Star Youth Court	95655		/users/profile/111121	msmomma31	Volunteer	5	08/13/2011	It was so easy and such a pleasure to support the North Star Youth Court of Fairbanks during my stay in Fairbanks, Alaska.  My son has been active in the North Star Youth Court of Fairbanks, Alaska for over a year.  This program is outstanding!  The staff, Angela and Denise are awesome people who demands independence and proactive engagement from the students.  The foundation that the children who volunteers in the program receives is priceless.  I am moving to Anchorage, Alaska and only hope for a well-organized and helpful program like the one in Fairbanks.  
North Star Youth Court	94773		/users/profile/109707	emily	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2011	I am working on starting a peer court in Georgia, and I grew up in Alaska, so I contacted North Star to get information about their operations.  I spoke with Denise and Angela, who were helpful and supportive.  They offered recommendations and shared some of the problems they have faced and how they overcame those problems.  I appreciate them taking time out of their day to share their expertise with me!
North Star Youth Court	90454	1	/users/profile/103169	Kelly Q	Volunteer	5	06/11/2011	With my family being involved in the justice system, my mother thought it would be a great idea for me to try Youth Court... and that is how I got here three years ago. Starting out as an attorney fresh out of the bar class, I was scared! But luckily, the class I had just taken prepared me for everything, just like the senior attorneys helped. Once I became more involved, I saw just how many activities Youth Court participated in in the community, and how much influence we have on teenagers. I specifically saw this when I became a judge, and being in charge of deciding these mis- guided teens' futures. Youth Court, specifically North Star Youth Court, is a unique opportunity in which everyone involved can benefit.  It is a fantastic option for teens who made a one time mistake, and to be helped by their peers. For those of us on this side of the law, North Star Youth Court is not only a place where we can delve into the practice of law, and help the community, while nurturing out peers, but it also gives us a great small community in which we can be serious, or laugh. All in all, North Star Youth Court is a fabulous opportunity, and a dynamic influence on all people who are involved.
North Star Youth Court	59637		/users/profile/64534	Jessica	Volunteer	3	01/07/2011	I have been in Youth Court for over two years now and I love it. I actually found Youth Court through a friend and begged my mom to let me join. I love helping people and that is what Youth Court is all about.
North Star Youth Court	59514		/users/profile/64324	Daniel P.	Volunteer	5	01/06/2011	I first came across Youth Court when...well actually, my mom came across it. I took the training, thinking it was just a chance to learn more about law. Little did I know it was an organisation that dealt with youth crime. To say that I dove in head first would be a drastic overstatement. But, when I got it into my head that not every case is a trial, then I began to be more involved. And here I am now, much smarter because of Youth Court.
North Star Youth Court	59371		/users/profile/64070	Anne Marie Brainerd	Board Member	5	01/03/2011	North Star Youth Court (NSYC) truly is an exceptional organization.  As a former Board member, it was my honor to assist in decisions that fostered a program that empowers youth from all social strata while teaching respect for the law and positive citizenship.  As the parent of a young man who volunteered with Youth Court, I was able to witness first-hand the positive impact on responsibility, public speaking abilities, and overall self-confidence this program instills.  In essence, this organization quite literally helps to develop our next generation of youth leaders.  It is an outstanding asset to our community!
North Star Youth Court	58843		/users/profile/62985	ericenlow	Board Member	4	12/15/2010	I have been in youth court for two years now.  I have served as both defense and prosecuting attorney.  I feel that the people involved with youth court really take time to help those in need.  I enjoy the hard work that every day people, mostly teenagers  like myself, put into this organization.  I have seen young people grow and have watched what others have done with their choices.   Youth court has allowed me to learn lessons from other people's experience as well as help others in a fun and productive way.  I enjoy working with this program and am proud to have met such hard working and honest people.
North Star Youth Court	58840		/users/profile/62979	TerinAurora	Volunteer	5	12/15/2010	North Star Youth Court and Mediation is a phenomenal community organization, and I am proud to have been volunteering with them since January 2006.  I grew up in North Pole and Fairbanks, Alaska, and partied quite hard from a young age.  I experienced numerous problem incidents, unwanted sexual encounters, and barely escaped death from alcohol before I finally quit drinking in July 2004.  As NSYC developed their Alcohol Awareness Class for first-time offending minors charged with MCA or possession, they asked me to be the class's guest speaker.  Since this organization seeks to inform, educate and empower young offenders rather than talk down to them or berate them, NSYC figured the students would likely relate to my experiences, feel comfortable enough to ask tough questions, and hopefully learn vicariously through me.  They also structure the class to be as educational and fun as such a class can be, led by youth volunteers who are committed to helping their peers.  From the students' immediate reactions to my story, positive class evaluations, and a number of students who have personally contacted me after classes, I am confident this Alcohol Awareness Class is providing an extremely positive alternative to sending youth offenders through the sometimes imposing and often expensive District Court and Juvenile Justice systems. As my involvement with NSYC continued, my passion for the organization deepened.  I truly believe in the mission of NSYC&M, and I greatly appreciate its commitment to so many levels of our community:  youth offenders, youth and adult volunteers, and the betterment of our community as a whole.  NSYC&M realizes that restorative justice, educating and empowering people who have made mistakes, and promoting community service and youth leadership leads to a healthier community where youth encourage their peers to make positive choices, hold themselves accountable, and have a higher code of responsibility.  Past youth volunteers have become nurses, politicians, teachers and community activists.  Past youth offenders have become volunteers within NSYC--or chosen to share their stories with others to help them learn lessons vicariously.  Fairbanks has seen a lowered rate of youth recidivism.  I have witnessed a society of youth that seeks knowledge and wants to make informed decisions rather than feel peer pressured or blindly choose to drink at the young ages that my peers did. North Star Youth Court is an example of an ideal nonprofit organization that is truly committed to its community.  I wholeheartedly support and promote this organization--and am even trying to become an official board of directors member this month (December 2010)!

Kenai Watershed Forum	297770		/users/profile/388584	Writer	Board Member	5	07/22/2016	The Kenai River Wareshed Forum is an exemplary organization! Their dedication to education of the Kenai River and it's watershed is critical to its preservation and future health.
Kenai Watershed Forum	88281		/users/profile/99228	Lauren J.	Volunteer	5	05/02/2011	We're so lucky to have the Kenai Watershed Forum working to protect, preserve and restore the watersheds in our area. In addition to the "science" work that KWF does (monitoring water quality, habitat restoration, etc), they also host or participate in several community events that are geared towards reaching out the the public to raise awareness.  The Kenai Riverfest is one of the highlights of summer in our area. It's important to reach out to the community for support - and KWF does an excellent job of that. 
Kenai Watershed Forum	87082		/users/profile/97661	Merrill	Volunteer	5	04/25/2011	What a priviledge for a community to have an organization that delivers such positive results from habitat restoration, to invasive plant to environmental education.  An organization that delivers on the dream of having Government agencies, private property owners, environmentalists, regulators, educators and youth working together to solve environmental challenges and improve everyone's, including the wildlife's quality of life.  Specifically having the Kenai River removed from the threatened catagory in less that a year's time.  Administering the Caring for the Kenai environmental awareness contest and sponsoring The Kenai River Festival as a community celebration of the river with opportunity to learn how to preserve it.
Kenai Watershed Forum	86842		/users/profile/97337	Elizabeth J	Volunteer	5	04/22/2011	The Kenai Watershed Forum is a fantastic organization truly committed to achieving their goal of a healthy watershed through cooperation with the community.  The staff are energetic and have a real dedication to the work they do.   They are a team with diverse technical skills which complement each other nicely.  They also achieve a lot and are well respected within the community.  While environmental topics can often be divisive, KWF does a commendable job at bringing all parties to the table and coming away with a robust solution that everyone is happy with.  They are also particularly good at being a resource for learning within the community.  It would be hard to find another organization as well respected and as dedicated to the community in which they serve as the Kenai Watershed Forum.  
Kenai Watershed Forum	86660		/users/profile/97085	Ed O.	General Member of the Public	5	04/21/2011	The Kenai Watershed Forum is a wonderful organization providing excellent services to the residents and visitors of the Kenai Peninsula. They are very skilled at bringing all sides of an issue to the table to solve conservation challenges facing our area. I commend them on their work and enjoy supporting the organization. We all agree our watersheds need to be preserved for future generations and the vitality of the area - KWF is doing a great job on this front! 
Kenai Watershed Forum	86659		/users/profile/97084	Joe C.	Volunteer	5	04/21/2011	The Kenai Watershed Forum is an outstanding organization with an incredible knack for working cooperatively with a diverse group of interests. In a community in which divisions between different interests such as commercial and sport fishermen can be quite bitter, virtually everyone can come together agree that the KWF does good work. All of the staff, but especially Robert, the director, are adept at listening to and understanding the needs of the community. The entire organization then, works together well to resolve big problems with impacts on the community. For instance, by explaining to boaters on the Kenai River how  hydrocarbons detrimentally hurt river health for everyone, regulations were passed on two-stroke engines and the river was cleaned up.
Kenai Watershed Forum	86652		/users/profile/97077	Lisa Parker	Volunteer	5	04/21/2011	The Kenai Watershed Forum is a wonderful organization serving the community, working with students and local businesses for the betterment of the watershed.   I have never seen the organization look at a project and say no - they ask the question how can we get it done.  I approached them ten years ago to help implement an educational awareness program.  They not only said yes but have helped to grow and improve the program.  Kenai Watershed Forum should serve as a mentor for all non-profit organizations.  They are my heros!
Kenai Watershed Forum	57371		/users/profile/60579	Kristy M	Board Member	5	11/18/2010	This organization is great for our local community and for the bigger environment.  I'm very impressed with the staff:  they are dedicated to working together with the community, rather than fighting against it.  I also am 100% behind their strategies:  opening-up habitat, collecting quality research, and educating our communities.  This focus has driven the organization towards projects that improve our surroundings the most.It's wonderful to have an environmental organization like the Watershed Forum in the Kenai Peninsula.
Brave Heart Volunteers	177495	2	/users/profile/234055	Joy2019	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	Aside from a few times in high school I never volunteered my time to any organizations. However, this year I found Brave Heart and decided that this was an organization that I wanted to get involved with.  I felt compelled by the mission statement and what Brave Heart stands for, so I took the plunge and became a volunteer! Since then, I have never looked back! I wish I was involved sooner as I really look forward to my weekly visits and the time I spend with some of the elderly residents within the community. I can really see how much the visits mean to them, and that alone makes me so proud to be apart of such a wonderful organization. Thanks BHV! 
Brave Heart Volunteers	176967	1	/users/profile/233426	jagibson15	Volunteer	5	10/11/2013	I ask myself the question "if something happens, would I know what to do?" My parents are getting older, there has been a couple scares... what are the things I need to know or start thinking about if, god forbid, their situations get worse? That was the fuel for becoming a Volunteer at Brave Heart Volunteers. The more experience I have with elder care, the more prepared I will be when it become applicable to my family.  At first, I was apprehensive about the amount of training I would be put through. I assumed it was going to be boring. It wasn't. There were discussions, a volunteer panel, experts in the industry. The amount of knowledge I gained just from the training was invaluable. They really prepare you for and get your questions answered before you know you have one. I feel I know more about what to do now, then ever before. I also feel that when I do have future questions, or want to learn more about elder-care, they have the resources and other trainings in place where I can keep learning about what to do.
Brave Heart Volunteers	176586	2	/users/profile/233007	mystik	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	I sat with a bed-ridden lady every Thursday afternoon for 4 years, when she passed.  I think I got more out of the experience than she did.  BHV trainings gave me a sound understanding of how to help and be present with the people I am serving.
Brave Heart Volunteers	176572	1	/users/profile/232994	akwj	Client Served	5	10/10/2013	I attended the Brave Heart Volunteers End of Life Education and Training program and found it to be invaluable.  As a nurse, I have used the information I have learned both in the professional setting as well as personally.  I learned about so much from this 30 hour training that was led by professionals from all backgrounds including doctors, therapists, professors and many others, it is hard to believe that this training is offered free of charge every year.  
Brave Heart Volunteers	176561	1	/users/profile/232983	SS91	Client Served	5	10/10/2013	I recently received grief support services through Brave Heart Volunteers' licensed counselor to help support a close friend who lost someone. Learning about the grieving process and learning about things I can do to help her has made me feel comfortable in helping her through this process. I also felt supported by Brave Heart Volunteers during the whole process and am grateful I have them as a resource. 
Brave Heart Volunteers	156440	1	/users/profile/207514	Ttay112	Client Served	5	04/26/2013	I would say that I am right in the middle of a condition that could go either way - and Brave Heart definitely pulled me over to the healthy side; they helped get me going again. I've been 90% homebound since 2006 and maybe it does add up, but I had observed another Veteran with health issues get visited by church folks and I thought it looked like a good idea.  When I heard about Brave Heart, I asked for weekly home visits.   The first one was real tough.  The meeting and talking were fine as it was centered on hot coffee, the weather and how unique AK is - but afterwards, I was exhausted.  I had to lay in bed for 2-3 hours completely still.  It was very disruptive to my own management of my condition which only I know how to do. Well, I recovered quickly and after the next visit, I only laid down for about an hour.  And then for every visit afterward, I was usually out-the-door walking at least a few blocks through the neighborhood to clear my mind.   The visits had worked and for the rest of the 12 months, they were quite normal and there were times when I was listening to the volunteer's stories.  This is in fact what I enjoyed - the give and take about the sometimes comical nature of daily living and the funny things that can happen.  We were connecting. Throughout the months, I started my own activities including online classes and learning how to walk through Sitka while always listening to Nature.  It's a quiet, peaceful place and taking an hour to have coffee with someone else fits in well. Overall, I improved.  Pretty much in every category of health, energy and mind.  The visits help.  I do in fact recommend them.  If I move back to SE Alaska, I'll sign up again.  I guess I miss my visits now and I wish the Volunteer and the folks at Brave Heart best wishes.  Thanks.
Brave Heart Volunteers	154448		/users/profile/205276	bon59	Volunteer	5	04/12/2013	In 2010-11 I had the privilege of serving as an AmeriCorps Volunteer with Brave Heart Volunteers in Sitka, Alaska.  BHV offers services to people facing illness, isolation, and grief.  There are also volunteers especially trained to give support at the end of life.  In Sitka there is no hospice program, but through BHV and their care giving partners, all the elements of hospice care are provided.  Having volunteered with the elderly for over forty years, I was impressed with the quality of care that is available for the aging population in this small community.   The collaboration between BHV and other care giving agencies in Sitka is one of the community's greatest strengths.  During the last month of my service at BHV I spent much of my time introducing our new Volunteer Coordinator to our care receivers and volunteers.  It was a wonderful opportunity for me to see firsthand what BHV does best.  Some long term relationships date back over 8 years, starting when the care receiver was living at home and continuing at the Pioneer Home.  There are many intergenerational relationships between care receivers, volunteers, and their children and grandchildren.  These relationships between volunteers and care receivers and their families are at the heart of everything that Brave Heart Volunteers does.  I believe that this is what makes Brave Heart Volunteers unique.  And it's what I would want if I needed respite from caring for a loved one or if I needed someone to sit by my bedside at the end of my life.
Armed Services Ymca Of The Usa	33952	1	/users/profile/34767	keith1	Board Member	5	03/25/2010	I got involved with the Armed Services YMCA of Alaska in 2007 while trying to create a fishing tournament that would take returning Combat Veterans fishing for a day out of Seward Alaska. In the process of trying to get information out of the Military Bases about how many people they would be able to make available, I was directed to the ASYMCA to use as a liaison. After that first very successfull year I have partnered up with the ASYMCA and continue to take upwards of 400 returning Combat Veterans fishing each year. I was asked to be a board member in 2009 and was very happy to accept, I am involved in several non-profits but none that make me as proud as the ASYMCA of Alaska.

They offer an array of wonderful programs/services to include: school supply drives, summer camps, before/after school care, kid olympics, healthy kids day, holiday hearts, baby bundles, operation hero, operation kid comfort, fitness classes, craft classes, classy closet, mother daughter tea, etc... The staff is extremely supportive, helpful, and passionate about providing support to Soldiers and Families.  This is a busy branch serving an enormous installation expected to grow by over 40,000 in 2011 with a very small staff. If they had the resources to have a bigger staff, I can only imagine what is yet to come!
Law Project For Psychiatric Rights Inc	91552		/users/profile/104508	Maria Mangicaro	General Member of the Public	5	06/21/2011	PsychRights is described as a "public interest law firm whose mission is to mount a  strategic legal campaign against forced psychiatric drugging and electroshock in the United States akin to what Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP mounted in the 40's and 50's on behalf of African American civil rights." Forced electroshock therapy must be stopped.   It is a treatment left over from the dark ages of psychiatry. PsychRights is providing a great service by advocating for human rights of individuals who have been labeled and forced into ineffective, harmful treatment.

PsychRights is irreplaceable and has led the way in activism to improve conditions for those who have been psychiatrically diagnosed, so that they cannot be compelled to take psychiatric drugs. This struggle has become even more compelling now that information about the dangers of these drugs has increasingly (in no small part also due to PsychRights) come to light.

It has also helped people in other states, but not having any lawyers available to bring suits in other states has hampered these efforts.

Alaska Network On Domestic Violence And Sexual Assault Inc	43312	7	/users/profile/44136	chriscom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2010	I have been really impressed by the work the Alaska Network on Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault has done to promote awareness of the problem in our state and to support the 18 shelters in our state. They are there for us to provide advocacy, legal assistance to victims, training, and every level of help to member organizations and victims. I think their work helped our Governor get involved in really addressing the issue in our state this year.

Friends of the Campbell Creek Science Center	131082		/users/profile/176620	Amanda S	Board Member	5	10/30/2012	With a board of 12 dedicated volunteers, no staff and an incredible partnership with the BLM, the Friends of the Campbell Creek Science Center raise thousands of dollars for students to be able to experince the creek, walk through the woods, investigate science and learn ourdoors.

Friends of the Campbell Creek Science Center	35431	8	/users/profile/36262	carla1	Donor	5	04/11/2010	Campbell Creek Science Center provides a wonderful venue and excellent, balanced programming that connects children and families with opportunities to learn about energy and the outdoors.  Two years ago, I attended an outdoor winter activities day at which they partnered with local businesses like REI to provide free use of gear for families who otherwise could not experience some of the great activities available right here in Anchorage. The staff and volunteers work hard to be a great organization making a difference.
Friends of the Campbell Creek Science Center	35143	8	/users/profile/35987	crystal-enkvist	Donor	5	04/08/2010	Alaska Power Association has been a donor to the Friends of the Campbell Creek Science Center and we found it to be a worthwhile use of our limited sponsorship budget. The work of the science center tied into the work we were doing on a project and it was a good match for both non-profit organizations. The center provided maximum recognition for our donation and has provided consistent follow up communications.  I was so impressed with the work of the Friends of the Campbell Creek Science Center and the personal outreach efforts from board members Joette Storm and Mike Hanley that I started taking my family to their events and we become donors, as well.

Interacting with those who bring electronics for recycling is a happy bonus.

Alaska Multiple Sclerosis Center Inc	125916		/users/profile/171062	MelissaRoberts	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I first learned of the AMSC through my childhood friend, who was diagnosed just after we graduated highschool in 1992.  The AMSC has proven to be a wonderful experience for her as well as me.  There is a support group that meets monthly, and the AMSC has many social functions to get MS people together.  There are also exercise programs designed especially for people living with MS. All of this is possible on a very small budget due to active volunteers.  There is also an extensive library with various literature on the nature of MS, how to live with it, and information about the different drugs available to MS patients.  The AMSC gives their clients help and hope for a better way of living with MS.

Afghan Child Project	147718		/users/profile/195435	Aimal	Volunteer	5	01/06/2013	I think that ACP in the leadership of Mr. Will has identified the right priorities to help the deserved Afghan children and women in Afghanistan. I am both one of the volunteers and one of the beneficiaries of the ACP. My son's heath was getting worst and I was totally hopeless to do his proper treatment when ACP supported me. To help others and be supportive, this is what I learnt from Mr. Will. ACP is helping very poor and vulnerable children and women to provide them with health and learning facilities. Thousands of Afghans have been benefited and became the friend of ACP. As an Afghan, I am feeling so proud to be friend and part of ACP in helping thedeserved Afghans. Thanks
Afghan Child Project	147683		/users/profile/195392	bmulligan	Donor	5	01/05/2013	A former 100% scholarship kid, I routinely contribute to the schools that forty years ago gave me a chance at higher education.  But when considering other charities I ask:  --does the charity have personal meaning for me? --does the charity have a competent leader/organization? --is my contribution going to the charitable purpose, rather than to overhead and salaries? and --will my contribution make a difference?  The Afghan Child Project works in a remarkably simple manner.  Donors send winter coats, stuffed animals, medical textbooks, cash donations, whatever, to the ACP and  ACP volunteers in Afghanistan carry  the donations directly to the Afghan women and children.  There are no organizational salaries or overhead.  Miscellaneous expenses are paid for by founder Will Sherman from his own pocket.   100% of donors contributions go directly to the health and education of Afghan women and children.  Founder Will Sherman is  an idealist and a visionary who uses the organizational skills of an attorney and the practical intelligence of a pilot to bring his ideals and visions into reality.   I sent a box of medical textbooks to ACP and a month later was e-mailed a photo of medical personnel opening the box and smiling at the textbooks.   I sent a contribution to ACP for a mine-clearing operation and was later e-mailed a photograph of a smiling ACP volunteer sitting on abandoned Russian tank sitting in the middle of the newly-cleared minefield.   It is a delight to check the website and find photos of the founder, Will Sherman, in a bunny suit(!), handing donated stuffed animals in schools and hospitals to delighted Afghan children. ( I wish the Afghan Child Project would send out monthly or quarterly reports to its donors).  I feel a personal link to this charity, and every time theres a report of some new tragedy in Afghanistan I feel good about knowing Im doing at least a little something to help  the ACP make things better for the mothers and children in Afghanistan. 
ALASKA COMMUNITY ACTION ON TOXICS	147146		/users/profile/194326	heather.mccausland	General Member of the Public	5	12/21/2012	I first learned about Alaska Community Action on Toxics (www.akaction.org) from a member of the local Alaska Native village. She told me about their work locally and all the way to the United Nations for environmental health and justice.  This organization is working at many levels for the health of our children. They advocate for safer alternatives to toxic chemicals that are all around us and they even participate in national and international studies to see what chemicals are within us from exposures.  I didn't really expect to find an organization like this in Alaska. I'm glad that I did. They also work from an inspired place for the Yupik people of St. Lawrence Island who are dealing with global contaminants as well as those from abandoned military sites on their island. This organization not only provides training and local jobs for villagers with community based research - they also provide opportunities and human rights training so that the villagers can bring their health concerns to the US Government and to the United Nations. Please support them, I do.
ALASKA COMMUNITY ACTION ON TOXICS	139936	1	/users/profile/186084	Moose Creek	General Member of the Public	5	11/15/2012	Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT) provides scientific information to the community about human health and wellness in an easy-to-understand way.  They are one of the only groups that will visit rural (and often very-remote) Alaskan communities to educate the community, conduct research, and support communities with concerns about toxins to human health.  Additionally they help educate the entire populace of Alaska (urban and rural) with numerous community awareness/education campaigns and educational presentations by nationally-recognized physicians and professionals.  Lastly, ACAT is more than 'just a non-profit' they are a support group for individuals and communities with concerns and questions about human health, they are willing to find answers to questions, and their staff are highly respected and appreciated within the communities ACAT has served. 
Alaskas Healing Hearts	304252	2	/users/profile/395384	MichelleSturgeon	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	Alaska's Healing Hearts,  The name says it all.  The Moments I share are just a glimpse of the good, done with this group:There are many more, and more team members with similar memories. We have served meals to families in the hospital when all odds were against their loved one.We have sat bedside and prayed with a wife holding her infant, as her spouse struggled to live. We arranged paperwork for the children, in the hospital so she did not have to leave his side,we help navigate a broken system of benefits, and we helped the warrior come home.  We moved his furniture and watched his children so they could go to doctor appointments. - We are great full to be a part of his recovery. A family lost their mom, we helped dad with food and meals, clothing and any other resources we could get together. We pulled into the drive way late at night on the ice and snow, incomplete darkness, at -19 temps to deliver the family  food. I put on my ice cleats and gloves and got the job done.  I sat and listened to him for hours. Unsure of anything to say to bring him the least bit of comfort. I braided hair of a little girl that lost her mom. I read the kids a book and said their prayers with them.  I went home, with a little more appreciation for the problems I had.  This summer we crossed paths and he gave me the biggest hug and wiped away tears, as he tried to say thank you. What we do matters, the people we help along the way will never forget that kindness. This summer, I started helping a Veteran care for his farm, I promised him I would be there twice a day as long as it took so he could get better. I showed up one day and rushed him to the hospital, he has not been home since.  After months in ICU with our Sunday visits,  His wishes were to see his horse before he was moved into a long term care facility out of state. I told him if they let me. "I will bring the babies down" a few months latter one Monday morning, I get a call from a social worker, that tells me he will be moved in 2 hours out of state. He wanted to see his Dog, ( That was his best friend) and he Wanted to See the Horse before he left. When I arrived, they came out and told me to hurry, " Hurry we only have a few minutes " When the hospital staff came out with the bed and he was able to see his horse and lay with his dog, time stood still. It was the first time they have seen each other in 5 months. I sat his dog on his bed, and I handed him the lead rope to his gentle giant. The absolute peaceful smile was a perfect moment.  As the transport team came out side, everyone stopped,  nothing was done the entire staff wept; and kinda stood back. He laid there with his Horse,  wind blowing his silver hair in the breeze, tears in his blue eyes and he was able to say goodbye to his best friends. When it was time to go he went into the back of an ambulance headed to the airport with a smile. As they closed the door he gave me a thumbs up and smiled. His Dog and horse, are members of my family.  She sleeps at the foot of my bed, and the horse sings a good morning song every day.  - I will never forget that day, or how this impacted my life. My first snow machine ride ever, was with AHH. I tagged along with another pro-staff volunteer Mike Page to take a group of active duty and Veterans out to lunch in Alaska's Extreme FROZEN back country.  50 miles or so..lolNeedless to say, I instantly gained respect for the Iron Dog and the snow machine sports.When we arrived at our destination, we are all dressed in snow gear with ice on our gloves and one of our Veterans had a hard time getting his boots off. I watched Mike, our team member, instantly get on his knees in the snow and pull the boots off. No hesitation what so ever. That will always have my respect. After we warmed up (Thawed out) it was time to head back and Mike helped our Vet, put his shoes back on, Zipped his coat and started his machine for him.That is one of the amazing team members we have!   We also facilitate some awesome community projects; We have the Wall of Honor at Wal-Mart where we display pictures of those who served our great nation. We cook dinner at the Fisher house monthly giving back to those in need of housing while their families recover or get medical care. The team we work with is always amazing and willing to lend a hand wherever the need might arise.  The stories you hear are probably true, the more impossible they seem the more likely it is to have happened. I honestly feel that there is nothing this team can not accomplish. We have very diverse skill sets of operators that have common bond of giving back to those that have given their service to the greatest military in the world.  Thank you all for everything you do!- Michelle Sturgeon

Children's Surgical Centre	108755		/users/profile/148024	Lexi W.	Volunteer	5	04/02/2012	I worked at the Children's Surgical Centre doing social media and helping out wherever I could.  It is a very special hospital, and the difference they make in the lives of poor Cambodian's is inspirational.  The patients that come in have a wide variety of unusual medical conditions, and most have had debilitating conditions that they have lived with for years until they hear of the CSC.  The Children's Surgical Centre gives free life changing surgery to deserving people that otherwise would have to live with their disabilities and misfortune.  It is a very important hospital that thousands of poor Cambodians count on.  The Children's Surgical Centre is also a teaching hospital of Khmer surgeons and staff.  Surgeons from around the world come and train the surgeons and teach them new techniques.  I would argue that the surgeons here at the CSC are some of the best in Cambodia, they are very talented and humble.  I really enjoyed going into work every day, and I learned a lot.  All the staff are very welcoming and warm, and Dr. Jim and wife  Kanya made me feel at home and part of the team.  The Children's Surgical Centre is run very efficiently and with a low overhead compared to other NGOs.  I will definitely return and continue to support the Children's Surgical Centre.

Homer Community Food Pantry	321099		/users/profile/414295	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/11/2017	In my opinion, no nonprofit in Homer does more with less for so many in need than the Homer Community Food Pantry.    While the Food Pantry distributes food on Mondays, they answer requests for help 7 days a week including assistance in paying heating bills and rent when eviction or shutting off power is eminent.   The Pantry is 100 % volunteer run.  All money received goes to food and services for low income folks in Homer AND the surrounding area.  A donation to the Pantry will go a long way in helping those in need.

INSTITUTE OF THE NORTH	148606		/users/profile/197893	sgwbak	Volunteer	5	01/28/2013	I had the opportunity to intern with the Institute of the North and consider it one of my most valuable experiences.

Love In The Name Of Christ Of The Tanana Valley	80988	1	/users/profile/88465	Alaskasense	Donor	5	03/02/2011	Love, INC is a charity located in Fairbanks, Alaska that assists the most downtrodden and hopeless of our community with everything from meal boxes to gift cards for fuel bills or electrical bills, clothing for school children or baby baskets for new mothers, to babysitting so a single parent can work or go to school to reach for better opportunities.  It is supported by multiple churches in the area, and is currently experiencing an upsurge in requests for assistance.  I strongly support its mission, it is highly effective, and it enjoys a great reputation both among donors/volunteers and those who receive assistance.

JUNEAU ARTS AND HUMANITIES COUNCIL	161578	1	/users/profile/214320	Pua Maunu	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2013	Juneau is a community with many creative artists.  The Juneau Arts and Humanities Council (JAHC)also associated with the Juneau Arts and Culture Center (JACC) serves all aspects of the community, with an art gallery, music, dance, and many community events inlcuding a community market that helps small businesses, like a rhubarb ice cream, or fresh baked bread, or home made jams made from wild berries and its largest fundraiser, the Wearable Art event which sells out every year.  Money from events are turned around to support the community form of art scholarships and sponsorship  to bring a variety of arts events into Juneau and support for the arts.  This truly is a community inspired.  Its website is also a clearinghouse for knowing of any kind of community and art events going on in the community.  We couldn't have a better arts organization that truly answers to all aspects of the arts in Juneau.  And incredibly, it has a very small staff, supported by many volunteers.  Its amazing.  Juneau would not be the same place without JAHC and the JACC!

Alaska Legal Services Corporation	287004		/users/profile/377076	Libby_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Alaska Legal Services and Civil Legal Aid: When Time Means More Than MoneyTheres an old clich that time is money, and nowhere is that saying more apt than in the American legal system, where access to justice so often depends on a persons financial resources.Thats why I support Alaska Legal Services by donating my time as a volunteer attorney. Alaska Legal Services is a fantastic civil legal aid organization that gave me my first introduction to Alaska's legal community more than a decade ago. The lawyers who work there have relinquished higher-paying jobs and dedicated their careers to ensuring that the civil justice system is accessible to all Alaskans, regardless of their income. Alaska Legal Services advocates tirelessly for its clients to ensure that they dont lose custody of their children, get evicted from their homes, or become the victims of predatory lending practices simply because theyre poor. There are innumerable problems that correlate directly with poverty, but because of Alaska Legal Services, substandard access to justice isnt always one of them. I dont work for Alaska Legal Services, but Ive occasionally taken their cases as a form of volunteer support. Putting my time, energy, and expertise as a lawyer into a court case is more meaningful than writing a check, because it creates memorable relationships with clients and achieves visible, concrete, and direct results. Through Alaska Legal Services, Ive helped a same-sex couple dissolve their partnership; a teenager retrieve a large sum of money she was owed from her estranged father; and numerous couples secure fair divisions of property and custody of their children in divorce and custody cases.I feel a moral obligation to do this work, because in my view, good representation in the legal system is like good healthcare in the health care system: It shouldn't be for sale. Or at least, it should be available to everyone on equal footing. After all, justice in America is a public rightnot a private commodity.  When I volunteer for Alaska Legal Services, my time is worth more than money: Its worth greater equity and access to a core branch of our democracy.  And you cant put a price tag on that.
Kenai Peninsula Fair Association	237215		/users/profile/321639	alcancowgirl	Board Member	5	01/23/2015	I have always loved this fair, long before I was ever involved with it. After my children attended several 4H and Pony Club horse camps at the Fairgrounds I realized how much this facility was giving to those non-profits and was providing such a wonderful place for the kids. I wanted to get more involved. I had no idea how many things were provided to so many groups of families from this one facility. After being involved and on the board for a few years, I am even more amazed. The Fairs Executive Director is very community and civic minded and has a passion for kids. She contaminates the fair board with her spirit of giving :) We try very hard to do better every year. We are constantly changing and evolving trying to be the best we can be. I truly believe we are better every year!
Tanana Chiefs Conference	3214	1	/users/profile/4919	theresa_krebs	Volunteer	4	04/02/2009	I became acquainted with Alaska's Tanana Valley at the age of 15, in 1992, as a member of World Horizons, a sort of "junior peace corps" for teenagers. I went back in the summer of 2007 and interned at another Fairbanks nonprofit, the Cultural Heritage and Education Institute. There, I tried to pull together an institutional collaboration with several local stakeholders, an effort that was unsuccessful due to a lack of overall resources, a charged political atmosphere, and a lack of trust or proven track record specifically with respect to one of the entities involved - me, the outsider in Indian Country, and the tiny one-man nonprofit that I interned for. Throughout that process, as I approached the Tanana Chiefs Conference and made my pitch, I was struck by how constructive their perspective was.I admire the Tanana Chiefs Conference for its organizational effectiveness in the Fairbanks community. From my vantage point, they are totally above board. Their staff carry out their mission with only the best of intentions for individuals, stakeholders, and the community at large. While that may sound obvious and easily taken for granted, Fairbanks is a complex environment and it can be very difficult to hold institutional collaborations together. In this environment, the Tanana Chiefs Conference has earned a reputation as a solid Partner, and an internally supportive place to work.And let's not forget impact. Their service to the community is fantastic from my perspective. Most of what they do is social, but there's also a huge and positive environmental impact. For example, they have their own GIS shop. And, they promote a sustainable value system.My only criticism relates to capacity, and it's more an understanding and a recognition than a true criticism. As wonderful a Partner as the Tanana Chiefs Conference can be, they are rarely in a position to say "yes" to an external initiative or new partnership. Most of their priorities are internal - they prioritize their core services and the existing demands on their infrastructure, and there seems to be little in the way of discretionary resources. Surely there's funding out there that would help them do more? Because they do it so well, and it's a shame that they're maxed out for lack of additional resources. Makes me wonder what other financing mechanisms might be available, particularly on the environmental side of things. All it takes is 10% of their existing capacity - just that amount would allow them to do more. Perhaps an organization that has a strong cross-cultural effectiveness and some credibility in this area could step in? Also, I wonder what is out there in the way of resources ranging from consulting to leadership retreats to training that would help them do more with what they already have, and do it even more effectively.

Alaska Raptor Rehabilitation Center Inc Arrc	122124		/users/profile/166286	eadeacon	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2012	After arriving in Sitka, Alaska on a private vessel we found ourselves wandering through downtown, and then through the nearby Sitka National Historic Park and Trails.  We overheard fellow walkers talk about the Alaska Raptor Rehabilitation Center and learned it was nearby.  What an unbelievable facility and unforgettable experience!  A volunteer-run organization, the Alaska Raptor Centre (ARC) has become Alaska's foremost bald eagle hospital and educational center.  Providing medical and rehabilitation services for injured raptors; education to the public about Alaska's birds and environmental conservation; and conducting Bald eagle research;  ARC is a most impressive and remarkable 17-acre operation.  Bordering the Tongass National Forest and the Indian River in Sitka it features award-winning natural habitats for its 15+ Raptors-in-residence.  We're very proud to donate to this organization and strongly encourage everyone to visit and learn about these incredible birds when visiting Southeast Alaska!

I have confidence that this organization will continue to meet the growing demands placed upon it through wise administration, creative solutions, and effective planning.

When you lose your job and then your home; it is a safe haven with warmth and food. 
Kitty And K-9 Connection - - A New Leash On Life	220636	1	/users/profile/284307	MyJet	Client Served	5	10/07/2014	KKC helped connect me with two of the most perfect companions I could ever have hoped for.  I was impressed by the care they took in matching me to the right pets in order to ensure a successful adoption AND the follow-up contact I received. They take rescues mainly from Animal Control, get them the medical care they need, then foster them in the homes of their volunteers.  The adoption fee was very reasonable considering it covers all shots, spay/neuter, microchip & Municipality registration for 1 year.  They DON'T charge for all the other medical care they give each rescue (dentals, surgeries, medications, grooming, etc.).Kitty & K-9 Connection is a small rescue organization compared to some of the better known groups, but they really focus on quality rather than quantity in rehoming abused, neglected and abandoned dogs and cats.
ALASKA WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL	158900	1	/users/profile/210926	Rod Finkle	Advisor	5	05/28/2013	In my many years of association with Alaska World Affairs Council I have seen and participated in many of the Council's weekly programs.  The programs really "Bring the World to Alaska."  Guests and members alike come from all age groups and professions to hear personally what guest speakers discuss on a broad range of international and national topics.  The Council has developed a strong and widely accepted student participation program and most of the schools in the Anchorage School District participate. The Council's World Quest competitions have been outstanding and produced some very knowledge winners.  The goals of the Council incorporate both learning and listening to the world around us.  The speaker's list has been impressive and has included presidents from other countries, ambassadors, politicians, successful business leaders all highly qualified in their professions or area of expertise.  The Council itself is an active enthusiastic group of residients who truly believe in what they do.  And what they do as volunteers is energic, active and meaningful in producing one of the best World Affairs programs in the U.S. This Council is a major non-profit player in our community and contributes greatly to expanding knowledge and the quality of life.
Alaska Society For Prevention Of Cruelty To Animals	302267		/users/profile/393109	akpets907	Client Served	5	09/01/2016	When my mama cat found herself in dire need of getting spayed I found myself in dire straights financially. The Alaska SPCA Vet Clinic were there to my rescue. They have great caring staff members who helped me get my cat spayed & vaccinated at the most affordable fees anywhere. They were able to direct me to another organization who helped me obtain a partial payment voucher to assist in the overall cost. My cat received excellent care and is now a happy healthy feline. Thank you Alaska SPCA for being there for us!
Alaska Assistance Dogs	153057	2	/users/profile/203911	thatonecrazydoglady	Volunteer	5	04/07/2013	AAD has been a asset to this community. Not just for the clients with dogs, but for the parents and children in their therapeutic programs of which the majority are benefiting families that have special needs children. The kids who feel like their disabilities prevent them from doing normal everyday things start working with these dog and begin to realize that there is nothing they can't do. AAD is truly a blessing to this state and I can't say enough good things about them. They continue to amaze me with their life changing work everyday. I constantly hear parents raving about the wonderful changes in their kids after going through their Therapeutic Training Programs. Special needs kids work with these amazing dogs until they are ready to be handed off to a disabled Alaskan in need. It's a win-win all around, not to mention their credentials. They are one of the very few service dog organizations that has the appropriate experience and education background in this line of work. They have a great relationship with the businesses of the community and share knowledge about service dogs.  A therapist oversees the therapeutic programs and all of their contracted trainers are certified through Bergin University of Canine Studies.  I cannot recommend this group further. Please donate and support this great organization.

Tba Theatre Inc	5967	10	/users/profile/7769	Bill Cotton	Volunteer	5	07/02/2009	I have been involved with TBA Theatre for probably 10 years. I drove my kids to participate in plays there and eventually acted in several myself. I have also been a stage manager in several shows and have made a donation to TBA for several years.TBA does great theater involving kids. But this isn't what I generally consider kids theater. Shows usually include very talented and experience adults (and kids who have acted for years). The quality of the shows are truely excellent.More important, TBA fosters a supportive and caring attitude for kids and adults alike. My children have benefied more than I can describe from their experiences there.I would highly recommend TBA Theatre to anyone. (I am the Managing Director of another theater company in Anchorage, Anchorage COmmunity Theatre.)
Anchorage Cooperative Preschool Inc	53278		/users/profile/54362	nutsenmai	Volunteer	5	09/24/2010	ACP has been such an inclusive environment during my short time there so far.

Little Bears Playhouse	198489		/users/profile/259203	Girdwood.Tennis	Volunteer	5	04/21/2014	Friends of Girdwood Tennis Courts recognize the importance this non-profit plays in raising healthy children in our community. The "Little Bears" play daily on the tennis courts adjacent to their daycare facility. Unfortunately 30 years of neglect have left these courts in total disrepair with major sink holes, frost heaves and extensive cracking. Once a great place for kids to ride trikes and learn to ride bikes or skate, this public facilities poor state of disrepair makes playing in this space a challenge. We support Little Bears need for safe and secure places for kids to exercise outdoors and hope that our combined efforts will help achieve our common goal of repairing the valuable public facility so kids of Girdwood can again play here safely.
