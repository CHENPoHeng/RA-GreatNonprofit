Hugs Project Incorporated	304118		/users/profile/395289	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	I love working with the Hugs Project. I enjoy hearing the stories of the men and women who receive the packages and how much they love the items in them. The Hugs Project uses everything that is donated to them. This is a great organization made up entirely of volunteers who work from the heart, not for a paycheck.
Hugs Project Incorporated	293930	3	/users/profile/176047	Sherri B.	Volunteer	5	06/26/2016	I started volunteering for The Hugs Project in 2006. This year we assembled care packages to send to the troops! It is a very organized and fun group to be a part of!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	130576	2	/users/profile/176047	Sherri B.	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	In 2006, when my son joined the Army National Guard, I started looking for an organization for which I could actually do something based around my work schedule. I came across The Hugs Project and the pattern for the "hugs" (cool ties). Since I can sew, I knew this was the organization for me! I could make these on my own time and then simply ship the "hug" to them.That was 6 years ago and I am still doing it, despite being remarried (to a former Navy member) and moving out of state!  I love this organization!!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	292299	2	/users/profile/34265	sherrile	Volunteer	5	06/06/2016	There is no stronger support group for our troops and veterans than the Hugs Project!  I have volunteered in various capacities for years and have learned that no donations are wasted.  All money goes to our troops.  Karen, Ray, and all the loyal volunteers love our military, and it shows in all that they have done and continue to do for our service members.  You may help support this fine organization no matter your age or your financial standing.  Everyone can have a part in uplifting and encouraging our troops by investing your time, talents, &/or treasures.
Hugs Project Incorporated	255986	4	/users/profile/34265	sherrile	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	The Hugs Project has faithfully supported our deployed troops for years and now they also aid those who have returned with brain injury/PTSD by helping them secure Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.  Fantastic group - best return for donations of money and time that I have seen! 
Hugs Project Incorporated	33468	2	/users/profile/34265	sherrile	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	For about 5 years I have been privileged to serve with the wonderful men and women at The Hugs Project by helping organize some of their Christmas pack projects and by assisting in whatever manner might be needed. Currently I facilitate the recycling of used cell phones and ink cartridges for money to assist with postage and supply needs. My church's military support ministry works cooperatively with The Hugs Project in several ways, and we have involved all ages in our church from children as young as two through our senior citizens.   Karen's assistance to our ministry has been invaluable as has her cooperation with countless other military support groups. Her goal is always to show America's finest young men and women that we care for them and appreciate what they are doing for us back home and for the people in the countries they serve.
Hugs Project Incorporated	291210	3	/users/profile/381594	Julie259	Volunteer	5	05/27/2016	This is a great organization. All donations go to help the troops. No one earns a salary! My mom and I have made cookies, hugs, bracelets, dog leashes and so many other things. We've also collected donations like soap, shampoo, coffee, tea, condiments. This organization has helped me help our men and women serving this great country. I've been a volunteer for many years and plan to continue for many more. Everyone who works there makes you feel loved and respected.Hearing the stories from the men and women who receive the care packages and how much we are helping them feel appreciated makes it all worthwhile. You couldn't ask for a better organization to help. Everything that comes in is used in someway to further the cause. Volunteer or donate today!
Hugs Project Incorporated	289184	2	/users/profile/344710	Diana92	Donor	5	05/09/2016	The Hugs Project is a truly unique nonprofit, benefitting troops and their families and also volunteers who become friends through working with this group.   There are no words for those who lead this nonprofit, for their dedication and loyalty to the troops, and their willingness to donate time, time, and more time.     Oklahoma City is a better place because of The Hugs Project.   
Hugs Project Incorporated	256310	3	/users/profile/344710	Diana92	Donor	5	09/10/2015	The Hugs Project is a super non-profit with a great, dedicated group of volunteers. I am so proud to have The Hugs Project as a local group to which we can donate.  What a special service this organization offers to our troops and veterans.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	289175	2	/users/profile/120643	Debra N.	Donor	5	05/09/2016	I personally know The Hugs Project and what they do for our military men and women.  My Mom and I have donated food items and fabric and sewn for The Hugs Project for our men and women.  This organization LOVES our military and goes above and beyond.  I will continue to do whatever I can to support them.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	136356	2	/users/profile/120643	Debra N.	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I have been a member of The Hugs Project Oklahoma City for the past few years.  Due to health problems, I have not been able to participate except through donations of fabric to make Cool Ties (Hugs) and other items to put in the Care Packages to send to our Military men and women.  When I had family members serving overseas, The Hugs Project made sure they received a Care Package.  They work very hard and are very dedicated to our Military men and women.
Hugs Project Incorporated	99722	3	/users/profile/120643	Debra N.	Donor	5	10/25/2011	Although I am not physically able to volunteer at The Hugs Project, my Mother and I donate fabric to this organization.  I have also gotten donations of tooth brushes, tooth paste and dental floss from my dentist.  I have family members who have donated their time.  My daughter is an Extreme Couponer and has donated hygiene items, non-perishable food items.  Our family LOVES our military men and women and The Hugs Project is a remarkable organization.  God Bless America and this organization for their hard work.
Hugs Project Incorporated	288568	1	/users/profile/353006	Angie62	Volunteer	5	05/05/2016	As a 4-H leader, I am constantly searching for community service projects for the kids to participate in.  Karen and Ray Stark are such sweet people who work with the kids and never let us leave without Karen visiting with them about her 4-H career.  Coming from a military family, I am more than eager to support our service men and women.  It gives me pride to know that a box we packed was sent and received by very grateful military personnel.  I know that a small gesture on our part helped make a person far from home a little bit brighter!  I highly recommend everyone to take a few hours to volunteer at The Hugs Project in support of our military!
Hugs Project Incorporated	264292	4	/users/profile/353006	Angie62	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	I have been working with the Hugs Project & Karen Stark for years through my 4-H Club.  She never fails to tell her story to the members and it just seems to hit home with many of them!  Being able to send a little bit of love from home to our men and women stationed so far from home is the least we can do!  The Hugs Project in Oklahoma is a wonderful organization that never says "no"!  Through the countless hours and volunteers, Karen tries to ensure that every Oklahoman stationed abroad has a care package which shows her passion for our military!  The need for care packages are not as many as in the past, but the donors, volunteers and staff continue with the mission.  If you are looking for a great organization to donate to whether, it be monetary; time or products; you will not be turned away!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	288467	2	/users/profile/378663	Jennifer539	Donor	5	05/04/2016	My husband and I donated 144 baseballs to the Hugs Project a couple of years ago - it was great! They tucked one in each of 144 care packages going to Iraq and Afghanistan. We were so glad to be able to help.
Hugs Project Incorporated	288455	3	/users/profile/120750	Donnie W.	Client Served	5	05/04/2016	The Hugs Project supported me and my guys through a couple of tours too.  You cant find a better organization.   They are aces!!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	255583	2	/users/profile/120750	Donnie W.	Client Served	5	09/09/2015	I'm one of the lucky ones who was supported during all three tours in the Middle East.  I can't say enough good things about The Hugs Project.  They are rock stars in my eyes!!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	209903	2	/users/profile/120750	Donnie W.	Client Served	5	08/10/2014	I was deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan and the Hugs Project took care of me and my unit both tours.  You couldn't ask for a better agency.  They really care about all military personnel.  Their boxes are filled to overflowing with all kinds of supplies that are hard to get on the other side of the world.  It's great to have them on our side.
Hugs Project Incorporated	153834	2	/users/profile/120750	Donnie W.	Client Served	5	04/09/2013	Good afternoon! Hello!   I received your care package this afternoon and wanted to make sure you received my "Thank you!"  It was a very welcomed surprise.  We don't get very much mail where we are and this made my day.  I especially love the 550 paracord bracelet.  We hope to get more of these for the members of my command so don't worry, they definitely let us wear them.  I am currently stationed in Afghanistan.  We play board games or read, when we are not on missions.  Missions take up most of my time.   Keeping you guys safe at home isn't easy, but I am proud to do it for you.  Packages like this from home make me know that you appreciate what we do out here. Coming from a small town in Maine I really appreciate the support from all of you. Thank you......everyone.......who helped put this together.   v/r,   Donnie
Hugs Project Incorporated	130573	3	/users/profile/120750	Donnie W.	Client Served	5	10/28/2012	The best thing that can happen to a troop is to receive love and support from the American public.  The Hugs Project goes above and beyond to send us that kind of love.  They let us know they care about us and that they realize where their freedoms come from.  We receive a lot of letters and they were passed around so that they brought a lot of smiles to many, many faces.  Thanks, Hugs Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	99756	4	/users/profile/120750	Donnie W.	Client Served	5	10/25/2011	We got boxes while we were overseas.  The care packages and letters of support make a big difference in our morale.  It's good to know someone cares.
Hugs Project Incorporated	288428	2	/users/profile/120993	John23456	Donor	5	05/04/2016	The Hugs Project supported both my sons through their many deployments.  You can't find a more deserving or worthwhile organization.  Thank you from this dad's heart. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	211509	4	/users/profile/120993	John23456	General Member of the Public	5	08/21/2014	Groups like The Hugs Project really make a difference.  When I was deployed, we lived for mail call.  To get a package from family was great but when you get something from total strangers, it would blow your socks off!!!   Thank you all for caring about a bunch of grunts you will never even meet.  We love the great way you make us feel.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	99794	3	/users/profile/120993	John23456	Volunteer	5	10/27/2011	Worked with these folks at Christmas 2010 when they did 4,000 care packages.  Will work with them again this year and the goal is 4,500 or more.  Good Stuff!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	257261	2	/users/profile/34223	dr-billye	Donor	5	09/15/2015	I've been supporting the Hugs Project for many years.  I love the fact that supporting our troops with care packages is a priority, as well as supporting those troops who have returned home and need help with PTSD (The Hugs Project provides the oxygen for The Patriot Clinics.).   Knowing that my donations are being used so wisely makes giving easy!
Hugs Project Incorporated	128468	2	/users/profile/34223	dr-billye	Board Member	5	10/24/2012	The Hugs Project is a 100% volunteer organization sending care packages to our beloved troops.  No one takes a salary at The Hugs Project, which sends about 100 packages a week and over 5,000 at Christmas.  Each box contains "hugs," cooling neckties, which are hand made (over 1 million have been sent so far) and many items which are hard for our troops to get.  Our troops deserve the thanks of a grateful nation, and The Hugs Project is trying to show our soldiers just how important they are to our freedom!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33419	2	/users/profile/34223	dr-billye	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I've been volunteering with The Hugs Project for about three years.  You will never meet a more dedicated group who work tirelessly for our troops.  No one takes a salary; our headquarters, electricity, and water are donated by Crossroads Mall--almost every dime that is donated to The Hugs Projects goes back into sending care packages or buying materials to make a Hug neck cooler or other supplies.  What an awesome organization!
Hugs Project Incorporated	257193		/users/profile/345602	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/14/2015	We absolutely  love what The Hugs Project  is doing  for our service members! Karen and Ray Stark are the most dedicated people  I  know. They are so welcoming  to anyone  who  wants  to  help. All of the volunteers  I've  met there have amazing  hearts. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	256873	3	/users/profile/34395	grgriffin	Volunteer	5	09/12/2015	We have been sending care packages to deployed troops since 2004.  In recent years we have also begun to provide FREE hyperbaric oxygen treatments  (HBOT) to ALL veterans in conjunction with The Patriot Clinic.  Both of these organizations are 100% volunteer run.   I support both of these charities with my time and money.  These  two groups are the largest donations in my budget.  I am fully confident that every dime they receive is spent to help our brave men and women.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	130506		/users/profile/34395	grgriffin	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	The Hugs Project mails between 50-100 boxes each week full of lifesaving cooling ties  (called Hugs) which can reduce body core temps by 7+ degrees, hygiene supplies,  canned food and beef jerky.   We've sent out 1.4 million hugs, 200,000 "kisses (cooling helmet liners) and more than 462 TONS of care package items in the 8 years since The Hugs Project began.    At Christmas we send out  5,000 Christmas boxes.   In addition to the usual items, each box will contain some homemade goodies.  We believe that every American serving in harm's way deserves the thanks of a grateful nation.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33591	7	/users/profile/34395	grgriffin	Volunteer	5	03/19/2010	I found this group when I was looking for an Eagle Scout project.  I was so impressed that I continued to volunteer with them.
Hugs Project Incorporated	255884		/users/profile/120631	Military Supporter	Client Served	5	09/10/2015	Love what The Hugs Project does for those who remain in harm's way.  Now, they are also working with clinics that treat PTSD and traumatic brain injury with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy.  Good stuff!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	210793	1	/users/profile/120631	Military Supporter	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	I loved volunteering today! Everyone was so Nice and Caring! Definitely coming back to volunteer more!
Hugs Project Incorporated	159705		/users/profile/120631	Military Supporter	Board Member	5	06/05/2013	We love our troops and strive to let them know they are loved and respected.   If you have a loved one or friend who is currently deployed "in harm's way", please send their mailing address to:  TheHugsProject(at)cox.net   
Hugs Project Incorporated	130567		/users/profile/120631	Military Supporter	Board Member	5	10/28/2012	The Hugs Project is dedicated to making sure each and every member of our military feels the love and support from back home.   If anyone has a loved one serving far from home during the holidays, you can send the address to:  TheHugsProject(at)cox.net and they will receive a special care package as a thank you for their service.
Hugs Project Incorporated	99717	5	/users/profile/120631	Military Supporter	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	I've worked with The Hugs Project for 7 1/2 years as a volunteer.  We have no paid staff and our work space is donated.  All donated funds go to help our troops.   We send care packages and cooling ties to troops.  We love and appreciate all our troops and want them to know America has not forgotten them.
Hugs Project Incorporated	255760	1	/users/profile/344144	Susan406	Board Member	5	09/10/2015	I was introduced to The Hugs Project by a coworker five years ago. My husband deployed two times since that meeting and THP sent packages to my husband and everyone that was deployed with them. The boxes they packed were loaded to the top. My husband's group was so amazed at how much they put into the care packages. I was so impressed with THP that I came on board and currently serve as their President. THP is filled with amazing volunteers who have so much love for our troops. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	255690	1	/users/profile/344069	Beth143	Client Served	5	09/09/2015	My son and his Marine buddies benefitted from the Hugs every tour served in Iraq! Knowing people from home care did wonders for lifting their spirits! Thank you for all you do! 
Hugs Project Incorporated	255648	1	/users/profile/344032	susie2012	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2015	Wonderful group that's very caring and has lots of love for soldiers! 
Hugs Project Incorporated	255586	1	/users/profile/178913	Helen16	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2015	My son and his whole bunch of battle buddies knew someone back home cared because of the wonderful volunteers at The Hugs Project.  None of them get paid to do what they do, they just want our troops to be well taken care of and to feel loved.  How can it get any better?  It can't.  Thank you all.
Hugs Project Incorporated	209863	1	/users/profile/178913	Helen16	Volunteer	5	08/10/2014	What THP does to help and support our military members and there families is amazing to say the least.  They certainly get my vote for a top notch nonprofit.
Hugs Project Incorporated	133207		/users/profile/178913	Helen16	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	This group of patriotic folks work without pay to make sure our military's needs are met.  They improve morale regardless of what state or branch the young man or woman is from or with.  Kudos to The Hugs Project,
Hugs Project Incorporated	247056	1	/users/profile/334543	LibraryladyDM	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	I  heard many times of the ladies meeting in a near by town to make cake in a cup to send of to those in service for our country.  Last year I joined the group and what a wonderful event.  We spent the day chatting, laughing and filling mugs.  I then heard how the mugs would travel with one of the ladies to a state south and then on to the service people.  What a wonderful way to say thank you to those giving so much.  The Hugs Project offers a wonderful way for people to give back if even just one cup at a time.  Thank you Hugs Project
Hugs Project Incorporated	243278	3	/users/profile/329976	Steveb54	Donor	5	05/19/2015	I played in a golf tournament yesterday and our foursome was given the opportunity to make a donation to HUGS.  Without hesitation, we kicked in $200.  With a son flying an F-16 in the USAF, I look at all the men and women who serve as family.  This is a small price to pay for the sacrifices these warriors make.  Thank you HUGS.
Hugs Project Incorporated	210783	1	/users/profile/273577	Donnetta L.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/14/2014	I am honored to work with such wonderful people who work extremely hard getting things done for our soldiers in harm way. With the letters and pictures that we get makes us know that what we do give them a little bit of home. Being a Navy wife and a Marine mom (daughter) it make me feel good to be able to do this work.
Hugs Project Incorporated	210736	1	/users/profile/34289	readbooks18	Board Member	5	08/14/2014	I have helped The Hugs Project for 6 years, it is a great organization that helps our troops overseas. I started when my brother was deployed and never left, that one box turned into hundreds of boxes for our troops. I love to read the Thank You notes we get back and how much they appreciate the little things we send. Most of the little things we send, we at home take for granted and don't think about being in the middle of nowhere and not having toothpaste or toothbrush. I love working with the other volunteers! We have a great time and able to support our troops!
Hugs Project Incorporated	130555		/users/profile/34289	readbooks18	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	I went to pack a box for my brother 4 years ago and never left. Everyone is a volunteer and we support all branches of the military. We support our troops year round averaging 50 a week and 5000 at Christmas.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33495	5	/users/profile/34289	readbooks18	Volunteer	5	03/18/2010	I have been with The Hugs Project since last year and have packed boxes for the troops during Christmas. My brother recently returned home from Iraq and received packages from The Hugs Project. This is a great organization supporting our troops overseas, I plan to continue to help in any way I can by volunteering each week.
Hugs Project Incorporated	210732	1	/users/profile/273521	Jo W.	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	I work every Thursday and enjoy working with this dedicated group of people.  We hope the unique and thoughtful items we include show our appreciation to our Service Men and Women how much we appreciate what they do for us.
Hugs Project Incorporated	210527	1	/users/profile/273295	Rob_31	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	One of my customers told me about The Hugs Project just before Christmas, so I took my teenage son to check it out. We found a wonderful group of volunteers, tirelessly organizing and packing and making hand made gifts for our troops. We asked what we could do and next thing we knew the boxes were stacking up. So 3 weeks later when shipping day came we stacked care packages  on pallets 6 feet high, thats a little more than 100 per pallet. There were close to 100 pallets that day being sent all over the world., and that was just the 1st shipment. All done with love from Karen and her organization. I've seen Pics of our troops opening them, and the happiness it brings to them while they are so far from home. The best charity I have volunteered at in a long time.
Hugs Project Incorporated	210504	1	/users/profile/33731	cheryl8	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	This is an absolutely awesome group. All volunteers, so all money donated goes directly to supporting the troops. When my son was deployed to Iraq, they shared packages of love with him and all his buddies. They were a blessing!
Hugs Project Incorporated	159818	1	/users/profile/33731	cheryl8	Volunteer	5	06/06/2013	Loving, generous group.  They sent boxes to my son and his men when he was deployed.. The boxes were carefully planned and thought out.   All the members are wonderful people.
Hugs Project Incorporated	133614		/users/profile/33731	cheryl8	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	The Hugs Project is a group of caring, hard working volunteers. They sent packages to my USMC son when he was in the sand box and just made his day.  They truly "put their money, where their mouth is' when it comes to supporting our young men and women in harm's way.  Working with them defines troop support to a whole new level.
Hugs Project Incorporated	99999	1	/users/profile/33731	cheryl8	Volunteer	5	10/30/2011	this organization absolutely rocks! They work very hard to support our troops and always insure that the very best they can do, they deliver to the troops.  I have known and worked with them since 2005 and never have I been as impressed with the leadership and dedication of a totally volunteer organization such as this one.
Hugs Project Incorporated	32903	1	/users/profile/33731	cheryl8	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	The Hugs Project is an incredible group of volunteers that serve our military men and women. they go beyond the call of duty to see to it that everyone they can reach knows they are appreciated.  I am one of those volunteers and also the parent of a Marine.  You can't imagine how wonderful it makes your deployed loved one feel when he or she receives a token of appreciation from strangers.  The "fall out" from that is that everyone involved - from parents to other volunteers - gets a lift too.  So much is negative in our world and this group makes a heroic effort to let our loved ones deployed in often hostile and abrasive situations, know that there are many out there supporting them and appreciating them.
Hugs Project Incorporated	210445	1	/users/profile/13829	JarheadJustin	Client Served	5	08/13/2014	The Gals in my unit were thrilled anytime we got a box from TheHugsProject.  We never knew what to expect inside.  They sent lots of great food, letters, fun stuff, toe nail polish ( yes, we had some ladies in our group and it's fun to please the girls), games, DVD's, socks, hair gel, etc.   We were never more excited than when we got a HUGS box.  keep up the good work.  We're not all home yet.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	11862	12	/users/profile/13829	JarheadJustin	Client Served	5	10/03/2009	I just want to say THANK YOU to The Hugs Project for making meknow that someone back home loves me and respects the job I've been called upon to do for my county.  They couldn't have a higher rating in my book.  Is 5 as high as I can go?  I want rate them even higher than that.  How about a 100 plus?  Can I do that?LCpl Justin Manford USMC currently deployed
Hugs Project Incorporated	160328	2	/users/profile/90306	tony.sellars	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/11/2013	I have personally worked on projects with Karen and am constantly amazed at what she is abled to do for our service men and women.  The Hugs Project is a beacon of light among nonprofit agencies and a testament to what a simple idea can blossom into.
Hugs Project Incorporated	159731	1	/users/profile/204485	Dorinda M.	Volunteer	5	06/05/2013	I had the wonderful opportunity of working with this group for a few days the first week of December.  I drove from Houston to Oklahoma City just to do what I could do to help.  I met some of the most wonderful people and I cannot tell you what a great group this is, young and old.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	153672	1	/users/profile/204485	Dorinda M.	Volunteer	5	04/09/2013	Been a member for about 4 years, even though it is a sweet long distance relationship.  At 2:00 AM on Friday Dec. 8th 2012 I was instant messaging with Karen at HUGS in OKC, me in Houston, TX.  She said they were sweating bullets packing the planned 5000 care packages out by Dec. 12th.  Went to check the mileage, about 400plus.  By noon Friday the 9th a friend and I were on our way up there in my RV I had just gotten.   I didn't even know how to turn the furnace on in it and that was the 19 degree nights.  We got in late Sat and met the bunch on Sunday and volunteered almost everyday until we had to drive back to Houston on Dec. 12th so we missed postal pickup.  Most rewarding experience I have ever been a part of.  Amazing young and old packing those packages.   They wore me out, best tired I have ever had. Dorinda McKenzie, Houston Texas
Hugs Project Incorporated	159727	2	/users/profile/211901	Linda192	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2013	HUGS is AWESOME!!!! My youngest son was deployed and I signed him and a few of his buddies up to receive Care Packages. When the  packages arrived my son says that everyone gathered around their beds to see what they'd received. They'd grab something out of it and place the rest in the common areas to be shared. One young man had no family to support him and my son said he actually had tears in his eyes as he opened his first package. The young man said that receiving that package let him know that there were people who cared if he were lonely, lost, and scared. He says that his box contained a letter thanking him for his service, praising him for being man enough to make the sacrifices he was making, and sending him prayers. He allowed everyone to read it then, he folded it up and put it in a safe place. To this day, he carried it around in his wallet. It's faded and warn from him rereading it so often but his hands still shake when he shows it to people. But, HUGS didn't stop there. They didn't just "adopt" my son and his buddies, they adopted me as well. Without their love and support I would never have made it through my sons deployment. Mary and Karen checked up on me all the time, asked about my son and his buddies, and they listened to a mother's fears for her child. Without them, I would have never made it through the longest 12 months of my life with my sanity intact.I can't thank HUGS enough for supporting my son, his buddies, and myself during that deployment. Your support made the sacrifices those young men and women made easier and less lonely, and helped ease my fears. Please keep up the good work!!! What you do touches the lives and hearts of many. THANK YOU!!!! And God Bless you all.

Hugs Project Incorporated	133755	2	/users/profile/179506	ghvacteck	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	I was so impressed with this organization that I started a chapter here in western Kentucky. The work that is done by the home group is amazing. A LOT of work and dedication is needed to run a group like this when EVERYONE is a volunteer. Not too hard when someone is getting paid to do the work but much different when it's done 100% with love. There have been MANY of our heroes who have told us the stories of how much it meant to them to get the love and support that goes into every box sent. Even after they come home it sometimes makes a difference. Just knowing someone cares is enough to get you thru a bad day over there. I love our heroes and I love The Hugs Project for doing what they do. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	159712		/users/profile/71834	DrCoffee	Board Member	5	06/05/2013	When I served in the Navy during Desert Shield and Storm, care packages were the best part of ANY day.  That hasn't changed.   We are making a difference in the quality of American lives and it feels good.  Come join us.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65717		/users/profile/71834	DrCoffee	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I've worked with this group for almost 7 years.  We're all volunteers.  No one takes a salary.   I was a lonely sailor onboard the USS Independence in 1990.  I picked an "Any Servicemember" letter out of a stack in the morale office so I know the great feeling support from strangers brings.  I want to pass that on.   Our troops let us know that this project affects the way they look at things.  One young Marine wrote, "You are rocking our world".  Does it get any better? Well, for me it did...the great feeling I got from my Desert Shield pen pal is one reason I asked her to marry me over 18 years ago.  My wife, Karen is the driving force behind The Hugs Project and she's still the love of my life.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	157333	1	/users/profile/208641	Paula32	Donor	5	05/07/2013	This is the best organization that I have worked with because the volunteers are so dedicated towards their cause. I don't think any money goes to "administrative costs" because all the volunteers reach deep into their pockets to pay for their high costs. The military are experiencing reduced supplies and they really deserve so very much. I pray for the service members who are so appreciative of their Hugs boxes and I hope they return safe. I am very grateful to the Hugs group for what they do.
Hugs Project Incorporated	157179		/users/profile/208437	Nellie Willis	Volunteer	5	05/06/2013	I have been associated with the Hugs Project early on, since I don't know when exactly.  I can't even remember where we met, it wasn't at the current Crossroads Mall though.  I've volunteered time, money and talent since I first answered a newspaper article at its early beginnings.  You see I did not know anyone in the military, but after reading the article I was so moved to do something for the troops, might have been Desert Storm.  I haven't been as active as in the beginning because of raising my granddaughter, but have become more so because my granddaughter, age 7, can help as well.  The 2012 Christmas campaign was memorable for her because she colored and wrote messages on the care packages.  She even got a glimpse of her artwork when the local television station aired the event.  She is always asking to go to the Hugs Project so she can help.  Karen and Ray work Hugs Project 24 hours a day with only admiration, respect and love from the troops and members as payment for service.

Hugs Project Incorporated	145445	1	/users/profile/71348	onebzemom	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	If you have read any of the posted reviews, you already know what the HUGs Project is and what they do for the US Military. I have been a "Career Volunteer" my whole life, and this is the one organization that has done/will continue to do, the most good for the most people that I have ever worked with. Non-military sometimes have a hard time understanding the career choice of men and women who have taken on the job of protecting their country. The HUGs Project champions these military members with unquestioning support year round...not just during the holidays (which is when they send out 5,000 packages!) but every day. Each week, 50-75 CARE packages are mailed to troops in all services who are serving in harm's way. This non-profit group is run by an amazing couple that are tireless in their dedication to the cause, with the promise, "As long as they are fighting for our freedom, we'll work to support them." This is a remarkable group that I am proud to be a part of.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65273	1	/users/profile/71348	onebzemom	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	The Hugs Project in Oklahoma City has made a difference in so many lives. After 23 years of duty in the Air Force, my husband and I settled down in OKC to raise our children. Our son is now an active duty Air Force helicopter pilot. During his year in Afghanistan, I became acquainted with Karen and Ray Stark and started volunteering with THP . They started and have kept the HUGS program running from their Edmond home and the Crossroads Mall storefront location. Volunteers from all around the area meet Wednesday, Thursday, or Saturday's to make hand sewn items (the HUGS that go around the neck to be wet and help cool the body), take large quantities of goods  and make smaller baggies of the items (beef jerky, candy, gum, hygiene items, etc.), write encouraging notes to the Troops, and fill CARE boxes. Usually about 30-50 boxes go out every week to Troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Over 4,000 boxes were sent overseas in December, full of Christmas candy, mugs of hot chocolate mix, knitted hats, socks, homemade goodies, granola bars, Twinkies, wrapped presents, books, toys for local children, ornaments, and as much love as could be packed into them. The letters expressing thanks from the Troops who received these boxes can break your heart. Being supported by total strangers gives them a lift in spirit, hope that they are appreciated, and a touch of home in a very scary place. This volunteer organization touches the lives of the Troops, the lives of children and locals they come in contact with, and it touches the hearts of all the volunteers from various walks of life who come to work here throughout the week. The Hugs Project is an amazing, totally non-profit organization, that does a huge amount of good for all who work there and for all who receive the boxes that are sent. Every box that goes out from THP, goes with the love of those supporting our Troops in harm's way.
Hugs Project Incorporated	133609	1	/users/profile/179347	Kelli K.	Donor	5	11/05/2012	I learned about The Hugs Project years ago online.  I've done what I can to support through fabric donations and money when I can.  This year I had a high school classmate deployed overseas.  I sent this group of people the name and address for my friend.  Before I could blink they sent him a care package.  My friend was touched by the kindness of strangers.  I can't speak highly enough of The Hugs Project!
Hugs Project Incorporated	130570	1	/users/profile/176042	Allesan	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	I've been volunteering since 2004. HUGS has sent packages to my family & friends serving overseas.  They are efficient and so thoughtful about how they spend. Every penny goes to the troops!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	130569	1	/users/profile/176040	momfromtx	Client Served	5	10/28/2012	This is such a wonderful charity. All one needs to do is ask and they will send a care package. In addition they look for service personnel to send packagers to. When both my daughter and son in law where deployed to Iraq they sent them care packages that were very useful . As my son in law said they really knew what they were doing and  what was needed. They make helmet warmers for our service members to put under their helmet that keeps their heads warm. For places that are very hot they send an item- its like a scarf, very lightweight - that gives you a hug that when activated with water cools you down. This is life saving . They have never turned down a requests and wok tirelessly to help out our deployed military women and men.  I can not say enough wonderful things about this charity. They deserve to be considered one the top great charities.  Even though both my marines Were deployed in 2008, I have sent them request for other military members who are active duty. They always respond.
Hugs Project Incorporated	112861		/users/profile/153606	Abby Harris	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/24/2012	As a staff member of Feed The Children, we cannot say enough about The Hugs Project. It is a little TLC from home. They are well organized and have a great volunteer base. It also helps give family members peace of mind knowing their loved ones are receiving a care package to lift their spirits while they are serving our country. We are proud to partner with The Hugs Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	106840	1	/users/profile/76275	Dr. B	Volunteer	5	02/21/2012	The Hugs Project sends approximately 100 care packages weekly to our troops and 5,000 at Christmas.  It is all volunteer--no one takes salaries, and the headquarters is donated by Crossroads Mall.  They also pay the water and electricity.  "Hugs" are the cooling neckties that are sewn for the troops to keep them cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  The Hugs Project has sent over 1 million "hugs" to the Middle East.  Many other things are sent in the care boxes--things our troops need.  It is a great organization!
Hugs Project Incorporated	69789	2	/users/profile/76275	Dr. B	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	The Hugs Project is amazing and truly cares about our troops.  As a volunteer, I know that no one gets a salary; and thanks to Crossroads Mall who donates our space and utlities, more of the donated money can be used for more items for our troops.  Nothing is wasted at The Hugs Project!  If you can't physically go work at headquarters, there are many things you can do at home.  Just visit www.thehugsproject.com to learn what you can do.  Our troops deserve the thanks of a grateful nation.
Hugs Project Incorporated	106277		/users/profile/34228	pattihms	Volunteer	5	02/11/2012	My husband and I have assisted The Hugs Project for four or five years by supplying needed supplies and when health permits, working at their facility. They touch so many soldiers lives with the work they do and it is staffed entirely by volunteers. We heartily recommend this group as a very worth while organization.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33423	8	/users/profile/34228	pattihms	Donor	5	03/17/2010	I heard about The Hugs Project  accidently and filled out a form for my nephew who was stationed in Iraq at the time. He received a package and was very excited to share it with his fellow squad. The contents of the package was just what he needed at the time;kool aid powders to put in their thermos was a great addition. The beef jerky,cd's flashlight and more goodies to eat. Thank you so very much The Hugs Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	100087		/users/profile/121612	SpaGirl S.	Volunteer	5	11/01/2011	The message is clear at HUGS PROJECT - they care.  All volunteers give of their time and resources to create and send packages to our military, which are lovingly received by our soldiers.  Many thanks for a job well done.
Hugs Project Incorporated	100025		/users/profile/33718	dkrivenko	Volunteer	5	10/31/2011	The Hugs Project is a wonderful organization.  Not only do they continue to keep deployed members of the military in packages, they do it with lots of love, blood sweat and tears.   They are helping remind those deployed there really are people back in the States supporting them and loving them. My son has been the recipient of packages during both his deployments to Iraq.   His buddies also received packages.  I know when my son deploys again, he will be on their list and receive a ton of wonderful stuff/
Hugs Project Incorporated	32890	5	/users/profile/33718	dkrivenko	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	The Hugs Project is a wonderful organization.  My Marine son was deployed to Iraq twice and both times received lots of great stuff from them.  It really warms a mother's heart knowing someone cares enough to try to make their son's time away a little more comfortable.  This is done not even knowing my son!  How great is that?
Hugs Project Incorporated	100005		/users/profile/34502	david17	Donor	5	10/30/2011	The HUGS Project provides a service to our fighting men that can't always be known to those within the program and those that receive the packages.  I provide dollars and goods to the project and I know that when a soldier receives a package his/her heart and spirit is raised to a new level. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	33687	1	/users/profile/34502	david17	General Member of the Public	5	03/22/2010	HUGS is the best that I have seen for a nonprofit org doing service for our troops. The greatest thing I personaaly admire is that when one submits a soldiers name they ship a package. The next best is the receivers are so proud to receive not only the goodies but also the personal items. HUGS could not do it a\ny better.
Hugs Project Incorporated	100004	1	/users/profile/121449	cararog	Volunteer	5	10/30/2011	I have been associated with The Hugs Project since 2004.  All are volunteers and all have extremely unlimited huge hearts.  Hundreds of thousands of cool ties (hugs) have been made by many of us and many more are made yearly.  Our A.F. daughter was deployed twice and they came through with packages to help her fellow troops that did not receive support from home.  When a call goes out for a needed item or to help, hundreds respond and are there to help.  I've belonged to several military based organizations and The Hugs Project is by far the best.  God Bless our troops, and The Hugs Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	100002	2	/users/profile/121443	Anita M.	Donor	5	10/30/2011	I support The Hugs Project because I support our troops.  Hugs people do a great job of boosting their morale.  My son's in the military and has received care packages from the group.  It has meant a lot to him that someone cared enough to make or gather so many thoughtful items and send as a gift from home. Several handmade items are adapted to fit the special circumstances of combat troops. For example, board games are made of fabric to be light and easily transported.  The cooling neckties make life a little more bearable in the desert, and they have been known to actually save lives. Just a great organization.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	99984	2	/users/profile/121419	Shirley234	Volunteer	5	10/30/2011	Love and caring for the American troops must be contagious and Karen and Ray Stark are the most infectious carriers!  Their love, concern and dedication to serving those who are serving us in the military is impossible to ignore.   The result of working with or donating to the Hugs Project is such a good feeling you just want more of that feeling!  
Hugs Project Incorporated	99979	1	/users/profile/121412	nightstick	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2011	It is with great pleasure that  write this here. A little background first. In my own experience, I have been in both Iraq and Afghanistan (twice each), and while in Afghanistan I had the privilege to be involved in not one but two missions with my own son. I have had two nephews who have served in Iraq as well. What I am getting at is this, I know what our "kids" are going through, been there done that with them. And back in April I had the opportunity to meet and get to know some great members of this group, Karen and Ray, and to find out first hand the great job they and all the HUGS members do, all without pay, to help our troops in harms way.  And most times paying for the items they make with their own funds. They do not just care, they really care, very deeply. If you have been seeking a group to join or donate to, my money is on the Hugs Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	99976		/users/profile/121409	Gra C.	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2011	So nice to know that when your son is far from home someone wants to send him a hug.

Hugs Project Incorporated	99770	2	/users/profile/120814	Jonathan2345	Volunteer	5	10/26/2011	Being down range you don't get the luxuries that we take for granted here in America every day.  You don't have 24 hour access to stores or even showers for that matter, so something like a box of some baby wipes goes a long way to someone who is sleeping in a hole in the ground...literally!  We have guys that risk their lives doing convoys just to get care packages to others who are in harsher terrain!  Those who receive these packages are always in great spirits!!  When you're talking about being in a war zone and having all of the same problems you still have on the home front like bills, deaths in the family, divorce, stress in general that makes you just want to quit...that little piece of Heaven that's a HUGS Care Package is all someone needs to keep going!  Keep it up HUGS!  You're loved by more than you know!

Hugs Project Incorporated	99737	1	/users/profile/120692	Rick2345	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	Some bands that I play in had the chance to perform at a HUGS.  We practiced several weeks getting ready and had a really good time working with the volunteers and learning more about HUGS.  The letters from the troops were very moving and rewarding.As a civilian, I'm really glad to know there are organizations like HUGS that give comfort to our troops who are fighting for our country while we go about life as normal.
Hugs Project Incorporated	73243	1	/users/profile/80053	Kindheartedhugslover	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	Karen Stark and everyone at the Hugs Project is selflessly committed to the mission of extending a heartfelt thank you to every soldier serving in today's military, especially those in harm's way. I have spent enough time volunteering and helping pack boxes, write letters, make cool ties, and am constantly amazed at this organization's tireless effort. I have never been so personally motivated and inspired as I have by the Hugs Project and the hearts behind it. I have seen the good it does first hand and have had the joy and honor of realizing the huge emotional impact that one care package and one note means to each and every troop that recieves them. I have come to value more deeply the importance of the human spirit and how it can be changed through The Hugs Project.I attended a small carnival outside OKC with the Hugs Project where we set up a small booth trying to gain funds to help our soldiers, and to reach out and inspire others to be greatful for their sacrifices. It poured rain and was cold, but we did not pack up, instead Karen and I huddled in the back of her van, continuing to make things we could send to the troops. When the rain cleared a man stopped by and gave us all a heartfelt thank you and told us of how he was deeply discouraged after returning to the states from his time of service and to see minimal gratitude from other citizens and it motivated him to see what we were doing and he had actually recieved our packages overseas and said that they had boosted the morale of his fellow men in arms. I broke down and cried, and hugged this perfect stranger. There is no deeper connection to humanity than that which I have experienced with the Hugs Project. This organization and It's mission deserve all the recognition they can be given. Thank you Hugs!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	69902	1	/users/profile/76405	thankful22	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2011	My nephew deployed for his third tour.  The first two years, I was able to send him packages.  This time I could not.  Thankfully, I met someone who is actively involved in HUGS.  I gave her the APO address, and packages have been going to Jason and his troops ever since.  I am so thankful.  THEY are even more thankful.  This organization is a true blessing.
Hugs Project Incorporated	69817	1	/users/profile/76307	Gold Star Mom JM Edmond	Client Served	5	02/17/2011	As a Gold Star Mother who's Army Soldier Son was KIA in 2005 in Iraq and Mom of a 2nd Soldier Son, who deployed twice to very dangerous areas in Iraq, I know first-hand how important The Hugs Project is for Troops morale and "family support back home" during the toughest times! The Hugs Project is the epitome of good neighbors, good friends and greatttt Americans by their actions!!!  These volunteers are about the hardest working Americans you will ever know!  Who always rise to the bar to help our Troops over and over again! Year after year, The Hugs Project Volunteers selflessly... and tirelessly..must raise donation funds to create, pack and ship thousands of much needed care boxes and cool ties to our Troops serving on the front lines overseas. Their care boxes are life lines from home to our Troops... letting them know some fellow Americans remember them and their daily sacrifices while they courageously serve far from home!!  I heard directly from my Sgt. Soldier Son when based in the dessert, in a primitive forward operating base with 130 degree heat, no running water and short supplies receiving care boxes from The Hugs Project totally renewed Soldiers morale and shared goodwill!  The Soldiers commented "they don't know what they would have done without those care boxes, as they were reall morale life savers!" A care box and letters can be one of the best ways to let our Soldiers know they aren't forgotten and are appreciated for their service to our nation during a time of war.  A box so small that means so much!!  For a lifetime of  "caring" memories for our Troops!  But, The Hugs Project cannot handle this load alone and also need help and support! Many Americans just assume that care boxes to our Troops are made up and shipped from our military facilities free of charge. That is quite an incorrect assumption as each care box made costs The Hugs Project over $10 dollars a box to be mailed, and the mail carrier is the United States Post Office, not shipping on military cargo planes.  And items in the care boxes depend on the donations received or funds sent in to buy the supplies packed.  Yearly the costs run into multiple thousands of dollars easily just to continue to send our American Troops a caring box from home filled with love...and hugs! As community neighbors, The Hugs Project members also kindly and actively support other non profit military support groups in Oklahoma and try to work with them often on Troop projects such as "welcome events at Christmas/ Exodus" at the OKC airport, deployment ceremonies for the Oklahoma 45th Infantry Army and Air National Guard, and numerous statewide and nationwide Troop support  events yearly.  Also, as a former chapter President of a fellow military non profit support group, The Hugs Project generously helped my organization on several occasions with their time and services and were wonderful partners to work with in helping "get" care boxes sent to our Soldiers.  They were much appreciated in their fellow support! And until the last of our brave Troops are able to return home, The Hugs Project wants to keep remembering our Warriors with hearfelt support and care boxes filled with cool ties and much needed supplies.  Please help them with their admirable and continuing goal!The Hugs Project is a truly outstanding and wonderful organization!!They are America at it's best! Jan MartinGold Star Mother and former Blue Star MotherEdmond, OK

I have 3 sons who are scouts and they enjoyed working to help our troops try to enjoy a few of the comforts of home.  From what I have read in email attachments to HUGS, our efforts were much appreciated.  I hope that our troop will volunteer again for this much worthy cause. M Welch

When I was serving in Southeast Asia there was not any origination doing what the Hugs Project is doing. It would have been great to receive packages from people that you did not know and know that they really did care about what we were doing and how we were. When we retuned from Southeast Asia we were spit on, called names and look at as the sum of the earth. The Men and Women that serve this country today deserve better and this a group of great people that are showing them that there is people who do care about what they are doing and how they are living. They do a great job of getting needed supplies to the Men and Women of our arm forces. Karen and all of her volunteers are to be commended for all the hard work and long hours that they put in.I would have loved to have received a package and support that they give everyone.I have been a volunteer for a short time but due to work requirements I can not spend as much time helping all that I want. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	68179	1	/users/profile/74499	Karen K.	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	I love The Hugs Project because the packages sent to our troops touch them on a personal level.  Every care package is packed with  well, much care.  We often think about the troops and wish we could let them know how much we appreciate their sacrifice.  The Hugs Projects sends encouragement from home to our troops and, of course, the true vision of the hug is brilliant  a cooling tie that will help lower the bodys temperature when in the heat.  A real source of comfort physically as well as emotionally.  We receive an e-mail each week with thank yous from the troops and its heartwarming to read how they felt when the received their package, often sharing it with everyone they can.  I wish we could send every service man and woman a package from The Hugs Projectthey deserve it!  They deserve our best for defending our country and our home.

She and the other members of the Unit have received boxes of goods from your organization.  The  receipt was completely unexpected, a wonderful suprise and spirit lifting for them all.  The smallest package or card received by a soldier helps them make it though the day and lets them know they are not forgotten.  Please keep up the good deed.  Our soldiers look forward to it and depend on it.
Hugs Project Incorporated	67017	1	/users/profile/73248	NickSummitt	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	Not only does this organization help and support troops in need of simple yet scarce supplies, but they also provide a fun and social environment for those with little to do or those who just need a reason to get out of the house. These people are literally some of the nicest people anyone could ever meet. If you need some community service hours, they're there to help. If you wanna get out of the Lazy-Boy and do somethin productive, they're there to provide. If you want to help out the troops over seas fighting for our freedom, whether they are a relative, a loved one, or just a friend, the Hugs project is the place to be. I personally love every moment I'm there, packing care packages, ironing hugs, or even bagging up chocolate. There's many jobs available, creative jobs for the kids and even simple jobs like sowing and ironing for those who need to sit and still be productive.

Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	The Hugs Project is an awesome group of really friendly, wonderful people - all working together for a common goal - to let our fine young people serving in Afghanistan and Iraq know how much we support and appreciate all that they do - (the fact that we have so much fun and laughter why doing so shouldn't count, but it does!)  It is amazing to me to watch, when I volunteer each week, everyone pitch in, figure out as an all volunteer what/how needs doing and "get 'er done."  Awesome!
Hugs Project Incorporated	66662	1	/users/profile/72861	Granny F.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	My Father was career Navy, having served in the "Silent Service" in WWII, Korea, Vietnam.  He was a Naval Recruiter during the Vietnam war.  I saw first hand how poorly many treat those who serve to keep us free and vowed to do all in my power when I had a chance to make sure those who serve now know how important they are and how much we support them.   When I volunteer every week I see men and women of all ages and all back grounds working together to do just that and am so thankful to be given the opportunity to volunteer at Hugs.  The best days at Hugs are when any of my Grandchildren are able to go with me - they learn first hand about the sacrifices our military makes.
Hugs Project Incorporated	66275	1	/users/profile/72443	pegasus	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I love working with the Hugs Project because it provides me with a great way to give simething back to the men and women serving in harm's way to provide me with the freedoms I enjoy every day.  I can use my everyday skills to create things useful to others.  The care packages we put together contain common supplies we take for granted here in the US, but which may be impossible to get where our service men and women are posted on foreign soil.  When was the last time you had to go without basic hygiene supplies like toothpaste, shampoo, or soap?  I know I would be lost without them.  I can't imagine living in a tent (or less) and not having access to the simplest things.  The Hugs Project is filling a big void and the volunteers who serve are wonderful supporters of our troops.  I highly recommend this organization to anyone who wants to help our sons and daughters survive their service abroad.
Hugs Project Incorporated	66198	1	/users/profile/72361	GARDENGIRL1	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	MY HUSBAND I HAVE WORKED AT OR SUPPORTED THE HUGS PROJECT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ARE ALWAYS AMAZED AT THE DEVOTION AND CARING OF ALL VOLUNTEERS. THEY PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO WHAT GOES INTO THE BOXES AND THE LETTERS COMING FROM THE TROOPS EXPRESS THEIR GREAT APPRECIATION. ALL THIS ENCOURAGES US TO GIVE AS MUCH AS WE CAN AFFORD BECAUSE  IT IS SO GREATLY NEEDED AND APPRECIATED.
Hugs Project Incorporated	66073	1	/users/profile/72232	Nancarr	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	This is a wonderful organization that is nothing else is filled with heart. n their is not one voluteer or doner that does not put more then 100 percent in everything they do to support our men and women in harms way. I get so much enjoyment working with this special group of men and women who show everyday how much doing for others mean to them. Being a part of this organzation has also made me a better person and so much fullfillment in helping this group give to our service personal. This is an important organization in what it does. they give our service men and women reinforcement in that this country truely supports our men and women in the job that they were called to do to protect us so we are allowed to do the things we do in our daily lives . In this case i am allowed to volunteer to give back to them . May they be kept safe. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	66045	1	/users/profile/72197	Connie	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I work at the FAA and received an email that volunteers were needed for the HUGS Project to pack boxes for the troops.  My husband and I wanted to show support for the troops who give their all for their Country.  We were happy to be a part of the team that sent 4,000 boxes to the troops this Christmas 2010.  We are proud of the men and women who fight for our freedom.  We will continue to support the HUGS project for as long as we have troops supporting us!
Hugs Project Incorporated	66012	1	/users/profile/72160	MESH	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	I began volunteering for Hugs when my son expressed interest in joining the Air Force while in college.  Later, when he was sent to Iraq, we sent several care packages to him. He was always so encouraged to get the boxes and shared them with as many people as he could. Last fall he was transferred to a different base and as he unpacked, he found the special things he had saved from his "Hug boxes."  He said it was as if he was receiving those boxes all over again. I am proud to be a part of an organization that makes our military feel appreciated.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65959	1	/users/profile/72096	JJJJ	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	The mail package that I received from The Hugs Project (OKC) while I am in Iraq with the military was incredible. The package contained so many different items that it had something for everyone. I shared the package with other military members where I work and they greatly enjoyed the various snacks, hygiene items and reading material. Beyond the physical usefulness of the items, it was a great morale booster to get a package out of the blue, from people that don't know me.   The Hugs Project (OKC) is really helping out military members who are deployed overseas through their care packages.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65953		/users/profile/72089	Helen Hughes	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I am 71 & my husband is 73 & we have been volunteers since the year it was organized.   We can think of no better group to work for than The Hugs Project which focuses on helping our troops in harm's way. Will always remember young lady who wrote that she never got any mail. Had no family. Got a package from Hugs & she cried because someone cared enough to send her a box & a letter of appreciation for her service to the USA. No volunteer is turned away.  We need cutters, sewers, ironers, packers, letter writers.  Small children draw pictures for the troops & the troops love it.  One Sunday school class wrote letters of appreciation & the troops loved that & replied to the kids.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65897		/users/profile/72026	VanDoren	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I've seen the thousands of boxes that The Hugs Project sends to troops at Christmas time.  They also send 40-50 boxes each week throughout the year.  The feedback from the troops indicates that they cannot believe the variety of things that can be packed into one box.  They receive handmade portable games, toiletries, letters, flash drives, chocolate (even in the summer) and much more. One of the most appreciated gifts seems to be socks. Cooling ties were the first things that were sent.  They can cool a body's core temperature by several degrees and have been known to save the lives of soldiers suffering from heat stroke.  Of course, thousands of these are still sent out every year. The troops are very appreciative that people at home are working so hard to support them.  They usually share with others in their unit so one package goes a long way in letting our troops know someone cares. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	65855		/users/profile/71985	baron	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I helped with HUGS a couple years back when they were sending school supplies overseas.  I work a lot so I do not get to come help much but respect the work they do.  They helped my brother when he was overseas (both deployments).
Hugs Project Incorporated	65821		/users/profile/71945	Amanda B	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	While doing a class project based on a non-profit organization, I met Karen with The Hugs Project. The Hugs Project is a great organization for our troops. Karen and her volunteers are able to offer our guys and gals over in the Middle East a little bit of home, something that our troops desparately need. Please help Karen and Hugs be able to send a little more home to our troops who cannot be here.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65796		/users/profile/71921	Bob Ewing	Volunteer	4	02/09/2011	My husband and I started working with HUGS about 4 years ago.  He became their primary HUGS material cutter.  Having a system all of his own, I just assisted.  Over the years, we think he cut over 100,000 of the 5" x 45" strips for the HUGS.  He served in the Navy Reserves during the 1960's and was so pleased that he could help the troops now.Sadly, he died in June of 2010.  So many of the HUGS volunteers were at his service and sent cards and flowers.  I am reminded constantly of his untiring work.  I hope to "pick up the scissors" soon and begin cutting more material for HUGS.  In November, family members and friends gathered to help pack boxes in Bob's memory.  I'm sure he was smiling down on us.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	65774		/users/profile/71895	martygruber	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	I met Karen at the Miami Airport in Dec. and was blown away at her dedication and support she gives to our troops!!!This project (and Karen) are a blessing to the troops and to all of us who are being helped by our troops putting their lives on the line for our Freedom!!!  God Bless Karen and the Hugs Project!!!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	65761		/users/profile/71882	KarenP	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	The girls volunteered over 225 collective hours during their project year. The most important thing the girls learned is what it means to serve others and how even a 9 year old can make a difference in the life of another human being.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65744		/users/profile/71864	Allesan A.	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I've been with the HUGS Project for 6 years.  I started when Karen was staying in a hotel where I worked.  She handed me a knifty knitter and said "Here, you're just sitting around.  Make a hat for a soldier!"  So I did and have been volunteering as regularly as I can .  My brother in law has been deployed twice and has recieved multiple packages which he distributes to his men.  Another friend of mine from college is also an Army officer and has done the same.  HUGS does so much good for so many people!  They give people in Central Oklahoma a place to help our troops!  Please consider donating or volunteering.  Our men and women need all love from home that they can get!
Hugs Project Incorporated	65733		/users/profile/71851	padorough	Donor	5	02/09/2011	I cannot thank The Hugs Project enough for all they do for our Troops!  They are right there supporting every request they receive of a need for our Troops.  I have submitted several names to them of friends in Iraq to include for my sister and The Hugs Project put them on their care package mailing list and sent them wonderful, wonderful packages!  They cannot do enough for our Troops no matter what!  It's not a job to them, it's Tender Loving Care for those we love who are in harm's way!  I salute The Hugs Project!
Hugs Project Incorporated	65713	1	/users/profile/71829	isellots	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	I have Volunteered a few hours here & there to help the HUGS Project, but its been awhile since I've been able to make time to assist these awesome people who pour their lives into providing real essentials wih a healthy dose of home (the great USA) and love into boxes shipped across the miles to our men and women serving and sacrificing their very lives for our freedom. That's why I've marked my role as a general member of the public; I don't feel like I deserve to be in the same category as those who volunteer on a regular basis week after week, day after day to provide this remarkable service that they provide.  It's an honor for me to say that I've even been a part of this great organization & to have known Ray & Karen Stark. They definitely deserve this $5000 award and will put it to good use paying for shipping these donations to the wonderful men and women of our US armed services.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65711	1	/users/profile/71827	S Stone	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	 Several years ago I met some "Hugs" volunteers at a booth at "Global Oklahoma". They told me what they do to support our troops (America's bravest and strongest men and women). Because I do not take my freedoms for granted, "The Hugs Project" gave me a way to give the support to our troops that was lacking in the Vietnam era. My sister and I started volunteering weekly to sew, iron, and fill the cooling neckties (hugs) that have saved lives. Although I cannot volunteer consistently, when I can, I go to "Crossroads" to help by sewing, by bagging snacks, first aid kits , and stationary packs, and by wrapping small, useful gifts. With the little money I can spare and the coupons that I can sometimes double, I watch for sales to buy coffee and tea, socks, hygene products andplaying cards, Chex mix, fig bars and raisins, as well as protein foods such as tuna, sardines, and peanut butter. I go to the thrift stores on half price days to collect mugs and tins, nylons to make "soaps on a rope", and 100% cotton sheets to dye (with tea if I can't afford dye) and cut out "hugs" and "kisses" (warming hat liners). Sometimes I can find school supplies and small toys for the troops to give to the children to lessen their fear of Americans. At home I have made quilt tops to back with fleece from fabrics I've gotten from " The Hugs Project". My husband (a Vietnam veteran) makes fudge that I know the troops appreciate. "The Hugs Project" has provided me with peanut butter, sugar, peanuts and syrup to make lots of peanut patties for the Christmas packages. When I have had no money to work with my grandchildren and I cheerfully collect leaves to press and send to troops serving in the desert (as reminders of home). In early December 2010 I was filled with a sense of pride in our troops from Tinker AFB and all of the volunteers of all ages who turned out to help man two lines (in a bucket brigade fasion) in an effort to load mail trucks with 4,000 care packages; a goal that seemed impossible the week before. The "Hugs Project" needs money for postage and for items that have not been donated in order to provide these "we care" packages that give needed moral support to the troops who sacrifice so much for our country.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65588	1	/users/profile/71691	LAHicks	Board Member	5	02/09/2011	The Hugs Project brightened the lives of over 6300 soldiers last year with care packages filled with "Hugs" cooling ties, food, candy, socks, personal hygiene items, books, games, powdered drink mixes, coffee, mini-binoculars, solar powered LED flashlights, handknitted neck pillows, etc.  When needs arose for foot powder or socks, the troops contacted us for help!  We have also been able to supply them with over 120 sewing machines and 2 wheelchairs for them to present to local citizens in their "Hearts and Minds" program which is meant to change opinions of Americans in the hearts and minds of the Middle Eastern citizens. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	65587	1	/users/profile/71690	nangal	Donor	5	02/09/2011	The Hugs Project provides such needed supplies to our troops overseas but they provide much more than that.  They send a message to our troops that we support them and recognize their sacrifices and efforts.  The soldiers leave their loved ones, their homes and sometimes their jobs to fight for what we believe in.  They need to know we care.  I began supporting this project because my husband's son was killed in Iraq and we wanted the troops to know that people here understand their sacrifice, sometimes with their life.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65577	1	/users/profile/71679	Fran deCordova	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	We have supported the "hugs" project for over 5 years now and have spread the word to others who we know are interested in the welfare of our military and who want to "do something" to support our troops.We found that many people want to help and are thrilled to read the letters of thanks from those heroes who receive the "hugs" packages.The expressions of amazement from the service members who open their packages, from total strangers, and find just what they need encourages us to spread the word through our church, our circle of friends and in other organizations who in turn contribute time and money.  Being retired military, we can relate to the loneliness and isolation of our soldiers, so we want to do what we can for them. A group of RV owners that we informed has made over 2000 "hugs" cooling ties, hundreds of games and teddy bears, and thousands of prayer rocks. They say it is the least they can do to say "thank you" to our deserving military heroes.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	65576	1	/users/profile/71678	Checker4	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	For sometime a group of ladies in my church have made "Hugs Love Bears" to be sent to the service people to give out to children in troubled areas.  We wondered if the task was productive until we heard from a gentleman serving in Irag about a child who had received a bear.  The story was very heart warming.  So - we continue to make the bears.  Hopefully we will be able to do others items in the future.  We did at one time provide items like socks.  Just receiving something from home helps show that we care and pray for safe journeys.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65522	1	/users/profile/71618	traininglady911	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I became a volunteer for The Hugs Project to support and thank our troops.  I am a former military wife and know from personal experience the difficulties and sacrifices our troops make every day.  They give up their homes, their families, and their very lives to keep us safe.  It is my pleasure and honor to help bring a little comfort to them. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	65478	1	/users/profile/71569	Cheri H.	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I became a volunteer for 3 specific reasons.  My son started getting care packages when he served in Iraq so I was curious about these strangers showing such support for him.  I found a wonderful, diverse group of people with a single purpose; to send love and support to our troops.  Finally it is the only non-profit organization I know of that spends 100% of its funds to fulfill its mission.  There are no paid salaries, all of the equipment was donated, and even their work space is donated.   I am honored to be a part of this organization and look forward to continuing as they send love and support to our 3500 Oklahoma National Guard members deploying to Afghanstan.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65465	1	/users/profile/71555	S. Patterson	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I am writing in support of the Hugs Project started by Karen Stark.  Just reading letters from the military who have received care packages is proof that this is so appreciated.  I have made dozens of the cooling ties that are included in the care packages.  Such an easy way to help out.  There are so many volunteers, and this group has expanded to groups all over the USA.  Karen is a tireless worker with excellent leadership and managerial abilities.  She keeps us all enthused, such a great group to work with.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65464	1	/users/profile/71554	simoncharley	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2011	With so many of our armed forces in harms way, it is so good to know that with the HUGS project, they are not forgotten.  HUGS truly cares about our military and their need to be taken care of by the rest of us.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65432		/users/profile/71520	P K Wallace	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	The Hugs Project has been a very rewarding project for my Mother and myself because it allows us to serve those military personnel who are serving their country in harm's way.  Because of the letters and emails received from the troops, I know the care package we construct and send make a difference and help make a difficult situation better.  I believe these packages help sustain morale and improve the physical conditions endured on a daily basis.  Every year, The Hugs Project does more and better services than the year before because we care.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65350		/users/profile/71437	Maria W.	Donor	5	02/09/2011	I donate to this program because the money goes where they say it does.  I have been there once and witnessed the dedication of the volunteers.  Their untiring devotion to our servicemen and women serving in harms way is amazing.  Then my son was deployed, they sent him a care package to share with his unit.  Upon my son's second deployment the first thing he asked for was some hugs for his men.  They provide much needed relief in a serious area of the world.  Then when my son's unit was hit with several injuries, they sent another package with some cheer items.  These men and women serve our military in a great unselfish act of kindness providing needed relief from the heat and a taste of home which keeps their moral up, which is vital to their survival.  
Hugs Project Incorporated	65348		/users/profile/71435	demi_ward88	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	Dedication, hard work, and patriotism are the three descriptive words that immediately come to mind when I think of the Hugs Project. Volunteering with them is a great experience in that there isn't a moment they are not working towards their awesome goals. Care packages are consistantly being packed, cooling ties and special gifts being made, and encouraging and supportive stories about the men and women serving overseas are talked about with great knowledge and compassion. Each time I volunteer (during this Christmas season, when 4,000 packages were put together, for example), I know for a fact fellow Americans are being provided with necessities and love from the volunteers.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65329		/users/profile/71415	Linda IHS	Volunteer	4	02/09/2011	I know when I give to the HUGS Project that my money and my time will be well spent.  The HUGS Project has no paid staff or even rent fees to consume donations. The vast majority of the monies donated goes for postage to get as many packages as possible into the hands of our brave men and women serving in harm's way abroad. My son was one of those young men. During his 15 month deployment he received a package from the HUGS project which he shared with the men and women he worked with--including Iraqis assisting the military. Each package we are able to send touches many--not only with essential things like food, HUGS, and survival bracelets; not only with the caring shown by all the little things thoughtfully included; not only by providing an opportunity for our soldiers to share with each other and those they are there to help; but also by impacting the lives of every person involved in those packages in a positive way. The person who donates money or goods and those physically filling the boxes are blessed. The recipients not only have their living conditions improved by the contents but are blessed by the love and caring behind each package.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65304		/users/profile/71383	Helen	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERNMy husband and me have been working with the Hugs Project for over 3 years. We have no one in service, but The Lord has blessed us in many ways so we want to give back.  We look forward to Saturdays when we open the office in Oklahoma City, OK. and greet the volunteers who come to work. We assign them a job.  This project has opened up a new life for us. He is 84 and I'm 83. Being Senior Citizens, our family wants us, but since they have their own families they don't always need us, so this fills that need.                                               Sincerely,  Dennis and Helen Miller

Hugs Project Incorporated	65291		/users/profile/71370	girl4glory	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I am part of an organization that began working with HUGS last year and we have tried to come monthly ever since. When seeing the passion all of the workers have for this job, it's hard to not want to work just as hard. With so many stories told from the ladies (there are some men too!), we can honestly say we are making a difference in the lives of soldiers and heroes. Some projects seem out there, but we know those fighting overseas love all they get and so we just love to join the HUGS project and help. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	65280		/users/profile/71355	janirenejon	General Member of the Public	4	02/09/2011	I visited the website to submit my sons name for a care package and I also visited the location in Crossroads Mall.  I found a multitude of items being boxed for shipment.  I was in awe of the community outpouring for this project.  When it's that one soldier or airman, sailor or marine who doesn't have much family and no one really writes, receives a package.  What a big surprise, someone cares, someone knows I am here and appreciates what I am doing for "Our Country".  It's not what is in the package so much as the "HUG" it gives that service member.  Thank You HUGS Project INC.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65254		/users/profile/71325	Debra	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	The Hugs Project has been so helpful to so many of our military staff.  Living in a military town, I see troops come and go and have spoken to many of them and they always say how much the appriciate getting packages and items during their deployment time.  This group has worked with so many groups like the one that I belong to to help us to learn what items need to be sent.  Great Job Hugs!
Hugs Project Incorporated	65249		/users/profile/71320	lmarshall	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	I only spent a few weeks working with the HUGS project in OKC before I moved to another state. I have never been with a more dedicated and enthusiastic group of people. They believe wholeheartedly in what they do and helping them lets us be connected to the men who are risking their lives for us. Please help them continue the wonderful work that they do.

Hugs Project Incorporated	65222		/users/profile/71292	dcorder	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	The HUGS Project has many volunteers that, like myself, give time, money and goods because the work serves a much higher purpose. The joy I receive from volunteering knowing that what I do provides more than joy - it often fills a void in the life of a deployed soldier. Often, these soldiers are so grateful that we cared enough to send a box of needed and cherished items they write to us and they sometimes drop by to give a personal thanks. When I realize what our work means to a deployed individual I am filled with pride for our fighting men and the HUGS Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	65189		/users/profile/71257	sheilagriffin	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	I have volunteered with The Hugs Project for a couple of years now.  They are a great group of patriots.  They love our soldiers and work tirelessly to send them care packages.  At Christmas time, they send out about 4000 packages. That's over $40,000 in postage alone! The leaders of the group are the most dedicated people I have ever met.  It is an honor to be a part of this group.   
Hugs Project Incorporated	65184		/users/profile/71252	Delta Dawn	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	I am very new to volunteering with the Hugs Project and  I've only had a chance to help a couple of times. It didn't take long to realize the Hugs Project folks are extremely dedicated in ministering to our troops. When it comes to care packages, they cover all the basis. Treats, good reading, nifty little games for our troops to share with each other and play. And lots more great things in those packages. Can anyone say? KEEP 'EM COMING HUGS!!!  The Hugs Project must go on. I cannot imagine them not being around. I know many troops have been blessed by them.  I look forward to helping them out more in the near future. 
Hugs Project Incorporated	59315		/users/profile/63947	gpadad	Volunteer	5	12/31/2010	I am starting my 3rd year volunteering with The Hugs Project one day per  week (sometimes more).  I have a great time supporting our troops overseas and enjoying the company of fellow volunteers (all great people).  Our "pay" is the joy we receive in reading letters and emails sent to us from the troops expressing their appreciation and their knowing that someone at home cares about them.  Ray & Karen Stark work hard, unpaid, long hours to see that as many "care packages" as possible are packed and sent to our "defenders of freedom".   DW-OKC
Hugs Project Incorporated	59262		/users/profile/63861	girl4glory	Volunteer	5	12/29/2010	I volunteer with the college group I'm involved in and we love coming to the HUGS Project. To say these people are passionate is a true understatement. Everyone who walks in the store knows the purpose behind all that they do. Not one single thing is wasted and much thought goes into the package contents. It is a great cause and I will definitely support them in the future.

It means that world to each of us to get a box full of goodies from the home front.  The support is phenomenal and it is the thoughtfulness that keeps us motivate to keep pushing through to accomplish the mission.  I happened to receive a couple of boxes while deployed to Kabul Afghanistan.

When mail was called, I was the only one in my unit that knew there would be nothing for me; not everyone received things but at least they had that hope.  Not me, I knew no one even cared that I was serving my country far from home.  But, one day that changed.  When my friend came back from picking up mail, he had a huge smile as he laid a box on the foot of my cot.  I told him hed made a mistake but he pointed to my name on the label and said, Isnt that you?I couldnt believe it but man, I cried like a baby when I realized it wasnt a dream.  Someone knew.  Someone cared.  It was from the Oklahoma City chapter of The Hugs Project and their letter said that they appreciated me and that they respected me for the job I was doing.  Reading that, I cried even harder.You can never know how good I felt and still feel even now.  I hope that someday, I can meet some of these good people so that I can throw my arms around their necks and let them know that they made a difference in the life of some lonely soldiers far from homeespecially this one.Respectfully,Jessica Stanwick

My late friend Jim Johnson was able to have his son placed on the list of brave men who received boxes.  His son shared his gifts with those who served with him.  Jim was proud of his son and grateful to an organization who let us volunteer to show those serving our country our pride in them and our gratitude for them.     Robert B. Weil

Everything they send is useful and really boosts the morale of the unit.  It is great to see a group of people that are this supportive of the troops, keep up the good work!Kenny

Hugs Project Incorporated	33950	6	/users/profile/34768	pjc93yahoocom	Client Served	5	03/25/2010	We appreciate all the support of the volunteers back home.  It is tough to be away from loved ones for such long periods and it means a lot when we are deployed to receive messages and packages.  Thanks for all that you are doing. Know that it is a great boost over here and we truley appreciate the effort and support from all of you back home!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33941	9	/users/profile/34756	ray2	Volunteer	5	03/25/2010	Thank you to the Hugs Project for ensuring that there's always someone back home who appreciates the service that we do for our country.

God bless all that are involved in this great project.  Little things that they send make a big difference!From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33924	5	/users/profile/34739	ralph3	General Member of the Public	5	03/25/2010	Hugs Project is a great way to show Servicemembers that their service is appreciated. My thanks for Hugs Project for all their support to our Servicemembers serving in today's global contingency operations!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33894	5	/users/profile/34708	over65volunteer	Volunteer	5	03/25/2010	I came to Hugs probably six years ago frustrated that I was 60 years old and felt I wasn't doing anything to be supportive of our soldiers, especially those in Iraq.  Working in the midst of other concerned Americans gave me a good feeling that I was finally doing something to help.  The thank you letters from the soldiers make our efforts especially worthwhile.  In compiling the care packages there is work for all ages from sorting, cutting, sewing, ironing, gathering, taping, writing messages, even making games.  It's a well-managed, well-organized effort that always needs helping hands and financial support for postage.  It's a privilege to be associated with this group and its leaders who find the energy to keep going year after year.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33830	5	/users/profile/34657	notdoingmuch	Volunteer	5	03/24/2010	I have been a Hugs Project member for more than five years.  This group is unselfish in it's support of the Troops around the world.  After persoanlly sending many boxes filled with cooling ties (HUGS), helmet coolers (KISSES), neck pillows, etc., the most heart warming email I received was a very sincere "Thank You" from one soldier who was grateful for a bar of soap I had sent.  He had lost his soap and couldn't replace it.  His note brouhgt tears to my eye.  Such thanks for so little, I thought.  These men and woman put their lives on the line for us.  The least we can do is send them America's thanks.  I support the Hugs Project and everything they do for our Troops.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33772	8	/users/profile/34589	joshsgirl	Volunteer	5	03/23/2010	WOW!!!  What to say about this awesome group of caring people?  They kept me sane while my husband was deployed.  I spent way too much time worrying before I started working with them. After I went to their office and worked my frst Saturday, I found myself taking work home and as I spent more time making things to send in care packages, I spent less time worrying about myself.  This project's good for the troops but it's also good for the vounteers and for the military families.Way to go HUGS!!!   You guys ROCK!!Jen
Hugs Project Incorporated	33703	8	/users/profile/34516	carolyn-kay-1	Board Member	5	03/22/2010	I became acquainted with HUGS about 4 years ago.  My aunt (89 at the time) and I purchased materials and made the Cool Tie (neck Hugs) for the troops.  We found about about The HUGS Project and started working with them.  My husband is also involved.  We have helped at Christmas time packing the boxes.  We spread the word via the internet and through friends and with our church.  HUGS is very well run.  A very small percentage of the funds raised is spent on anything other than postage or items for the troops.  Volunteers meet 3 times a week and go quietly about their tasks of making cool ties and other items.  Everyone is so friendly.  Kids from the age of 5 and adults to the age of 85 or so meet and work together doing any job that is needed that day.  I feel as though I am contributing greatly to help boost the morale of the troops and their families.  People give of themselves whether it is time, money, or articles or just saying prayers.  It is a great way to volunteer and the founders, Karen and Ray, are so dedicated to the project and to our troops.  The enthusiasm is contagious.  My granddaughters (13 and 11) want to go to HUGS to work all of the time.  I see that they go as often as possible as I believe that they need to know why people are sacrificing for their freedoms.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33694	5	/users/profile/34510	tcarlson72	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	My family and I just volunteered for the first time a couple of weekends ago and truely enjoyed it.  We spent about 5 hours with them and they are the sweetest people and they really care about what they are doing.  My family and I are planning on volunteering again and making it a regular thing for us!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33683	4	/users/profile/33784	jazabel	Client Served	5	03/22/2010	The Hugs Project have sent packages to addresses I have provided to them.  All the troops have been thrilled to receive "Hugs & Kisses". I also had the honour of working with Karen & Ray at a VFW convention in Orlando several years ago. They worked hard, to raise funds to send packages to our troops on the home front.  These hard working dedicated troop supporters inspire many others to work along side of them, and they never forget that have troops needing their help, daily. Thank you volunteer folks of the Hug Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33671	5	/users/profile/34486	terri3	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	The Hugs Project is one of the most worthwhile non profits I have found in a long time.  Our men and women serving should know how much we care about them.  Some of them do not have family that care or can send them things from home that remind them of the place they will be coming back to.  This project does that, it makes every soldier feel like they have a piece of home right there in the horrible war conditions they are subject to.  My son did a food fundraiser at his school for the HUGS and he has been there twice so far to help fill boxes.  It has been a very rewarding experience for my whole family.  It makes you remember who fights for the great country we live in and the freedom that is provided.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33670	5	/users/profile/34485	welshgirl2010	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	I have helped at "hugs", for 5 years, can't imagine being anywhere else on Wednesdays. if you can't sew or knit,[there is always ironing!!] re-packaging items that come in plastic, or cardboard; we use thousands of ziplock bags, all sizes,,,think of new ways to make life a little easier for the TROOPS . The children love to help, whether it is tearing open boxes, or drawing pictures on boxes to be mailed.We are also there on Thursdays and Saturdays. As I have learned to say , Y'ALL COME SEE US. you will be impressed.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33668	5	/users/profile/34484	ouabrams	General Member of the Public	5	03/22/2010	I feel The Hugs Project is a great charity.  Not only do my parents devote numerous hours cutting the material for the hugs and spending time at the center volunteering, my daughters are also very involved.  The ask, beg, plead to go out there to help.  It is very rewarding as a parent to have children who want to spend time on spring break, christmas break or during the summer help a worth while project.  My youngest has even invited a friend to go with here and see what it is like.  Both of my girls were given a monetary gift about 6 months ago.  Both of them came to me asking if they could give a portion of it to HUGS.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33666	7	/users/profile/34482	don3	Board Member	5	03/22/2010	My wife & I first learned about The Hugs Project in December of 2008 just before Christmas.  We decided to see what it was about and started helping out in the "arcade" packing boxes and making chocolate-covered pretzels to send to the troops.  We also spent an early morning at Will Rogers Airport seeing off young soldiers who were going home for Christmas from Ft. Sill.   We attended a "members meeting" shortly after that and somehow ended up on the board.  Through that we have learned more about "Hugs" and have become more involved.  I volunteer weekly (unless out of town) and enjoy it immensely.  It is "the least" I can do for those young men and women in harms way protecting my family and our country. God bless them all.     Also, I have the pleasure of working along side some of the nicest, most giving people you could ever meet.  I can lay my head down at night knowing that I have done something worthwhile and realizing that because of our troops I have a place to "lay my head" at night.    Most people are busy these days just trying to get through life.  If you find yourself with a little extra money in your pocket, then "Hugs" is a good place to put it, or if you have extra time then "Hugs" is a good place to spend it.  You won't regret it.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33665	8	/users/profile/34480	curtiss	Client Served	5	03/22/2010	The HUGs project sent care packages to my men in Afghanistan.  They sent cool teck ties (hugs) and helmet liners (kisses) to keep us cool in the 140 degree summers.  They also sent blankets and Christmas gifts in the winter.  Of course lots of groups are charitable like the HUGS Project, but there was something different about this group.  The members wanted to do more than send boxes.  They sent correspondance and lots of love.  They took a personal interest.  They linked my men with other families in a broad network of sharing and fraternity.  I guess that might seem ok to some people, but the needs of the modern combat Soldier, Sailor, Marine, and Airman are great so I found it to be Heaven Sent!  We needed a means to vent frustrations as we were under massive stress.  We needed to feel a sense of belonging as we missed our own families terribly.  We needed to feel like what we did was a service the American people desired and appreiciated.  The HUGs Project fulfilled these needs for us.  In our darkest hours, they were the Cavalry who came to our rescue.  I know these folks all deserve ample thanks and they all have my eternal appreciation, but specifically I wanted to thank Lee Coe, Dawn Case, and Debbie Cappel.  These three cared for me on a personal level and even connected with my familiy back home.  If the HUGs volunteers are all saints, then these three women are most assuredly angels.  God bless the HUGS Project and God Bless America.Sincerly MAJ Curtiss Robinson, ARSIC-S Police Mentor Team Chief, Shahjoy district, Zabul province.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33664	7	/users/profile/34479	linda12	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	For those who want to feel like their money is well spent and their time is going to a worthy cause, the HUGS Project fits the bill. First, there are no salaries or huge overhead, so I know the vast majority of any monies donated goes to the actual ministry. Second, the cause of supporting our soldiers is certainly one which I can support.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33658	7	/users/profile/34470	akg	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	This group is one of the most together groups I have volunteered for.  The Hugs Project keeps you informed what is needed, how to do it, where to send it and when they will be working on putting the donations together.  I have sent many packages to names they have given me and participated in their troop projects.Their guidance is unsurpassed and I am sure the troops on the receiving end of their work would give them a thumbs up.  Keep up the good work and ourtroops will be well taken care of.  Thanks!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33656	5	/users/profile/34469	wmaok2	Donor	5	03/22/2010	These are some of the most dedicated people I have ever met.  They go full tilt almost all the time to make sure that their mission to support our troops is carried out. Sometime I have wondered if the Starks and their workers ever sleep. Still, when you visit their 'command post' at Crossroads Mall, everyone is so pleasant and helpful and besides the cool tie (HUGS) and goodies they put in those boxes, you can always get the other kind of HUGS too.This is just a great group working hard for a great cause!

Hugs Project Incorporated	33654	7	/users/profile/34467	katysmith	Volunteer	5	03/22/2010	Wonderful, wonderful organization.  I appreciate that my kids can actively volunteer for such a positive group!  We look forward to returning many times. Thank you!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33633	5	/users/profile/33681	TheHugsLady	Board Member	5	03/21/2010	This is the best group anyone could ever hope for.  Our members are dedicated to supporting Americans far from home. We were the first ones to send cooling ties to the troops serving in the Middle East.  We call them "hugs" since they go around the neck and we think all our troops deserve a {{{hug}}}.  Cooling ties can reduce body core temps by 5+ degrees helping save our troops from heat stroke deaths.I want to thank every member who has ever made a cooling tie, packed a box, written a letter, made a homemade goodie or prayed for these brave young men and women.  Without you, there would be no Hugs Project.  Respectfully,Karen StarkFounder/Executive Director
Hugs Project Incorporated	33597	5	/users/profile/34402	anamibremer	Volunteer	5	03/20/2010	I have been involved with The Hugs Project for about 7 years.  When I found out that the hugs we sew can save lives by cooling our troops during those severe summer temps that they have to serve in, I got busy, bought 100% muslin by the bolt, made myself a hug turner with the info on our website, bought pounds of water sorb crystals and sewed and sewed and sewed.  I love knowing that I have done something to help those young men and women that serve our nation so well.I also write letters every week to individuals who don't get much mail.  If they respond by email, and some do, I email them once a week also.  But that letter goes into the mailbox every week as well.  I send them crossword puzzles, word search games and Sunday comics, too.  They need to feel that connection with home in the simple things and know that their service is keeping life good at home for all of us.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33562	5	/users/profile/34357	kenb	Volunteer	5	03/19/2010	My family, especially my daughter, helped to start this wonderful group. We sponsored the original group hug at our church, attended many of the next several and developed tools and techniques with them. My little girl has grown up presenting this project to 4-H kids, fair goers, and many other groups, meanwhile making large numbers of hugs, and sending many packages. Having been intimately involved in the early progression from idea to working group, we know exactly how much good and on how tight a budget this group can work near miracles in helping our troops! It's GREAT!!! It made my daughter and my family more caring, more sharing, and more aware. It was clear when we were on TV several times that it would be a wonderful project, but just how big it has gone is a fantastic surprise. It is terrific to look back and think about the first donation big enough to acquire water holding crystals in a 50 pound bag... big enough to make many hundred Hugs and big enough to get so many people involved. Its time to deliver more hugs to the group... and time for the weather to go higher on the thermometer than most of us will ever see it, so time to get busy again!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33560	6	/users/profile/34356	mom2amarine	Volunteer	5	03/19/2010	I found The Hugs Project 5 years ago when I was looking for a way to support our troops.  My son had just joined the Marines and I wanted to do something that would also help him when he deployed.  I was very impressed with the group when Karen received a request from a higher-up Marine in Iraq for 10,000 Hugs and the various groups had them made and sent within 3 to 4 weeks!!        Reading the "Thank yous" received makes me realize that this is something very important to our military and I am grateful to continue to be a part of it!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33555	6	/users/profile/34215	laila	Volunteer	5	03/19/2010	I started volunteering with The Hugs Project when my brother was deployed in 2006.  He and his unit requested 1000 cool ties and recieved them that summer. I started a group in Kansas City,MO, and it has been supporting those men and women everyday since.  I love the way that this group has brought support to the community, those left behind during deployment, and those that are away.  I have also been thoroughly impressed with the kindness of the community and their donations during fundraiser efforts.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33538	6	/users/profile/34334	pepper	Volunteer	5	03/18/2010	I  have worked with the Hugs Project in OKC for 2 1/2 years and I see the wonderful response received from the military men and women who have received our care packages.  It is a very worthwhile organization helping those who serve us everyday in harms way.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33535	5	/users/profile/34331	lapband4me	Client Served	5	03/18/2010	The Hugs project is an amazing group of people who truly care about our troops. Karen and the gang, never batted an eye when I asked for cold weather gear for my son and his platoon in the mountains of Afghanistan this past winter, now that things are HOT! They graciously sent over 40 cool ties to my son's platoon, making sure there were enough for everyone. They have included my son on their care package list, when I was financially unable to send packages to him. Often as a marine mom we learn of other young men and women who are deployed but who are receiving little or no mail from home. I have passed these names on to the hugs project as well, and they made sure to add them to their lists. My son called and said mom, Marine X got a package today from the Hugs Project and he said it made him so happy that someone thought of him. He couldnt believe that someone he didnt even know sent him this wonderful box. What a morale booster. Everyone always shares with each other but it is nice when you get a box addressed to you.I am so grateful for all the support my son and his fellow marines, as well as all the troops they support, receive from this outstanding organization. There just are NO words to completely express my gratitude to them. God Bless, "The Hugs Project" and all of the volunteers who work so hard to support our troops.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33525	5	/users/profile/34323	chrissysews	Volunteer	5	03/18/2010	The Hugs Project is truly an amazing selfless organization that functions solely to support and serve our military who are serving in harms way!  This group of volunteer men and women throughout our nation sacrifice their time and resources to send letters and packages from home to our service men and women, and I am deeply honored and proud to be a small part of it. The leadership of the group stretches every donated dollar for its maximum benefit on behalf of the military. They are also incredibly protective of the security of the names of our servicemen & women. It is truly an organization to be commended to the highest for its purpose and mission!

I coordinated our staff Day of Service Project and everyone came away with a sense of pride that we could contribute to such a worthy cause.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33501	5	/users/profile/34296	martin3	Client Served	5	03/18/2010	Everyone says, "been there, done that" but I really have.  Served in both Iraq and then again 2 times in Afghanistan.  America's troops are doing a hard job without adequate supplies and it's groups like The HUGS Project that keep us going and motivated.  We feel like these people are the true heroes.  We're just doing our jobs.  They don't have to do what they do but they do it because they care about us and that's better than gold.I've gotten care packages with hugs in them and just want to say thank you to each and every member who's ever packed a box or written a letter to let us know that you haven't forgotten we're still over here.May God continue blessing America and the good people of The HUGS Project.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33498	5	/users/profile/34292	rich4	Volunteer	5	03/18/2010	The Hugs project is an awesome prgram. It provides a valuable service to members of the military in harms way. I enjoy being a part of this organization as a volunteer and feel I could never do as much as they have done.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33491	5	/users/profile/34285	cheetah	Volunteer	5	03/18/2010	I had been a member of the HUGS PROJECT since 2004 after reading an article in our local paper.  My husband is a Viet Nam vet and I wanted a way to help our young men and women in the military. Even though I have never met the "hugs" members in person, I feel like I've known them forever.  We are all supportive of each other in various endeavors.  It's the best group on the Internet with the biggest heart for our troops.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33489	7	/users/profile/34283	debim1028	Volunteer	5	03/18/2010	I joined this group and many others to support my Soldier.  Evan is just back from Afghanistan.  The wonderful folks at the Hugs Project sent him several care packages during his year of deployment.  They also inspired me to work with a group of friends to make Hugs and send them to Evan's unit to help keep them cool over there!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33488	7	/users/profile/34281	croudebush	General Member of the Public	5	03/18/2010	I am so impressed with the work this group has done and is continuing to do for our military. As the mom of a soldier who has been deployed for almost a year, receiving care packages are a welcomed and treasured event. They are a connection from home and something that everyone looks forward to. Thank you to all who have had their loving hands involved in taking care of these courageous young men and women.

Hugs Project Incorporated	33481	6	/users/profile/34275	cara2	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I had been a member of other groups helping our troops, but stayed the longest the HUGS PROJECT since 2006.  The people in this group have the biggest hearts for our troops and all is given in a great grass roots effort. Ideas fly from one end of the country to the other to help everyone with any ongoing project.  We support each others sons, daughters, wives, husbands and complete strangers.  The energy these people generate is fantastic.  Groups of various sizes connected with the HUGS PROJECT are all over the country of varying degrees of members, all with the same effort of helping and letting our troops know we are here for them. The largest pitfall is obtaining money for postage, whether with the group or individually. The thank you notes we receive usually brings a lump to the throat, and many tears.  Tears of joy knowing we will never forget our troops.  I remember the returning Viet Nam troops, and I will never let that happen again.  Our troops have our backs.  The least we can do is give them a 'hug' and let them know we are here for them.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33477	4	/users/profile/34272	sew4him2004	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I joined The Hugs Project in 2006 and am now president of the Elkhart, IN chapter.  I've organized our groups here, made hugs, knit wool items for winter, bought care package items, helped with fund raisers and anything else I can to grow THP in our area.  It is a wonderful organization and I've been blessed to be part of it.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33472	7	/users/profile/34269	marinemom9933	General Member of the Public	5	03/17/2010	The Hugs Group is a wonderful organization.  I wish I could do more monetarily to help them out for all that they do.  My son is deployed to Afghanistan at this time and I know how important it is when these men receive packages and items to help make it more comfortable for them.  I am hoping when I finish school and am in a better financial situation to be able to make a contribution for them.  Thank you Hugs for all your do for our Men and Women!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33471	7	/users/profile/34268	musicgal	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I first heard of The Hugs Project in 2007 through our state extension organization, Oklahoma Home and Community Education. One of OHCE's goals was military support, and The Hugs Project serves as a channel, focusing those efforts. We received patterns and training from them and made the cooling ties ("HUGs"), learned how to pack care boxes for shipping, and enjoy the reward of knowing that what we do really makes a difference to the troops. The care packages not only boost morale and provide personal touches from home, they also supply much-appreciated items otherwise unavailable in rugged field conditions. I know The Hugs Project will be there to assist when my sons deploy, and they will know that someone besides direct family members appreciates the sacrifices they make.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33469	8	/users/profile/34266	luitwieler	Donor	5	03/17/2010	My late wife, Marlene, heard about The Hugs Project and quickly immersed herself in creating HUGS neck coolers and other useful articles. She worked by herself in Tulsa, buying all the needed materials in bulk and every month or two, we would jointly pack and ship boxes to our valiant and dedicated troops overseas. Being a Vietnam Vet, I wanted to help and Marlene  had incredible talents - so we made a good volunteer group!! We got addresses from Karen and occassionally received warm thank you notes from serviceman. One I got 2 weeks after her untimely death. Shortly thereafter I was able to give all the supplies Marlene  had accumulated for future HUGS shipments, also had a garage sale and donated the funds to HUGS. It is an awesome group with tiny overhead and lots of dedicated volunteers.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33466	7	/users/profile/34263	deb2	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I have belonged to this organization since at least 2005.  I have never seen an instance where the members of this group are doing things for them selves.  This group is all about helping our troops overseas, especially the ones in harms way.  In fact sometimes imaginations work over time and we have too many ideas for helping our troops.  The fact remains that the goal of the Hugs Project remains firm- " a Hug to those serving our country.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33426	7	/users/profile/34230	pam4	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I helped to make Hugs for this organization to send to the troops that they love so much.  My son was stationed in Iraq and was a recipient of their care packages.  Their patriotism and love of our troops puts them at the top of the list of organizations to support in any way possible.

I truly enjoyed the experience of donating materials, packing care packages and decorating the outside of those boxes that would brighten someone's day in the midst of what had to be a trying time for them.  My small children really found the experience to be therapeutic when they felt helpless in that situation.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33422	7	/users/profile/34226	kevin6	Client Served	5	03/17/2010	I received several care packages from The Hugs Project when I was deployed to Iraq during the troop Surge in 2007-2008.  When we were enduring rocket and mortar attacks almost daily, and I was separated from my family for a year while serving our country, it was very comforting to get a care package from home.  Even in these days of email and phone access, there is nothing like a care package when one is deployed.  Since my return I have volunteered for The Hugs Project.  Karen Stark and the rest of the Hugs folks are true servant leaders.  I thank God for them.-Kevin CalveyCaptain, Army National Guard
Hugs Project Incorporated	33421	9	/users/profile/34227	dsc123	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	For the past two Christmas seasons I have had the priviledge helping the HUGS PROJECT with their Christmas packages. The volunteers at HUGS are a great team. They really care about the men and women over fighting overseas. They prove that with every box they pack. When we pack boxs make some of the goodies or one of the games. We are putting a little bit of us in each of those boxs. So our men and women in the service know that we care about them.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33415	7	/users/profile/34219	linda11	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I volunteered with hugs for about 6 months and I have never been  so proud of anything in my life.  What  a wonderful organization this is. Karen  formed a small thought of love into a huge organization of  "hugs" for our serviceman and women. Thank God for all  men,women and Karen who cared enough to help in a bad situation.

The volunteers, the leadership, the dedication to keep those defending American aware that folks at home appreciate their sacrifices.  They are a 4 star in my book.

Hugs Project Incorporated	33408	7	/users/profile/34211	demi	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	It was the Christmas season of 2009, and I was looking for a place to volunteer my time and help many people. I'm so very glad to have come across The Hugs Project, because I not only found what I was looking for, but much more. The amount of items and care packages being prepared to be sent off to the troops was abundant, and the love and dedication going along with these packages was just as great. Many people are touched, helped, loved, and honored by The Hugs Project, and I can only hope and pray for further growth of the venture and it's family of volunteers.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33406	3	/users/profile/34210	yharv63	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I have worked w/The Hugs Project for 3 yrs and believe that all the bigs things and all the little things that we do let's our troops know that we stand behind them, support them, believe in them and love them.  The Hugs Project let's our troops know that we care.  We really have no idea what they go through each and every day, but when we send them something whether a letter, hug, or food item, they know that somewhere back home someone believes in what they are fighting for.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33405	3	/users/profile/34208	dij59	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I have enjoyed sharing my crafts with our troops. I have helped with sending cards and care packages to our troops.

Hugs Project Incorporated	33396	3	/users/profile/34200	katie-starkey	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I am deployed in Afghanistan, and am the MWR leader for my Unit. I am writing you to tell you how wonderful your project is. There was so much help, support, and love from all of the people that support our unit from the HUGS project that there was enough to go around and more! We all would like to thank you from the bottom of our hearts! Bev (the woman I corresponded with from HUGS)was always most helpful and always asked for requests, and no matter what we asked for, our Unit got. I had no idea that projects like this really existed with people in them that cared so much!!! We were all pretty bummed that we were spending Christmas here in Afghanistan, but the people of HUGS made it to where it wasn't so bad. They sent Christmas packages, hand-made Christmas stockings all filled with love and support that we all needed to keep us going through the Holiday Season. It's wonderful to know that someone supports us out there. Alot of times, some of the Soldiers feel like no one out there really truely appreciates what we are doing here. And it's people like you that keep our morale up! Thank you so much for everything you do! Keep it up!!! -SPC Katie Starkey
Hugs Project Incorporated	33390	7	/users/profile/34193	marsha3	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	The HUGS Project has been wonderful in sending our donated Girl Scout donated cookies to the troops.  They gladly pick up the cases of cookies at our Council and ship them to our military overseas who are anxious to receive them.  The HUGS Project and Girl Scouts have a wonderful relationship.  God Bless Karen for all her efforts!
Hugs Project Incorporated	33389	3	/users/profile/34192	traininglady911	Donor	5	03/17/2010	It has been my privilege to participate in my small way sewing "HUGS" for The Hugs Project.  It amazes me that what started as basically a "one woman show" (Karen Stark) now has over 2000 members nationwide and serves troops all over the world.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33388	4	/users/profile/34191	eharnois	Volunteer	4	03/17/2010	I've been involved with the Hugs Project since my son first deployed to Iraq.  It enabled me to supply my son and his platoon with cooling ties to help with the heat of summer.  It was probably as much as a help for me to be doing something for my son and his friends as it was for the Marines.  The cooling ties were a big help.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33385	5	/users/profile/34187	pattipat	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	I have worked with the hugs project for several years.  They are a very hard working group of people who offer an enormous amount of love and support to our troops, their families and to those of us who try to do our part.  I feel privileged to be a small part of this group.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33384	5	/users/profile/34185	kissa	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	We wandered into The Hugs Project one day, to have family pictures taken as a fundraiser for the group.  We didn't leave for several hours after, as we got involved in repackaging items for the care packages.  Karen and Ray don't believe in wasting space in the boxes, so many things are repackaged in ziploc bags.  My 5-year old even got to be involved as a "Bunny basher".  His first job was to smash hollow chocolate candies into pieces, so the soldiers could have chocolate, and no empty air was shipped overseas.  I've packed boxes, filled and tied hand-crocheted neck pillows (or lumbar pillows), filled the tubes that make Hugs, ironed, etc.  Karen and Ray don't let anyone feel like they're a stranger, even going so far as to "adopt" my toddler son and include him in the happenings of the group. On another trip, I turned empty RX bottles into "boo-boo kits" with minor first aid supplies that soldiers could carry easily.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33380	5	/users/profile/34182	f312y	Client Served	5	03/17/2010	I was in Iraq and received packages from the Hugs Project from all over the USA. It was very special to see how many people really do care about us over there. It made me feel good for days after opening a box.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33368	5	/users/profile/34173	dawn23o	Volunteer	5	03/17/2010	My husband is retired Navy. We were looking for a way to help support our Military overseas and found this wonderful group. We have enjoyed gathering and making items to send to them. I make ornaments, wash cloths, soap socks. We write note cards to include with each item we send. My husband and I want each soldier to know they are being prayed for daily. It is our way of sending them a HUG. Thank you Karen for allowing us to be part of your charity.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33363	5	/users/profile/34169	twickmann	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	This group has been an invaluable aide in my desire to show my support of our Troops in a tangible way. Rather than me trying to guess what I think they need, the group provides specific guidelines and patterns so that the items I send to the troops is effective for their needs.It also helps me to know that I am not alone in my feelings for these brave soldiers.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33360	5	/users/profile/34167	leelu	Donor	5	03/16/2010	I had been looking for a way to support the troops since my husband, who had been in Viet Nam, came home. I drove to Tacoma, WA, to keep him from experiencing the jeers and taunts of the crowds at the air field. I googled and found "cool ties" and The Hugs Project came up. I knew that was the way!! I thank the Lord each day for what we can do to keep the troops safe from Heat Stroke and send our love to them in Care packages.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33356	5	/users/profile/34159	susan21	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	The Hugs Project puts their heart and soul into making care packages for soliders overseas at their own expense.  When you do something from the heart, that is what counts.  I myself have been involved with The Hugs Project for 3 years now and I consider it an honor to make cool ties and send them off to our troops.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33352	5	/users/profile/34157	anita3	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	I have been involved with the HUGS project for about 4 years.  This fantastic organization has helped me with projects to support our troops and veterans.  They have been a font of information regarding rules and regulations for care packages, given lists of needed items etc.  They have sent my relatives many different care  packages.  They are a Godsend to our troops.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33351	5	/users/profile/34156	wildcatfan45	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	I went to a Marine reunion in OK in 2006 and met Karen and Ray who started this project. I was so impressed with what they were doing, and the fact that it was 100% volunteer that I brought it to Western KY. I found in short order that our troops appreciated this effort a great deal. My son who served in Iraq told me "you know dad, I love the packages you send me, you know me so well you know just what to send. But, when I get a package from Ok, Tx, Fl, NY or some other place from people I don't even know, it means so much. Those are people who don't "have" to support me but they do. And it's special". I also found that there were SO MANY of our troops that were not getting ANYTHING from home. The more involved I got, the bigger our small group got. THANK YOU to this project for allowing us to be a part of a great group of people who's only objective is to show love and support to those who deserve it so much. Our troops give their all for us, the least we can do is show them we care. Thanks to The Hugs Project and it's affiliates all over the world, we are able to do that in a big way. Thanks to the donors and volunteers, it is a success. BUT, in order for it to continue, it takes YOU. Donors and volunteers are needed always. The more donors and volunteers, the more love and support that can be shown. No matter how large or how small, everyone can do something. Donate funds, donate items or donate your time... just do something to show your support.
Hugs Project Incorporated	33349	4	/users/profile/34154	jodig	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	i have been a member of the hugs projects for several years..the people are wonderful..we all come together like a family and make things happen for our troops.. I have submitted troops that needed care packages and have never been denied one sent to anyone and great reviews from the recipients.  Love this organization and we all love and support our troops and each other.
Hugs Project Incorporated	32979	9	/users/profile/33807	bevd1	Volunteer	5	03/11/2010	I became familiar with the organization The HUGS Project several years ago when I was looking for a way to support our troops.  I sew for my sanity breaks and discovered I could not only sew for me time in the evenings but also help the troops at the same time.  I then started recruiting other friends to help me sew and it started evolving in other ways as well.  I felt I could still do so much more.  I knew Karen and her crew sent care packages to the troops as well as letters of support and to help bring comfort and joy to someone's day.I asked Karen for a name of a soldier to write to  about 6 months later and it has been increasing since that day.  This past Christmas my family and friends had a care package drive and knit a-thon.  We collected 125 knitted or crocheted washcloths, 75 knitted wool hats, 300 hand made Christmas stockings and the stuff to fill them with, and over 300 handmade Christmas cards with blessing for our troops from a local 5th grade class.  We packaged up and shipped off over 400 lbs of oatmeal, hot chocolate mix, snacks, candy and chocolate to the troops.  If it wasnt for The HUGS project we would not have been able to rally this much support and have a place to ship to our troops.I currently send care packages to a chaplain in the remote hills of Afghanistan with a group large of men.  These guys have no PX or base and so anything that is sent is greatly appreciated.  I am currently sending to my 3rd Chaplain at this same location and my current as well as the 2 previous men who have held this position always are grateful for anything they get. I also send letters and care packages to a wonderful young gal in Afghanistan and a Maj in Iraq.  Over the past several years I have support numerous personnel serving in the middle east and as one comes home and get a new name of someone else to ship to.As I do not know of anyone serving in the military but feel I would like to brighten up someones day.  Karen and the HUGS Project has introduced me to some pretty awesome people who support, sew for and send care packages to our troops.  My husband and I are truly blessed that I stumbled across The HUGS Project website and feel we have been able to help in our small way.Anything we can do to help support Karen and The HUGS Project in making our troops feel a little piece of home always makes a great day.Mark & Bev DeLisleSouth Haven, MI
Hugs Project Incorporated	32972	13	/users/profile/33801	441-aeas-cc	Client Served	5	03/11/2010	Dear Oklahoma City Hugs Project,      I am Lt Col C. Todd Prejean, Commander of the 441st Air Expeditionary Advisory Squadron currently deployed in Afghanistan.  I just wanted to take the time to write a quick thank you note for the care packages that we received from your organization.  I am unable to put into words the gratitude that we feel as a result of your selfless and patriotic gesture of goodwill.  This is especially true during the holiday season where all my troops are far away from their loved ones.  As you might imagine that are many needs to be filled in Afghanistan.  Because we fly re-supply helicopters and the unforgiving terrain of Afghanistan, we are the only link to food supplies for many people.  I would also like to tell you that some of the things you guys sent are being given to the Afghan children.  Few Americans can comprehend the hardships and poverty some of these children in remote areas face.  I did not think you would mind considering there is nothing more American than helping less fortunate people out.  I wish I could explain to you the impact you have had on my unit as well as many Afghan locals.  It is people like you that make America great.  God Bless and Merry Christmas!

Hugs Project Incorporated	32923	7	/users/profile/28209	two-dozen	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	I have worked with the Hugs Chapter in Lilburn, Ga for several years now, and it's such a rewarding feeling to be able to do something for our Troops overseas in return for all they do for us. I look forward to the times that I can work with our group in making the hug ties, preparing packages or even gathering items for mailings. It's amazing how much something so 'trivial' to us, such as a Q-Tip can mean so much to someone in the 'fields'. It's the least I can do!I would like to thank the Oklahoma group for even starting the Hugs Project. It's touched so many lives. As a parent of a son who will be starting his military career in a couple of years, I'm relieved to know that there's a group like this that will help take care of some of his needs.Thanks Hugs Project - for all you do and for letting me help you do it!!!
Hugs Project Incorporated	32906	5	/users/profile/33735	president15	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	The only thing better than receiving a letter from home is receiving a package from home. The unfortunate reality is that many of our service members are forgotten or don't have a close circle of friends or family who regularly support them, especially while deployed. And even those troops who have support need to see and feel the gratitude of a grateful nation.The HUGS Project makes sure that our troops are not forgotten, that they understand they serve a nation that deeply appreciates their sacrifices. The packages sent by The HUGS Project to our deployed service members are done so well. The boxes are heartfelt and made with so much love and consideration. Not only are the boxes from the heart, but so many of the contents are useful in the field. From letters of thanks from grateful school children to foot powder and their famous COOL TIES, these packages make a difference to the individual troop and the morale of the unit he or she is serving.My personal experience with HUGS has been ongoing for nearly four months now. This past Christmas I served alongside hundreds of dedicated volunteers as nearly 4,000 troops received a HUG from home! It was an amazing experience I look forward to being a part of as long as our military is protecting our freedoms.What's more is that nearly every penny of every dollar in donations goes directly to the contents of the packages or to postage getting the boxes there.I highly commend the leadership of The HUGS Project for their tireless service and dedication to our miliary. From a former active duty Marine, I extend my highest commendation to the organization and the many incredible people that make up the volunteer force. You have a reputation for being faithful. So I salute you with a full-voiced "Semper Fi."Thank you for all that you do to support our troops around the world.Steven Anderson

I made sure to donate what I could before leaving knowing first hand what Soldiers and Marines far from home are going through.  I am currently deployed and part of a very small detachment unit and the HugsProject made us feel very special, no matter how many people we were.  One of my soldiers missed the birth of his first child and the HugsProject was there, sending him warm wishes.  I can't thank people enough who volunteer their time and keep the soldiers in their hearts and minds even after many years at war.  Thank you HugsProject for doing what you do, you truely impact every recipient.

OK Save A Dog	315651		/users/profile/406958	okiedokiedeb	Client Served	5	10/27/2016	This organization is fantastic! We adopted a pup (Toby/now Buddy) from them in April when he was about 8-9 weeks old.  He came to us healthy and well-taken care of, as well as chipped and neutered. I know he was in excellent health because I took him to my vet, immediately (just a habit of mine). I already had 3 cats and 2 dogs so I did not HAVE to get another!  I CHOSE to get Buddy from OKSAD because of it's great reputation (multiple family members have adopted from them). The length of the form and the scrutiny of the questions made me nervous about "passing muster"; however, I took no offense because they want their dogs to be well-taken care of and well-loved for the rest of their lives!! Thankfully, OKSAD gave us custody of this vibrant, bright-eyed sweetheart and he has changed the lives of my husband and me!! Rest assured, my future dogs will all come from this wonderful organization I KNOW I can trust! I have no doubt every dollar raised is used for the rescue and care of these precious souls--I wish I had a million dollars to give them!

OK Save A Dog	315240	2	/users/profile/406564	Writer	Donor	5	10/27/2016	I have been donating to OK Save A Dog for some time.  Not only do they pull dogs from shelters but being in a rural setting, they take in the dogs that are dumped in the country.  To see the transition of the dogs that are taken in is amazing.  The time and dedication of all involved to foster and attend adoption events might seem overwhelming to some but the OK Save A Dog team does it consistently and constantly.  They really go the extra mile.

I've not only adopted 3 dogs from them, I've visited there numerous times and the place is clean and very well kept. There are no cages. They are about saving lives, even lives of the not so perfect or not so adorable or those in need of big medical care.  Oklahoma is very blessed to have them saving lives and educating adopters! They are always willing to take back any dog they've adopted out.

They had found the momma and her 5 pups in a hoarder home. When I met Piper she was in a foster home with her brother woody. It was love at first sight. About a year later I got a message from Pipers foster saying that Izzy, Pipers sister had been returned to the rescue because her owner went off to college and didn't want her. I immediately jumped in the car, made the hour drive to the rescue and met Pipers sister, Izzy. I got to meet Kim, the head honcho of the rescue and she is such a caring and hard working lady! Best advice and customer service one could ask for. An adoption fee and a signature later Izzy was packed in my car and on her way to her new home. OK Save A Dog is such a wonderful organization that helps so many animals in need.. that with out them, they would die! 5 stars all the way around!

We drove up from Sherman, TX to view a dog we found on Pet Finder.  Kim is very impressive, completely devoted to rescuing and caring for dogs.  Prospective adopters are screened to find the dogs proper forever-homes.  Since that original experience I have made contributions in cash and in kind, and recently discovered a portion of Amazon purchases can be donated through Amazon Smile, which I put in place immediately.

Little Molly-dog had been a hoarder rescue and it was immediately obvious that she had a very special place in OK Save A Dog's hearts as well.

We have adopted  others that have moved out with our grown kids. The dogs are known by the volunteers at the rescue so they can be paired well with prospective families. Dogs at the rescue roam free in fenced enclosures rather than having to be caged. This means their interaction with other animals can be observed which,  again, results in better placements.Commitment to the animals is paramount at this rescue. Sometimes that results in unhappy people (who don't get a dog unsuited for their home) but that's okay. OKSave a Dog exists solely to save dogs and improve their lives.

Then later we adopted Eddie, our sweet Jack Russell.  Both have been wonderful dogs.  I have seen a lot of rescues come and go, but OKSAD has been steadfast in their passion and dedication to improving the lives of the abandoned dogs in the area.  They have taken what little money they get from donations to improve their facilities and have expanded their abilities but have never profited from it.

They have a great skill set for saving and working with the dogs, they provide an excellent place for them and they work tirelessly to get them adopted to good forever homes.  They have taken in animals from hoarders and such many times to help out the community and of course, the dogs.  In my opinion, they are the absolute best dog rescue in our area, perhaps the state of Oklahoma.  They are not publicity hounds but instead work around the clock doing work that most of us couldn't do.  They have committed their lives to helping those that can't help themselves.

We did NOT want to return Poppy - my heart is broken and I miss her terribly!  But she attacked our 5 lb Yorkie and put a gash on her head requiring staples from ear to ear.  The Yorkie will be ok, but EVERYONE, including our vet, said it was a bad idea to try to keep Poppy now.  (Weve had Yorkie 9 years, Poppy almost 4 years) They said the risk of finding Yorkie dead sometime was too high.  Poppy and I had a great connection and I feel like I lost part of me.  I was trying to find a home for Poppy myself and Kim wrote me the most hateful, hurtful email!  TO ANYONE WHO ADOPTS FROM THIS WOMAN - FIRST THING TO DO - have your dog rechipped to you! SECOND, If you ever find yourself in our position - DO NOT RETURN YOUR PET TO HER! Do whatever you can to find your dog a home!  Kim will make you feel like dirt!

I went out to their facility and was incredibly impressed by how calm all the animals were. None of the frenetic fear that you see at a shelter. Huge pens for the dogs, separated, and with shelter from the weather. It was like going to someone's house who happened to have a LOT of dogs, rather than a rescue facility. I cannot praise Kim and Sunshine enough for their hard work and dedication to the animals they rescue!

These two dedicated individuals don't just rescue and re-home, they are truly dedicated to this cause.  They will not allow their rescued pups to go to any home, it must be the right home.  Their primary goal saving as many hopeless and condemned dogs as they can and finding them the best forever home available.   They will never allow an intact pet to leave their kennels, thereby alleviating the need for anymore abandoned, unwanted dogs.   After adoption they are available to answer questions, provide advice, educate and they alway love reports from the adopters about how the new family member is doing.  A great organization, with dedicated, knowledgeable people who really care about their wards and the people who adopt them.  Do yourself a favor if you want to adopt look to OK Save A Dog first.

I tucked my old dogs picture into my shirt on my heart and knew she would guide me and guide she did.  I found Ok Save a Dog and my sweet Nana there waiting to be adopted. I knew right away she was the one.  Since that day Ok Save a Dog has become like family.

Her dogs are not kept in cages, they have fenced yards and shelter.  She has different yards for different sizes of dogs, and the small dogs even have access to her home via a doggy door.  She loves each one as her own and has a vested interest in successful adoptions.  You may apply for one pup, and she might suggest another based on information on your application.  Sure she has cute little puppies, but she also has taken on dogs from hoarder situations, starving abandoned dogs, and even handicapped dogs.  She is OCD on cleanliness.  She is what every rescue group should aspire to be.  God bless the OK Save A Dog rescue and many thanks for all of the lives they have saved and all of the happy homes they have approved!

Our family dog had died the summer before and we missed her so much, we felt like our family was not complete without a four legged family member. I had been looking for a rescued dog online for months and always ended up back at OK Save A Dog's site. Their dogs were always happy and healthy looking after they had a chance to care for them and let them come to know they were safe and loved. I balked at the strict application rules a bit a first but, when we had looked all over town at shelters and other rescue places, I realized they were the best-they were there for the dogs welfare and only had their best interests in mind. That is the way it should be. When we drove out to see them after our application had been accepted, I was astonished at the cleanliness and well appointed facilities they maintained for the dogs. Dogs of all sizes and shapes were playing and wagging there tails, not cooped up in crates or small pens. It was very impressive and you could tell that they lived for these little guys. They made sure that we understood our responsibility, helped make sure that we were matched with the right pet for us, and we left with a healthy, happy, neutered and vet vaccinated and checked pup. He has been a perfect fit for us and the following year we adopted another one, this time an older girl who they saved the day before she was to be put down at the shelter. She gave birth to healthy puppies the next day! They had a foster care for them until they were weaned and old enough to be with there own new families and she is a happy spoiled little girl now, we all couldn't be happier. I strongly recommend OK Save A Dog, their knowledge, care, and dedication is outstanding. I have often heard of these folks referred to as angels, I think that might be right.

This is definitely the best pet adoption facility in Oklahoma and probably among the other surrounding states as well. The owners take exceptional care of every pet they take in as if they were their own and pets are very well groomed and already spayed/neutered and vaccinated. There is no better way to adopt a pet than from OKSAD. We will definitely adopt all of our pets from now on from them.

I looked at the listing and realized they were about an hour drive from us, so I applied on line to adopt one of the puppies and once approved, we drove out to OK Save a Dog and met Kim.  The dogs were all so well cared for and it was obvious they were happy and loved there.  Of course the one we were interested in was one of four from the litter and Kim told us another couple was driving up from Texas to take one of the males, but we could have our pick of the males.  Well call us crazy, but we ended up adopting one of the males and both the females that day and have since adopted two more from Kim.  I love her dedication to the animals.  Some people complain about rescues having adoption applications, etc.  I say great, if you can't be bothered to fill out an application to get a new member of your family, then you probably won't be bothered to care for them.

Right there in the middle of small town Oklahoma is a Wonder. A person who has done this on her own for over 10 years resulting in the rescue and placement of over 6,000 dogs!  Six thousand dogs!  It's hard work rescuing just one dog. It must be evaluated, vetted, bathed, photographed, advertised and most of all loved. I applaud anyone that's rescued even one dog, but thousands of dogs - it's unheard of.  It just doesn't happen. Bravo and a standing ovation for Kim and OK Save A Dog in Prague OK ! ! ! ! !

Not only do they rescue animals from all kinds of bad situations, they see that they get whatever care they need when they get there (including vetting), they are kept in the best of conditions possible, and are certainly non-profit - I don't see how they do it! And, when it comes to adoption, they are very cautious in seeing that the dog is placed in a good, loving, forever home with the proper environment conducive to a life-long  happy relationship for both the pet and the pet's new family (human and otherwise). In my books, they are just the BEST all the way around!

Feed The Children, Inc.	236887	5	/users/profile/321072	rlc01	Volunteer	5	01/15/2015	I volunteered at the Bethlehem, PA location of Feed the Children and it was such a great experience. I felt like the time spent there packing boxes made such an impact and that all the work they do at their location was so important. All the people I met there were so much fun to work with and it was so obvious that they cared about the work they were doing. I absolutely recommend going to volunteer for a few hours and taking the time to ask some questions and learn about all of the other ways volunteers can be involved. 
Feed The Children, Inc.	161500	4	/users/profile/214206	THE RIVER FUND NEW YORK	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/26/2013	Feed the Children is an exceptional organization that has been able to make a significant impact in the lives of thousands of children by partnering intelligently with effective direct-service organizations in every part of the country that care for needy kids. As Chief Production Officer for one such organization (The River Fund New York) based in New York Citys largest borough, I have direct interaction with key operatives at Feed the Children on a regular basis. The level of professionalism and expertise that these individuals bring to the table allows Feed the Children to define and implement the most effective use of available resources. As a team, Feed the Children develops smart programs to support direct-service organizationsand then aggressively goes into the market to find the appropriate corporate and foundation support to make those programs work. Operating since 21 years, The River Fund New York has been a partner with Feed the Children for a long time and we have always enjoyed working with them. However, our appreciation for the organization grew even deeper with the tremendous support we received during the immediate aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. As the very first Emergency Food Program to get into the Flood Zones behind the storm, we at The River Fund needed all the help we could get. Feed the Children was quick to respond to some of the special needs of the situation: Not only did they make large quantities of food available, they also channeled substantial quantities of cleaning supplies to uswhich were desperately needed for distribution to families whose homes were inundated by muddy flood waters. Of course, our work in the Sandy Flood Zones continuessince thousands of families and seniors who were already struggling before the storm still require our ongoing support. Feed the Children continues to be an outstanding partner with us, and calls on us regularly with ideas and ways of assisting us to deliver more help to those in need. The relationship we have established with Feed the Children is a major source of encouragement to us as we continue in our Mission to feed and empower those we serve to move beyond the lines of poverty. Thank you very much for the opportunity to endorse this outstanding organization.

Because of the generous donations of goods we receive from Feed the Children we are better enabled to provide badly needed supplies to the impoverished Native Americans that live in remote high mountain desert areas of the Southwest. This wonderful organization donated school supplies that we handed out to very poor Native Children  on the reservations. Without this wonderful giving these tiny scholars would have gone to school missing the barest essentialsnotebook paper and binders. The Indian schools on the reservation also give special thanks for your support.  I cant speak highly enough about the staff. The people that we work with at Feed the Children are joyfully committed, very helpful, and extremely well organized.  I rate this organization five stars. Feed the Children is a great asset to Wings of Faith. We are grateful for the generous giving and I look forward to continuing our partnership.

Feed The Children, Inc.	160661	1	/users/profile/213017	Donna Kakavecos	Client Served	5	06/14/2013	I work for a large, national, faith-based not-for-profit food bank who receives regular donations from Feed The Children.  One of their regular donations to us are boxes of miscellaneous non-food items.  The agencies we serve love them and always anticipate opening the boxes to inspect the contents.  One of the not-for-profit organizations that we support on the west side of Indianapolis received a box with an assortment of extra large gauze pads.  The director of the pantry wasn't sure if she'd ever be able to "move" them out of the pantry but decided to place them on an "unlimited" table within the pantry.  When they opened the doors for their pantry, the first client was a veteran in a wheelchair who had lost his leg in a war while serving our country.  Due to a sore at the amputation site, he was unable to wear his prosthesis.  He needed extra large gauze pads to place between the prosthesis and the amputation site - and there they were just for him just when he needed them.  What a blessing for him and for the pantry workers to witness.

As such the support we receive from Feed the Children is extremely valuable and completely on point. In the aftermath of the recent superstorm Sandy that ravaged several areas of Queens and Brooklyn, The River Fund New York was, in many instances, the very FIRST food provider to get into the areas hardest hit by Sandysetting up in minutes and serving substantial quantities of ready-to-eat foods to the residents. We were so well-equipped to handle this situation because for 18 of our 21 years of service, The River Fund New York has been operating the ONLY mobile pantry program in New York City, taking care of extremely needy families in New Yorks most desperate communitieswhich gives us quite a depth of experience and well-practiced teams. Coordinating with Members of Congress and other officials with access to the best and most up-to-date information, within 36 hours of the storm, we were first on the ground. In addition to being there first, we also recognized the importance of bringing in baby supplies to the people in these hard-hit locations. This included diapers, infant formula (of all kinds and for every age), baby bottles, special vitamins for pregnant and lactating mothers and children vitamins. We took care of more than 10,000 families in this way (of which some 34% had small children). In this hour of need, Feed the Children rose to the challenge of helping us replenish substantial quantities of critically-needed items24 pallets of material ranging from baby food and diapers to Clorox bleach and other cleaning supplies that were absolutely vital in the post-Sandy clean-up effort. Our partnership with Feed the Children continues to make an enormous difference in the lives of New Yorks most needy.
Feed The Children, Inc.	145498	1	/users/profile/191992	Carolyn43	Client Served	5	12/01/2012	My name is CB Beckwith. I have been the Vendor and Transportation Coordinator for Riverwalk Food Ministry located in Texas for the past 18 years. We have been with Feed the Chrildren, Inc, (FTC) for 18 years and have grown with them. Very sad to have to say our food ministry has just closed November 30, 2012 due to fininacial issues, but, I wanted to share  how mportant FTC has been to the growth of this ministry.  We have a food distribution every Tuesday morning that  feeds approxumately 250 to 300  families weekly, (approxmately 50,000 annually).  Without FTC we could not have continued to grow and feed the amount of people we have fed. Whether it is food, clothes, medical items,  drinks, sheets, toys, coats and mittens we have always had a large crowd of people who need these items. The staff of FTC  is very friendly, courteous and helpful and will assist you with whatever needs you have. As soon as they educate or train, If you will, us as the client how to handle all the paperwork getting it back to them in a timely manner certainly helps everyone invovled to get the  job done. I have enjoyed working with FTC and wish them continued growth and success in doing the Lord's work in feeding the children. Thank you.

Professional, very caring, above board, and super efficient are the words I use to describe Feed the Children.  One would need to search far and wide to find a better organization to donate to.

I also worked with a church that needed many supplies , snacks and water to assist with youth camps and other projects.  Feed The Children made all of the projects I worked on very successful!

When recently applying for membership with Feed the Children they walked me through the application process smoothly and quickly in order to get supplies to us as soon as possible.  The items I received have been a great addition to what we have to offer our teachers, books, craft items, children's magazines and more.  Thank you Feed the Children for your work in feeding children not only food for the body, but food for the mind as well.

Feed The Children, Inc.	102879	7	/users/profile/136135	LifesaverM	General Member of the Public	4	01/04/2012	During the FTC's turmoil I ceased donating money until I was satisfied the problem was resolved. I would like to point out to the last reviewer and all who may see this, the person being referred to with the home has nothing to do with FTC anymore, and has not for over a year. FTC's board has gone to great lengths to repair the damage done, refine their accounting processes, and become an accountable organization again. As a board member of a non-profit myself, I feel satisfied that they have taken the necessary measures to insure their practices are "kosher". As such I have again become a donor and happily do so.
Feed The Children, Inc.	100308	2	/users/profile/121994	cacbused	General Member of the Public	1	11/05/2011	Sorry, but whether the allegations are true or not this organization needs to do some self-reflection in my opinion.  How can you ask for money for starving children from middle class families struggling themselves when the owners/priciples are living in million dollar houses?? Why not sell your million dollar house and buy one in the $250k range? That 750K would feed a lot of starving people and show how living humble and serving is the best example for your potential donors. If nothing else, use the other 750k to establish a perpetual trust that supports the stated mission.  That way investment gains could be used to broaden the scope of the operation.  Until then I doubt most donors are going to find sympathy for your situation (legal or otherwise).
Feed The Children, Inc.	93709		/users/profile/107990	Tynese Taylor	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/11/2011	Open Door Church of God In Christ located in Brooklyn NY has been in existence for over 30 years providing food, clothes and other resources to individuals and families in need.  Since our partnership with Feed the Children we have been able to reach thousands of people distributing items that we picked up from their warehouse.  FTC has been a part of our ministry program for over 10 years.  It is truly a blessing to have support from this organization.  Most importantly, the needs for the less fortunate are being met.  Feed the Children supplies are countless and the staff is always helpful. I am so thankful Feed the Children helps us make a difference to over 2,000 clients a week in need of food and other items made possible through a organization named FEED THE CHILDREN.  Thank you and the Bedford Stuyvesant Community thanks you also.
Feed The Children, Inc.	85146	1	/users/profile/94804	Terry Jones	Volunteer	5	04/11/2011	Resurrection Life Church has worked with Feed the Children for fifteen years and we have had many excellent experiences with this fine organization.  If I had to pick one special event which they made possible, it would have to be what occurred after the Oklahoma City bombing.   Our church worked closely with all the affected families for many months and still maintain contact with a number of them. Many families lost their children on that terrible day.  The devestating effects of that tragedy ripped a huge hole in the hearts and souls of the families, to a point where most of them could not be around children because of their painful memories. We decided that with your help, we would sponsor a special Christmas event for the poor children in the neighborhood.  Along with the staff at Feed the Children, we decided to pass out food and presents to the children and invited the families who lost children in the bombing to come to the event for an evening of healing.  Almost all the family members showed up, but with understandably guarded emotions. We placed all the gifts along one wall seperated by age and gender.  Then we placed long tables in front of the presents with an army of volunteers behind the tables and placed chairs in front of the tables where we had the family members sit and wait for the doors to open with the excited kids. The Lord was present that evening as the children sat on the laps of the family members.  After hugs and kisses were given as thank yous for the beautiful presents Feed the Children had donated, the family members allowed themselves to feel joy (many for the first time since April 19th.)  So not only were hundreds of children blessed due to the generosity of Feed the Children, but many greiving victims were also. This is just one of hundreds of stories we have about our experience with Feed the Children and the wonderful people who run the show in Oklahoma City and around the country.

Over the past 42 years we have treated more than 40,000 men and women for serious substance abuse problems.  Feed the Children has been of immeasurable help to us in our goal of bringing treatment to the indigent by making hudreds of thousands of dollars worth of groceries, medical supplies and cleaning supplies available to us at not cost.  During a very cold Winter, they supplied us with hundreds of warm sweaters.  This fills a huge need for us with no cost, allowing us to use the dollars elsewhere.  And it's so simple.  They fax us the information about what is available for pick-up and we tell them what we can use, then we pick it up.   It couldn't be easier.  Thank you Feed the Children!

Feed The Children, Inc.	82391		/users/profile/90797	Lee Younce	Board Member	5	03/16/2011	     Feed the Children is one of the most important and valued assets to the thousands of non-profit organizations they serve, including Victory Christian Childrens Ministries / Operation:  Feed - A - Child which serves more than 5000 children in need on a weekly basis.  Feed the Children is one of the greatest blessings any benevolent organization could ever ask for.  They are professional in all their dealings and are very above board with all their recipients as well as their donors.  We are very proud to be a recipient of Feed the Children supplies and food donations and are very very impressed with the accounting of all donations that they distribute to their various agencies.  Feed the Children is indeed one of the finest charities in America and their professionalism is unsurpassed as far as I am concerned.
Feed The Children, Inc.	82358		/users/profile/90748	Laura Rhea	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/16/2011	I am the CEO of a statewide faith-based, free foodbank in Arkansas.  We have been a distribution partner with Feed The Children for over 20 years.  When FTC has food to share, they call or email.  When we face shortages in food, we call them and they respond. When disasters hit Arkansas and we request assistance, they respond in a big way.   As a Christian organization, one of our most important resources is to pray for whatever we need, and more times than I can count, the way God answers our prayers is through Feed The Children.   FTC also seems to do a good job of inspecting the agencies they partner with, to make sure the food is not sold, traded, or used for purposes other than feeding the hungry.  There is a pretty intensive application and inspection process, which I would think their donors, especially food donors, would appreciate.   Many foodbanks charge a shared maintenance fee, so donated food ends up costing the hunger agency.  That is never the case with Feed The Children, and they do not allow their recipients to charge for the food either.  I appreciate that donated food is given away based on need, not on how much money the charity has to spend.

The foundation maximizes every dollar received, in serving the best interests of these children.

I also travel on an annual LWB medical trip, where I photograph children before and after cleft lip and palate surgery.  Like all other LWB volunteers, I travel at my own expense.  I also donate to this charity's medical fund, and I sponsor a child in foster care.  I would not volunteer my time and donate my money to a charity that wasn't absolutely transparent and fiscally responsible.  I am so grateful that this charity exists to advocate for orphaned and impoverished children who otherwise would have little hope.  Volunteering with LWB has changed my life.

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	288685	2	/users/profile/223143	cherylchina	Volunteer	5	05/05/2016	I've volunteered since 2011 with this organization. I watched them grow from just a group of adoptive parents thinking about how they could help one little boy to an world-wide organization of volunteers who have helped so many children in China. They have many programs such as  healing homes, foster care programs, Believe in Me school programs, unity initiatives that help poor families get the surgeries for their children so they don't have to abandon them, life-skills programs for older orphans, nutrition, care-give training and more. LWB is not the kind of organization that puts out sad advertisements to get people to donate. LWB does the work, gets the kids help, and report back to the donors how the children are doing. The kids are not just a name or a number, Each child is a story of how people pulled together, sometimes in most difficult of circumstances and how healing and transformation takes place. In the Changzhi Foster Care program, we have had 22 children get adopted and each of them was much more prepared for transition into a forever family because of the love and care they got in a foster family instead of an orphanage.  It is all possible not only because of the dedication of our volunteers, it is the strong dedication of our thousands of sponsors who donate and support these children and the programs that help them. For an idea of some ways LWB is making a difference see for yourself. https://www.lovewithoutboundaries.com/impact-report/

They are able to take on responsibilities such as identifying children in need, creating a plan, execute it in hours and save a life. Not only save a life but take it through medical treatment, healing, and into foster homes with families who care for them in a natural family setting instead of an orphanage. They run educational programs for orphans who would not get to go to school, fund higher education for kids who are so poor their families or the relative they may be living with can't afford. There are so many things LWB does seamlessly and so many lives are touched especially those of us who do the work.

It took a long time because he was very ill but they never gave up. He received his cleft lip repair surgery in China and LWB took care of him until he was healed. They then placed him in a loving foster home. There he was loved and cared for until I could bring him home. After this I started donating to this amazing program so other children could get the same love and care my son received. LWB saved my sons life I will forever be thankful.

LWB not only works with orphans but are dedicated to helping prevent orphans through their Unity Initiative and also for children left behind from working parents.  It speaks volumes to the depths of the love from this organization for the children.

Great team of mostly volunteers that make a high impact for each dollar used.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	216877	1	/users/profile/280400	lksweeney6	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	One of the qualities of LWB that helped me choose to sponsor a child was the low overhead costs and volunteer workforce.  When I actually visited one of the LWB healing homes, I came home and immediately applied to volunteer for them since I saw what a tangible difference LWB care makes in the lives of orphans in China.  We now have adopted our daughter who benefitted from LWB care and I now have personal experience all around that LWB really lives their motto, "Every Child Counts."
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	274027	2	/users/profile/363363	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/08/2015	Love Without Boindaries is run by volunteers.  Not even the founder or CEO take a salary or payment of any kind.  Entirely through donations and volunteer work, they are able to help orphans in China get healthy enough for surgery, get life-saving surgery, get well post surgery, and move into wonderful foster care with real village and city families. They also provide "Believe In Me" schools in orphanages for children with visible special needs or disabilities that prevent them from attending regular school.  And in the last few years a growing program called "Unity" allows donors to fund surgeries for children still in their families, so that families can remain together - families that may have otherwise had no choice but to abandon their child so that the child's life could be saved, as they simply do not have the money to pay for surgery or care.  Love Without Boundaries is the real deal and I feel lucky to play a small role in all this charity accomplishes. 
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	274026	2	/users/profile/363362	Snow M.	Volunteer	5	12/08/2015	I am a volunteer of the LWB. I came from China and knowing the huge needs of the orphaned children to get help to have a better life and better opportunities.  In China, most orphaned children are not only having challenges to stay alive but also are disabled and have physical and psychological difficulties. There also are some children who are not orphaned but have sever diseases which require money to get treatment, but their parents are too poor to get the proper treatment they need. Love without boundaries foundation not only help the children in the orphanage, but also help children in poor families to get the care they need: medical care, education needs, nutrition needs and the materials for their daily living.  Love without boundaries foundation are not only help children but also help the childrens parents if there were need and all the volunteers are working hard and doing their best to help those they need. Most of the volunteers are not Chinese and some of them may not even know much about China but we all are working together to help as much as we can to change the Chinese orphanage childrens life. I love this foundation because the whole organizations unconditional love to the children and their work. Volunteering in love without boundaries foundation really can make huge deference of those childrens lifeI am proud of being part of it!Please support our foundation!

They are committed to helping as many children as possible in China. They are primarily staffed by volunteers so their overhead costs are low. It's an amazing charity!

This organization's commitment to helping children in China, both those with families and without, is truly impressive. I am proud to now work as a volunteer with them. There are very few paid staff in the organization, so that more of the donation money can help the children it is intended for. I don't have words for how grateful I am that they helped save my daughter's life.

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98269		/users/profile/116688	Brandi D.	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2011	The work Love Without Boundaries is doing is inspirational.  The lives they touch priceless and uncountable.  From the children in their programs to the foster parents, from the doctors on cleft exchanges to the parents who adopt a child that otherwise may have died from a complicated heart defect they are reaching out with compassion and often what appears to be emotions raw from the loses.   They have several educational programs that are changing children's lives.  I know of at least two orphans in recent weeks who passed college/university entrance exams because of the work LWB does.  They help children in preschool all the way through college.  Many of these children would not have had educational opportunities without them because of being orphaned or because of poverty. They provide funding for orphans and rural children, and they provide training for teachers.   The people of this organization are what make it so great.  They are changing the world one child at a time.

They are the first foundation I turn to when I am looking to donate because I always know the money is going directly to the children through their strong programs on the ground in China and because i get updated with colorful reports on the children and programs we have donated to.  Top notch foundation!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	85405		/users/profile/95266	Michelle M.	Donor	5	04/13/2011	We have sponsored children in LWB's medical, healing homes and foster care programs and are always so pleased to see that LWB utilizes our donation to directly help the children.  This organization is a world-wide network of volunteers who desire to help orphans in China and donate all of their time and work.  LWB's communication with sponsors is frequent and includes photos of the children that clearly show their progress, be it from surgical intervention or the loving arms of a foster family.  Recommend highly!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	221427		/users/profile/116674	Kerstin P.	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	I have been volunteering for Love Without Boundaries for 5 years.  The oversight, the dedication volunteer feels to the children and the fact that almost all of each donation goes to the children makes this a truly great charity.  I am proud of being associated with them.  My younger daughter was served by medical, foster care, and education and it made such a difference in her health and her adjustment.  
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	122273		/users/profile/116674	Kerstin P.	Volunteer	5	09/13/2012	I am a foster care and education coordinator for Anhui Province.  I track monthly developmental progress of the children and make sure they are on target.  If they aren't, I make suggestions to help them make progress.  I also track quarterly education reports to ensure that the school-aged children in my foster care program are making strides in their intellectual development.  It is a privilege to work for the children and to watch them grow (and then be adopted!).  
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98258		/users/profile/116674	Kerstin P.	Volunteer	5	09/27/2011	I began sponsoring a child   through Love Without Boundaries.  We received updates of the little girl in education so we could see her development.  When an opportunity opened to volunteer for Love Without Boundaries, I jumped at it.  Love Without Boundaries provides medical care, education, and foster care for children in child, but each team works with the others to ensure the whole child's needs are considered.  When many of the children in the foster care program which I coordinate became preschool aged, Love Without Boundaries found a way to send them to school.  Love Without Boundaries provides the head start for children in China that I wish my own daughter had in her early years.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	221212		/users/profile/284920	Yolanda4	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	By far the most rewarding volunteer experience of my university career so far.

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	221146		/users/profile/284858	S.S.H	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	After working with Love Without Boundaries for over 2 years now I must say that I have been very impressed with the level of dedication, love, care and passion it takes to run an organization of this size and impact. Everyone involved from the Board to the Director  to the China Staff and to the Volunteer Base has a strong level of commitment to these deserving children. There is a common goal that each person shares and it is to better the lives of every child that LWB comes into contact with, whether the child is a part of the program or not. Love Without Boundaries welcomes new ideas from it's support community and embraces change very easily. It has and will continue to be a pleasure and inspiration to volunteer with LWB. They are honest, ethical and passionate.

So professionally operated, yet with such a caring heart that shines through in their regular communications to donors such as myself.

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	168285		/users/profile/223171	Kristy9	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	I first learned about this organization from the adoption community. Then years later I adopted a child who happened to be sponsored and provided for by LWB. Our daughter was so well taken care of compared to other children adopted and the same time, that weren't in a nutrition program and foster home, that I was thoroughly convinced the work of LWB was crucially to the children's needs. I have now volunteered for over 5 years, and seen that they advocate for every child's need, and funds go directly to the children. I am so impressed with this volunteer model, I've seen nothing like it in any other nonprofit! 
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	168270		/users/profile/223156	Kelly91	Volunteer	5	09/07/2013	This organization continues to amaze me.  I became a volunteer after LWB was able to help me get a donation of coats to my daughter's orphanage.  I could not walk away from them after I learned more and I continue to be blown away by the love and dedication of this group.  With a very low overhead due to mostly volunteers, LWB is making a massive difference, often a life-saving difference, in orphans and impoverished children of China, one child at a time.

I feel certain she wouldn't be here today if it were not for LWB.  There are no words to describe our gratitude for the love and care she received.  We are so thankful to all the nannies, doctors, sponsors and LWB volunteers who supported and prayed for our little one until we got to her.  I have just started volunteering with LWB in the past few weeks to try to give back for all done with our daughter.  We love LWB and have never been more impressed with an organization that truly lives out their name - love without boundaries.

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	167979		/users/profile/222868	sidneywrites	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	I honestly never thought of myself as a "charity volunteer" type of person.  Then I started researching adoption from China and came across some wonderful, very informative articles written by Love Without Boundaries founder Amy Eldridge.  I started looking at what LWB did for children in China, and I was just blown away by the extent of help they provided, and the beautiful spirit in which it was done.  Then I checked their financials, and saw how pretty much ALL of the money goes to the children.  Then I applied to volunteer.   I felt like the luckiest person in the world when I was given an opportunity to volunteer!   I still feel lucky EVERY DAY in the work I do for Love Without Boundaries.  I am so proud of the organization and so thankful and honored to be a part of what we do.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	167970		/users/profile/222859	Kelly90	Client Served	5	09/06/2013	I adopted a 12 year old girl from China that had the privilege of being in LWB programs in her orphanage. She has been home 2 years and I have come to learn that LWB was responsible for her being put in school, tutoring after school, encouragement and support of her through her adoption and many field trip experiences. All of this was non-existent before LWB was established at her orphanage. I currently am bringing home 2 more girls who are enrolled in LWB programs in their orphanage and I am thankful for the role they are playing in their lives until their forever family can get there. I have seen first hand what this organization and individuals involved with this organization can do and what an impact they have in children's iives, as a result i have recently volunteered my time with them as a small token to what the organization has done for my children as well as thousands of other children.

As a donor, I want to be sure that my donation is being spent intelligently.  I have read that LWB spends less than 10% on overhead and fundraising.  This is astoundingly low.  I also read their blog and facebook posts, and it's clear that the organization is really passionate about their cause.

What makes LWB unique is they only have Chinese people on the ground doing the work and all but three of their staff are volunteers meaning that virtually every dollar we give is used to help the children in their care.  LWB is a great non-profit in every sense of the word!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	122498	1	/users/profile/166835	Barbara69	Volunteer	5	09/18/2012	As a mother to two girls adopted from China, I was familiar with Love Without Boundaries from its inception and was impressed with its founders' dedication to helping children who remained in China.  However, it was not until I became a volunteer for LWB nearly three-and-a-half years ago that I realized how truly special it is.  This organization is almost entirely run by volunteers, and the funds raised are truly used to help children directly in areas such as education, foster care, medical care, nutrition and assistance to orphanages. Numerous children's lives have been improved by LWB, and many children have been healed and therefore made eligible for adoption because of their programs.  The single-minded focus of its volunteers towards helping orphans and impoverished children in China is inspiring, and I am honored to call myself an LWB volunteer as well as a donor.

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	122371		/users/profile/166648	Tammy Z.	Client Served	4	09/16/2012	We adopted our newest daughter when she was almost 14 years old.  LWB set up schooling for our daughter and many other older children just a few years ago at her orphanage.  If it were not for the few years of public schooling and tutoring that she received, she would have had much more struggles in school than she does.  They also provided the older kids with opportunities to sing/perform in public, and go on various field trips to give them new life experiences.  I believe these field trips were very good for broadening our daughter's knowledge of the world around her.  In addition, I believe the performances and tutoring helped build our daughter's self esteem.  LWB sent us several CDs of pictures of our daughter for the last 4-5 years of her life.  Some of those CDs contained her progress that she made from when she began school to how she was doing recently in school.  In addition, LWB was very receptive to concerns we had when we adopted a previous child several years ago as an older toddler.  They stepped in and checked out the older children's nutritional needs and made more protein and snacks available for the children.  They also made it possible recently for children younger than 3 years old to begin attending their Believe in Me school onsite at the orphanage, which is a huge plus that they now can offer this to the younger children.  LWB is a very caring, responsive, and financially responsible organization.  We have donated to this organization many times and recommended them as a charity to our friends and family.  I hold them in high esteem.

After our first adoption from Huainan in 2003, my 13 yr old son wrote a poem for the Love's Journey book that LWB made to raise funds. We have sponsored children and projects for many years and have seen the children blossom in their care. Little did we know that our fourth little girl from China would benefit from life saving surgery funded by LWB as a newborn, eat nutritious food  everyday through the nutrition program and attend the Believe in Me School in Huainan funded by LWB. She was also sponsored and placed in a loving foster home through LWB. After we brought her home in July, we received about 100 precious pictures and foster care reports that will be treasured in her life book. She has done so well on every level since coming home. Having all this support has made her transition incredibly peaceful. She started kindergarten and attached to her forever family readily. I know her ability to be both resilient and successful n transitioning to our family and school  is directly a result of the head start during these formative years from LWB. We are sponsoring a little girl from her orphanage and get reports to follow her progress with the hopes that she too will find a family. Thank you to all the volunteers that make every dollar count and every child matter. 5 stars indeed! Beth Flanders mom to Kerry Wa Flanders from LWB Huainan aka Huai Rui Wa

However some time ago I read about a young lady from an orphange who manage to pass an univesity test but could not afford the tution fee. We have for some years lived in China and our children is getting a great education. Education is so important and for many children and youth here in China it is their only way to a bettter life. But without many there is no way. So we gave a litlle and talked a lot and spread the word to friends. The our children decided to give their allowance and slowly the tution fee of 1500 dollar was raised. The day when I got the meassage that the girl could sign up for her courses I was so happy. I am so grateful for the work Love without boundaries is doing. I am proud to be able to be a part of a organization that helps children and young people to reach their potential and dreams!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98315		/users/profile/116745	Beth Laxer-Limmer	Client Served	5	09/27/2011	Our daughter was in the Love Without Boundaries foster care program in Loudi, China in 2006 prior to her adoption.  We are forever grateful for the program.  Our daughter had a family that gave her love, affection, and attention that she might not have received had she been one of many in an orphanage.  She adjusted very well to her forever family because of that individualized care.  Everyone at Love Without Boundaries are heroes to so many children and their families.

We are adopting a little 2 year old special needs boy that love without boundaries sponsored his care and got him into an incredible foster home. Their work allowed our little guy's cleft lip and palate to be fixed and they are ensuring he is cared for until we can travel to china. Their appeals to their supporters has certainly raised awareness of the splight of special needs and has given life to hundreds of children. The unity fund which helps families who cannot afford healthcare ( these families consider giving their children away toget them medical treatment) is one of the most amazing projects. They allow families to stay together.  They truly are making a difference in the lives of so many...one child at a time.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98293		/users/profile/116718	Momto8Blessings	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2011	I have seen the work that LWB does for the children and rural families in China for 8+ years now and know that they have saved lives and changed countless more lives around the world by what they are doing for the children of China.  No child is turned away, every child matters, they care deeply, they cry when a child doesn't make it, they cry when help comes too late, they work countless hours for these children, all as volunteers, none of them for a salary, they do so much because they truly want to be the difference in the life of a child, being able to LIVE!  So that every child might be able to live, have good nutrition, a good education, quality medical care & of all, to know unconditional love of a forever family.  
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98292		/users/profile/116716	Traci23	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2011	While neither of my Chinese adopted daughters benifitted directly from Love Without Boundaries, both of their orphanages have since become homes to numerous LWB programs! I couldn't ever in my lifetime say enough positive words about Love Without Boundaries. Their name describes exactly who they are and what they do. They Love children Without and Boundaries holding them back from their goals!!!!! The simple fact the Chinese government trusts them enough to allow them to do their work proves endless coups on their part!!!

Donor	5	09/27/2011	We (my husband, I, my church) have been donors to LWB over the past several years and with many programs (medical, educational).  LWB has changed the lives of so many through their programs.  They are quick to respond to a need.  Everyone I have dealt with at LWB has always been accessible and lives out their motto "Every child counts."  They are good stewards of funds.  You are assured that what you intend for your money to do, they will put it to that use with minimal overhead.  They are the model of how charitable organizations should operate.  I love, love, love, Love Without Boundaries!

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98286		/users/profile/116708	maryannday	General Member of the Public	5	09/27/2011	My daughter was an orphan in China and was enrolled in a Preschool program in her orphanage that made a huge impact on her.  She received extra attention and was encouraged to learn in a safe environment with teachers who cared about her well being.  We were able to adopt her about 6 months later and she had no developmental delays at all.  Our daughter has special needs and they didn't allow that to interfere with her right to have love and education.  I am very thankful and supportive of Love Without Boundaries and the love they have for children and the right of every child to receive medical care, nutrition, education and love.Mary Ann Day
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98282		/users/profile/116703	Julie2345678	Donor	5	09/27/2011	Love Without Boundaries has done immeasurable work to help orphaned children in China.  We adopted our daughter in 2006 and were so distressed to see the conditions in which the children had to live in her orphanage.  No toys, very little attention, etc.  Just monts later, LWB went in and started a preschool and a foster care program.  In addition, a playground was added for the children.  This is just one area they made a huge difference, they have done the same at numerous orphanages in China.

The work they do is so desperately needed, and life-changing to those they serve.  They are angels to children who have nothing, and their work is truly remarkable.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98271		/users/profile/116690	Baldiny	Donor	5	09/27/2011	Love Without Boundaries started as the dream of one adoptive mother, who I have had the pleasure of knowing for over 10 years. We started our journeys to adopt childen in China at the same time and I've watched her dream grow with the addition of hundreds of other adoptive parents and people who care about orphans and poor children. LWB uses every cent possible to change the lives of children in China through their nutritional programs, medical care and educational facitilies.  With an administrative overhead of less than 10%, my family and friends are assured that our donations are making a difference in the world. We love Love Without Boundaries!

From helping families stay together, to transforming lives by providing life-changing, life-saving care, via nutrition, education, surgeries and aftercare through healing homes and foster families, they are truly an amazing organization and have more-than lived up to their name by showing true and unconditional LOVE WITHOUT BOUNDARIES!!

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98257		/users/profile/116673	LWBSavesLives	Donor	5	09/27/2011	This is a wonderful chairty that helps orphaned and ill children who desperately need medical attention. Through LWB, these children are provided with the medical attention no matter how much and how specialized the care needed is. They never cease to stop, thankfully!!! They give these children a chance for a very healthy and happy life!! Without LWB, these children most of which would die. Some would survive with little ability to thrieve and be adopted.  I firmly believe in Love Without Boundaries and have donated several thousands of dollars to these children, proudly, because they are so deserving. Each chlid is in my heart. Thank you.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	98255		/users/profile/116671	Tracy2345	Client Served	5	09/27/2011	Actually, my daughter is one of the many "clients" served by LWB. When she was an orphan, living in China, LWB ran a nutrition program in the orphanage system where my daughter was being cared for. Their oversight and generousity provided not just my daughter but many precious babies with healthy food and formula. Their broad-based care programs provide such a wonderful variety of resources, and their commitment to helping families care for their children within China as well as caring for orphans while they wait for families makes LWB one of our favorite non-profits to support and share with friends.

I leared about their work while we were waiting to travel to China to adopt our baby girl.  About that same time, they were beginning a nutrition program at our daughter's orphanage.  It was a wonderful way for us to help provide for our daughter's basic needs until we were able to go and get her.  Now we are able to do the same for other precious children.  They do so many things to improve the quality of life for orphans.  I love this organization.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	87896		/users/profile/98702	Evelyn	Donor	5	04/28/2011	I am a mother of two little girls adopted from China.  I feel very blessed and wanted to help other orphans in China.  I had heard of Love Without Boundaries and was familiar with their work in China.  Then I had the opportunity to hear Amy Eldridge, founder, speak about her organization.  I was hooked.  I made my first donation that night.  I began receiving reports and keeping up to date with all Love Without Boundaries does.  They really help children in need.  My primary experience has been with Heartbridge.  This is one of their healing homes that brings in medically fragile orphans and takes care of them before, during and after their surgery.  You can see the results in their pictures and reports.  These children receive the love and care necessary to heal.  I wish I was more eloquent.  I just want everyone to know that this organization is amazing.   Please visit their website and check them out.  Please donate to this awesome charity.

I have an adopted daughter from China and my heart hurts for the orphans left behind, especially those with special medical needs.  Love Without Boundaries seems to work miracles at times with the orphans under their care.  I have sponsored several children in their Heartbridge Healing Home and have watched their progress with amazement.  These babies have a chance for a real life and the love a family because of the extraordinary work done by the volunteers at LWB and their employees in China.  They do so much with the donations.  I'm impressed with their stewardship of their funds and their desire to maximize the benefits for the children they are helping.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	85428		/users/profile/95308	Grateful Mom	Donor	5	04/13/2011	Love Without Boundaries is truly the most authentic organization I know of!Started by an every day mom moved by what she saw in an orphanage while she was adopting her child from China. She came home, couldn't shake off what she had seen, prayed, and miracles happened and continue to happen. Why? Because she put love into actual action. Orphans have the very heart of God and He backs people who fight for orphans. God puts all Heaven behind saving the lives of these hero children. The bottom line question to ask yourself is this; "Is there anything sadder in life than a sick child alone in the world?"Since there is not. Love Without Boundaries works for change in this world!They are simply the BEST! They make a difference by saving one child at a time!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	85386		/users/profile/95238	Betsy Wilkerson Brundage	General Member of the Public	5	04/12/2011	I am the mom of three children adopted from China. Two of them were lucky enough to be in Social Welfare Institutions where LWB works.  LWB's programs benefit so many children. My kids were helped by the nutrition and educational programs and we are certain that LWB's support helped them become the healthy and happy children they are today.  We currently help sponsor the education of a child in the SWI my daughter is from.   I was briefly a volunteer for LWB (would still be one if not for a full-time job and the activities of three kids) and so got a first-hand look at the organization.  I can't imagine a group of volunteers that are more dedicated and passionate about their work. LWB has made a huge difference in the lives of so many people all over the world, not just the children they help, but the families who have been blessed by adopting these children.  Love Without Boundaries is an amazing organization!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	85365		/users/profile/95215	Charissa M.	Donor	5	04/12/2011	I am an adoptive parent currently in process of adopting two more children.  I heard that the Social Welfare Institute, where my children are waiting for me, was lacking in providing stimulation and I approached Love Without Boundaries to see if they could help make a difference for the children in the SWI if we could raise the necessary funds.  Love Without Boundaries was very open to helping and contacted the SWI director to make sure providing developmental toys and things would be well received.  I am happy to say that we've raised enough money and Love Without Boundaries is now working to get the things in place in the SWI so the children can get the stimulation they need to grow and develop.  I have found Love Without Boundaries to be caring, professional and quick in communication.  You can see their love for the children they serve showing in all of the work that they do, which is great and serves many orphans.  I also know that the vast majority of the money that is donated is going directly to helping orphans since LWB overhead is so low.  That especially makes me feel good about advocating for people to donate to this organization and I know their work is making a difference in the lives of children.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	85228		/users/profile/95030	Linda P.	Volunteer	5	04/12/2011	I've been a volunteer with LWB since 2004.  I love thinking that a group of people from all over the world can work together to truly save and change the lives of children in China.  LWB really strives to work within the Chinese culture and with the Chinese people and also to make sure that everything that we do is done with the "whole child" in mind.  One of my adopted children was a beneficiary of LWB programs and I know that it has made such a difference in her life.  I often wonder what her life would have been like without the intervention that LWB provided, since she is considered a child with "special needs."  I feel very privileged to be a part of the LWB family and to have a part in touching lives every day!

The level of dedication is amazing, the number of volunteer employees who stay for YEARS is remarkable as well.   This is a wonderful organization that uses its resources well, is very organized, and really cares about the children served.  They do not waste their donors money and really strive to give the children the best care possible.   The amount of love within LWB is incredible.  I have been a volunteer with LWB for nearly 3 years, and I look forward to the many, many more years ahead!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	57337		/users/profile/60521	Donald W.	Board Member	5	11/18/2010	In 2004 LWB did a cleft medical mission to China and repaired the lips of twin girls that had been orphaned the prior year.  Six months later we adopted the twins and upon finding out that LWB had been responsible for their marvelous repair (a plastic surgeon that specializes in cleft repairs at Miami Chjildren's Hospital claims they were two of the best repairs he had ever seen) my wife and I volunteered to work with LWB and in 2006 I was asked to serve on the Board.  This organization has a total heart for China's orphans.   LWB uses over 90% of the funds they collect to fund medical, education, healing homes, foster care and nutrition programs.  There are no fat cats with fat salaries - just great people giving in some cases 40 hours or more to help these kids with no remuneration.  If you are looking to find a charity that truly does what it says - this is the one.

Love Without Boundaries Foundation	3334	21	/users/profile/5095	suznews40	Volunteer	5	04/09/2009	I am the mother of 6 bio kids and two daughters from China.  I heard about LWB when we decided to adopt an older child from China.  The child we were considering was in an orphanage that has LWB programs.  I started sponsoring a child in the education program.  We adopted our daughter a few months later and I got to visit the orphanage.   After I returned, I decided I would like to volunteer for LWB and so I have been a volunteer since Dec. 2006.  I was an assistant in the education program at my daughter's orphanage briefly and later became the Foster Care coordinator for the program at her orphanage.  While I had this position, I again visited the orphanage and I got to visit the foster care children also.  Recently I have taken on Orphanage Assistance Director and this program is so AWESOME... I love my work, I love what LWB does for those kids.  I love that if a parent like myself has a child from an orphanage (My second adopted daughter's orphanage) where LWB doesn't have programs, they can contact LWB and we can do a project to get something for that orphanage..whether they donate $25 or $2500....we can make a difference.  I love that we had a recent donation to a specific orphanage for $54 ....  We asked the orphanage, and they needed a heater for the baby's bathroom.  Think about how nice this will be on little cold bottoms in the winter.  Such a small amount of money can make a difference...I am proud to volunteer for this organization.  So many children have been, are being now, and will be helped because of LWB and the sponsors who make it possible for us to do this caring work.Suzanne DamstedtOrphanage Assistance DirectorLove Without Boundaries.comwww.lovewithoutboundaries.com

As a volunteer, I see a lot of the detail that goes on day to day, yet in preparing my presentations, I realized how much all of the little things add up to helping so many children in very significant ways.Education, medical, healing home, foster care, nutrition and orphanage assistance combine to provide for the whole child while LWB advocates for permanent families.  And, oh, the joy, when we hear from a family that their new son or daughter is doing well in their new families!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	12648	8	/users/profile/14679	Gena1223	Volunteer	5	10/08/2009	I first came across LWB right after we adopted our first son from China.  I subscribed to "LWB NEWS". Shortly after there was a post about a need for sponsors for a young man who was wheelchairbound because his bones in his legs broke when he walked.  He needed surgery to put rods in his legs so he could work. He was an orphan who had "aged out" and so he would have to support himself. My heart went out to him. Fixing his legs seemed like his only hope. Not being an outgoing person, I somehow asked people around me to help sponsor his surgery. When I collected all the funds for his surgery, I sent it thinking tht was it. I knew a young man would have surgery and, Lord willing, would be able to walk one day.  To my surprise I received photos of him and updates on his rehabilitation after surgery. Many months later I got additional photos of him walking! i was so thankful for these updates and my only connection to him. The days I got these updates always made the day brighter. Currently he has a job and he is doing well in society. Praise God for Love Without Boundaries.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	12093	11	/users/profile/14104	michmom3k	Volunteer	5	10/06/2009	My two youngest children were adopted from China.  After traveling to bring my daughters home, on two separate trips, I was left worrying about the children who were left behind in the crowded orphanages.  I would watch my own girls sleeping in their comfortable and warm beds and wonder about the "brothers and sisters" still living as orphans in China.I was initially drawn to Love Without Boundaries because their work centers on the children who remain in China, waiting for families of their own.  As I learned more about this foundation and all the amazing work they have done, I knew I wanted to volunteer my time and resources to help them accomplish their mission.  Joining Love Without Boundaries as a volunteer was one of the best decisions I ever made.  Every day I know I make a difference in the lives of the orphans who are still waiting in China to be adopted.Both of my daughters lived with foster families in China before being adopted.  I believe the individual love and attention they received in their homes greatly improved their development and well-being and showed them how to give and receive love.  I now volunteer with the Love Without Boundaries Foster Care Program.  It is incredibly meaningful for me to help other children benefit from foster care they way my own children did until they were adopted.  This program is changing lives for these children.
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	3354	23	/users/profile/5118	tracyafischer	Volunteer	5	04/10/2009	Love Without Boundaries is a fantastic organizations.  The vast majority of all donations go directly to assisting the children, as all staff volunteer their time.  Everyone involved has such a caring heart and the results of the work the organization does is very evident in the progress children are making.  Donors receive regular updates on the children or projects they are supporting as well as hand-written thank you notes from the project coordinators.  I am also an adoption social worker and have actually met children who have been part of LWB programs after they come home with their adoptive families.  The fact that some of these children are even still alive, as several were born with complex medical issues that LWB arranged and paid for medical treatment for, is a testament to the wonderful work LWB does!
Love Without Boundaries Foundation	3345	22	/users/profile/5107	NancyB	Volunteer	5	04/09/2009	Both of my daughters were adopted from China and there is a desire to give back to help other children.  However, I am very cautious about donating to organizations unless I can see some accountability for the funds.  This is where Love Without Boundaries stands out.  Due to the volunteer structure of the organization, only a very small percent of funding is need to support administration.  The true test is the results that sponsors can see on the sponsor reports and the medical missions.After supporting this organization through donations, I also became a volunteer.  That's when I found out what heart the organization has.  Daily e-mails flow around the world to find the best ways to help these children in need.  The energy of this organization is incredible.

Novo Ministries Inc	87885		/users/profile/98689	Kathy O.	Client Served	5	04/28/2011	My daughter, Abbie, has been a student that has been touched by NOVO Ministries. They hold a Bible Club on a weekly basis at her elementary school, Tulakes. The teachers of Bible Club have really helped her learn more about God, how to be a good friend/person. They show her weekly what it means to serve God unselfishly. Bible Club also had an overnight camp 2 summers ago, that she attended. This was the first time she had been away from home more than a night. I was so nervous. She got off the bus after a full week away, and was so estatic about the fun she had. They had a free camp, with lots of fun... all based on God. What more could a parent ask for! Another great joy about Bible Club is that our church's children's minister, APril Swang, has joined the "staff". This gives Abbie a great connection between all the important areas of her life. Ms. April comes every week and helps spread the love of God to these students at Tulakes, most who live in severe poverty. It is people like her, and many many others, that make a difference in the lives of children every week!!  The time and dedication these teachers show the students is unmatched! They see them weekly, send notes to them sometimes, call them on the phone periodically.. it's a great great thing!! I could not have picked a better "club" for my daughter to join!!

Novo Ministries Inc	298850		/users/profile/389738	satre	Donor	5	08/01/2016	I've have had the honor to partner with novo ministries both financially and serving. What impresses me the most is how organized and prepared they are. This really helps out the volunteers as well as maximizing the time to share the love of Jesus with the kids. The bible is the foundation of their teaching and they share the gospel in a way that all ages can understand. Novo Ministry leaders and volunteers serve God with humility and grace. They glorify God, by interacting with the children with love. Their greatest joy is seeing God's work at hand when children make the decision to put their trust in God and follow him. God definitely uses novo ministries to advance the gospel, build His kingdom, and bring glory to his name -David Satre
Novo Ministries Inc	298807		/users/profile/389693	Olivia23	Donor	5	08/01/2016	Novo Ministries is one of the best non-profits I've worked with. Of the organizations we give to monthly, this is the only one that gives regular updates that includes CURRENT information and thanks you for what you ARE giving. We've received mailings, phone calls, emails...not asking for more money or sending the same pictures over and over, just saying thank you for what we're doing now. Because of their mission, methods, and how they treat their donors, this is the FIRST organization I think of when I have extra to give and the place I encourage others to give to.

Novo Ministries Inc	269119		/users/profile/357847	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/29/2015	I was able to volunteer for Novo about 5 years ago. I helped with a Bible club in west OKC. The training I received by the staff at Novo helped me feel confident to share the gospel with kids in a way that was thorough but also easy to understand. I am thankful for the experience I have had with Novo.
Novo Ministries Inc	268008		/users/profile/356738	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2015	Novo ministries is making a difference in the lives of inner city children and families!  I volunteer at one of their bible clubs located in a section 8 apartment complex, which meets one night every week. The curriculum is easy to follow and the children have fun while learning foundational truths from the Bible.  A mentoring relationship is built between leaders and children, giving them someone to talk to in a safe loving environment. The Novo employees are extremely helpful and obviously care about these children and love the Lord!  I would highly recommend getting involved with this organization!
Novo Ministries Inc	266700		/users/profile/355459	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/23/2015	All things are done with excellence and hard work. The workers and volunteers are held to a high standard, and they work really hard to serve inner city kids and their families. The training is thorough, and the workers try to hard to reach places other people don't want to go so that no one is left behind. 
Novo Ministries Inc	261143		/users/profile/348767	wwaf98	Donor	5	10/02/2015	About five years ago a church I was attending had a presentation regarding NOVO ministries.  I was impressed with the concept of after school activities made available to children that might otherwise find themselves involved in activities that may prove harmful to themselves or others around them.  The bonus was that these after school activities offered would present the Gospel!  I personally knew some of the volunteers and they would share stories of children running with excitement to participate in the activities provided to them.  Stories were told of how the children made a positive impact in the volunteers' lives as well.  When approached with an invitation to partner with NOVO ministries by giving a donation, I gladly accepted.  I have been made aware of children being turned away as a result of a lack of funding to open more activity sites, or a lack of volunteers.  My prayer is that the Lord our God will touch the hearts of all those he will to respond to the call to aid NOVO ministries in presenting the Gospel to all who desire to come to the activities they make available.

Novo Ministries Inc	183967		/users/profile/240883	Tyler Smith	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	First off I want to say that I loved working with Novo.  My co-workers became like family along with the children who we built relationships with.  I served at Novo as a Program Assistant for one year (May 2012 to May 2013).  During the Summer months we did non-stop Day Camps which included fun, games, Bible teachings, and water!  Summer is a very busy time, but very rewarding.  You get to teach and mentor boys and girls by teaching them God's Word.  Novo helps boys and girls to understand why they are receiving discipline and will talk individually with anyone to help correct wrong behavior by pointing to scripture.  The school months are specialized to specific programming sites.  It was there that more personal relationships were formed and that you could see more change in the children's lives.  The office atmosphere is very encouraging.  Personal growth and development is a major focus for Novo's employees.  There are many opportunities to grow with this organization.  My teaching skills greatly increased, along with being able to relate to children more.  I developed a deeper prayer life and more of a passion for kids.  There will be some days at programming sites that will be hard and discouraging, but it is a fight that is worth fighting for.  You will have a work family that will pray for you and help you when you are having trouble teaching, relating to the kids, or anything you struggle with so that you will be better prepared.  You can grow in your strengths and weaknesses.  Your talents will be used to their fullest potential at Novo; specifically office work.  I enjoy being organized and doing human resource type work.  Novo realized that talent and I was used to do what I did best.  I highly suggest volunteering or working for Novo Ministries.  God will change your life and the lives of others if you invest your time and efforts into this ministry.  
Novo Ministries Inc	183940		/users/profile/240853	Doublea	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	Novo Ministries changed my life.  I began volunteering in 2010 at a Day Camp.  The kiddos just melt your heart.  Being able to share Christ and love on children that need it in Oklahoma City's inner city is an awesome experience.  I would highly recommend Novo Ministries to anyone that has a passion for sharing Jesus and loving on children.  
Novo Ministries Inc	183689		/users/profile/240604	SC51row	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I first volunteered with NOVO in 2011.  Since then I have volunteered several other times at day camps and summer programs.  My most recent experience was in August of 2013.  Every time I volunteer with NOVO I have had opportunities to get close with one or more of the children.  Whether the children had questions about the gospel, or they didn't understand some of the rules in place (like remaining seated in large group), there were plenty of opportunities to show them you cared about them. The professional nature of NOVO truly enabled me to care for the children in this way. The lesson plans tackled big issues in a very simple-to-understand way, the props were always clean and in good order, and the staff was knowledgeable and trained to deal with a wide range of issues. I could not be more impressed with NOVO as an organization, and am truly blessed and excited about NOVO's mission. Bringing the gospel to inner city children while connecting them with Christian churches makes me want to celebrate.
Novo Ministries Inc	183540		/users/profile/240451	Jennifer284	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	     I am proud to recommend NOVO Ministries in the OKC area to anyone who is looking to invest in the cause of spreading the gospel of Christ to inner-city children, The workers who go into the apartment houses to tell Bible stories, sing Bible songs and minister to children are some of the best young people. I personally know two of them.    I purchased story books of Bible characters/happenings and send them to NOVO via my son's roommates. I wish I didn't live three hours away , or else I would do more.    I teach school. I hopefully will get to go volunteer some next summer.Mrs. Jennifer KilgoreBraggs, OK.
Novo Ministries Inc	182975		/users/profile/239866	Tara Lee	Donor	5	10/28/2013	As a ministry, they do a great job taking care of their staff's needs, providing space and opportunity to do the behind the scenes work necessary before going out to work with the children. It has been good to see how they use finances and donations to better equip their leadership team in order to lead the volunteer groups successfully.
Novo Ministries Inc	180699		/users/profile/237390	Gregg H.	Volunteer	4	10/21/2013	  Novo goes where most organizations won't.  They go to the rough neighborhoods and the tough schools and improve the outlook of the children. They try to instill structure, discipline with a positive purpose.  I have dealt with many of the children in large group, small groups and individually.  The children react in a positive way to the investment being made in their lives.  I wish other large cities had a group like Novo with a city that partners with them. Greg Hallett
Novo Ministries Inc	177483		/users/profile/234045	April Swang	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I started helping with NOVO about 5 years ago. It is such a great way to help our children in the community to feel loved and special and to learn about how much God loves them. I love working with the children and seeing how they grow and how they want to be a NOVO volunteer when they are old enough to help. Their smiles and hugs are such a blessing to me. It is a great mission field here in our state!
Novo Ministries Inc	176764		/users/profile/233218	ShellyDowns	Volunteer	5	10/11/2013	Novo has given these kids something to look forward to each week. It is so wonderful to see how these kids just light up and get so excited when we arrive on Thursdays for bible club. I went through training just to see what it was like, both my daughter and son were volunteering. After going through the training I volunteered at the Forrest Creek location only because they were short handed, I believed it would just be temporary, until other volunteers were available.  This was going on 3 years ago.  My group is 9-12 year old boys and there are a few of them that have been with me the entire time.  I'm amazed at the impact these kids have had on my life.

They are reaching the children who are really needing to be reached out to in the communities, the more vulnerable ones. The staff truly do care and there is a lot of time and preparation(and love) put into each lesson. I am happy to be a part of the hands and feet of Jesus with Novo Ministries!
Novo Ministries Inc	175262		/users/profile/231597	Kristn P.	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	Novo Bible Clubs has reached deep into my heart these last 4 years.  We have developed relationships with numerous children and their mothers.  We  have seen them grow and mature and show great eagerness to hear God's Truth weekly.  They hear that God loves them and has good plans for them.  I will tell of one young lady who was a part of an overnight stay at my house with activities such as Zumba, crafts and swimming at my girlfriend's home, a library visit, a trip to Marble Slab and Taco Bueno, and several meals at my house prepared by the kids themselves:  grilling, setting the table and doing dishes!  This young lady was so tired she fell asleep before dinner.  She had waited up for her mom to come home from her boyfriend's home until 4:15am!  She graduated from Bible Club and I saw her recently.  With being left at home so much while her mom pursues relationships with other men, I was very concerned about her.  She is doing great!  She is studying to be a chef at Francis Tuttle.  She is involved at church and making good decisions!  I believe this is in part to NOVO!  We were there for her for years.  She learned to trust and obey God, that He is Holy and desires for us to be holy as well.

Novo Ministries Inc	115934		/users/profile/157863	tmclain	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/20/2012	I've worked with a number of non-profits and ministries in the last 15 years. This ministry goes beyond expectations in assisting it's team of volunteers and staff in accomplishing it's given mission. It provides a number of resources that most non-profits dream of (specified training, strategic planning, hands on resources, consultation, supplies, and more) at no financial cost to the volunteer. The ministry provides the content and resources, while the volunteer provides the time and relationship building abilities. I was initially drawn to it because it doesn't just throw the leaders into the field unprepared. It requires and aids in preparation so the children receive quality interaction rather than just quantity interaction.

Novo Ministries Inc	115853		/users/profile/157767	SGP1	Board Member	5	06/20/2012	NOVO Ministries is an Oklahoma 501 (c) 3 non-profit organizations that is making a life changing impact in the lives of underprivileged kids in OKC.  Through their weekly Bible Clubs which are conducted at public elementary schools and local housing authority recreation centers, kids gather to enjoy participating in games, snacks and teaching times in both large and small group settings.   NOVO's staff of employees and volunteers range in age from around 15-80 years and all enthusiastically pursue a common goal - to reach inner city boys and girls with life changing Biblical truth.    Mentoring relationships are established between the kids who attend the Clubs and the staff and volunteers and it is sometimes hard to tell which group is receiving the most benefit as many of the volunteers have stated how much they feel privileged to spend time with these kids.   Being a part of meeting someone else's need is totally awesome!  The executive staff and key personal on the NOVO team provide outstanding, trustworthy leadership with and unwavering focus on being faithful to do what they say they will do.   When the NOVO team commits to serve a community with regular weekly  Bible Clubs, the kids never have to wonder if the NOVO team will be there on any given week.   This consistent commitment and presence in the local communities has provided a haven for kids to run to because they know the NOVO team will be there and each kid in attendance knows they are loved by the staff and volunteers. I have served on the Board of Directors since the organizations was founded and count my involvement with NOVO ministries as one of the very best investments I can make with my personal time and money as the results from the efforts expended by NOVO Ministries are yielding returns way beyond anything I could have ever imagined.  NOVO is truly making a difference - one child at a time.
Novo Ministries Inc	115786		/users/profile/157681	myword47	Volunteer	5	06/19/2012	I was introduced to Novo thru listening to a simple commercial on a radio station in 2011.  I was hesitant to get involved me / kids... no way.  I have very little contact with children especially the younger ones.  Also you hear stories of some ministries that lack structure or accountability.  God worked on my heart, and I made that call to start the process to become a volunteer.  At the training day I found out that this is an organization that HAS structure and accountability but still allows the works of God in childrens lives.  I now not only volunteer with Novo Ministries but I work with Valerie Sherrer with my churches Mission board.  
Novo Ministries Inc	115772		/users/profile/157667	Kevin31	Volunteer	5	06/19/2012	NOVO is amazing. The preparation and training they do to minister to little kids is unbelievable. The heart of the staff shows through in the quality of the program they conduct. Working with the kids at Tulakes is the hardest thing I've ever done but so worth every minute because I know that NOVO is putting it all on the line and my part is to just show up.
Novo Ministries Inc	115709		/users/profile/157582	CynMunOKC	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/19/2012	Our organization, Girl Scouts of Western Oklahoma, partners with Novo Ministries to serve children, especially girls, who live in public housing apartments in the Oklahoma City area. Like most non profits, we are always in need of more staff and more volunteers. Thankfully, Novo staff members step in to assist in facilitating Girl Scout programming within the sites they already serve. It is a great partnership for us, but most importantly, the girls. It is important for the girls to be familiarized with their leaders so they are open and confident in sharing their thoughts and opinions and participating in activities. The Novo staff are very knowledgeable about the inner city and the statistics children and families face here in Oklahoma City. Each staff member is highly professional and passionate about their job. It is a pleasure working with them!
Novo Ministries Inc	115707		/users/profile/157579	Jerry9	Board Member	5	06/19/2012	My wife and I got involved in NOVO as volunteers because we saw the impact they were having on inner city children.  We could see their heart and their strategy were working.  My wife served as a bible club leader with our children as her assistants.  As a Pastor I saw the value of the families of our church also getting involved as volunteers.  As a result many of the children that we started teaching through NOVO are now attending our church.  I have been able to get to know these children and see first hand the change that is being made in their lives.  They come from some of the worst environments but they are finding hope through the love they are receiving and what they are being taught.   
Novo Ministries Inc	115702		/users/profile/157572	Jeremy W.	Volunteer	5	06/19/2012	Novo Ministries helps me connect and serve young kids in the inner-city of Oklahoma City. Through their planning, prayer, training, and encouragement, I can serve alongside other volunteers and staff to love on some kids that do not get a lot of attention at home sometimes. I get to teach them about the love, justice, and hope we can all have in Jesus Christ through what He did in giving up His life to take the punishment for our sins and rising again, giving us hope for our eternal communion with Him after this life. The power and work of Jesus Christ is the foundation and empowerment for the mission that they are on to reach kids with the gospel in order to impact the community in an immensely powerful way. The little children that I have been working with, through Novo, for over a year have shown such sweet reception to our presence and continued interest in their lives that it has transformed and softened my heart towards them and other children who have needs, who just want and need attention, and who desperately crave to understand what life is about even in the midst of strife, turmoil, and craziness. Novo is so easy to work with also! They make it so easy to get plugged in to serving that it seems like you do not have to do much work yourself. Their impact on children, families, and the communities is worth recognizing and praising and I hope their work will continue to grow!
Novo Ministries Inc	115691		/users/profile/157554	Ruth N.	Volunteer	4	06/19/2012	It is a great organization. Great way to minster to kids who do not have a normal home life.

To be succinct, I have seen countless young people evolve right in front of my very own eyes.  They have gone from youngsters  that consistently make poor choices to being more responsible and Godly.  Novo is led by people of great faith and chracter and the ministry is simply an amazing difference maker!

Novo Ministries Inc	115682		/users/profile/157543	js_small	Board Member	5	06/19/2012	Novo Ministries Incorporated, since its inception, has sought to take Jesus to children who may not otherwise have the opportunity to meet Him.  The ministry of the volunteers is invaluable to the children they reach.  For a child to know that each week Bible Club is meeting, brings a sense of continuity and security in his or her life. Novo Ministries provides an opportunity to change the lives of children in circumstances that are often dismal and destructive.  A weekly meeting with the same volunteers, a foundational lesson of truth, games, and numerous hugs are the integral components of the success of Novo Ministries Incorporated.

If I am remembering correctly, I attended the program for at least two consecutive years, as well as their summer camp program at that time. Novo really was, and is a life-changing program to the young boys and girls that attend. I was introduced to Christ, in a way that I never had been previously. The things I learned at Bible Club, has stuck with me in my Christian journey as I grow older. I am very grateful for this program, because I realize how impacting it was on my own life. Because of the way Novo helped me, I felt led to go back and volunteer, and give back to the inner-city boys and girls, just as was done for me.

I had wanted to take some type of program into an apartment complex with a low-income population in my community, but, I wasn't sure how to get started.  A friend told me about Novo Ministries' work with inner-city children, so, I registered for a training session.  I was amazed at the excellence with which they carried out the training. They gave me so much more than I could have hoped for, even helping with how to set up program.  Novo has partnered with us and provided much training to all our volunteers at no cost to our church.  They have provided excellent curriculum for use with our apartment ministry.  Novo Ministries places a high value on doing with excellence all that they do, and they are faithful to give God the glory for the work that is accomplished.  I am a better leader of our ministry because of the preparation that Novo provides.

Novo has guided us every step of the way and continually instructs and encourages us.  Through Novo, we've been able to do something that we could not have easily done on our own.  They love the kids and their primary purpose is to make sure they know how much God loves them.

Volunteer	5	04/27/2011	My wife and I have worked with NOVO off and on for the past eight years, and we are always thrilled to see the work that they are doing to serve the communities of Oklahoma City. As volunteers, and more broadly as citizens, we are grateful for the investment that NOVO makes in children's future day in and day out.
Novo Ministries Inc	87416		/users/profile/98080	Amanda T.	Client Served	5	04/26/2011	We use the NOVO Curriculum at our church for both Wednesday night kids club and Sunday school. All the teachers love it and the kids have lots of fun as well as learn a lot.
Novo Ministries Inc	87393		/users/profile/98056	claudia	Volunteer	5	04/26/2011	I have known about NOVO for a long time but just got involeved with them about a year ago.  Wish I would have done it sooner.  They just love children where they are.  There goal is to share Jesus with all children and they do a great job.  I get to work at one of the Bible clubs and it is life changing.  They believe that one person can make a difference and so do I.  Glad I can be apart of there ministry.
Novo Ministries Inc	10061	8	/users/profile/11923	JasonH	Donor	5	09/08/2009	I went through Novo training.  I've read through their literature.  I've met with a number of their directors and club leaders.  I've spoken with the members of our church who work with the local Novo club.  The program and persons behind it are highly committed to sharing the gospel with children.  The clubs are in settings to reach many unchurched children.  I've been a donor ever since I first learned about Novo 3 years ago.  I intend to contue to support them.

Novo Ministries Inc	9151	8	/users/profile/10941	Redladybug18	Former Volunteer	4	08/14/2009	I was an intern for this ministry when meant that I helped with office work in the morning and then taught Bible clubs after school at government housing, apartments or schools.  I had the joy many times of seeing kids come to know Christ and also teaching them to live for God.  Novo ministrys I'm sure has changed a lot since I was there 3 years ago but friends who are still there really love it and I'm sure it would only change for the better.  I really enjoyed my time there.
Novo Ministries Inc	9150	8	/users/profile/10940	Juliannie86	Former staff	5	08/14/2009	I have seen God use Novo Ministries to make a difference not only to hundreds of inner city children, but also to the many volunteers and staff who have been involved with it. The time I spent working there was an extremely valuable learning experience for me. The training I received stretched and prepared me to such an extent that I feel much more equipped and confident to minister to children than I otherwise would have. I will always look back on my time with Novo Ministries as a wonderful experience that God used to make a difference in my own life!While I was there, I spent many months working with the children of Oklahoma City. Their needs are so great and although it may seem like an overwhelming task to try to help them, Novo is doing something about it by teaching them the most important thing they could know: how much God loves them and how they need a Savior. God truly is using this ministry to make a difference... one child at a time.
Novo Ministries Inc	9146	8	/users/profile/10935	K. Todd	Former Volunteer	5	08/14/2009	Whether a donor or volunteer, helping with Novo Ministries is an unforgettable and awesome experience. I have benefited from being able to play both roles. First, as a volunteer, I was able to take time after work to assist at Bible clubs: teaching Bible lessons and songs, having fun with the kids at games, praying with them, visiting them with their families, and more. I am amazed at how Novo Ministries takes children who are living in bad conditions and leads them to live better. I also got to help out at a summer camp as a camp counselor. I know first-hand how Novo Ministries brightens children's lives. But, even beyond that, what I learned from Novo Ministries years ago has not left me yet. I still do children's ministry work, whether for non-profits or on my own free time. I learned so much from Novo Ministries' staff, who are enraptured with what they do. Working with Novo Ministries has changed my life and that is why I plan to continue to donate to this organization.
Novo Ministries Inc	8996	9	/users/profile/10780	Tara McLain	Former Volunteer	5	08/11/2009	I've worked with a number of children's ministries and outreaches in the last 15 years. When this ministry was introduced, I was somewhat hesitant to get involved. I didn't know much about the ministry and I have very high expectations of children's programs. They invited me to observe and after seeing only one program, I knew I wanted to be involved. I volunteered for a school year, working at 4 different clubs during that time. They made me feel very useful, though they had a great team in place already. I was able to work behind the scenes, teach a small group, build relationships with the children, and teach in the large group presentation. I loved Novo's vision for the community and their determination to present excellent, high quality work. In fact, I loved it so much that when they offered me a position, I made a career change and came to work with them full time.

The workers were so professional and polite.  Joe even took time in his hectic day to sit & visit with us for a while.  They make you feel right at home & never tire of answering questions about all the beautiful animals there.  I plan on making this a yearly event and that's only because I live too far away.  Otherwise I'd defintely be there more often.  You've got a wonderful place there Joe.  You,  your crew and your animals are outstanding.  One of the biggest & cleanest places I've seen.

ANIMALS ARE BRED FOR PROFIT AND ARE ABUSED. THE LIVING CONDTIONS ARE ROWS UPON ROWS OF ANIMALS LIVING ON TOP OF  EACH OTHER. THE CUBS ARE BEATEN FOR BITING THE HUMANS THAT HANDLE THEM. POOR VET CARE LEAVING THEM TO SUFFER WITH DIARRHEA AND ILLNESS FROM BEING HANDLED.  IT'S HIS PERSONAL FREAK SHOW OF UN-NATURAL BREEDING.
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	201176	2	/users/profile/262641	IAMSOMAD	Volunteer	1	05/29/2014	I have never been so sickened in my life. These poor animals are not being properly treated. This is not a sanctuary, it is a reprehensible disgrace.
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	163636		/users/profile/217317	kmacdark	General Member of the Public	5	07/26/2013	I have visited this private zoo several times and evertime I am astounded by the love and care they have for the animals. They give one of the best tours I have ever witnesses and a truly interactive experience. They treat their animals like one of their own. It warms my heart to see the care they give for their animals. 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	137153		/users/profile/161764	Lisa110	General Member of the Public	5	11/11/2012	This park goes above and beyond for their animals, even with the harassment from animals rights extremists, they put the needs & welfare of the animals first.  They take in many exotic rescues, and provide them with a loving & nurturing home.  GW exotic animal foundation is a must see, when in the area!
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	137127		/users/profile/108620	topsecretmoon	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/11/2012	This animal park has such an upstanding environment for the animals. It was built , and you can see it very plainly , with the animals best interest in mind. This is a must see if you live in Oklahoma or if you are traveling be sure to stop in!! TOP NOTCH PARK!!! 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94063		/users/profile/108620	topsecretmoon	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/19/2011	We own a small zoo in the south. I have over 32 in the animal field and I have no other zoo/sanctuary that even comes close to the magnitude of GW Exotic. The place is well kept, well managed, the animals are healthy and have regular veterinary care. Your public zoos could actually take a few lessons from GW Exotics. They involve the visitors so that the visit leaves a memory that stays forever and strikes a heartwarming feeling in the depth of your soul. I recommend if you EVER get the chance to go to do it! You will NOT regret it! 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	137099		/users/profile/162095	Bigcatslive	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/11/2012	This facility far exceed any other facilities.

This is an A-1 facility and I highly suggest to anyone to go there and see for yourself the best zoo/ rescue in the whole country!!

I am the mother of a special needs adult, she loves the park as much as I do.  We have to drive 5 hours to get there and we have been know to drive down visit the park and drive back it is soooooooooo worth it!!!!!!
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104596	12	/users/profile/140259	LoveCats13	General Member of the Public	1	01/26/2012	This Oklahoma zoo is overcrowded and the conditions are sub-par. The owners and manager claim it to be a "rescue" of sorts, but they continually breed more. Recently, the owner has had to appeal to his friends on more than one occasion begging for donations because he couldn't pay his bills. Breeding and taking in more animals when you are already overcrowded and cannot care for the ones you have is irresponsible.

G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104564	11	/users/profile/140224	AnimalsMatter	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/25/2012	It seems indisputable that GW Exotic Animal Park does indeed rescue animals.  And it appears the level of care provided has greatly improved over the years, after what seems to have been a rocky start.  However, the financial burden of never saying no, of never turning away an animal, when doing so financially endangers the lives of the 1,400 others already living in the facility, is troublesome to me.  It also seems to be a huge contradiction to, on one hand, "rescue" animals and, on the other, to breed and produce more captive animals to be used for commercial purposes.  The director has stated he would take the baby tigers off the road if he could afford to.  If that's true, and this mission to rescue is sincere, then GW needs to make some serious changes in my 'giving' book before I can support them or recommend them to anyone else.  
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104552	1	/users/profile/140210	MonkeyButtDevin	Donor	5	01/25/2012	I DONATE TO GW EXOTIC ANIMAL FOUNDATION PARK. I STOPPED DONATING TO A WELL KNOWN ANIMAL ORG AND HAVE SINCE BEEN SENDING TO GW PARKS. JOE IS AN AWESOME PERSON WITH A LOVING HEART FOR THE ANIMALS. THE ANIMALS COME FIRST IN HIS LIFE AND THAT IN IT'S SELF IS ADMIRABLE!!  HIS ANIMALS ARE BEAUTIFUL AND NOTHING LIKE ALL THE OTHER ZOOS. MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT GW EXOTIC ANIMAL FOUNDATION PARK IS EXOTIC HEAVEN... I HAVE TOLD OTHER FRIENDS OF MINE ABOUT THIS PLACE AND ALSO TOLD THEM TO HELP AND THEY ALSO DONATE FOR THE ANIMALS. SO IF YOUR LOOKING TO DONATE YOUR MONEY TO A PLACE FOR ANIMALS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE.   I WILL NEVER STOP DONATING TO JOE FOR THE ANIMALS. RATED CLASS A !!! NUMBER 1...
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104541	1	/users/profile/140190	Brandie C.	General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2012	This is absolutely the best park I have ever been to. My husband and I got the opportunity to stay a weekend and it could not have been more enjoyable.  We had a great time. Joe unlocked our cabin personally and made sure We were set for the night when We first arrived. The park was absolutely spotless. The animals were very healthy and well cared for. Ever guy one was very polite and kind. As well as very attentive. We had a great time and cannot wait to return this summer. This is one place that has now be come a family tradition for us. 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104504	1	/users/profile/140130	Sharon19	General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2012	I have never meet Joe or visit the park, but I hope I will get to soon, what time I talk with Joe and visit with him on facebook talking about the bans and how the monkey world is made up, he has always had ear to listen to you talk and he gives good advice to people. Joe stands up for what he believes in and joe does not talk or take sh@t from anyone. Joe takes in animal other dont want and gives them good home. I have heard nothing but nice things said about this man. Joe does not down you for what you believe in he dont care if your white, black, half breed or what ever.  He try to be fair with everyone. Animal are his passion and he fight for them when they dont have voice to speak. If people would ban together as one and let someone like joe guide us.. we would get alot further with these bans. As far as bagging for money others claim he does, is not true, Joe works very hard to keep his place going. People donate at their on free will.. If people dont have nice thing to say about Joe the old saying is keep your mouth shut and dont say nothing at all...

Go there and see for yourself what a great facility this is, run by great people with truly golden hearts. Rumors are unfounded and a little bit childish in regards to GW's and I've never seen anything but excellence in every way coming from here.
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104482	2	/users/profile/140103	Crystal8	General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2012	I think Joe is a good hearted person that knows what hes doing. He may breed but I see nothing wrong with it. It is a natural way of life! What about all the people that keep popping kids out right and left and live off of public aide? They are still allowed to pop them out. Those animals are being treated and cared for and they breed on their own when they are in there own natural enviroment. If hes making a profit off of the animals whether selling them to good homes, or letting people take pics with them when they are young...hes using the funds to take care of all his animals...also Ive been in those lines to take a pic with my son with a baby cub...we did that for our love for animals and who ever gets the opportunity to that? The money I paid for the pic with the cub wet right back to their non profit organization and if it wasnt for people like Joe breeding these wild animals would they exisit in 20 yrs? No, same thing with the polar bears! What about the lipstick you buy Gloria? 90% of animals are being tested on and brutally tortured due to you making those purchases. Also what about the candy you buy? MARS candy tortures monkeys/rabbits/and mice for your pleasure. Use your energy towards putting a stop towards that! Also theres animals getting tortured every day for our army men to practice on to see how they would save  fellow soldiers...Pigs skins are being torched while they are awake and full aware what is going on to tach these men how to treat a burn...then those pics are left to die..or the goats that get their main artery slit so they can stop the bleeding. Also what about the rhinos getting their horns cut off so people can paint them and sell them to us...and they leave the rhino to die a slow agony death. My sister has a monkey and she gets stopped all the time for people to take pics of him and pics with them and their family...Is she better cause she didnt charge?! No its all about getting to see and have hands on with an animal that is usually only seen behind bars thats living in miserable conditions and dont get hands on with people like they should. His animals dont pace back and forth so much that its denting in the ground because they are losing their mind from no interaction or not getting enough food...So for all of you leaving rude/untrue comments maybe you should stop taking your children to zoos/circus'/ and sea world ect. The use the money you pay for those to get bigger brighter signs to get your attention that money isnt being used for the care and best interest of the animals. So I agree with what joe does and back him up all the way. So Joe breed, educate, and keep taking those pics with other animals with animal lovers who never got an opportunity to do such a thing without your help and care for the animals like you do. So I think those of you that have something negative to say...think about all these other animal places that arent for the best interest of these animals! JOE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104479	2	/users/profile/140100	Buddy M.

Most people don,t think about that,how it would be to loose some of these beautiful creatures to extinction.All of the animals i had the opportunity to be with seemed very happy, content, and healthy. I hope to have the opportunity to be a part of this again. I believe GW Exotic is doing great things for these animals.

The people that say they breed for profit are just blind to the gossip. This park is now the leading facility in DNA testing to save the species and much more. Keeping up the good work to protect the tiger species against a 25 year agenda by the AR to make them extinct. keep up the good work.

There is healing in this experience and life in the animals. The staff is awesome, the animals are amazing, well kept and great health. I would recommend this to anyone visiting or just wanting to experience a great place with exotic animals. You will not be disappointed. 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	104365		/users/profile/139937	bobbicorona	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	I've worked for this foundation for 1.5 years.  The staff's dedication to the animals that call the park home is undeniable.  The park is often called the best  the public has ever seen by our visitors.  Our dedication to the Rare Species Fund, conservation, and educating the public plays a very important role in our daily lives.   I have witnessed the blood sweat and tears that most will never see, just to make the park the best it can be for the animals, and for people to enjoy.  I highly recommend you make a trip and see and judge for yourself,  rather than listening to those who want to see us fail just because we will not follow their (the AR) agenda.  We are dedicated to the welfare and love of our animals, nothing more.

I recently took my girlfriend, who is from South Africa, to visit the park as she has always dreamed of playing with big cats. As a surprise weekend, she was overcome with emotion as we pulled up and heard the first roar of the lions. It was an incredible experience to have taken the behind the scenes, Zookeeper for a Day tour. She was able to view, pet and feed all the animals during our 3 hour tour. Ben, our guide expert, went above and beyond the experience I had wished for and ensured not only did my girlfriend have the time of her life, but also made sure we were able to take home the experience with photos and movies that we can forever treasure. The look on my girlfriends face throughout the entire tour was priceless. I highly recommend this tour as not only will it be a tour to remember for a lifetime, but will also continue to support the efforts of GW Exotic Wildlife Park. They are a group of dedicated people who really seem to care about the welfare of all animals. I can't recommend this experience in a better way than to say there is no other tour in the country like the "Zookeeper for a Day"tour. A MUST EXPERIENCE ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME!!!! Thank you all for allowing us to feed the baby tiger as well and the chance to share a very special day in our relationship. Best of wishes to you all!!
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	99002	1	/users/profile/117984	PoetPainter	Donor	5	10/05/2011	G W Exotic Animal Park  is a wonderful place - for visitors and for the animals lucky enough to have been brought there to live. My husband and I were expecting - well - a small place, mom and pop, few animals.  Were we ever surprised!   We have visited again and become donors because of our observations, research and long talks with staff.  We were welcomed by a friendly and knowledgable woman at the front desk and shown the full tour - even back behind the large iron fences where visitors often don't go.  The first animal I saw as I rounded a tall cane break was a two-year-old pale yellow lion who was clearly well-fed, content and friendly toward visitors.  As we progressed  I felt myself  becoming emotional at the sight of every animal so well cared for that they looked professionally groomed.  Every one was well fed, each compound was clean and free from insect pests or feces.  Animals responded well to visitors and were clearly not afraid and not mistreated in any way.   The larger animals had plenty of room to roam and many  interacted facially and by coming over to fences.  One of the staff members walked with us on the long tour where new building is going on and it was clear that she had a loving, nurturing relationship with nearly every animal...a personal relationship.  They ran to the fences at the sound of her voice, lions "chuffed" back at her when she "chuffed" at them - an affectionate vibrating sound made with the lips.  Cletis, a young camel and his "side-kick", a pygmy goat, came to the fence and with very little encouragement Cletis stuck his well-groomed nose through the fencing for a nose-scratch.  We asked questions and did lots of computer research on this private refuge.  It is ligitimate and supported only by visitors and individuals who come and see and become believers that these people love and respect the wonderful, exotic animals in their care.   -  In response to negative remarks made by other reviewers ... please...if you were expecting a carnival-like Disney atmosphere with lights and music - remember - every cent is spent on caring for, housing and feeding the animals ... would you want them to spend their money on a parking lot and playground or costly gift shop when they are a non-profit organization?  If so, maybe you went for the wrong reasons.  And this place is sponsored by the one U.S. organization that inspects and approves animal refuges/zoos and has given it the highest rating.   Looking for glitz ... don't go.  Looking for a humanitarian gift to God's beautiful creatures ... make a visit.  You won't be disappointed.
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	98990	1	/users/profile/117957	JIMTHEGEM	Donor	5	10/05/2011	     I have visited the facility twice.  On the first trip, I was amazed at the care and cleanliness of the animals.  The animals seemed content and relaxed.  The staff was helpful and educated.  Being an "intelligent" donor, I investigated other resources before deciding to become a donor.     The next visit (Two weeks later), before becoming a donor, validated this was a worthy organization.  Each visit, my wife and I observed the care and concern for these animals from the staff.  I have since recommended that friends visit the GW Exotic Animal Park.

With the excellent staff here you will always find that the animals are loved, cared for and the guest are treated just like kings and queens. The park grounds are beautiful and all the cages are spotless. One of the best private owned zoos in the world. This zoo serves also as a refuge to homeless animals that have no where else to go. It is a must see place. any negative comment is from people who have never been here.

G W Exotic Animal Foundation	95545	7	/users/profile/110948	kmoney	General Member of the Public	1	08/11/2011	this place is a JOKE... on our way home to Dallas from OKC we saw the signs and stopped so my daughter could get a little energy out and have fun looking at animals. The little gift shop wreaked of animal urine and the lady in there looked like she hadn't taken a shower in weeks, and didn't know what a tooth brush was. It is awfully expensive for what little experience there is. The tigers looked absolutely miserable. There were ducks and chickens running around everywhere outside of their cages that were missing half their beaks. It looked like they had got into a fight. There were about 10 workers sitting on benches talking to each other the entire time we were there, ignoring the few amount of visitors to the park and animals. 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94756		/users/profile/109680	kaitystrawberry	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2011	I went to this park for my brothers birthday and OMG it was the BEST thing ever. These people really do care about these animals. I can honestly say that I can never look at any other zoo the same because at this zoo you can see how much they truley care about these animals. I had the best time with my family because we got to interact with some of the animals. Also, at this zoo, there are no flys on the animals, nor was there an offensive smell coming from any of their habitats. If you're ever in the area, go for the tour. Thank you GW park for the amazing tour and we'll see you soon!

The animals are so beautiful and well taken care of,  you can tell they are happy.  They do a good job of rescue and you won't be disappointed if you visit. You can get so close to the animals it's unreal! So different from a zoo, you would just have to see the difference.  Make sure you take the time to visit this place!
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94272		/users/profile/108955	Debloveszero	Donor	5	07/24/2011	I first went to GW in Oct. 2007. I signed up for a three-day retreat and really wasn't sure what I was getting myself into. I spent those three days helping to clean cages and learning how to care for the animals. I learned that the staff doesn't eat until every animal is cared for. It was an extraordinary experience and one that I would totally recommend. Since my first visit I've been back to the park several times and always had a great time. The interaction with the animals is worth the price of admission. 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94226		/users/profile/108892	berly	General Member of the Public	5	07/22/2011	My daughter and I came upon GW Animal Park by accident in June this year and it has changed our lives. We were so impressed that my daughter has become a sponsor and a volunteer. After our first visit, we returned to Houston where we live and immediatly planned a return trip the very next weekend. We are headed back this coming weekend and can't wait. These animals are so happy. Once you visit, you too will know.

The animals are awesome and well cared for, it's a very nice place to visit.  You get to be so close up to all the animals, it's an awesome experience for any age. 
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94148		/users/profile/108754	OklahomaGirl	Donor	5	07/21/2011	The animals here are all rescues from abuse, malnutrition or maiming.  Some have a missing leg or foot,  and some were just mistreated by owners or travelling circuses.  All animals have lots of room and are well cared for.  They expand just about every year.  I have not been in a couple of years, but go to their website all the time to see what they have added or what animals they have rescued.  I believe in this group of people, although in the beginning did not agree with their captive breeding program.  I now realize that without sanctuaries and captive breeding, many of these animals will become extinct.  Their natural habitats are slowly diminishing, being taken over by the human population, and the animals are slowly dying of even in India and Africa.  They have an 18 minute film on their site that explains what is happening to the wild cat population and its worth watching.  It will open your eyes.  They always can use donations because the costs are tremendous.  If every person who reads this can just give a $5.00 donation, this would help them greatly.  If you ever have a chance to visit this facility, you should.  The people are kind and very knowledgeable and you leave there feeling a very special connection with the animals.  I have donated on many occasions, but know that it will take many people giving small donations to make a difference for them.

It was an amazing experience.  The staff were so friendly and down-to-earth.  You could see how much the staff cared about their animals - and you could see how much the animals cared about them.  This was an amazing experience.My son is 4 and he got to touch a baby tiger.  I don't care what you say about if you should be able to..  My young man had the experience of a life time.  He has talked about it for weeks.  He has asked all sorts of questions about where tigers live and why they can't live their any more.  The staff educates the public.  I learned a lot while we were at the park and the experience was priceless to me and my family.
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94081		/users/profile/108651	Kyle Dozier	Client Served	5	07/20/2011	I think it is sad that these other posters call themselves "animal lovers." True animal lovers would try to help and not go to every site that GW is on and try to just slander their name for some sort of sick personal gain and satisfaction.  Everyone talks crap about them not being able to afford the water bill.  If the government can give billions to banks to pay their executives bonuses and hold company parties, why can't these guys get a little help?  This place is great.  They actually love the animals and take care of them as pets (unlike some other places).  I will definitely go back, because not only did I enjoy it, but believe what they are doing for these animals is great.  Great job, Joe!  
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94075	7	/users/profile/108638	AnimalLover	General Member of the Public	1	07/20/2011	I'm appauled at the conditions of this "zoo".They cannot afford to adequately care for the animals they have, yet they continually breed and acquire more.They animals are in substandard housing. Living on rocks is not an appropriate material for an animal.Used tires that can be torn apart and ingested are not appropriate toys for big cats.
G W Exotic Animal Foundation	94060		/users/profile/108617	Tammy	General Member of the Public	5	07/19/2011	My son and I have visited this park twice this year and had an excellant experience both times.  The first time we came we did a one hour private tour where we learned all about the park and the animals.  Our guide was very friendly, gave us lots of background on the tigers and just made sure we had a great time. He even found a tiger whisker and gave it to my son.  We got to spend 15 minutes playing with a tiger cub which was the coolest thing either of us had ever done.   Our next visit was just a week ago.  We did a two hour tour with a large group of people.  Even though it was incredibly hot, the staff did all they could to keep us cooled off and make sure we learned lots and had fun.  We got to play with several baby animals and the staff took pictures of our tour so we left with a photo CD full of memories. This place is incredible.  I feel like it is a part of me.  I go to their Facebook page and website regularly so I can keep up with the animals and see what everyone is up to.  The staff is so friendly you really feel at home there.  You can tell that they love the animals and the park and that love is infectious.  I highly recommend that you experience this awesome place for yourself!

Most of the animals have been rescued from bad situations and now live their lives content and secure. The park staff at G.W. exotic works tirelessly to ensure that the park is clean, the animals' needs are met, and visitors have a memory that is sure to bring them back. I spent a night at one of the cabins and absolutely loved it! Nothing compares to the huffs and calls of the big cats while sitting under the stars. I highly recommend it.

Cages are much larger than the required size, they are clean and very well maintained, there are covers to keep the animals shaded, the houses are nice and roomy, they are just beautiful!  The animals have beautiful coats to show good health and care and they do look happy.  The people are extraordinary!  Each and every person, from the Director, to the outside crews, to the office and gift shop personnel always have a smile on their face, greets everyone they meet, is more than willing to help or answer any questions, and have a sense of pride with their jobs!

I have been a volunteer with this group from the very beginning, and can post that I am very, very HAPPY to be a part of such an excellent & very hard working group of families & individuals!!  These peoples come from varied backgrounds, degrees & non-degreed and from the young to the older.. ;)  Like me, we have some SENIOR volunteers and the owner & managers the married couple named: Harold & Lynn Sullivan have dedicated most of their lives to the care of the offtrack thoroughbreds in this state. And, they have recent permission to help horses from some other states, as well!!  I greatly appreciate their hard work and most of all their graciousness to take in the ottb and evaluate them and help them in any way they can!  I have personally had many 'uplifting moments into days, and much happiness" from volunteering & from viewing their different websites to fbook sites! Also, have much joy & resting moments; by helping making crafts &/or making jewelry bags~ to be sold to get monies to help these gorgeous & absolutely amazing animals!  I hope you to will view their website and open your heart to the needs of the horses that are in their care.  Many horses come to any rescue farm needing much veterinary care & rehabbing; than the work of retraining them starts..so, YES, the needs continue every day at a rescue farm.  Thank you for reading my post!  I hope you will SHARE this farm's info and help them earn around $43.00~ by going to~ www.greatnonprofit.org~ their front page describes, how just by SHARING their link on that site..you can help this ottb farm earn some much needed dollars!  (I will include a pic of one of my son's & his favorite Arabian mare & foal. And some sample ideas of items that can be donated to the yearly Silent Auction..that when sold helps make monies for this farm! Most Sincerely, Rebecca Hill~

OTTB's are beautiful, loving creatures who have so much more to give to a responsible owner. More organizations need to help our nation's horses. I commend them so much for dealing with the dark side of the racing industry and other sources where OTTB's come from needing homes vs. disposal.

Thoroughbred Athletes Inc.	307613	2	/users/profile/398960	angie.santillan	Volunteer	5	10/03/2016	Thoroughbred athletes was such a blessing to me. I used to be terrified of horses but once I got a look of Lynn's horses I instantly fell in love with horses. I used to be a tad bit girly girl and didnt really enjoy the smell of a ranch, i would go to mexico at my grandpas ranch and the smell made me want to just stay inside and not go outside at all but now the aroma of the horses at thoroughbred athletes is so amune to me. My mom always asks me how I last when I clean the stalls but I tell her that I just love it there so much that I don't even think about it. I even became more hard working. In fact i love horses and the ranch so much now that my quinceera (a Mexican tradition that we do when a girl turns 15 and "becomes a women" you make a huge event with family and friends) well it's going to be ranch themed at a ranch obviously (which isnt normal because theyre usually in the city but i love the ranch so much now that i dont care that it won't be "normal") i cant express how much I've changed as a person after volunteering at thoroughbred athletes.in the photo it should describe it a little bit (features one of my favorite horses at thoroughbred athletes)  I love how much care Lynn puts into a horses health. It amazes me how much the horses improve from when they first got there. When you compare them in photos to how they are after a while at thoroughbred athletes would put you in a shock. It touches me when i go volunteer and the weather is not the best or just plain freezing in the winter and lynn is STILL there working hard, making sure her horses are fine, and seeing if everything is in check. Everyone there is always working hard and giving their free time to those horses so they can live a long healthy and happy life. Donating to thoroughbred athletes would be the best decision to ever make, trust me its just as helpful as volunteering. (Doing both would be great too)

The horses are each cared for on an individual basis and receive top quality care. Not only does this organization do tons for their own horses and efforts, but Lynn also makes sure to give back to other nonprofits in our state through whatever support is possible. It is superbly clear that this organization not only strives to meet its own goals and missions, but helps others on the way. I could not be more proud to be a part of the efforts of this org.

To me, they are the epitome of a non-profit, as it is painfully clear that they care more for their horses' wellbeing than they do their own.

The horses are so well cared for, happy, and Lynn works very hard to see that they are placed in homes that will be beneficial for everyone involved. If you inquire about a horse you are given a full history on them good or bad. Lynn leaves nothing to question. You know as much about the horse as she does before you decide which one you want! I cannot wait to see the future of this organization, with Lynn at the helm the sky is the limit!

We helped them find and save several horses from auctions and feedlots.  Some had one foot on the trailer to slaughter.  They took over and helped get the horses ready for a new vocation and life.   Some of the poor horses still had their race shoes on from the track.. the trainers/owners didn't even take the time to pull their shoes before dumping them at auctions!Thumbs up to the crew at Thoroughbred!  They are top notch!

Before arriving, I was sure that my search for a nice horse would be long and arduous, as I wanted to be sure I was finding the perfect new mount to bring along.  Upon arrival, I immediately saw many nice horses...all being meticulously cared for.  The facility was immaculate, and all of the horses were obviously fed and groomed well.  I also noticed each horse being appropriately handled and worked with in a manner that suited each horse's individual needs based on where he/she was in their stage of rehabilitation and retraining coming off of the track.  After seeing several nice prospects that day, and learning each of their stories, I made the decision to adopt an extremely lovely mare from Thoroughbred Athletes, Inc., and she was on my property within the week.  I am so happy about the decision I made, and I truly believe that the thoroughbred racing industry in Oklahoma is so fortunate to have a facility such as this to aid in rehabilitating, retraining, and re-homing horses off the track.  I have recommended the facility to other friends of mine who may be looking for horses in the future, and I feel so grateful that I have found such a wonderful place, doing such positive things for these great animals.

It was a great experience for her and very unforgettable.  Made new friends, intensely worked on her arts discipline for two weeks, learned about other arts disciplines, worked under Professionals in the field brought in from other places, etc.  She felt this was a prestigious camp and worked hard to audition in. She plays the violin.As a parent, was very impressed from the beginning when dropping our daughter off to camp.  All was very organized.  They made everyone feel very welcome with a smile and willingness to meet any needs.  It was great all the way through from the concerts parents could attend on the weekends, keeping the kids safe by not allowing anyone in but on certain times, limited use of cell phones, set rules in place to keep all things running good...again, very organized. What a wonderful organization that helps promote the arts in the state of Oklahoma!  My daughter cannot wait until next year.  This organization made sure our kids thanked the donors who allowed our kids to be there for almost a $2500 valued scholarship.  I know my daughter also received a letter too for participating.  Good etiquette is always good for our kids to learn.  This organization made sure each and every kid was recognized in their local town newspapers as well as news lips being done on TV.  Very impressed!

I remember very vividly the first day with our guest conductor, Maestro Jeffrey Grogan, as we sat down and opened our two-week experience with the finale to Ottorino Respighi's "Pines of Rome." I had never felt so much power and emotion swell into me as I did playing in that exact moment and I felt like all of my preconceived notions about the world and the people in it had vanished. As the week went on, I watched Oklahoma's most talented youth pour their hearts out through their craft, both thriving in their environment and struggling to be better not for themselves, but for the people around them. We all met people younger, older, male, female, gay, straight, lesbian, black, white, or whatever it is that they identified as and none of it mattered. OSAI brought us together and, without trying to, taught us to care for each other and collaborate through our individual crafts. I can't think of another place where so many people who were all so young could have felt that unified. This organization is more than just guest speakers, workshops, and a fun two weeks away. The Oklahoma Arts Institute is creating beauty in the world, changing lives, and truly bringing out the best in every individual that has ever had the opportunity to attend their programs.

After attending two years of OSAI as a student, I have met other inspirational students from across this state that are also passionate and hard-working in their artistic discipline as well as professional faculty that I look up to as great role models. Furthermore, the OSAI that I attended was not just a two-week long workshop for just photography, orchestra, modern dance, chorus, ballet, film and video, creative writing, acting, and drawing and painting or any discipline alone; it is an Institute for all arts listed combined for a true arts program, so we are able to draw inspiration, not only from students in our discipline, but also from students in other disciplines. There are also many students in the state who cannot afford to attend workshops or camps.

The creative and artistic opportunities are unmatched, the friends I have made there are still in touch, and there is not a day that passes when I am not thankful and count myself lucky to have been accepted into this program last summer.

Oklahoma Arts Institute at Quartz Mountain	168661		/users/profile/223599	dankrig	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2013	Oklahoma Fall Arts Institute is a wonderful opportunity for  art teachers, artist and those who are engaged in art in any way.  I have attended OFAI several times to attend workshops taught by professional artists and instructors. The quality of instruction has been excellent. And the opportunity to work over a four day period with a specific medium without interruption is awesome! It has given  me the opportunity to grow as an artist and teacher to take new skills/ideas back to my art class and implement them with my students. The fact that OFAI is a scholarship based opportunity makes it available to teachers who could not otherwise afford such a rich art immersion experiences. Oklahoma artists are so fortunate to have this program.

Quartz brings in the most talented and passionate people in every discipline and allows students to submerge themselves into a hard, challenging, empowering, and rewarding atmosphere for two weeks during the summer. The application progress to get into the program is rigorous and competitive, but getting in allows students to reap incredible rewards. I attended the program for choral music and got to work with some incredible conductors. The time I spent at Quartz shaped me into who I am today -- a passionate and successful  music education major. I have made dear and lifelong friends that share similar passions and was able to make a large amount of connections. Attending Quartz is one of my most fond experiences in high school. I hope to go back someday as a liaison!

Those two weeks that I spent on the mountain at Quartz Mountain, completely immersed in my art form, were the best two weeks of my life. Being able to learn from people who have achieved such success as Tony Awards, Grammy Awards and Academy Awards is a great and wonderful experience.

The quality of instruction has typically been excellent.  And the opportunity to work over a four day period with a specific subject/medium without interruption is awesome!

Oklahoma Arts Institute at Quartz Mountain	11074	3	/users/profile/13011	CChavers	General Member of the Public	5	09/26/2009	I first attended the Oklahoma Summer Arts Institute in 1979 after graduating from high school. I studied print making with my instructor Dan Kiacz. With his encouragement and guidance, I decided to major in Art in college. I am in my 25th year of teaching Art and have trained 6 student teachers to become Art teachers, I've also had many students go on to major in Art and get Art careers. I have attended the OFAI many times studying every visual Art they offer. Each time it impacts my personal Art and my students. I would not be as successful as an Art teacher today if it wasn't for the initial 2 weeks of Quartz Mountain Arts Institute when I was 18, and for all the training I've received since I began teaching in 1984. I am grateful for every time I'm accepted and for every teacher I learn something valuable. I am a direct product of the Oklahoma Arts Institute and it's positive impact on the Arts in Oklahoma.
Oklahoma Arts Institute at Quartz Mountain	10843	7	/users/profile/12768	ApostrapheS	Board Member	5	09/23/2009	Both of our sons attended OSAI (the summer session) of OSAI and it made a HUGE, positive impact on both of their lives.  One of the first comments made by our older son was that "he was amazed to be in a place where EVERYONE is an artist and a good one" and that "it really felt good to NOT be competing with the jocks for resources".  Both sons, after being enrolled in college a short time, expressed amazement that other states don't have programs like this and how great it was to be able to completely focus on their art 24/7 for two whole weeks!  Because of the enormous positive impact that it made in their lives and other students, I readily joined the board.  Now I can also see just how hard the impressive staff works all year long to provide excellent arts education opportunities to Oklahoma high school students.This is a GREAT organization!

The half hour I spent there was so impactful in a way I could never have imagined.  That visit inspired me to choose international health as a focus for my studies.  I became a volunteer then and have supported WN ever since.  The way they empower a community is so beautiful.  They never come into a priority population and just start giving them things to make life easier.  WN TEACHES, they INSPIRE and they help GROW a community.  They are innovators in health practices.  They have a health indicator wrist marker that Mom's can use to measure there childs nutrition health.  The "clean birth kit" is simple, so simple it works!  Terrace farming is something that enables communities to have food security and sustainability.  I am so proud to be a WN volunteer and hope that there work is recognized to a greater extent.

World Neighbors	140493		/users/profile/87119	IowaEupher	Board Member	5	11/16/2012	I have had the opportunity to see first-hand what a terrific job World Neighbors is able to do by taking a long-term approach to enabling villages in very poor regions of the world to solve their most important problems whether it be water, HIV-Aids, access to health, or food security.  I visited villages in the Lake Victoria area of Kenya where villagers had leaned how to live productive lives with HIV-Aids, water sources had been purified, regional health centers had been build, and families not only produced enough food for themselves but also had enough to sell in the market.  What is so remarkable is that it is the people who identify their most critical problems, develop a plan for solving them and provide the leadership to implement the solutions. World Neighbor's staff guide the process and identify the technical knowledge that is needed but they don't "do it for the villages."  The result is that after a few years, World Neighbors can move to other villages and the work that has been accomplished continues because the local people own the solutions and have the knowledge to continue the work.  The work is remarkable!

I was emotionally moved by the testimony of the people in the villages in Kenya and Tanzania where World Neighbors works.  To witness three projects in three different phases of development was an incredibly valuable look at how World Neighbors works with local leadership to create the capacity for long-term and sustainable community renewal and development.

Its work inspires people and helps communities identify and address their own particular circumstances and needs.  There is no 'one size fits all' approach to its methods.  World Neighbors works with community leaders through a long term and collaborative process to understand and address key challenges facing the community whether it is sustainable agriculture, micro-credit facilities, public health etc....very much a 'teach a person to fish' role.  The impact of World Neighbors work extends far beyond the community leaders and volunteers with whom WN works most directly....like ripples emanating from a stone tossed into a pond, the results of World Neighbors work spread far into a community and its neighbors.

Far off the main roads and out where the campesinos walk in from distant hillside fields with their crops, I met men and women whose lives had been transformed to the good by programs started by World Neighbors.  Each story shared the basic truth that World Neighbors helped by bringing the right tools to the community it worked with -  whether that was a dialog on village priorities, the mechanics of a  micro-finance cooperative or how to terrace hillsides for optimum irrigation.  In each case the people learned how to use the tool, took pride in using it well, spread the word to friends and neighbors about it and thereby spread the benefits far and wide.  World Neighbors.

World Neighbors	81092		/users/profile/88647	Bill	Volunteer	5	03/03/2011	One day I visited a community farmer training center near Tegucigalpa in Honduras. I stood on the hillside with three young farmers in their mid 20s. They had come because family members suggested it would be a way for them to earn their own livelihood in a way not understood by their fathers ands grandfathers. For Hosea, Julian, and Pedro it was a way out of the past.  They were the poorest of the poor and many of their friends had joined the army. Those three guys now have families of their own though I have long since lost track of them. Yet I learned something that I will never forget. World Neighbors trainers have taught me that it is here among the poorest of the poor that the opportunity for improvement is the greatest and where we can be a catalyst for change that comes from within the heart.  Pedro  said to me one evening, please don't leave me. And we didn't for almost six years, on his own land with corn and bean production exceeding 400% greater than his ancestors. 
World Neighbors	80724		/users/profile/88098	Jean	Board Member	5	03/01/2011	Because It is my good fortune to live in Oklahoma City, headquarters of World Neighbors, I have known about this organization since I heard a program at our church about 20 years ago.  My husband and I thought the integrated and respectful approach to solving problems that World Neighbors brings to the most deprived  villages made so much sense, we were anxious to learn more.  The more we learned, the more impressed we became.  Following our World Neighbors Journey to Ecuador 5 years ago, we  became even stronger advocates.  We were able to meet the outstanding field staff, mostly people from the area, and the villagers who told us how much WN had improved their lives. Many women said that without WN their husbands would have needed to go to another country to find work to send  home money. But with the help of WN their families now had enough food and healthy living conditions for the family to remain together in their village.  We are now looking forward to a World Neighbors Journey to Peru in a few weeks.

The work of WN has been a model for other non-profit groups in international development, but I doubt if any other group does the basic work of building infra-structure and encouraging community self-help as World Neighbors.

I first learned about World Neighbors in graduate school as a field trip. I was blown away by their focus on serving international populations living in poverty. My passion for World Neighbors stems from how they choose to serve. Rather than sending Americans oversees to "fix" problems, they work with local people to develop culturally appropriate solutions to problems with poverty, child mortality, women's rights, health, etc. They are careful to advocate for change in a manner that does not infringe on culture ... what a group!

World Neighbors	590	1	/users/profile/1032	NWsupporter	Board Member	5	04/02/2008	I first learned about World Neighbors 11 years ago, when I met its CEO and board chair at a conference in Washington DC.  I was amazed to learn that it was then 46 years old because it was clearly doing important and effective international development work but I had never heard of it before.Since that time, I have joined the board of trustees and, in addition to my board work, have traveled to Ecuador, Guatemala and Karnataka, India to visit World Neighbors programs.  During those visits, I have met many program participants, shared meals with them and learned first-hand from them how World Neighbors programs have changed their lives in very positive and lasting ways.  World Neighbors works only in rural areas of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.  Often, it works with communities and villages so remote that no other development organizations are willing or able to work there.  World Neighbors makes long term commitments to the communities it engages with and typically remains in an area for 8-10 years.  By making long term commitments and carefully planning both its entry into new communities and its exit strategies, World Neighbors ensures that the progress made while it is engaged with communities will be sustainable for decades after it has moved on to new communities and other regions.  There are villages in rural India where World Neighbors first worked in the late 1950s that are still thriving in ways that neighboring communities have never done, because those communities participated in World Neighbors programs decades ago.  It is hard to find other development programs that have achieved such long lasting success, no matter where you look around the world.World Neighbors always focuses its work on those areas of need that its program participants think are most important to them.  It never enters a new region with pre-conceived ideas about what the people there need.  However, some problems are universal in the developing world and often include issues of food security and sustainable agriculture, environmental conservation, access to clean water and family and reproductive health.  Many communities are also interested in working with World Neighbors to establish micro credit associations, leadership development programs and gender equity programs.  Together, these types of programs, which World Neighbors implements through partnerships with local non-governmental organizations staffed by local people, are able to significantly improve the lives of those who participate in them.  Some of the tangible outcomes include greatly increased food security through sustainable agriculture, enhanced methods of environmental conservation, adequate shelter for the entire family, access to health care and and clearn water, smaller, better spaced and planned families, and more opportunities for education and income generating activities, especially for girls and women.  All of these add up to increased self sufficiency, greater confidence among participants in their own ability to provide for their families, greater self respect, and above all, hope for a better future for themselves and their families.

Joy In The Cause, and specifically Lisa Bain, was an angel sent by God to me and my family.  One day, on a day that was particularly difficult, Lisa came to my door with a bag filled with Joy!  There were gift cards for food, a personally crafted quilt for warmth, a Mavis Pearl stuffed animal for comfort and a check for necessities and to help with the cost of lost pay checks.  I am just one of many many people whose lives have been touched and greatly helped by Joy In The Cause in their hour of need.  This organization is such an asset and a huge blessing to so many in our community. They truly do bring Joy in each and every cause because "your cause matters".  They are life changing!

I proudly would do anything I could for this organization. They have done so much for us, my son in particular. He needed a therapy/service dog and we couldn't possibly make it happen on our own and without a second thought Lisa said, "let us help" and that is exactly what they did. This dog has only been part of our family for two weeks and has already had a profound impact on my 7 year old leukemia survivor. After 3.5 years of chemotherapy he has some long term side effects including chronic knee pain, memory issues and a ptsd of sorts. Stella vanilla (the puppy) ) has given him confidence exponentially visible to our family and to the school. You see, BW tested for the gifted and talented (GnT) program at his school, and he was accepted after passing test with flying colors! When I talked to him about how proud his daddy and I both are he said well mom, I had to be smart for Stella so I can train her! Stella is changing our lives and we have Joy in the Cause to thank for that! This organization has heart that many lack. This is the cream de la cream!

Joy in the Cause	308538	1	/users/profile/399913	Mary465	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	We are Trinity Baptist Church Quilters. Lisa calls us her quilting Angels. We are a few retired ladies that love to make beautiful quilts. We are from the age of 70 - 92. We were making a few quilts each month for our local mission. We never new where they went, to someone that would really appreciate them or not. We met this lovely lady named Lisa Bain and a dog named Mavis Pearl, it changed our lives. We began making prayer quilts for cancer patients, we saw each month what a difference we were making in the lives of others. We get thank you letters almost every month. Joy in the Cause gives us a reason to get up in the mornings. We love what we do and why we do it. Thank God for Joy in the Cause.

They reached out to me and my son when I was in the hospital. They brought us food after I came home not on just one occasion but twice. I was so touched. I have now been a volunteer for over a year and have been involved in many events. The genuine love that they have for people in the community is just amazing. I have delievered  dogs to people in need, dresses Mavis dog, and just spent time talking with strangers. It's such a blessing to be a part of this amazing organization.

Recipients of JITC become volunteers, volunteers spread joy to the next people in need, and then those people become volunteers. It's a beautiful cycle of love, giving, & joy. 
Joy in the Cause	302438		/users/profile/393571	Edana B.	Volunteer	5	09/02/2016	As a volunteer with Joy In The Cause, I absolutely LoVe everything about this organization!  It was news stories about the "furry face" of JITC, Mavis Pearl, that first caused me to first notice JITC and the joy they are spreading throughout our community.  But it wasn't until I visited the website, and began reading the story behind how Joy In The Cause began, that my heart truly and fully became vested in the mission -- to spread JOY.  It's that simple.  Joy to our senior heroes in nursing facilities; Joy to those in the chemo treatment centers; Joy to the children fighting diseases; Joy to the families whose loved ones are on hospice care; Joy to our veterans; Joy to anyone who needs it; Joy.  Pure and simple.  And the mission is catching on!  So many companies and organizations are realizing how special it is to share Joy In The Cause {whatever the Cause may be}, and they're not only donating funds but volunteering their time and talents!! It's so exciting to be part of something so special!!  What's the Cause near and dear to your heart?  At JITC, your Cause matters!!  
Joy in the Cause	302407		/users/profile/393539	Cindy213	Volunteer	5	09/02/2016	Joy in the Cause is a non-profit with a unique purpose-to bring joy to those in life-altering situations and illnesses.  These joyful, hopeful moments are made possible through not only financial donations but also through the time and talents of over 300 volunteers.  Where there are needs for love and hope, Joy in the Cause complements other service providers to meet those personal, special needs. It is a non-profit that is successful because of its unique mission and it's amazing leadership. As a volunteer, it has given me the perfect place to share my skills and talents to benefit so many.  From sewing and crocheting items that are distributed to the "joy receivers" to using my skills in planning and organizing sewing events to best utilize volunteers, I have found a welcoming and fulfilling environment for my volunteer service.  Helping provide joy to others has been one of the greatest sources of joy in my life!

My 9 year old daughter and I started making tutus in early 2015 and shortly after my brother was diagnosed with Stage 3 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. JITC was a bright light in such a dark place for our family. They provided stuffed Mavis dogs for my niece and offered support, prayers and life-long friendships were made. My grandfather had also just been given a clean bill of health after prostate cancer treatments and JITC arranged a "bucket list" flight for him to celebrate!!  We will be forever grateful to JITC and are honored to be a small part in paying it forward with such a wonderful cause.

Their volunteers bring light into the darkness. They have so many "arms" that reach into different areas of need such as , cancer patients, nursing communities, special needs, women and children's shelters and police outreach. They truly want to change the world. My organization, Diakonos Group, LLC,  believes in their mission so much that we are their platinum sponsor for their annual fundraising event/dinner. They are determined to leave the world better than they found it. 
Joy in the Cause	255314		/users/profile/343700	Kimberly121	Volunteer	5	09/08/2015	I am Kim. I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. My first day of chemo I met Lisa and Mavis and was amazed by this woman and her love and compassion.  I saw them again at TCI on a day of chemo that wasn't going very well.  All I wanted was to see Lisa, and get some encouragement that only she could give. And my terrible day was turned around.  I have stayed in touch with Lisa, and she was there my last day of radiation.  Her love and support is much appreciated because my family is in another state and what she did, and continues to do is heart warming and inspiring.  
Joy in the Cause	253124		/users/profile/341280	mjsebe	Donor	5	08/17/2015	I work with the International Organization for Rainbow for Girls.  Every six months a young lady picks a new service project to work with.  One of my girls picked Joy In The Cause.  It was by far the best experience for our girls.  They raised money for the stuffed Mavis dogs and were able to personally deliver these dogs to patients at the cancer center.  The girls also made tutu's for the Mavis dogs.  Lisa was very positive influence on the girls and tons of fun.  The girls learned just how much it means to work towards a goal and then they saw exactly how the money they raised for Joy In The Cause was spent.  Lisa and Skipper worked well with my pre-teens and teenagers.  They both made them feel very important and even though their monitory donation was not as large as some they were treated like royalty.  Lisa personally has worked with our girls and made them feel important to the cause.  This organization spreads love, support and most of all Joy to everyone it helps.  After our 6 months was up with sponsoring Joy In the Cause the girls continue to work making supplies for Mavis Dogs and even sponsoring care packages, gas cards, and hopefully in the future more Mavis Dogs.
Joy in the Cause	252976		/users/profile/341120	SwainMountian	Client Served	5	08/14/2015	I've been blessed in SO many ways since meeting Lisa and getting involved with Joy In The Cause...how long have you got?When I lost yet another friend to cancer I was proud when her daughter and niece became volunteers and fundraisers for several cancer related non for profits in Tulsa. I loved watching them grow as individuals through helping fight what has taken so many loved ones. When they started sharing stories about Lisa and her 'Star of the Show' dog Mavis Pearl the sparkle in their eye was infectious. I live in Arkansas and they in Oklahoma but when invited to help, I pulled out my sewing machine, wore Google and YouTube out trying to channel the high school me who earned an A+ on her senior sewing protect but hadn't sewed a stitch to sequel about since! When Lisa sent a photo of the little girl fighting cancer , hugging a Mini' Mavis wearing a dress I'd made, the feeling in my soul was unmatchable. I had to retire early due to my own health and am restricted to being at home most of my days...but at last I could 'Help' again.Through her own illness and the loss of her mother Lisa has created and taken Joy In The Cause to so many. Touching all she meets so deeply, sincerely, in such a lasting way, she is nothing less than inspiring in my own life. From children who've lost a parent, those with special needs, senior citizen who think they're lost and forgotten, when the Joy in The Cause gang walk in and start sharing their gifts of cookies, gift cards, books and best of all their own hand dressed Mavis Pearl dog, the gratitude, the long lost smiles, the tears of JOY for being remembered, you can see it swell, you can feel it grow from them all. It's amazing! It's impossible to have a bad day when you've spent it with this group and pretty hard not to be glowing a week later, still walking around with a smile.My son was hospitalized with congestive heart failure I spent over 2 weeks camped in his room. My worry was inconsolable and my wallet was beyond empty. I was weary and worn reaching for any last string of strength, a mother shows no fear to a their ill child you see. I was alone and on empty, then Lisa found out what was happening. Suddenly I looked up and like the brightest burst of sunshine and she arrived with a bag full of JOY and my spirits revival. From cupcakes to clothing to hugs of support the bag she brought out seemed bottomless. How I needed the t-shirts, the warmth of the sweatshirt and the smile I saw again, when she pulled out a quilt laying over my boy in his bed...I felt my strength refilling. There was a Visa card for gas and grocery's, a gift card to Olive Garden who even delivered to the hospital giving us the best dinner I've ever shared with my son when he was finally able to eat again. I slept wrapped in that blanket the whole second week, receiving the prayers I knew were sewn in with each stitch . I felt the support, I found again, my strength. On the way home, that Visa card also helped fill the very expensive prescriptions he was given. My son saw the kindness, felt it's 'meaning' and smiled, reviving my soul again. I am proud of my connection with JITC as well as grateful.I know JoyInTheCause has touched many lives, I believe JITC has truly saved at least 1! A lifelong friend of mine suffers from sever depression to the point she's tried to end her life. Deep in despair and darkness I begged her to reach out, to do something for someone else, get her 'out' of herself. She started making tutu's for the stuffed Mavis pups. In the last 40 years I've never seen her so involved in such a light giving, happiness making, support sharing group. Lisa, Mavis Pearl and JITC has changed her life....again, I am so grateful...I am so blessed, I have deeply touched and forever changed.

Joy in the Cause	252754		/users/profile/340863	Pedsrn22	Client Served	5	08/12/2015	I first contacted Joy in the Cause for help promoting brain cancer funding when my son was diagnosed in February. At that time, we were told he would most likely be heading to MD Anderson for treatment because Tulsa does not treat pediatric brain tumors for the most part. Lisa, whom I have never met, immediately sent a care package out for all my children, including the beloved Mavis Pearl dogs and sheets for my son for his hospital bed. We were overwhelmed by her generosity, especially from a complete stranger. When we recently went to Cleveland for a 2nd opinion, she again sent a box with travel games and gift cards for restaurants. I cannot tell you how much this has meant to us as a family and especially as a mother to see my kids so excited to receive a little something to let them know that someone is cheering them on and praying for their brother. Cancer affects the entire family and Joy In the Cause is there to help ease the burden by brightening people's day! 
Joy in the Cause	252735		/users/profile/340845	bshort	Client Served	5	08/12/2015	Our son, Logan, was diagnosed with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis in May 2013 and and went through a year of chemotherapy.  He was off of treatment for 6 months, then we found out that he relapsed in December 2014 and would be undergoing a more aggressive chemo through May 2016.  We met Lisa in January 2015 when we were referred to her by our good friend, Susan.  She brought our family the most awesome care package and the kids LOVED meeting Mavis Pearl.  It was definitely a bright spot for our family at a time when it was really needed.  Lisa Bain is one of the kindest, most generous women you will ever meet.  And it is very comforting knowing that she and Joy in the Cause are there for us when we need some "Joy" during the rough times that come with a tough medical diagnosis.  Through this journey, we have also decided to start volunteering as a family for this wonderful organization!

Never have I experienced a more caring and compassionate group of people. I look forward to a long and fruitful experience together. My mother passed away almost three years ago and I  was her primary caregiver. Until I found Lisa and JITC I was lost. This organization gives my life meaning and purpose in the most pure, profound way. There are not enough words to express  what this organization has accomplished and I will continue to sing their praises.
Joy in the Cause	252704		/users/profile/340804	MissionISpossible	Volunteer	5	08/12/2015	My daughter was diagnosed with cancer when she was 15 years old. Joy In The Cause (JITC) provided care packages, numerous visits, and consistently called and emailed to check on us throughout our lengthy treatment. Joy In The Cause provided us so much joy in a very dark time, a time where we felt very alienated,  JITC was consistent and supportive. This organization is not like anything I had ever seen. Many people fall in the gap and don't meet the requirements for other charities, but JITC is able to provide blessings to those people.  Joy In The Cause stands in the gap and lives are changed as a result.Our journey with cancer was life changing and our future now includes JITC because it is part of our new family. My daughter and I are active volunteers for JITC because we believe in the mission of JITC.

Holly spent many days of her summer in and out of the hospital.  Some of those stays were boring, lonely, and a few quite frightening.  That's where we met Lisa Bain.  She came to visit us. She brought Holly a stuffed Mavis Pearl dog, a gift card, and a contagious smile.  Holly's spirits were lifted and our stay just wasn't as bad that time.  We have been on this journey for three years.  Holly is now 17.5 and 10 months off treatment.  We are now spreading joy to other pediatric/teen cancer patients through Joy in the Cause because no one fights cancer alone.

Lisa visited many times to bring care packages to our family during long weeks while our daughter received chemo. The packages were full of gift cards and words of encouragement. Our favorite part was the great headbands and goofy glasses, games and things to keep us focused on Bella's battle. Mavis Pearl and Lisa also made home visits, bring insurmountable joy, smiles, and joy jumps. When our daughter passed away a year and a half later, Joy in the Cause remained to support and pray for us, reminding us to live in the moment, spread joy, and help others to heal so you in turn can begin the journey to healing. Joy in the Cause has touched the lives of thousands of people and we are blessed to be a part of their legacy. ----We Battle for Bella ---

United States Zoological Association	139385		/users/profile/185501	Keeper72	General Member of the Public	1	11/14/2012	Yet another group designed to pull at heart strings.  It is headed by Joseph Schreibvogel a very money hungry, drama queen who is linked to working with horrible zoos in India and bad animal brokers.  He breeds for greed so this organization is yet another ploy for him to line his pockets while big cats suffer and they recieve sub standard care.  When he will spend the money on flea control then he might get a different review from someone who just watches and isn't one of his self proclaimed "joe exotic minions".  These folks have formed a cult like situation and have the mentality to go with it.  When they stop attacking those that are just asking questions and expect honest answers then they will get respect until then this is not something I will ever support.  They rank right up there with the HSUS and their manipulative occupations.

United States Zoological Association	136901	3	/users/profile/182850	Fred L.	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	These guys actually put their money where their mouth is! Unlike so many "rescue" groups today, they do whatever it takes to help, rather than just take somebody's animals and then tell sob stories about how abusive their "victim" was. And when they do step in and take an animal, you can be sure it's going to be treated better at the Park, not worse or killed off. Their caging is strong, secure, and good-looking, unlike the chicken wire-and-hog ties of a place I saw in Florida. Contributions earmarked for a special cause or as a special memorial will certainly go where specified, and not into the owner's country club dues or retirement fund like with that big national "humane" outfit. They don't skimp on animal feed either, don't feed "scraps," and more importantly, don't feed live small animals to bigger animals. 
United States Zoological Association	136894	3	/users/profile/182843	Betty A.	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2012	This is one of the best animal rescued association in our country.  There rescues are so professional the animals come out with little to NO upset to the animals life.  Then they have a forever home at GW Park with the staff and Joe Exotic.  He teaches his staff menbers how to interact with the animals and the ability to help take care of them all.  They came to Ohio to help fight the exotic animal ban where there would be no need to have to start rescuing Ohio animals because of a bad exotic law which will put alot of animals in danger of losing there loving home.  This association I believe is a voice for the animal exotic and domestic.  God Bless them for that.

From the equipment used, to the person in charge and the handling of the animals. It was a long exhausting trip with sight focused on the task at hand.  Everything done appropriately and in a timely fashion. I would love to work with them again on any level!!!

United States Zoological Association	127308	5	/users/profile/108575	Ronnie	Volunteer	5	10/19/2012	The United States Zoological Association (USZA) is an organization that restored my faith in humanity.  They fight for people who are being attacked for the pets they own & offer help to get them up to state guidelines so they can keep their pets.  They work from the heart & love animals as much as I do.  They won't tolerate any cruelty to animals.  And they speak out against all hatred, discrimination & bigotry toward animals.  They believe all animals deserve to be loved & protected, no matter what the species is.  Please help them help the animals.  This is one organization that isn't about making themselves rich.  All funds go directly back to helping animals.  Whether it's rehoming an animal because of ban laws, or to give them a better home, USZA always steps up to the plate to make it happen.

Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145510		/users/profile/192006	Mark81	Volunteer	5	12/01/2012	Shiloh Summer Camp is the best camp in the USA on the way it is run.  From director Stephan Moore, Chauncy Julius, the office administration, Jerry the groundskeeper, the camp counselors, the instructors at various events, and working for them myself, they keep the kids motivated towards the goal of bringing them to come closer to Jesus through love.  While I was down and almost out, Stephan reached out to me and helped me out tremendously by giving me something to do.  My job is a school bus driver and some of the kids I recognized and told them how well of a job they were doing.  Even though it's in the summer, the staff know how to keep tempers and everyone's bodies cool by providing water and Gatorade with a dedicated water team.  On Friday nights, all the parents and kids have dinner and an awards ceremony along with skits on what God has done in their lives.  I'm truly grateful for Camp Shiloh and it is just an OUTSTANDING place anyone can go and have fun.
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145482		/users/profile/191971	Jo__9	General Member of the Public	5	12/01/2012	I know very little about this camp.....however, I DO know Stephan Moore, and you could not find a better leader!  Stephan has exhibited phenomenal and extraordinary integrity and intelligence in all the years I've known this young man....something like 30 years now....and in all those years, I've never once heard anything negative about him.  Sharing a last name with him has been a source of pride for me, even though I had it first!  I am prouder than I can say that he calls me "Mom!"  Our skin color may be different, but our hearts pulse the same color blood and we share a deep love for our Creator.

This is a dynamic camp that provides dynamic opportunities for youth to grow and develop spiritually, educationally, emotionally and culturally. An investment in this organization is an investment in current and future generations in Oklahoma.
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145340		/users/profile/191850	jchaser405	Volunteer	4	11/30/2012	I have had the amazing opportunity to serve, advocate, grow with Shiloh Summer Camp. With Shiloh you get the rare combination of committed individuals who actually know what they are doing and where they are going. Shiloh's goal is see holistic city transformation through the vehicle of sports, arts, and faith. I am excited to be a part of what is happening through Shiloh and invite those committed to change to get involved. 
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145307		/users/profile/191827	nathantina.williams	Board Member	5	11/30/2012	I am extremely proud to serve on the board of Shiloh.  The impact of Shiloh on the lives of the young people who attend the summer camp and their families is absolutely transformational.  It is amazing to see how much a young boy or girl can grow in their faith, gain confidence, and overcome their fears in the matter of a week.  The dedication of the Director, staff, and volunteers are second to none.
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145293		/users/profile/191814	Gregory8	Volunteer	4	11/30/2012	 This is a great sports & arts camp. The leadership and staff are all about loving on their campers and family.

Stephan Moore and his staff are making such a big impact to many children's lives and their families.   Shiloh is such a wonderful place of peace that is transforming lives.   The children are able to communicate and make new friends.   They are loved on and taught to have hope and to believe in their selves.

Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145066		/users/profile/191627	Dan Coday	Donor	5	11/30/2012	Over the past 30 years the leadership of Shiloh has impressed me and made a very positive impact on my life.  I have visited the camp during session and out of session, and see the passion the leadership has for the inner city kids of Oklahoma City.  They are focused, impactful, and one of the best investments I've seen as a donor.  They've done great things, but are set up for the greatest work still to come!
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145036		/users/profile/191596	Brian53	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/30/2012	I have known the leadership of Shiloh for over 25 years.  Over that time, I have seen incredible consistency in integrity, a heart for God, and a heart for others.  As well, I've been pleased to see the impact that Shiloh has through their stories of life change.  
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145023		/users/profile/169606	Chauncey J.	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I am extremely honored to be a part of the Shiloh Camp family! Ive experienced a variety of firsts in my life. I vividly remember the first time I navigated a bicycle without falling and injuring myself. I remember the first time I jumped off a diving board into the deep end at the neighborhood swimming pool.  My first tasting of black jelly beans was tragic! These memoriessome ill others amusing, all fail in comparison when I think of my first summer at Shiloh Camp.  The relationships forged, working for a Godly purpose & the daily excitement I feel when I drive through the front gate every morning is indescribable.  This is truly my dream job.Having served in the U.S. Army for nearly 12 years and spending 3 years overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Ive acquired a passion for duty and selfless service. And thats exactly what drew me to Shiloh Camp. Shiloh has an undying commitment to OKC's inner city youth. I come from a similar background that many of our inner city campers come from. I get fired up when it comes to sharing the Gospel to at-risk youth.  It was extremely compelling for my family and me to join a different kind of fight and give back to that community. I've completely bought in to Shilohs vision. It allowed me a chance to fight for the spiritual liberties & freedoms of OKC youth by sharing the Gospel. This fight has yielded tremendous rewards and has left me with no regrets! FIGHT ON SHILOH!
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145019		/users/profile/191578	Greg27	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I voluntered with Shiloh this summer with Eye to Eye Marriage Enrichment and Church ABlaze.  We provided a Friday Night meal and voluntered each Friday.  We had a great time interacting with the kids and parents.  Great Job Shiloh for making a difference with the inner city youth.
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145017		/users/profile/191577	Jonathan Hill	Donor	5	11/30/2012	Shiloh camp is a beacon of light in our city. I know Stephan Moore, Exec. Director, and Chauncey Julius, his right hand man, personally. Their families along with the other Shiloh staff are some of the most sacrificing and passionate people I ever met. I am also Stephan's Pastor and I have seen the affect that the camp has had on our older teens and younger kids at Church Ablaze. The camp provides a leadership environment for older youth as they operate as camp counselors. All of the youth in our church that have volunteered in the summers are always eager to return next year. To provide a camp for only $20 allows those underprivileged to participate in the best camp experience in our state. The fee is low but it is not cheap. All of the fun activities, biblical instruction, and realtationship building that takes place at camp provides a quality experience at low cost. I am proud to say I am a volunteer and a donor;  I see the impact every dollar and every volunteer hour is having on the lives of the youth in our state. Not only does it provide a summer camp, but I was apart of an event they hosted for men and boys called mancave, where men and boys camped overnight and instilled Godly manhood in our youth.  I love Shiloh!!!
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	145005		/users/profile/166988	Stephan M.	Advisor	5	11/30/2012	...I get to see and hear first hnad the impact of Shiloh on the lives of Children and their families.  It is real and tangible!  An incredible mountain top experience in the summer that encourages, challenges and provides biblical teaching, role models and Christ centered love.  This one week experience opens a door to year around activity and opportunities for mentoring, training, fellowship and fun and more for the entire family!
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144944		/users/profile/191500	Timothy13	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I've spent a total of 3 summers out there and after the first summer, I couldn't help but to return. The experience there was too amazing! God placed me there for a reason and I was blessed to have been given the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of inner-city youth and the whole Shiloh Family! I spent the first summer as a ropes instructor/part-time counselor and then the next summer as a counselor/part-time ropes instrustor and then the final summer (2012) as the head counselor/part-time ropes instructor/part-time programs but my main focus there was counseling. It's where my heart is with the kids. Getting to spread the gospel of Jesus to the kids who are in need was something way beyond me. It's humbling, it's exciting, it's tear jerking, it's emotional, it's many, many things and being a part of it changed my life forever. Building relationships with the kids is vital because they need that in their lives, someone that cares for them and willing to reach out to help them. I'm willing to bet that anyone who comes in contact with what Shiloh offers, they will leave changed and with a new perspective on life and it's all for God's glory! Not to mention, the relationships you build with the other volunteers and staff members there, it's unreal!
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144929	1	/users/profile/191483	MrsR	Donor	5	11/30/2012	Shiloh is a great community organization reaching into the heart of the City to change lives and I want to be a part of the positive change that is taking place! Their current programs are outstanding and just seeing what their plans are for the 40 acres and for the community for the future makes me want to be a part of it all the more. I back them with my time, funds, and committment!!

Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144672	1	/users/profile/191048	Luton99	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	Shiloh Camp is an extraordinary organization for kids! There are many activities to do there.  When I was younger I went fishing at a lake there and didn't know that they had that lake until someone told me. I was so excited to see the camp. It is a beautiful camp. 
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144665	1	/users/profile/191187	Christine65	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2012	Shiloh Camp is an incredible organization that not only provides a unique Summer Camp opportunity to 600 kids over 6 weeks each Summer, but they also focus on reaching into the community with events and programs serving children and their families as a whole through each and every season in their lives and each and every season in the year. Approaching every detail with excellence and joy in their heart truly leading by example! When I hear the parent testimonies of how their lives have been changed and how their children have changed for the better, you really know God is working miracles at Shiloh.                                                                                             
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144611	1	/users/profile/191148	Neicy H.	Volunteer	4	11/29/2012	Shiloh Camp is by far one the best organizations that I can say I am proud to be apart of. Growing up in the inner-city of Oklahoma can be a very tough, and challanging when all you see around you is negativity and violence.  Shiloh gives kids the opprotunity to explore new faces, surroundings and activities that they may not be able to experience in thier house hold. Most importantly it offers safety and comfort for all kids, especially the ones who grow up in a rough home. Throughout the week the kids learn to trust the counslers and depend on them to lead them in right direction. As a counsler I was able to reach out to young ladies and help them to built thier relationship with God as well as themselves, and there is nothing like leading a child to Christ! All in all, Shiloh is a wonderful place full of positivity and excitement that I recommend for everyone to get to experience!
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144597		/users/profile/191136	Estellesun	Donor	5	11/29/2012	I've been a supporter of many organizations over the years and when I learned of Shiloh and their mission to transform our inner city with the love of Christ through sports, arts, and meaningful relationships I thought I would be a great volunteer for them and started researching their programs to see where I could help. Then I learned more of their mission, "...to build confidence, equip the mind and spirit and strengthen the body planting the seeds of hope for a brighter tomorrow" I realized they were so much more than a day camp. They really focus on the family unit as a whole; healing, teaching, mentoring and transforming lives...and families. I decided then to begin donating and they have lived up to my every expectation. Shiloh is a place of peace and a place of transformation. 
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144505	1	/users/profile/191039	Gillybean	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	I am 12 years old and went with my Mom to take care of the goat, chickens, and bunnies that stay at Shiloh year round. We had a lot of fun and I learned a lot about what goes into keeping all these animals and taking care of them year round. It is a great responsibility, but I guess that is what my Mom wanted me to learn and I did. Gabrielle the goat is funny, he thinks he is a dog and loves to play. The bunnies are big enough to be dogs too, I love the floppy eared bunnies. We had a lot of fun and I can't wait to go back and volunteer again and volunteer for other things. I am looking forward to going back as a camper too and someday I want to be a Counselor at Shiloh so I have a lot to learn. What I love most about Shiloh is that it is not just about a Summer Camp, they have programs and events all year for everyone, the whole family. I saw what their plans are for the future and can't wait for them to reach their goals and plan on helping with my friends. What they bring to our city is life changing and what they have planned for the future is amazing. My Mom talks about it all the time and when she brought me there I finally realized why she thinks Shiloh is so special. Now I do too and share just like my Mom. 
Shiloh Summer Camp Inc	144464	1	/users/profile/191000	Justin19	Volunteer	4	11/29/2012	Shiloh Camp offers anyone a very unique experience. For myself, I had the opportunity to serve both as a Counselor and member of the Programming Team at Shiloh for the Summer terms of 2011-2012. My first term at Shiloh was full of learning moments, every step of the way, it was a full job learning the inner city culture and developing ways to minister "Fun&Jesus" to the children of that demographic. During this time the children of camp were a huge blessing as I had the privilege to see walls of frustration and pain broken down through the meaningful relationships that I had developed with them. One of my personal favorite experiences was the opportunity to teach the kids at a Gospel standpoint. Shiloh Camp really entrusted in my willingness and ability to appropriately preach the Gospel in a way that was relevant and effective to the children attending camp. This aspect lead me to see the larger vision that Shiloh is trying to accomplish through its sports, arts, and relations!

She is an inspiration to me and so many others, working tirelessly to help raise money and awareness for breast cancer! I am SO thankful to call her my friend and for her creative visions with all she does with Breast Impressions! From the casting of roller derby girls all over the country to her survivor calendar she puts together each year and her fashion show at Woodland Hills Mall and our "breast cancer awareness day" at the state capital, she is one truly amazing, inspirational woman and I love her dearly and will continue to be one of her biggest supporters!
Breast Impressions Foundation	38994	6	/users/profile/39924	ebony1	Client Served	5	05/14/2010	Judi Grove with Breast Impressions contacted me after reading a newsarticle about my breast cancer.  She asked if she could cast me for their fundraiser and I said yes.  After all the things we go through with breast cancer, the casting lets you feel good to celebrate your body.  That was just the beginning of a friendship and admiration that kept growing.  Anytime Judi tells me about an event, if I can help either humanly or monetary I do. Without Judi's artistic enthusiasm, Breast Impressions would just be another organization. Judi's dedication shows me she eats, sleeps and lives Breast Impression.  It is an honor to work with Judi Grove and Breast Impressions.  Judy Eason McIntyre, Oklahoma State Senator District 11
Breast Impressions Foundation	38894	7	/users/profile/39812	sassygirlgoldy	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/14/2010	Breast Impressions is so much more than sculptures and artwork. It has networked survivors, like myself, across the country. It had given women strength, hope and empowerment. It has also given us a moment, frozen in time, that forever represents our struggles and perserverance. We have made many new frindships and support through Judi and all her dedication and hard work. Hats off to Breast Impressions, Keep up the great work!
Breast Impressions Foundation	38891	4	/users/profile/39811	mikemon	General Member of the Public	5	05/14/2010	I have a sister who is a breast cancer survivor and I have known a number of people who also were survivors, but I still did not give the subject much thought. A couple of years ago I attended the first Breast Impressions exhibit of impressions. Each impression, of a womans breasts prior to or after surgery, or in tribute to someone who had breast cancer, is decorated by a local artist. The story behind the cast is displayed along side the cast. A friend, who is a breast cancer survivor, had been the model for one of the casts on display. I did not know what to expect and was little prepared for the emotional impact that the displays had on me. The stories were real and heart wrenching. The artists renditions ranged from weird and gaudy to absolutely beautiful. Last year, I had the pleasure of acquiring one of the more beautiful original casts from the 2007 exhibit. I am so honored to have one of the impressions and it sits proudly in my home, for all to see and hear the story behind the impression. Breast Impressions, Inc. mission is to increase breast cancer awareness and fund raising to support breast cancer education, prevention and treatment. Breast Impressions, Inc also donates breast casting kits to women who have recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, and would like to make a casting of their own prior to surgery. I cannot imagine a more dedicated organization whose outreach and impact is so great who would be more worthy of being selected in the Women's Empowerment Campaign as a top winner. I am proud to offer my story of Breast Impressions, Inc.

Breast Impressions Foundation	38688	6	/users/profile/39584	tricia-in-kc	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	I had the pleasure of meeting Judi Grove, founder of Breast Impressions, in early April.  She donated her time and casts for an auction that I am helping to organize this October of 2010.  This auction will raise proceeds to benefit YSC, (Young Survival Coalition) an international organization dedicated to working with survivors, caregivers and the medical, research, advocacy and legislative communities to increase the quality and quantity of life for women diagnosed with breast cancer ages 40 and under.Judi tirelessly worked two long days creating these castings with a constant smile and a wonderful attitude of charity.  She is truly a generous soul and I am honored to have worked alongside Breast Impressions!
Breast Impressions Foundation	38653	6	/users/profile/39542	bc1	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	I am a two time breast cancer survivor, my sister is a ovarian cancer survivor, I am from Oklahoma, I met Judi Grove of Breast Impressions not long after my second diagnosis, I asked her about the breast casts she does, were the money was going, I learned it goes 100% to a Breast Cancer Educating,  Financial Charity of choice by what ever group she is breast casting and having a auction for at the time. I also learned that 100% had gone to Tulsa Project Woman by one of the Roller Derby Girl Teams she had casted, Tulsa Project Woman is also a non-profit organization in Tulsa, Oklahoma so this would be near and dear to me, they educate women young and old about breast health, they offer free mammograms to women with no insurance and low income they also help provide for the cost of treatment should a woman be diagnosis with breast cancer. Breast Impressions is not just making a locally impact they are making a State to State impact and a impact on young women as well as older woman and I am Very Proud of Judi and Breast Impressions for what they have been able so far to accomplish starting out as just a small local charity, I am also Proud to call Judi my friend. Personal Impact with Breast Impressions ~ 1. I was part of a Survivor Breast Casting Auction; funds went to Tulsa Project Woman. 2. I have met so many wonderful women survivors, women still battling cancer, also some very dear women who have lost their battle with cancer. 3. First & Second Annual Breast Cancer Awareness Day at the Oklahoma State Capital building (making a State Impact) 4. Judi of Breast Impressions was the first woman to help me find my confidence as a woman on my road back from recovery of breast cancer, she is not only friend she is a giver, I call her my sister.
Breast Impressions Foundation	38610	6	/users/profile/39545	michele6	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/11/2010	I met the founder (Judi Grove) the first year she started this non profit, I love and appreciate all she does.. she goes above and beyond, spreading awareness and raising money that benifits local organizations such as the YSC and organizations that service survivors and familys of survivors. Judi works non stop, not only does Breast impressions cast breast, calenders for fundraisers but Breast Impressions has also started a Breast Cancer Awareness Day at Oklahoma's State Capital..two years in a row! Breast Impressions you ROCK..thank you for all you do..
Breast Impressions Foundation	38574	6	/users/profile/39458	indywwamy	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	I met the founder of Breast Impressions (Judi Grove) in Indianapolis where the local roller derby team raised over 5,000 dollars for the Young Survivor's Coalition. The event was well attended and had wonderful information available for Breast Cancer Awarenesss. This successful non profit has a unique way of spreading the word through Art. Breast casts of Roller Girls are turned into beautiful works of art painted by local artists, auctioned off at the event and 100% of the proceeds are given in full to the local charity chosen by those holding the event.  This sets Breast Impressions apart from any other non profit for breast cancer.  I highly recommend them to any group, female sports team, or organization wanting to do something unique in your community. Founder Judi Grove  is an incrediable,hard working, dedicated advocate and spokes person for Breast Cancer Awareness all around the world. She has unselfishly given her time,knowledge, and love to others for a fight she strongly believes in. Breast Impressions has also worked with The Simon Malls Corporation,The Pink Fire Trucks,Tulsa Project Woman,Sound Affect,Mutual Omaha's "A-ha" Moments, and recently was featured on CNN news for her efforts to raise awareness in Oklahoma at The Capitol.CNN shared Breast Impression's fight for awareness and education among hundreds of Survivors,Co-Survivors,and Congress at the courthouse. Breast Impression's founder Judi Grove also provided and produced a touching and magical video of Oklahoma Survivors who have died (or are surviving the battle of Breast Cancer) in their local districts connecting them to their individual Congressmen to promote awareness. Hats off to Breast Impression's for making a difference in the fight against Breast Cancer Awareness - and thank-you to Judi Grove!

As an author/artist/sculptor it was a moment in time that became life changing, mind boggling, earth shattering as tothe effect it would have like the pebble in the pond. Judi and Nancy with Breast Impressions ignited a flame for women that will burn gloriously, brightly and forever inour health, and in our happiness ,spurring usonward to new heights, taking care of ourselvesand remembering that when you give it is astounding the gifts you get in return.

She is very dedicated in her efforts of raising awareness of this horrible disease and for women to take control of learning how to detect the disease and how to fight it.
Breast Impressions Foundation	38503	6	/users/profile/39384	jpm	Donor	5	05/10/2010	Great Grass Roots organization that spend all of their money and time raising awareness of the need and availability for early detection and screening for breast cancer.  This group raises money to provide screening for  those who are not covered by Health Insurance.  Although started in Oklahoma it is branching out and involving all different members of communities in several states in the US.

She has not only personally encouraged women diagnosed with breast cancer, but she has greatly increased public awareness and the importance of early detection. Judi, the founder, is such a positive inspiring person, and her energy is contagious and empowering.

The artistry of these projects is genuinely one of a kind and a brilliantly unique way to help raise donations! I am very proud to have been apart of this project for our Roller Derby team and highly encourage anyone and everyone to be involved with Breast Impressions! Whether you're a volunteer, a casting subject or donating this is one organization you don't want to miss out on!
Breast Impressions Foundation	38327	6	/users/profile/39212	millyfaye	Volunteer	4	05/08/2010	Breast Impressions is a unique organization with a fabulous mission.  As a survivor and an advocate I know that breast cancer organizations have become a dime a dozen.  Breast Impressions, though, breaks the mold and raises the bar.  Judi Grove is passionate, motivated and very inclusive.  I have participated in a several events that she has put on for Breast Impressions both as a participant and an attendee.  My experiences have always been positive.  I have always felt appreciated as a volunteer and honored as a survivor.

I can not say enough about how wonderful Judi Grove, of Breast Impressions, Inc. has been to work with.  She spent a very long weekend making 14 breast casts last weekend and has given us a good deal of guidance and information on how to proceed with this project!  She is wonderful to work with; very professional and full of helpful tips and knowledge on how to make this charity bout as profitable as possible.  Judi will be helping us through this entire process and will return in November to assist us with the auction!  Haivng Judi's guidance has helped make this HUGE project seem so much more manageable and FUN!!

Breast Impressions Foundation	38257	6	/users/profile/39148	actorsoftulsagmailcom	General Member of the Public	5	05/07/2010	Breast Impressions does so much for the community in a creative and challenging way. They are tirelessly working on behalf of those victims of Breast cancer and other survivors to make them proud of their bodies at a time when their womanhood is challenged because of disease. I commend them for their efforts, and as a person who has lost several of my family members from cancer, sometimes I wish other organs would receive as much attention as the breast. It's bold, it's innovative, and it's a great chance for people to get involved and make something happen for this disease. Thank you Breast Impressions, from one creative to another, you are doing a great job.Starr Hardgrove

Assistance League Of Norman Inc	309763		/users/profile/401120	LBreshears	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2016	I had heard about Operation School Bell when I was a classroom teacher from students and faculty. Students were always excited upon their return and they always had a little more pep in their step. After taking students as their counselor, I can see first hand just how awesome this program is. Students are always greeted and made to feel welcome and they are able to take home items that they want and need. This program helps so many students and their families and can not imagine not having this available in our community.
Assistance League Of Norman Inc	309320		/users/profile/400686	homewithmo	Volunteer	5	10/10/2016	I've been an active member of Assistance League of Norman for over 21 years.  My favorite is the Operation School Bell project.  This project provides brand new clothing to Norman and Little Axe Public School students in need.  Each child has a personal shopper, assisting them in selecting fashionable, on trend clothing.  Each student visiting the on site store receives pants, tops, socks & underwear, a winter coat, grooming kit, and a voucher for shoes at a local shoe store.  The students also get to select gently used items from the other side of the store, where they often double the amount of fun clothing that they proudly carry home in a new, completely stuffed full, backpack!The impact that this program has on these children is remarkable.  They can hardly wait to show off their new clothing, and an immediate change can be perceived in their self confidence.  Receiving new clothing can immediately level the playing field for these students.  They are proud to come to school in their new clothes, and boosting their confidence, and providing them with new clothing often gives them the extra push to want to stay in school and succeed.  Teachers, counselors, bus drivers and other school officials have told us of the impact that we make on their students.  What a difference it can make to give a child some new things.  What a win-win situation for all involved.

Assistance League Of Norman Inc	278057		/users/profile/367936	Lori_Hollingsworth	General Member of the Public	5	01/26/2016	I cannot say enough positive things about the Assistance League of Norman! Their program, Operation School Bell, has clothed more of our students than I can count. Beyond that, they do not just provide clothes for our students, they make our students feel special and important. It would great to just send clothes to  school for our students to take home, but this is so much more! They welcome our students to their facility, provide one on one assistance as students browse for clothes, and send them home with a bag full of brand new clothes that students were able to personally pick out for themselves. The sense of pride and empowerment behind the smiles on my students' faces when they leave are priceless.  
Assistance League Of Norman Inc	278017		/users/profile/367888	BethWhittle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/26/2016	We love Operation School Bell! Being a Title 1 School we have many students in need of clothing. School Bell goes about and beyond to accommodate our students. Every year we need to clothe more students than the allotted spots we are provided each year. School Bell lets us bring as many students as we need, above and beyond how many students we have spots for. The School Bell ladies are fantastic and you can tell they really enjoy helping the students shop for new clothes. Several times, if a student is unable to make it to School Bell they allow us to shop for them and bring them their clothes. The students LOVE going to School Bell. Being able to provide students with new shoes, coats and warm clothes is so important and we would not be able to do it without the support of School Bell!!!
Assistance League Of Norman Inc	274387		/users/profile/363777	abbyamanda	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/14/2015	I have known many students throughout the years who have been helped by the Assistance League of Norman's Operation School Bell and I have many heart-warming stories.  However, my favorite was shared by a student this year.This year, the Assistance League made the truly innovative decision to allow high school students to actually shop for their clothes at Kohl's.  My students have always appreciated the opportunity to get new clothing at the Assistance League office, where Operation School Bell is housed, but they were very excited about a "real" shopping experience.  Keep in mind that there is not a lot of discretionary income in these households and shopping trips are rare.Many students came in to show me their new clothes, but one girl's story in particular, humbled me and warmed my heart.  She loved her new clothes, but what she really enjoyed was the opportunity to shop with her mother.  This 16 year old girl had only been clothes shopping with her mom on one other occasion and the trip to Kohl's, made possible by the generosity of the Assistance League of Norman, provided much more than needed clothing to this family.Thank you, Assistance League of Norman!
Assistance League Of Norman Inc	263715	1	/users/profile/352423	tmcdaniel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2015	As an elementary classroom teacher, I could always see the excitement in the students eyes when it was time for their trip to Operation School Bell and even more so when they returned!    This year, I got to take 14 7th graders, as their middle school counselor.  Now, I could experience the excitement first hand!  As well as, the relief of their guardians knowing they would be taken care of.  I had parent calls and students asking if they could go and when it would be.  The kids that have been before, can't wait to go back!  It is such a welcoming, comfortable, clean place for them.  It's like a department store!  The volunteers are so helpful to the students!   Middle School can be a tough time for kids.  This gives them some self confidence that is needed at this point in their lives.  One less thing to worry about!  Operation School Bell is an incredible program and a vital part of Norman Public Schools.  Don't know what we would do without it!  Thank you to OSB!

Since I am a first-year School Counselor in Norman, this was my first trip to School Bell. It brought me a great deal of joy to see my kids so happy.  The ladies who took them "shopping" were so kind and encouraging.  All I had to do was gather permission slips and accompany my students on the bus.  It was very organized and extremely easy.  For an overloaded counselor with not enough hours in the day, I am eternally grateful...that my students have new clothes, that they know their community cares, that their hardworking parents and grandparents feel supported, and that I got to witness this awesome gift.  Assistance League of Norman is a top notch organization.  I am blown away by this experience for my students.  Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all of the people who continue to make this possible.  Thank you for impacting the lives of 14 students today and many, many more throughout the year.

Assistance League Of Norman Inc	180527		/users/profile/237211	Sharon Heatly	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2013	      The Assistance League of Norman is changing the lives of students through Operation School Bell.  Operation School  Bell served 1,700 students in Norman Public Schools last year ! As Director of Guidance and Counseling for Norman Public Schools, I have the great privilege to see and hear of the student benefits through  participation in this program.  Each of the 1,700 students received  several new clothing items such a winter coat, jeans, slacks, dresses, sweaters, sweatshirts, t-shirts, underwear, socks, personal hygiene items and a book of their choice.  For each  age level of students, the clothes are great, new "with-it" styles and appropriate for their ages.  As the students would say, " Super awesome !".  In addition to the clothing, students receive a voucher to go to a local shoe store and select a new pair of shoes that fits !      These amazing volunteers provide a personal shopping experience for each student. A volunteer personally shops with each student and lets them select colors and styles that they like.  The students try the clothes on to ensure the right fit. Some of our special needs students with physical challenges need modifications to their clothing.  Assistance League  members always do alterations to ensure each child has the perfect fit.  This is the first experience for some students to go to a store-like setting and select brand new clothes.  It is not uncommon to see tears of joy from students and sometimes the volunteers.  This is a heart-felt mission for the Assistance League.     The Assistance League members lead busy lives yet they find the volunteer time to fund raise, shop, stock and be  personal shoppers to students. These purposeful actions sends the message that  you are important, we care and we want you to be successful. It is the hope that someday that these students will find it in their heart to volunteer and make their future communities a better place. As adults, we need to model meaningful ways to enrich the lives of others and the Assistance League of Norman is an outstanding example.    Operation School Bell is already in second month of serving students. Hundreds of students have already been to School Bell for the 2013-2014 school year. Once again the goal is 1,700 students being served.  From Norman Public Schools, thank you just doesn't convey how much you are appreciated and valued. I have to state again, " Assistance League of Norman is changing the lives of students". Sharon HeatlyDirector of Guidance and CounselingNorman Public SchoolsNorman, Oklahoma

Assistance League Of Norman Inc	151944		/users/profile/202937	Stephanie84	Volunteer	5	04/02/2013	I love being a volunteer at Assistance League of Norman for Operation School Bell (OSB).  Often times children come in w/ down cast eyes, won't talk much or are scared.  They leave with a smile on their face and chatting away about all the new clothes they get to take home.  OSB allows these children to shop with pride knowing that they are receiving brand new clothes (not just cast offs).  The volunteers are so loving and welcoming to all the kids, treating them with the love and dignity they deserve.I can't say enough about the wonderful impact OSB has on the kids in our school district who might otherwise have to go without.  It is also a humbling experience for the volunteers.  It's a reminder that while we might have so much we can always do more to make someone's life better.

"How do I look?" as he modeled what he was trying on. I replied, "You look great !" He twirled around and said with great joy and pride," I know!!"

I got involved with Operation School Bell immediately and continue to volunteer with this vitally important outreach. As a retired teacher, I know how important it is to arrive at school ready to learn. Having appropriate school clothing that allows you to" fit in"  with your peers is a critical component of school success. Counselors who accompany students to School Bell regularly comment on how grateful the children are for their new clothing and what a boost these items give them in terms of self esteem and school performance.  Working School Bell is as rewarding an experience for the volunteer as it is for the student attending. The stories we share after each session run the gamut of emotions...poignant,  funny and always heartwarming.

Citizens Caring for Children, Inc.	115636		/users/profile/157474	KellyandStacey B.	Volunteer	5	06/18/2012	I have volunteered and many of the events organized by Citizens Caring for Children.  Sorting and processing donatied clothing, assembling backpacks with school supplies for the children, participating in fundraisers at both Bids for Kids, Santa Stop, and the Redbud Classic, to name a few.  These have been both fun and rewarding because of the passion the director and the entire staff have for doing everything in there power to insure the children served have a great experience when picking out their clothing as well as every foster parent feels appreciated for what they are doing to break the cycle these children are experiencing.  Thank you Amy and Team, for making Citizens Caring for Children and important part of my life!

From birthday parties, to fulfilling Christmas wish lists, providing clothings, mentoring and more, CCC helps foster kids in Oklahoma County and surroundings areas.

The City of Tulsa and the surrounding areas are so fortunate to have an organization such as the Association; full of caring, passionate, devoted, unyielding individuals.  The staffs passion for change is inspirational not only to the board members but to the community as a whole.  Day in and day out, impressions and lives are changed by way of the Association.  I would encourage anyone looking for a volunteer opportunity to make a beeline for the Association.  There are multitudes of ways to devote your time and youll walk away with a heart more full.
Mental Health Association In Tulsa Inc	141298		/users/profile/187586	KCooper	Board Member	5	11/19/2012	The Mental Health Association in Tulsa is an amazing organization!  It begins with the staff who have a passion with helping those with a mental illness in Tulsa, and that same passion is found in all fo the volunteer leaders.  They have a very innovative model for helping individuals which includes a housing program.  This housing program is no easy feat, but they have managed to grow each year and continue to provide housing to those who were formerly homeless.  There is also a youth outreach movement that works with area high schools to educate students on the effects of bullying.  It is a wonderful organization that help so many in the Tulsa area.  I can not say enough good things about the Mental Health Association in Tulsa!
Mental Health Association In Tulsa Inc	136736		/users/profile/182672	JPotter	Board Member	5	11/10/2012	What started as a simple community volunteer opportunity has turned into an 18-year blessing.  Every experience I have had with the Mental Health Association in Tulsa has been a positive one and far exceeded any preconceived notions I had about being a volunteer, let alone a board member.  I am so proud to have been associated with such an outstanding organization.  Not only are they great stewards of every dime of funding they receive, they all truly love what they are doing and have such a passion for their mission.  It is impossible to be involved and not be better off for it.  I cant think of a more deserving organization!
Mental Health Association In Tulsa Inc	136366		/users/profile/182279	MJamison	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	My first experience with the MHAT was as an external auditor for many years.  From this relationship I observed the passion and dedication MHAT's employees exhibited in serving their clients and thier mission.  I audited many nonprofits in the area, many of which are truly wonderful organizations.  However, MHAT stood out to me as and Organization I wanted to get more involved with.  When I left the firm that performed the audit, I made the decision to volunteer with MHAT.  I served on the Board for 6 years and continue to serve on the Finance Committee.  The Association has grown by leaps and bounds over the past 10 years due to the passion exhibited by the Staff, volunteers (including Board Members) and donors.  Their "housing first" model has made the most significant impact on me.  They embraced the concept that you can't expect someone to sober up, clean up, get a job THEN provide them with housing.  You're much more successful when you provide a person with safe, affordable housing and wrap them with the services they need (whether from MHAT or other local nonprofits).
Mental Health Association In Tulsa Inc	135144		/users/profile/181012	homewardbound	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Having the opportunity to work closely with MHAT, and being acquainted with a number of their staff, I am deeply impacted by the compassion, integrity, respect and honor offered to all people serving with them, and most importantly, being served by them. Also as one whose family has suffered the loss of a heart-and-mind-wounded Iraq war veteran, I know by experience the strengthening and healing I have received through the love, support, and embrace encircling me through many on staff at MHAT. This organization has most certainly changed the topography of Tulsa in terms of mental health education, of moving this city forward to better understand, embrace, care for, and respect those in our midst who courageously confront their mental health challenges daily, and in engaging community members to get involved through tangible action. They have pioneered in caring for, and elevating, the segment of our community who, years ago, otherwise would have received very little compassion or care. There is truly no other organization or staff I know of for whom I have greater respect and with whom I am more proud -- and humbled -- to be involved, than Mental Health Association in Tulsa.
Mental Health Association In Tulsa Inc	134937		/users/profile/180803	haanen	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I have visited several of mhat buildings including Denver House, Altamonte, Walker and Yale Apartments. I met several former homeless who were residents.  All were employed, seemed happy and were participating in the mhat culture.  Money invested in public housing is better spent than unnecessary, emergency room vists, incarceration of the mentally ill and turning our backs on a potentially valuable segment of our community.
Mental Health Association In Tulsa Inc	133444		/users/profile/179162	Greg Guerrero	Volunteer	5	11/04/2012	     I have served as a member of the Housing Committe for the Mental Health Associaiton of Tulsa ("MHAT")for approximately 6 years.  A large portion of our homeless are also suffering from some form of mental illness.  During this time MHAT has dramitically assisted this portion of our homeless population with obtaining stable and affordable housing, which in turn has allowed more effective treatment of their mental illlness.  There have been many wonderful success stories.                                                                                                                                                                             My business is developement & management in the "for profit" multi-family industry. I have been and remain active in our local, state and national apartment associations.  The manner in which MHAT has improved and maintained the apartment properties it has acquired, has not only helped to meet its mission of providing affordable housing for the chronically homeless mentally ill, but has also helped to improve neighborhoods and increased property values.  As a real estate professional, I am very proud of the job that MHAT has done in this regard.  Greg Guerrero, ASC Development & Management Company.

When I became interested in MHAT, one of the staff recommended that I take a tour with them. It was very beneficial for me to see with my own eyes what they can do for so many people in our own city who are in need of specialized care. They are bringing redemption to those who are viewed as the least of these in our society. I have only great praise and admiration for all of the staff, counselors, and volunteers here.

The organization is very well run and employs about 45% of it's staff that has a mental illness and some have been homeless. It is an honor to support this fine organization.

I also worked as a public school teacher for 12 years. Working at MHAT has been the best work experience in my life. As a former drug abuser and mentally disturbed person, they let me use my life experience to help others and, I have not only grown as a result of working here but have also been given an opportunity to use the gifts I have developed as a result of my teaching experience. I am truly grateful for the chance to start over in a worthwhile profession that helps people, and I am not the only person who has been given this chance. Many who have a history of mental illness/substance abuse have been given employment which has literally saved their lives.

It hosts a wonderful worldwide FB page for people and their loved ones who have this diagnosis.  It is well monitored and a tremendous source of information and support.  LMSdr does everything possible to help people find a cure for this rare cancer, including identifying scientific research projects for financial support, helping people host fundraisers, organizing a tissue bank and blood samples for research purposes, hosting seminars, providing recordings of past seminars, the list goes on and on.    I have contributed greatly to LMSdr, and have encouraged friends, colleagues, and relatives to do likewise.  A tremendous percentage of what LMSdr collects goes directly to LMS research.

I couldn't pronounce the word let alone know what it was. My oncologist kept looking down at the report & back to me with terrified eyes. I heard RARE, AGGRESSIVE, FAST GROWING. The Internet was terrifying. Statistics were low and there seemed not much hope. But then I found an online group that offered support, encouragement, recommendations, hope...a light in a dismal place. LMSdr has been my rock. This rare cancer gets very little funding or recognition like other well known cancers. All donations to LMSdr go directly to research on our own cancer to help find better treatments and eventually a cure. The logo is "Working not Wishing".

The information was daunting and gave me a very small chance at 5 year survival.  I wanted to know patients stories and finally decided to do a search on Facebook.  I found LMSarcoma Direct Research (LMSDR) and it became a home.   The fellow patients and caregivers are amazing with support and information.  The conferences they host are full of good information given by talks from excellent oncologists.  LMSDR gives grants to researchers who are working for a way to control Leiomyosarcoma without further harm to the patient.  They have set up both a blood bank and tumor slide collection for researchers to use.  LMSDR helped me to change my fear of imminent death to one of hope.   There is much work to be done but if research stays ahead of the current therapies there is hope for people with LMS.

It connects a huge number of people - from artists themselves to patrons to arts enthusiasts - to their own creativity and the creative works of others.

A remarkable set of programs, staff, volunteers and exhibits make AHCT an invaluable part of Tulsa. 
Arts And Humanities Council Of Tulsa Inc	61086	1	/users/profile/66640	Arts2U	Board Member	5	01/26/2011	I have been a member of the Board of Directors for the Arts and Humanities Council of Tulsa (AHCT) for over ten years.  There is no other non-profit that I have dedicated this length and extend  of my volunteer time and effort.  With our city and state facing budget shortfalls, art education is one of the first programs to be eliminated from our schools.  As a result, students are not performing at their optimum levels and natural talents are left undeveloped.  A central focus of the AHCT is providing art education with our Artists-in-the-Schools program.  Our program reaches over 100,000 students annually, seeking to eliminate geographic, economic, and social barriers and ensure that all students have equal opportunity to engage in the arts.  The AHCT is the largest community provider of the arts programming in Tulsa area public schools; no other arts organization offers educational and outreach programs on the same scale.

In addition to acting as a hub for arts and culture collaboration, the organization provides critical early childhood and K-12 exposure to the arts that is so limited in our current public education system.    This organization has a rich history in its role as ambassador and envoy, and will only be strengthened going forward by the addition of financial and managerial skills, as well as the advent of a new and spectacular venue for its programs.

Children need more than just math and science. Among many, many other important things, AHCT brings professional visual and performing artists into public schools, providing opportunities children otherwise would not have. They have arranged projects that help wards of the state and troubled youth realize their creative potential, and begin to understand that they don't have to be a destructive force or take on the negative characteristics often attributed to them by parents and teachers.

Phoenix Rising is a particular favorite since it reaches kids that have not made it in any other school environment.  These kids get such a confidence boost from creating their own art that it helps them acheive academically as well.

Client Served	5	01/10/2011	The Arts and Humanities Council of Tulsa offers Harwelden for any public school in the Tulsa area.  Teachers attend a summer institute and have artists come to their school two to three times a year.  The performances are always outstanding and really impact the children.  Most of the children served are economically disadvantaged and might not ever have opportunity to view dances, plays, and musical performances.  Every person our school has had contact with has been great and they all have a true love and passion for children and what they do!

They make a difference in their lives and give them opportunities that aren't possible otherwise.  They also reach into the community to help other groups that might not have an experience  opportunity that they provide.  ie hospital, adjucated youth, etc.
Arts And Humanities Council Of Tulsa Inc	59748		/users/profile/64722	Robin Ballenger	Donor	5	01/10/2011	Here is a vibrant and energized  arts organization that reaches all corners of its service area!   With leadership determined to touch every individual with a dynamic Arts experience and detail-orienated execution of programs, the Tulsa Arts and Humanities Council has a well-justified reputation for fun, electric, and super-charged  events for the whole family.    This is a group that is building its dream--literally!   Plans for their new  building [although that word does not do it justice] downtown in the Brady District promise a wonderful and inclusive experience.  The Groundbreaking will be this Spring.This is an organization that is FUN to support because their gratitude is so genuine and they love to include you in their force-field.  
Arts And Humanities Council Of Tulsa Inc	59744		/users/profile/64711	sarahsmith8000	Volunteer	5	01/10/2011	Many years ago, I taught art classes to elementary and middle school children through artist in residence programs through the Art and Humanities Council of Tulsa. I was fortunate enough to be exposed to the arts as a young person, I wanted to pass that on to the young in my city with the help of AHCT.  It was a development experience for me and I hope I was able to touch the life of just one young person in a positive way. Free after school and summer art programs funded by AHCT for children who might not get the opportunity is such a blessing to our community. 
Arts And Humanities Council Of Tulsa Inc	51705	2	/users/profile/52439	hotshop	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/03/2010	Thanks to the support of the AHCT we are able to provide art programming and positive adult role models to a group of high risk youth.  The impact of the programming on the youth is significant in that it not only gives them an opportunity to be creative, but also teaches them the importance of team work and effective communication. It is awe-inspiring to see these young people transform from kids who would not give an adult the time of day on the street to a young adult who is respectful not only of the environment, but also the adult leading the class.  They learn that if they work together they can create things that they never dreamed.  AHCT's support of the these art programs provides an opportunity for high risk kids to be proud of themselves, their projects and their peers.
Arts And Humanities Council Of Tulsa Inc	51698	4	/users/profile/52430	margee	General Member of the Public	5	09/03/2010	I have witnessed the activity of the Tulsa's Arts and Humanities Council throughout our city. It shows up in the strangest places!  It supports an Arts and Healing project within Hillcrest Hospital where patients recover from major surgery, families wait for their loved one to have surgery and where women on a high risk pregnancy unit get a break from the endless days of worry and boredom.  It puts art back into our schools and gives students a chance to shine while being taught by experts in art, dance, acting and music fields.  It also provides steady work for our local artists which keeps them working and honing their skills rather than having to get a 9-5 job out of their field.

Love of Vietnam Expressed	116632	1	/users/profile/158763	tho tho	General Member of the Public	4	06/26/2012	Hello, my name is Tho. I'm a student of Da Nang college of Foreign languages. Now I am living in a student house supported by L.O.V.E (Love Of Vietnam Expressed). I find their work very helpful for poor children and needy students. They always care for us, for example asking us about our shortage and accommodation. They often visit us and encourage us in studying. Monthly, when we come to get help, we are always welcome. On behalf of the sponsored students, I want to say thank you very much for all what they do for us. I hope L.O.V.Es work will develop more and more. 
Love of Vietnam Expressed	116151	1	/users/profile/158148	jbar_on	Donor	5	06/22/2012	I first discovered L.O.V.E. in 2007 when I was looking for a way to become involved with the people of Vietnam.  While surfing the internet, I came upon L.O.V.E.'s website and found it was just what I was looking for.  L.O.V.E. not only pays school fees and buys uniforms and school materials for children from poor families but also helps make sure they have enough to eat.  Frequently, sponsorships include the whole family.  L.O.V.E. also sponsors visits by medical personnel and free medical care to poor areas and villages. I chose to sponsor a boy who was in high school.  We were able to write back and forth every month, and the staff at L.O.V.E. sent copies of the original letters plus translations.  Soon I decided to sponsor the family.  The father had passed away many years ago, and the mother had worked hard selling produce in the market place to support her three sons and young daughter.  Over the years, we became close through letters, and I learned to love my adopted family.  Last year I came to Vietnam as a teacher.  I have met all the L.O.V.E staff and they are wonderful dedicated Vietnamese young adults (except for the director, who is American with a Vietnamese wife).  Now I  can spend time with my adopted family also.  A little money goes a lot farther here.  The mother has used the money I have sent over the years wisely with help and guidance from L.O.V.E.  The family now has a new large kitchen and inside toilet where before they were cooking outside over an open fire.  All three boys are working now and my "niece" just got married.  L.O.V.E. gave them the step up that they needed.  The staff at L.O.V.E.  have been extremely helpful in translating and in helping more and more children and poor families to achieve a better life.  I would urge you to support L.O.V.E. and become involved in giving some family or child a better life.

Love of Vietnam Expressed	116140		/users/profile/158133	Lien T.	Volunteer	3	06/22/2012	I volunteered for L.O.V.E for about 2 1/2 weeks and I had a blessed time doing so. The staff workers there welcomed & helped me in any way possible and were really friendly people. I mainly translated letters of children that wrote to their sponsors from Vietnamese to English and also helped in organizing school books and uniforms that were then given out to children. Overall I was truly blessed to have an opportunity to work with L.O.V.E and to also experience how much this organization showed the love of Christ in helping those in need. 
Love of Vietnam Expressed	115302		/users/profile/157052	ducpham90	Volunteer	5	06/14/2012	I had an extraordinary opportunity to serve with L.O.V.E, a social relief organization for three weeks this summer.  The staff at L.O.V.E truly lives up to its mission: lifting impoverished people out of seemingly hopeless situations through education and on-going relationships from sponsors and staff. I am currently supporting three children through L.O.V.E and had the opportunity to visit them and their family. It was such a memorable experience that I will cherished for the rest of my life. Thank you for the staff at L.O.V.E for their friendship and allowing me to established life-long relationships with my sponsored children. I look forward on partnering with L.O.V.E and raising awareness for this great non-profit organization!
Love of Vietnam Expressed	114415		/users/profile/155706	Drew T.	Board Member	5	06/08/2012	This organization is very close to my heart as it was started by my grandfather. The work they are doing for the children and families in Vietnam is life changing for the recipients. I was able to visit on a missions trip for two weeks a few years ago and it had a great impact on me. Once you see the conditions that they have to live in, you can't help but feel moved to assist them. I look forward to working with LOVE for many years to come, and cannot wait until I am able to get back over there in person.

I love L.O.V.E. What a fantastic job they do. I support two children and regularly hear from them and write to them. I receive photos and a lovely newsletter. There is a sense of being part of a family. There never is enough money to do all that they would like to do to help the poor in Vietnam, the needs are great. Having said that they do a great job with the resources they have and are very trustworthy. I feel L.O.V.E. are making a difference in the lives of so many children and families. 
Love of Vietnam Expressed	114309	1	/users/profile/155545	Bao T.	Donor	5	06/08/2012	I have sponsored a couple of children (one is in middle school and one is just done with high school) through LOVE of Vietnam Expressed  (L.O.V.E) for the past two to three years. L.O.V.E have been very good at keeping me in contact with my sponsored children by translating and forwarding letters between us. They also very effective at communicate the needs of the children to me. One time, one of my sponsored children got really worry about school because he was sick for 2-3 weeks. He was behind in school and was very sad and worry that he would not finish. L.O.V.E asked me to talk to that child via Skype in L.O.V.E office to encourage him that it would be okay. Both the child and I were very touch by that. I talked to him via Skype for more than an hour.  I believed that helped him to get much less worry. He is doing great now and is preparing for Also, L.O.V.E sends me regular e-mail to give update about their other activities helping out children in Danang area. It's nice to see they are doing so many things for children there. I hope they will get more donor and volunteer to help sustain their program.

Love of Vietnam Expressed	114212	1	/users/profile/155420	Dave18	Donor	5	06/07/2012	Love of Vietnam for me is a non-sequetor since I am also a Purple Heart NAMVET.  But the horror of poverty in a country rich in abundant natural resources is the story of Reggie Coward, its director who has devoted his life's work to reaching the poor near DaNang with the simple blessings of school and basic essentials for children disadvantaged by a war many years prior to the child's birth leaving families with very low income and children without the possibility of school and clothing were it not for him.  Take a look yourself for how you may reach out to help.  His cause is just; his kids are truly needy and he is there with his Vietnamese wife to help them in the name of Christ. 
Love of Vietnam Expressed	114096		/users/profile/155259	LOVE Inc	Board Member	5	06/06/2012	I have volunteered with this mission since its inception, and now also serve on its Board (also as a volunteer).  I have seen so many lives touched and improved, where there was no hope. Children receive an education, families receive assistance and hope, the sick and injured receive medical assistance, children from poor families receive free dental care . . . more than I ever would have expected when we started, but our supporters and sponsors, from all over the world, have been amazing.  I thank God for the opportunity to serve in this capacity.  Join us and make a real difference in the lives of children and families.

This organisation helps me in everyway to connect and support the child. I write and receive letters each month from the child. L.O.V.E ensures that children and families have the basics like food, housing and education. When I visited Vietnam and my sponsored child L.O.V.E went out of their way to introduce me to the family and take them on a day trip. This was a very rewarding experience for everyone involved. I hope to return to Vietnam and volunteer to help this or organsition carry out the wonderful work that they do.
Oklahoma Performing Arts	53147		/users/profile/54224	BoomerSooner	Former Volunteer	5	09/23/2010	I learned more about myself while attending Oklahoma Performing Arts than any other organization I was ever involved with as a kid. I developed self-confidence, leadership, a very strong work ethic, courage, strong skill in the fine arts, social skills, and most of all best friends. I learned more skills than just the several disciplines of dance. Miss. Laura was the best mentor, friend, and instructor I could have had during my childhood and part of the roughest times in my grade school life. I credit Miss. Laura and the Oklahoma Performing Arts studio for many of the accomplishments I have achieved since I have left the studio. Everything I learned from Oklahoma Performing Arts has helped me in so many more areas than the performing arts, and dance; the life skills I learned have helped me in college, academics, the work field, student organizations, and athletic teams at college.
Oklahoma Performing Arts	32287	3	/users/profile/33079	kristi	Volunteer	5	03/02/2010	As a student of Miss Laura Tyson, I learned so much more than dance and performance skills. I learned about how to persevere, how to embrace self-confidence, and how to express myself through movement. Miss Laura is more than a dance teacher. She is a life-long friend, mentor, and advisor. Now, my daughter takes from Miss Laura, and I have the blessed opportunity to watch life come full circle.
Oklahoma Performing Arts	31416	7	/users/profile/32307	huskerdan95	Client Served	5	02/26/2010	My son has been involved with the orchestra for almost 3 years and we owe the refinement and advancement of his talent to his instructor, Tia Juby and to the program director, Laura Tyson.  This is a wonderful program to introduce our children to the arts and to give them the opportunity to achieve at a level their desire and talent carries them to.  Laura, Tia and Joycelyn have the heart, skill and talent to teach the arts as they should be taught to our students and only need the resources to continue and to lift the program to new and higher levels.  The preformances seem to achieve a greater high, though you would not think it is possible as so many of the youth have that star quality that you expect to see them next in the Tulsa Ballet or Tulsa Symphony.  It is through this teams dedication to excellence in this program and their desire to propell the arts for future generations that have made it a shining example for the community.
Oklahoma Performing Arts	30976	7	/users/profile/31918	gimmie	Board Member	5	02/25/2010	I have no children involved in OPA.  I became acquainted with OPA when they came to me for non-profit insurance. After seeing Laura's enthusiam for what she does I started questioning her and attending performances.  I WAS AMAZED!!!  These children, little ones, were focused, diligent, and mastered their performance with so much grace...WOW...not only that, the teamwork was outstanding...no fussing.  Everyone, just did what they were to do.  I began to want to get involved even though I have no children and was ecstatic when I was invited to be on the executive board.  This is a great organization but THEY NEED A BUILDING TO CALL THEIR OWN.  The church has been gracious to offer a temporary location but OPA has outgrown and needs additonal space to expand.  All contributions would be appreciated and any helpful information as well.  Come to a performance and be enlightened.

She is a straight A student and we attribute her hard work to lessons she has learned from what she has learned at OPA.  We love being part of the OPA family.

None of this would have been possible without Oklahoma Performing Arts. It is more than a studio it is a family. I have had so much support even when I graduated from the school. I am always in contact with the director who is constantly helping me figure out problems academically, artistically, and emotionally. While I was there I learned responsibility, maturity, and how to work as a team. There is no other place in Oklahoma where you can find all of that plus highly rated arts education. Any time I come back to Oklahome me and the other alumni always make sure we can take at least one class. They deserve as much support as anyone can give. The director is trying to make a difference in Oklahoma and with support I know she can do it.

I was referred to OPA by another parent whose daughter attends  and I am so glad that we have the opportunity to give back to the community while gaining training in the classic arts. My daughter is being trained in voice, acting, tap, ballet and jazz and is becoming a well rounded individual as well as performer. The discipline they learn from OPA goes far beyond the stage.

We had never done voice or acting . . .  It quickly became evident that the program was very advanced and well suited for our family.  It impresses me how quickly the children progress.  My daughter was behind others her age, but was given the attention and instruction to catch up and thrive!  It is a true testament to the fact that if you expect something out of a child, they WILL rise to meet the goals!Also, the family atmosphere made our move and integration into a new community much easier.  We love it so much that our son recently started in the program.

The children are challenged to do more than expected and they DO!  During the holidays, the students performed at various nursing homes in the area.

We were at the Bear Odyssey/Bearacuda in OKC this weekend. We bid & won a coffee & tea basket. Every single food item, every single bag of coffee & the teas were all expired. Some stuff even expired in October of 2015. It's now August 2016.  That's just messed up, ghetto, and just plain shady!!!! So ultimately we paid $45 for two cheap ass coffee mugs. Pretty ironic that it was for a food pantry that doesn't accept expired food, but someone thought it was ok to con someone into buying expired food items instead. SHADY & DISHONEST!!!!

I have never seen or even heard of any other program like yours.  In one word, "AMAZING!".   Not only do you help out with the nutritional needs of so many people your volunteers are the best.  While there I sat and watched how they listen to the clients, encourage them, give advise on not only cooking techniques and ideas, but they give SMILES.  I watched many a person walk through the doors down, confused and/or scared.  What your volunteers do is incredible!  By the time the people leave you have energized them to keep going and to not give up or give in to the sickness.  Please keep up the hard work and thank you for all that you do.

I personally have lost my mate years ago, and I understand the pain of giving up your house and giving up your possessions just to survive.  we used Other Options van, bought our gas and was more than honors to be of any help to a fellow man who was in grief and pain, we all  wished him a good travel and sent our prayers and good thoughts with him,

Don't get me wrong, the food bank is great for people that need help. But Mary Arbuckle is another thing. She cheated my brother out of  $275.00  dollars. On a riding lawn mower that we just got out of repair shop before she bought it. She was suppose to pay him $500.00 .Well she sent him $175.00 and she said she had to have a tune up and what ever else. like I said we just got it out of the repair shop and had everything done on it . It cost him $175.00 to have every thing done on it. So he got nothing on a year old Troy built riding lawn mower. My brother is blind and crippled and has to have help walking.  He is HIV positive, He just lost his partner of 31 years that is why he had to sell every thing he had, What he didn't sell he donated to the food bank .He had to move with me to Idaho cause he is blind and disabled. Since Roy died he couldn't be there by his self.  Mary was real ignorant to him. when he got here. Bryan has a big heart and she took advantage of him. Now none of his friends write or call him because of her. Thanks for listening. Donna
Other Options, Inc.	144205	1	/users/profile/190711	cowdy	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2012	Mary Arbuckle is an awesome giving cowgirl who knows that people need food and services more than a sermon.  She knows that for service providers it is better to listen than preach.  I've seen her do extraordinary things in terms of fundraising.   Even people just passing through Oklahoma have benefited from her kindness.  Other Options space is warm and inviting and people leave feeling good about themselves as opposed to some food pantries where one has to listen to some judgement as the price for accepting food.  It is so much better to leave a food pantry feeling empowered because that promotes wellness and can be the jumpstart to improving one's life.  As a horseperson, Mary Arbuckle has translated the ethic to human beings in that everybody deserves to be warm, dry and fed, especially in the Winter.
Other Options, Inc.	120525	1	/users/profile/58468	crspromo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/13/2012	I am amazed at the work that Other Options, Inc. provides for those living with HIV/AIDS.  The volunteers are friendly and they make the clients feel at home.  Other Options has gone out of their way to make the clients feel welcomed and that the have a safe haven.  
Other Options, Inc.	56157	1	/users/profile/58468	crspromo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2010	The Friends Food Pantry at Other Options is the only free food source in the 405 and 580 area codes for the HIV population in Oklahoma. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS in Oklahoma is growing significantly which continually places a burden on Other Options to enhance its funding sources. Other Options recognizes that this target population of children, youth, men, and women with HIV disease typically require a higher intake of proteins and complex carbohydrates as well as special formulas for babies and adults in trauma. This target population is unable to obtain this higher content food because of income restrictions and other pressing needs.Without Other Options these clients would not get the proper nutrition that they need to continue on! 
Other Options, Inc.	57726	1	/users/profile/61122	ChrisC	Board Member	5	11/23/2010	I have been a board member for over two years now and am continually amazed at what this organization can generate in terms of benefits for the people who need them, and in the role of getting the community excited about helping.  Cookie and Mary Arbuckle are pioneers for helping in this local community.  My first experience with them, before becoming a board member was when I showed up to volunteer during 'Day without a Gay', an annual event to bring awareness to the fight for marriage equality.  I decided to help that day, instead of hanging out at a bar drinking with the other gays.  We arrived at Other Options Inc/Friends Food Pantry and were asked to help move and clear out stock items, as well as sort through donations for Christmas baskets.  We finished early, and Mary Arbuckle called and found another charity in town that we could go and assist at.  It was such a great experience that when I was asked to join the board I immediately knew it was an organization I wanted to be a part of.  I'm very proud of what this organization's role is in the community, and to be part of it gives me far more than the help we are able to supply for those in need.  This organization generates more than food, medications, clothing, gifts...it generates love and friendships within the community.  And no matter how much money we have produced to fund feeding those in need we will always be very rich in life.
Other Options, Inc.	57696	1	/users/profile/61078	LeenaH	Board Member	5	11/23/2010	I've been involved with Other Options Inc/Friends Food Pantry (OOI/FFP) over the past 4 yrs after retiring after 20 yrs from the USAF/military.  With more free time in the evenings and weekends, I have been enlightened working with the many volunteers and board members of this organization and seeing the fruits of our labor in the grateful eyes & smiles of the clients as they shop at the food pantry on Sat/Mon or when we deliver the food on Mondays as well as during the Thanksgiving meal deliveries as well as when they pick up their Christmas toiletry & gift baskets.  It's truly a blessing getting to witness the board members and volunteers within the community get together as a team and work the fundraising events just to see us be able to support OOI/FFP serve its mission.  Getting to know and work with Cookie Arbuckle, who had the passion, heart and wherewithall to start this great organization in helping the clients, was truly an honor -- I hope to be able to help continue her legacy for many more years. 
Other Options, Inc.	56997	2	/users/profile/59801	Charla S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/15/2010	I have been involved with this agency as an employee for about a year and a half. I love it here! The works that are performed here everyday are like nowhere else. Other Options, Inc. has multiple programs to aid people living with (or affected by) HIV/AIDS. The biggest one being Friends Food Pantry - the only food pantry in the 405 and 580 area code specifically serving positive Oklahomans. This is a beautiful thing and if you really want to do something good for the community you should come in and volunteer sometime. We can always use the help.  Especially now, during the holidays. We do a Thanksgiving dinner delivery and we make gift and toiletry baskets for Christmas. We are small but with the help of volunteers we are mighty.  
Other Options, Inc.	56396	1	/users/profile/58858	Frankie C.	Volunteer	5	11/04/2010	At Other Option,  I felt as welcome as the clients.  The staff  and other volunteers helped me to find opportunities to be useful and fulfilled in every task I was given.  I really appreciated that I could work alone stocking shelves or working along side other volunteers on special projects or directly with clients.  The flexibility suited me perfectly.Volunteers, staff and clients all made me if they were my second family.
Other Options, Inc.	56341	1	/users/profile/58777	robinmed	Volunteer	5	11/03/2010	I have been affiliated with Other Options for more than 20 years as an advocate, supporter and volunteer. In the last two years I have become more involved and now serve on the board. I can't tell you how much gratitude I feel by helping in the small part that I do. This organization helps so many people with their food pantry and so many other services they provide, primarily for HIV & AIDS patients. Many people discriminate against these groups, but what people don't realize is that there are children and families that we help on a daily basis. Many people and families are affected by this disease. People tend to judge and they shouldn't.
Other Options, Inc.	56288	1	/users/profile/58697	Kristen D.	Volunteer	5	11/02/2010	I have volunteered at Other Options for over three years. It is a wonderful organization that provides so much to our community.  I am proud to be part of such a wonderful group. 
Other Options, Inc.	56159	1	/users/profile/58475	nlaguilera	Board Member	5	11/01/2010	I started at Other Options as a volunteer one year ago this month. As soon as I  began I was immediately impressed with not only the services they provide but how the clients are treated as well. Mary Arbuckle (the director) knows everyone by name and knows their entire back story. I quickly joined the advisory committee and recently joined the board. I really do feel that we have a great group of people working together to try and help as many people in need as we possibly can.  I was told when I first started that when you're volunteering, if you're not having fun you shouldn't do it. We manage to have a lot of fun and great interaction w/the clients while getting a lot of important work done. 
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	301482		/users/profile/392415	ceandmke	Donor	5	08/24/2016	We have been so very impressed with JBFC. Our two high school daughters visited their campus in Tanzania this past summer and it was life-changing. JBFC's mission to end poverty in rural Africa by providing education, sustainable food, and medicin, to some of the world's most needy and vulnerable children is both noble and pragmatic. Everything we have seen out of JBFC has been top notch. The organization is responsibly run with integrity and transparency. The staff is a compassionate and friendly "family." If you ever doubt how much good ONE PERSON can do in the world, I urge you to learn more about Chris Gates, and his founding and nurturing of JBFC. We are wholly impressed, and look forward to continuing our association, as donors, volunteers, and friends of the JBFC family. Just can't say enough good things about JBFC!
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	301476	3	/users/profile/392409	Sydney E.	Volunteer	5	08/24/2016	Ever since I heard about JBFC, I've always been wanting to travel to the campus in Tanzania. When I was able to go, it was a dream come true and was more that I could've ever imagined. Prayer time every day was so memorable for me, hearing all of the girls' beautiful voices and worships. Everyday I think about the bright smiles of pure joy from those grateful girls and nothing could make me happier. My experience with JBFC , and the girls at JBFC impacted me greatly in such a positive way. I can't wait to go back!

The structure of volunteering at JBFC is a combination of giving the volunteer a life changing experience while actually helping the community. Living conditions are definitely do-able, food is AMAZING, and the girls will change your life. Being apart of the JBFC family is  a huge part of my identity and I pray that everyone who has a hunger for helping others and seeing the world gets the opportunity to go to JBFC! 
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	297081	1	/users/profile/387857	JBFC2016	Board Member	5	07/18/2016	My involvement with JBFC began near its inception.  I must say, the vision Chris Gates (JBFC CEO) had at that time seemed, at least to me, almost unattainable.  It was a grand vision - to provide a home for orphaned girls that would give love and care to children whose lives were often shattered, to build a school to bring education and life skills to the girls at JBFC and the wider community, to become self-sustaining in terms of farming and permaculture, to bring medical services for the health and well-being of the girls and community, to give the girls at JBFC a bright future.  Fast forward to now, all that has been attained and much more.  It is a privilege to be on the Board of JBFC.  I continue to be amazed at the vision cast for JBFC and thankful to be a small part of making that happen.   Lindsay Hurley Fick
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	296878	2	/users/profile/387655	vvrooman	Volunteer	5	07/17/2016	My experience with JBFC began with my son's desire to volunteer for JBFC. As I researched the organization, met with the staff, and helped my son prepare for his summer experience, I found this organization to be all that is says that it is. The impact on my child has been remarkable. He is forever changed by his experiences and he fully intends to return to JBFC again. I have since spent time volunteering for JBFC here in Tulsa. I continue to be impressed with this organization. They are doing amazing things in Africa and throughout the world.

I am unbelievably confident that the work JBFC does is worthwhile and truly impactful.  I must say that I most respect JBFC for its unwavering commitment to its mission and its absolute dedication to the people it serves.  Further, I am impressed by how much the organization has grown in the past 5 years or so.   
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	283241	1	/users/profile/373461	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/23/2016	JBFC is completely committed to their mission and is an extremely well run non-profit organization.  I am always hesitant about international volunteer programs because the opportunity for people acting like tourists in someone else's oppression is very real. However, JBFC mitigates the risk of this happening through educating volunteers and openly discussing expectations for volunteers coming to their campus in Tanzania. Furthermore, their goal of sustainability and their conscience effort to engage the surrounding community in their work shows a cultural sensitivity and a self-awareness that many NGOs lack. The organization highly values and respects their volunteers and provides many volunteering opportunities both for groups and individuals with specialized interests and expertise. The staff members, both in the USA and in Tanzania, are welcoming, knowledgeable, and helpful. 
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	283227	1	/users/profile/373436	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/23/2016	I have recently returned from my third visit to JBFC.  My experience with the girls, the students and the organization have changed my life.  I never expected that this would become an annual pilgrimage for me but now I can't imagine it not.  The girls are incredibly grateful, respectful and passionate. To watch them grow over the years has been a true blessing for me, and they have voices of angles when they sing - moves my heart!  The students are awesome, whether working one on one, in the classroom or serving breakfast and lunch their smiles are infectious and their gratitude felt.  For the organization, I haven't see anything like it!  Their holistic and self sustainable approach to life on campus not only has a positive impact on the girls but the entire community. What JBFC has done and is doing I simply remarkable.  I am proud to be a part of such an incredible family. Thank you for the opportunity! xo

They are an amazing group changing lives in Tanzania. I volunteered at the Joseph and Mary School and saw firsthand what Chris and his team are doing in the community. They are giving these children the gift of an education. It was a blessing to volunteer with JBFC. The group is well-organized and strategic about its work to help the children of the Foundation. I hope to always remain connected to my friends at JBFC and am counting down the days until I go back!
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	277961	2	/users/profile/367821	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/25/2016	I have been involved as a volunteer and ambassador for JBFC since 2011. My first experience was a six week trip to the first campus in 2011. At the time, I was relatively blind to the work being done by the organization. Over the past 5 years, I have witnessed incredible growth by the organization which has already made a positive impact on the surrounding communities. I think this has been accomplished because Chris started by understanding the culture and the resources available. Chris Gates has been able to execute a  vision that is creating a platform for real change in Tanzania. The donations received by this organization are used in a way that invests in the future sustainability to ensure they make a meaningful impact long term.  As the organization continues to expand, I remain impressed by the execution of the JBFC model by the leadership and staff of the organization. 
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	277813	2	/users/profile/367648	Borna K.	Volunteer	5	01/23/2016	I have spent two summers on-site at JBFC. The way this organization has changed me is almost indescribable. I was fortunate enough to receive funding through Duke University to help JBFC implement a science lab curriculum to their schools. The girls at JBFC and the schoolkids had a level of enthusiasm and eagerness when it came to learning that I have never experienced before. Relative to what I'm accustomed to as an American, the kids there had very little material belongings. However, they were some of the happiest, most resilient, and grateful people I have met. I vividly remember leading a particular lesson plan involving baking soda and vinegar. This lesson, which is a staple of beginner science labs, incited such excitement within the students. I could see that they truly were able to learn so much when given the opportunity. I can say with certainty that JBFC has changed me as a person. The community and the students at JBFC will always be part of my life, and I can't wait for the chance to go back!
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	277791	2	/users/profile/367622	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/22/2016	The first time I traveled to JBFC was my first time out of the country. I stepped onto JBFC's campus believing I could change the lives of the 45 resident girls. The next three weeks proved me wrong- those girls changed my life forever. Nearly three years have passed since my last visit to JBFC's campus, but rarely does a day go by that I don't reference the impact JBFC has had on my life. The physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually exhausting yet rewarding experiences I had in Tanzania have molded me into a different person with a heart for serving others. The work employees and volunteers conduct in the states and on JBFC's campus are making an impact on the world and poverty. Over the years I have been blessed to witness JBFC grow their campus and mission. Through the continuing vision of employees and help of volunteers, I cannot wait to see how impactful JBFC will be in the coming years.

There's a combination of local Tanzanian staff, interns and visiting volunteers working together to create a strong sense of community and healing, empowering space for the 45 girls who are residents.During my brief visit I was able to attend school, art classes, a governance meeting, a goodnight ritual, all designed to help a person flourish in a retreat-like setting.In addition, the handmade items by local artisans in the craft store, the permaculture gardens, Papa's cafe, the bungalow where I stayed on Lake Victoria, are models of economic development and sustainability.This is project worth supporting and replicating and I believe can make significant impact on addressing poverty. 
JBFC (Janada L. Batchelor Foundation for Children Inc)	248614	2	/users/profile/336364	tamarcod	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	As a four time volunteer, I've been able to watch JBFC grow into an outstanding, heartfelt organization. It provides a safe haven for girls in Tanzania, when at times, all hope seemed to be lost for them. JBFC is built on four pillars, refuge, education, healthcare, and agriculture.  Through countless efforts from volunteers, donors, and the JBFC administration and staff, JBFC has excelled in all four pillars, allowing its girls to be girls again, and giving them the opportunity to thrive in a rough Tanzanian culture. It is  easy to assume that as a volunteer  you would be changing the lives of others, when in-fact JBFC has changed mine.

PET ANGELS RESCUE Inc	289852		/users/profile/380110	Writer	Client Served	5	05/13/2016	We walked into PetSmart one weekend to buy some dog food, and decided to take a quick peek at the adoptable dogs. We didn't intend to adopt a puppy, as we already had two dogs at home, but when I picked up Piper, (originally named Angel) I just couldn't put her down. She was 4 months old, and absolutely gorgeous. She came from a large litter where the mother had been chained to a wall for her entire life, and the puppies would certainly have perished if not for a neighbor who intervened, rescued the puppies and contacted Pet Angels Rescue for help. The adoption process was easy, and the volunteers were friendly. We have continued to support Pet Angels Rescue over the years with some small cash donations and by purchasing items on their Amazon wishlist. We also utilize the website www.smile.amazon.com when we order items from Amazon, so that a percentage of the money we spend is donated to Pet Angels Rescue every month. We truly appreciate the service that Pet Angels provides to the community. Dana and her volunteers work tirelessly to find homes for these animals who would otherwise be forgotten. Of course we have a soft spot in our hearts for Pet Angels, because it gave us our precious baby, Piper!

When my husband has had several serious health issues, Joe is a huge motivator to get well and get home. Had Pet Angels not been there to rescue him, I'm not sure if my husband would still be alive.

PET ANGELS RESCUE Inc	278686	1	/users/profile/368662	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/01/2016	Pet Angels Rescue changed my family's life.   As an adopter first and then a volunteer for Pet Angels, without a doubt the animals come first. No question. Pet Angels provides all animals with the best health care, shelter, food, love and finding the right forever home.   Dana Huckaby (Puckett), Pet Angels President, is a true angel. And I'm not saying that lightly.  She is the hardest working and most selfless person my husband and I have ever met.  Here is how we met Dana and Pet Angels: In 2014 my daughter's house was broken into at college while 5 girls slept in their rooms. No one was hurt, thank goodness, but we needed to make a change.  We love dogs, so my daughter decided to adopt a dog believing that would help as added protection.  She searched online and found a 3 year old husky named Bella at Pet Angels Rescue. We completed the Pet Angels application online and then attended an upcoming adoption event.  Bella was one of the dogs at the event.  My daughter fell in love instantly.  Bella was a perfect fit; she was housebroken, calm temperment and grew to be protective of my daughter, not aggressive, but would definitely growl a little at the cable guy!!! I couldn't believe how this sweet Bella ever ended up in the pound....TWICE!  She is absolutely precious, very loving, extremely well behaved and the most loyal dog.I was so impressed by the organization that I asked to volunteer, which is how we adopted a second dog from Pet Angels, named Batty Koda!    Dana had pulled Batty, a 4 month old husky, from a local pound as he was dropped in the night drop very sick.  He had a rare tick disease and required an emergency blood transfusion.  I offered to transport him home from emergency care and kept him for a day since Dana was out of town.   I became so attached to him instantly, and so did my 3 other dogs that when I took him back I cried the entire way to the rescue.  Luckily my husband had also fallen for Batty and we were able to adopt him!! Today he is a happy and healthy sweet adorable dog and the love of our life!But I can't stop there....I have one more to share!  Someone dropped a puppy in the night drop at a local pound while he was having seizures.  He was absolutely beautiful and so sweet.  Dana pulls him from the pound and takes him immediately to emergency care.  He was there for a few days when I offered to pick him up from emergency care on a snowy day....and you got it... I fell in love again!  This time my husband had cut me off at 4 dogs total and I was not allowed to adopt him. I was so sad.  But he received the best health care from Dana at Pet Angels and he never had another seizure.  My daughter adopted him and named him Jax.  Jax and Bella are her two babies and the two sweetest and best dogs ever.My husband and I have become more involved with Pet Angels because we witness on a daily basis, how every animal that Pet Angels brings into the shelter is provided with the best care possible.  My husband also assists Pet Angels in tax preparation so he knows the operating expenses and he couldn't believe how much Dana was doing for the animals with very limited funds.  This is an organization that truly cares about the animals first and follows the mission of placing them in loving forever homes with only private donations that go directly to the care of each animal. That is no joke!  I have so many more I want to adopt.  So please take a look at Pet Angels site at www.petangelrescue.org and adopt them for me!!  
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	250847		/users/profile/277543	Vunruh	Volunteer	5	07/31/2015	When you speak of a true sanctuary, Horse Feathers Equine Center fits every definition you can think of. A place for healing, compassion, care, peace, you name it!  All of the horses, whether in sanctuary or temporarily here waiting their forever homes, receive top notch care. Ongoing medical, ferrier work, dentistry, proper feed and supplementation, you name it and Horse Feathers does it to give these horses the best opportunity possible. So thankful and proud to be a part of something so wonderful!

She has taken in horses so weak and meager they could not even stand on their own. After her loving care and attention, these horses can not only stand but stand with pride and strength. She does so much for children and vets and anyone willing to learn. This is where she truly helps equines worldwide because she educates future potential owners of what is necessary with equine care so that others don't end up in similar situations as those brought to her rescue. She is truly an angel here on earth not only to equines but to all!
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	218624	1	/users/profile/282205	Miranda8	Volunteer	5	09/30/2014	My 13 year old, horse-crazy daughter found Horse Feathers on-line. We filled out our paperwork, did a little e-mailing to establish a schedule, and began volunteering. Horse Feathers is a place where horses truly come first. The gentle, loving care provided by the staff shines through everything that is done, from the regularity of meal time to the high quality medical care provided to those horses in need. Horse Feathers is a quality facility, with a quality staff and wonderful volunteers!
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	218511		/users/profile/282082	labedl	Donor	5	09/30/2014	Found Horse Feathers thru a friend on Facebook in the midst of the Oklahoma tornado disaster in mid 2013; and though I am in California and we have needy programs out here, I have been so impressed with their program I have kept following their progress and making small donations when I can. I believe it was the morning just after the tornado had swept through, and while the rest of the world was still looking blankly around them, Cheri knew time couldn't be wasted. She loaded up her trailer with supplies from the feed store and just started driving down rural roads seeing where she could help; a bag of feed here, water tank there. She organized people within just a few hours to go in with trailers and help get horses to safety. Since then I have watched a completely neglected donkey with hooves looking like elf shoes turn into the most sweet and adorable farm mascot, and most recently a starving bag of bones come in and receive such expert care that you wouldn't know it was the same horse 2 months later. This rescue welcomes volunteers and I wish I could be one of them!
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	218510		/users/profile/282081	Juanita S.	Volunteer	5	09/30/2014	Horse Feathers is an awesome place for horses and volunteers. I have seen many horses come in that were abused, neglected, or abandoned that they have not only been brought back to health but turned into sweet, loving animals!When I was in need after my horse was burned in a fire; They not only took her in while we rebuilt, helped her heal, and made her healthier and better behaved than she was when I bought her.Cheri and Viet are amazing with these wonderful creatures. They understand the horses' language and heal, teach, and love them in a way the horses understand. 
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	215051		/users/profile/278378	Mindy11	Volunteer	5	09/14/2014	I have been volunteering at Horse Feathers, it is a great place. The love, dedication and care shown to the horses by Cherie and Viet is tremendous. Whether the horses have been abused, starved, burned etc. the care and recovery they have all made by this rescue's hard work is wonderful. I am so happy to support this rescue. 
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	214575		/users/profile/277850	kaypar	Donor	5	09/10/2014	Cheri is so passionate about taking in abused, starved and injured members of the equine family.  She has helped numerous horses heal and find forever homes..  She is committed to the health and welfare of the animals that she has rescued.  I wish I lived closer so I could help her with the awesome care she gives horses, mules and donkeys.  
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	214569		/users/profile/277843	critters70	Volunteer	5	09/10/2014	I first became aware of Horse Feathers in Nov 2013 when my veterinarian suggested I contact Cheri .  At the time I was 2 weeks out of the hospital from a spinal fusion surgery, my horse had injured his eye, it became infected & he needed surgery to remove the eye.  I was still taking pain killers, knew very little about horses, blamed myself for his situation, had extremely limited financial resources and was generally overwhelmed.  (for anyone wondering WHY I had a horse - he had been abandoned on our property about a yr earlier - skinny & untrained - so we decided to try to care for him)  I called Cheri (crying) begging her to please take my horse.  She ask "If you could keep him would you?"  Absolutely I would...she then proceeded to provide information & emotional support necessary to get me & my horse through a very difficult time.  I began volunteering there in early Jan 2014 - for 4 months I was there 4 to 5 times a week to help with the evening feed - Cheri was also recovering from a major  surgery -  we limped, & froze but got everyone fed!  I continue to volunteer there.  I have witnessed the effort & time Cheri puts in to the operation, management, promotion and fund raising necessary to assure that Horse Feathers serves the interest of equines and the community without taking anything for herself.  It is wonderful what she does for the horses - they are not put in a pasture and forgotten - she knows them all and they know her.  Her adoption process is painstaking but worth it because "our" horses go to committed, loving homes.  
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	214370		/users/profile/277617	paranakyry	Volunteer	5	09/09/2014	My daughter and I have been volunteering at Horse Feathers for two years now. I have seen animals come to the rescue in dire condition, some with wounds or burns and others who have been neglected or otherwise mistreated. Cheri knows how to nurse creatures back from the brink, how to heal with constant love, encouragement and proper treatment. This summer, she took in a starved an abandoned horse, a walking skeleton whose eyes were dull and lifeless, and we watched as she slowly brought him back from the brink. It is astounding the things she can do with animals.  Beyond that, Horse Feathers puts its money directly into food and shelter for their animals. The organization is lean and makes good use of its volunteers. If you love horses, you should stop by or find out how you can support this organization.
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	214290	1	/users/profile/266806	Ann_85	Client Served	5	09/09/2014	What a wonderful place Horse Feathers is!  When my horse passed in January of this year I knew I wanted to adopt again.  I was looking for a local rescue to adopt from and found Horse Feathers through a friend who had adopted a horse.  In February I adopted a beautiful pony.  The work they do is an asset to our communities here in Oklahoma.  Adoption, what an option!  
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	214234	1	/users/profile/277487	Heidilinn	Volunteer	5	09/09/2014	I came across Horse Feathers early last year. The care RT gives not only to these horses, but anyone that comes out is amazing. After getting out of the military and transitioning not only to a new state, but to a life of being a stay at home mom, was difficult for me. Finding Horse Feathers and working with RT has been the best experience I could have ever asked for. She has a keen ability with pairing me up with a chore or horse that best suits me for the day, as well as being someone to talk with. Her dedication to not only the horses but the volunteers is beyond words. The fact that she also works to educate as well as the programs she has to help horse owners who've fallen on hard times shows just how much she cares about animals and people. Watching my children go out there and bond and work hard with her guidance makes my heart swell. If anyone is looking for a way to give back, do something as a family, or just need that something in their life, I suggest checking this facility out. 
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	9454	9	/users/profile/11248	Murphytime	Donor	5	08/22/2009	I first learned of Horse Feathers on a blog I was watching quite a few years a ago. The first thing that impressed me about Cheri(RT) was her committment to the horses under her care. There is no one that works harder for these souls than RT. There are many stories of how she has saved horses from near death and with love and care made them whole again. Her biggest struggle is keeping her organization solvent. She probably could take in more unwanted horses, but it takes a lot of money to take care of them. So she gives the one's in her care the best she can and relies on volunteers and donors to help. Those of us involved with her want her to succeed with her organization and will remain committed to her and the horses at Horse Feathers.
Horse Feathers Equine Center Inc	9446	10	/users/profile/11256	kckellsbells	Board Member	5	08/22/2009	I have known Cheri White Owl for over two years now and her hard work and determination are amazing.  She has a children's program and a program for our American veterans.  She not only helps and heals horses, but she helps and heals children and veterans.  Amazing place!
Hunger Relief International	304535		/users/profile/395715	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/14/2016	To Whom It May Concern:I have been very happy to support HRI over the years as I truly believe in their programming of offering educational programs for sustainable living for children in Haiti, Guatemala and beyond.  While providing money and food is needed and important,when an organization  goes beyond that and provides education in setting up water sources, working with local farmers to learn to grow their own food and partnering with churches to facilitate these goals, THIS is  what is needed for long term success.  I am happy to support such an organization. 
Hunger Relief International	304428		/users/profile/395589	aquamarine	Donor	5	09/14/2016	Hunger Relief International has helped save the lives of numerous vulnerable children, teens and their families by partnering with local communities to educate and  ensure that children and their families are able to have access to clean drinking water, health care and nutritional food. What sets Hunger Relief International apart is that HRI works with and teaches local farmers, community religious organizations and Government leaders how to grow nutritious foods as well as engage and empower the community to take part in their own health. Visiting countries like Haiti (among others) HRI has worked to identify water-borne illnesses and resolve this issue through a water treatment and filtration process that the community can now implement themselves. Providing the community ( through donations) with hygiene kits, sanitary latrines, parasite programs and safe cooking stoves will continue to reduce illness and save the lives of the most vulnerable. On the ground and traveling to countries like Haiti and Guatemala, Hunger Relief International has been successful in saving the sick and undernourished. Many children have lived as a result of implemented programs that address the sick and malnourished. Hunger Relief International 's programs and the education of the local communities has saved many and helped those in dire need to help themselves through your donations, programs and education. As a parent, clean drinking water, food and a sanitary home and environment is something most take for granted. These vulnerable children will survive and learn from their parents and community (with the help of HRI) to thrive. Hunger Relief International has been successful in implementing programs and education across the globe. Medical clinics, planting projects, mosquito nets, nutritional support programs, home planting gardens and more.  Hunger Relief International and it's efforts have been proven to be successful and many should donate and or continue to donate to this wonderful organization. H. Sackman
Hunger Relief International	289409		/users/profile/379659	trey3will	Volunteer	4	05/11/2016	We have been working with HRI in Guatemala for 3 years. I think HRI does a good job of defining the parameters of who they are serving. In Guatemala, for example, they have identified 5 villages and are working a plan to break the cycle of poverty with sanitation, nutrition, education and self-sufficiency in those villages.I love that the nutrition programs and the work projects are locally-sourced, from a resource and personnel standpoint. I also love that the in-country programs are run from Guatemala, by Guatemalan people. 
Hunger Relief International	289355		/users/profile/379594	DWheeler	Donor	5	05/10/2016	We have supported a number of HRI programs over the years. Their programs are sound and are meeting genuine needs throughout their service area. We have been impressed with the "service after gift" practices of the organization. We receive immediate receipts and periodic program reports on how our support is affecting change for those in need.

Hunger Relief International	284743	1	/users/profile/374805	Writer	Donor	5	04/05/2016	I have worked with Hunger Relief International for the last several years on projects in both Haiti and Guatemala. During these projects I have seen HRI go out of their way to ensure their projects are productive and efficient, as well they have brought in mission groups and students from universities to show the people of these villages how to grow efficient gardens, installed water filtrations, and to build dorms and security walls for the children. The most impressive thing is to see them invite other organizations long to increase the experience pool to share with these villages, from universities for garden projects, organizations for water projects, engineering firms for sanitation projects. Their teams are made up of local people and they purchase their food for their projects from the local farmers. Unlike other organizations which drop food and leave the local farmers with no one to buy their crops, Hunger Relief has though this trough and care about the people. They strive for the bigger picture of covering not just food, but deworming, clean water, and education, these are the things combined that will break the cycle of poverty. HRI has received awards for their transparency, and Rachel Zelon the founder has been named one of the top 30 people of the world to influence world hunger. This woman even went to Iraq during the war with no support to find and airlift the frail and dwindling remains of a once thriving Jewish community.

We have had the amazing opportunity to partner with HRI and Rachel.  I know first hand that they do everything with in the powers to make sure that not only the needs of the orphanages are met, but all those groups that serve with them!  The staff are very kind and genuine in their wanting to help not only provide for immediate care, but also for these young men's future.  It has been life changing for our team when we go to Haiti.  Logistics, food, travel, and accommodations are good.  HRI is first class!  HRI has great ethics and it is our privilege to partner with them.My name is Jonathan Poe and I serve as the Care Pastor and Mission Cooridnator at Skybreak  Church, located in College Station TX.
Hunger Relief International	282044		/users/profile/372152	Writer	Client Served	1	03/09/2016	Mission trips: In-country guides and translators are great. Stateside support is minimal. All costs are inflated. Dispute resolution a joke. Make sure you know exactly what you are getting.Transparency is virtually nonexistent. Nutrition support provided to orphanage is extremely inadequate, and again, there is no transparency or attempt at dispute resolution.
Hunger Relief International	274237	2	/users/profile/363608	Writer	Donor	5	12/11/2015	HRI is an amazing organization working  tirelessly to improve the lives of vulnerable children and their families.   The community based initiatives are   truly fulfilling  the organization's mission.  Knowing that 95% of donations go directly to programs is reassuring.  The wonderful newsletters and updates are informative and inspirational.  I am proud to support HRI and am  confident that they will accomplish their current and future goals.  I  highly recommend this great organization !

The services they provide enable families to develop skills and obtain life sustaining products to better provide for their families so they will not be forever dependent on foreign aid.

You meet so many wonderful, loving and caring people. I've done many things to help them by folding news letters ,stuffing envelopes. Also sewing lap robes , knitting baby caps for the hospital, we have been coloring greeting cards also.

Rsvp Of Central Oklahoma Inc	134173		/users/profile/179952	MarlaCole	Board Member	5	11/06/2012	It has been my privilege to work with RSVP in my role as VP and Licensed Professional Counselor, as I have referred countless widowed men and women to this organization.  RSVP has played a vital role in reminding those who feel lost that they continue to have purpose and value, and have much to offer their communities.  Those have volunteered with RSVP comment that they love it, and perhaps equally as important, they feel loved in return!  That is a win/win in my perspective.  What a great way to give back to your community, recognize your value and purpose and be valued back in return.   When invited to join the board recently, there was no hesitation.  I am proud to be affiliated with RSVP and believe strongly in our mission, the programs and the many avenues available to those who desiring to give of their time in a valuable way.

Rsvp Of Central Oklahoma Inc	133972		/users/profile/179738	lucky13lady	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	The mission of RSVP (Retired & Senior Volunteer Program of Central Oklahoma) is to match persons over the age of 55 with meaningful and challenging volunteer opportunities in the community.From one-time events to ongoing service, the dedicated RSVP staff work tirelessly to coordinate opportunities with volunteers. They go out of their way to match ones interests and skills with partner agencies and events. I first learned about RSVP from my mother who was very involved in the Provide-A-Ride program beginning in the mid-1990s. Health issues in 2005 forced her to transition to other RSVP activities. From then until her death in 2009, I was blessed to accompany her as her health allowed. I will always cherish the quality time we spent together and with other devoted volunteers.Being an active RSVP volunteer now keeps me involved in the community and its very rewarding to see the results of our efforts make the Oklahoma City metro area a better place to live.

They are mature, caring, fun loving adults who help with a huge variety of activities.  Volunteer projects range from 1 hour projects to as busy as you want to be.  They help tutor children, drive seniors to medical appointments, assist in museums & hospitals, help with disaster relief, local festivals, animal welfare, activities to help veterans and much more.

Rsvp Of Central Oklahoma Inc	133670		/users/profile/179413	apollock123	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	RSVP of Central Oklahoma has over 1200 registered volunteers providing 200,000 volunteer hours to its community service area each year.  It provides volunteers to approximately 140 non-profit agencies in the community.  It provides a most successful "Provie-a-Ride " program of giving free rides to medical appointments to those currently living alone and unable to drive.  Volunteer drivers take, wait with and return home their riders, amnd make stops to pick up prescriptions as well.  All services are coordinated through a small but dedicated staff of concerned individuals, familiar with the needs of the community and in touch, personally, with the volunteer base.It is simply an outstanding organization and asset to our community.

Just wish we had more time to devote to helping them.  We think they are great!

It's incredible how such a tiny staff makes me feel like I am part of the family, but there are over 1,000 members!  I like the way I am given personal attention to make sure I am pleased with the activities assigned, and I especially like the way I am "placed" with other members of the program to perform short-term projects for so many nonprofits.  It gives me a chance to make some new friends and meet all kinds of people.  And the services RSVP offers to seniors, especially free rides to doctors for senior citizens, are so needed.  I am so glad I made the choice to join such a top-notch program.
Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless Inc	283960	1	/users/profile/373970	Bntyhntr	Former staff	2	03/29/2016	The only real big help this org. Provides is a place for the homeless to hang out and do nothing all day waste their lives away sure some get housed after sitting around doing nothing.  The medical staff here is excellent and really cares to help the clients.  Case managers seem to help the easiest to put in government funded housing and the rest are told to figure things out on your own and let us know how it works out. Jack Younger the man in charge is pretty big bully if you make him mad by our kicked out no matter what. They will find a reason to get rid of you.  However many who are inline to be housed are still allowed to stay after being caught using drugs or fighting just to get them through the system and so the numbers of people who are housed stay looking OK. All in all most of the other reviews are just what the people are seeing for a brief time ask some of the clients there and see if their views match up with the rest of the reviews maybe 10% will. You want really help if your homeless check out children and family services or the programs offered next door at the salvation army

Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless Inc	24820	3	/users/profile/25823	Leslie Hoyt	Board Member	5	12/22/2009	It has been amazing working with the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless.  The thing that impresses me most is that each person that seeks out the Day Center is treated with respect and dignity.  The staff is exceptional, and truly cares about the clients they are serving. I feel this stems from the culture that is nurtured by Sandra Lewis, the director.  The case managers work so hard to make sure the needs of the clients are met, and are always working towards helping the clients become self-sufficient.  Recently the Day Center was asked to lead the way for Tulsa in facilitating the rapid rehousing effort, made possible by government stimulus dollars.  This is such a huge undertaking, but the staff has stepped up to the task!

I know that an easy fix is not what they need.  So I confidently steer them to the Day Center where I know they'll be guided into paths of long-term self-sufficiency.  Thanks to Sandra, the Board, and the entire crew of the Day Center for stretching their own resources to make a huge difference for the people of northeastern Oklahoma.

Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless Inc	24434	2	/users/profile/25494	fireballxl5	Volunteer	5	12/18/2009	Many years ago I had a young daughter that volunteerd at the Day Center as part of school community service hours.  I thought she would come back wide eyed and crying but she came back with a bigger heart and greater compassion for the homeless.  In fact she went back on many occations to volunteer when she didn't need to and inspired me to begin donating to this wonderful and most necessary facility on a regular basis.  Some years later I had family members that needed the services of Day Center and am proud to say they are fully back on their feet.  Now Brent and I do the yearly summertime Home Run for the Homeless and we get to sit in the air conditioned booth and make fun of the celebrities down on the HOT field.  Just one more reason The Day Center for the Homeless ROCKS!!

I could write for pages praising for this non-profit and it's staff.  In the interests of brevity, there are two things which impress me most. First is how the clients are treated by the staff. I have seen the Director on numerous occasions interacting with both clients and significant donors. Both of these groups are treated alike, that is, with the same dignity and respect to which all people are entitled.  I believe that our clients truly know that they are cared for and that people sincerely care about them.  Secondly, I admire the way that the Day Center is constantly trying to offer more services and opportunities to place people in a position where they can become self-sufficient   The Day Center is truly responsible for changing the lives of many of its clients immeasurably. It is an honor to try an assist the organization and further its goals in any way I can.

Every year, I have been so moved by the passion of the Day Center to help its clients as well as the support the event receives from local media and attendees. Even in the extreme heat, media personalitities get out and play in this celebrity softball tournament, and it has been a great way for the Day Center to continue to raise awareness of its organization.
Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless Inc	24314	1	/users/profile/25403	JulieChin2	Volunteer	5	12/17/2009	Bravo to the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless! I had the opportunity to visit the Day Center in advance of their "Homerun for the Homeless" charity baseball game and was blown away. That day happened to be one of the hottest of the summer, and so many people were seeking relief from the heat at the day center. The staff was welcoming not only to me, but to the many who really needed them. I was honored to be part of an event to help them raise money.  The charity baseball game is a first class event! I've had the honor of emceeing it for the last 3 years and have seen it grow bigger and better each year. It is so popular there are even media personalities vying to play in the game. Without a doubt a great event, and the Daycenter is a GREAT non-profit! Julie Chin, 2NEWS Meteorologist

Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless Inc	24026	3	/users/profile/25143	Tom Droege	General Member of the Public	5	12/14/2009	I have seen the Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless rally their staff to administer a new program by the federal government to prevent homelessness and help those who have become homeless due to the economic recession. I have seen how their Community Voice mail program has reconnected homeless people with family members, helped them get jobs and led to permenant housing. I have seen the staff plan a memorial service for some 44 homeless people who have died in Tulsa in 2009. This memorial is the only remembrance many of these people will ever receive. The Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless has many more medical, legal and job programs too numerous to list here.
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	188249		/users/profile/245572	LovingMommaOf2	Client Served	5	11/10/2013	In the midst of my Storm, as a married woman, husband of 13 yrs together 16, finally wants his divorce, and a mother of two previous children from God, gifts He gave me, (amazed since Doctor's in CA told me in 1998 that I could not have children) he's taken them and he and his families hid them from me since September 19 2013. I contacted my Attorney and finally heard from her September 29th so she could find out what was going on.  October 1st my Attorney calls me with documentation of twisted manipulative verbiage I never said, he claims that I am verbally and physically abusive to him and my kids.  He threw me to the Sharks/Wolves September 19 and again on the 25th and 30th of September.  He was granted Emergency Custody 11 days of no word or knowing where my kids were.  I am a faithful Christian Woman and mom and I finally went back to church also for my 11 yro dtr who begged me to take her back to church,  she and her brother never got to go with me since I started August 11 and been faithful to my Lord and committed to Him in all I do. I became a member of my churcg in September. Counseling since January 2013, on my Hypothyroid medicines since April 2013 (Finally the correct diahnistics) my mom has Hypothyroidism too, been going to Women Conferences thru my Church at Rhema, went to Girls of Grace Event October 19th, on behalf of my daughter, and church groups and mom's were there too.  It truly blessed me.  1st court date was October 10th and I was granted Sunday mornings to go pick up my kids in OKC, with Supervior driving time, and back El Reno, 9 to 1:30 & Wednesday nights 5:30-8:45pm. Been doing this and will do this until 2nd court date November 14th @1:30.  II was also granted at least one phone call a day with my kids and I am aloud to go to, now both my 11 yr old and 4 yr old son go to school, their dad secretly moved our daughter to on September 30th. I saw their school for the first time November 6th with my 6th grader and Thursday the 7th with my Preschool baby boy.  Their was a meeting on November 7th against me with John and his DHS and now Prevention people.  I have updated alk to my Attorney and according to Prevention I need more Mental Therapy because of the twisted lies documented September 25th. The state has nor seen or reviewed eith my kids since my new court minutes October 10th. I have the best time with my babies in the car to and fro and at church before they are excused for their Bible Studies.  My 4 year old sons class is called "The Worshippers" & my 11 yr old daughters is called "Azusa Street Kids". I am blessed I get to clean their rooms and sanctuary on Saturdays and volunteer to work in their classrooms. I keep praying for their dad and his families and friends and for my children who have been put in the middle of this.  He hates me so much well he said he loves me that is why he did what he did he said to protect our kids from me.  For the record I never verbally said those words to my children and never physically abused them or anyone in my 20 plus year's (I excluded between 0 and 18 since the words all my life here would not make sense) of my 36 years.  Their dad was and is the man I loved and now have a New Love for him in Christ. I forgave him and his people's and I need to let this go and be loving kind and patient on getting my kids back into my life and me in theirs.  Too much hate and anger built up between their dad and I. I want them 3 to stop this and in Jesus Name the Truth Set me FREE from false lies so I can be around my wonderful sweet children.  They don't know me.  I am not who they want to believe I am (hateful and evil) I am Loving Kind Gentle Caring Fun Encouraging Inspiring and Faithful in Him. Please keep us all in your prayers and ask me for the truth first.  John promised he would make life H E double hockey sticks for me to keep me away from our kids but it's not for the right reasons.  God bless and keep them.  Colossians 1:9-12, has been one of my "Life-Changing Prayers".  This is my prayer for me and my family and many other people around the globe.  God bless and keep you too.
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	187286		/users/profile/244279	LaineyL	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I found out about Calm Waters when my daughter attended her parenting class (for divorce) at their offices.  She knew I was looking for volunteer opportunities and told me they needed help.  I called, found out what I needed to do and soon found myself interviewing to help facilitate night time groups at their offices.  I was very happy when they told me I could go through training and start co-facilitating groups there.  But I got much more than I bargained for. The employees at Calm Waters care for the people they serve.  I have worked places where it is just a job so I know what they looks and feels like.  The Calm Waters office is different.  They want every interaction to be meaningful for the families they serve.  I enjoyed helping serve those families and soon was also facilitating support groups in the school system as well.  This is my third year there and I have to say the children I work with seem to really benefit from the support Calm Waters provides.  They look forward to groups and I am fortunate enough to see some of the transformations as kids learn how to handle their emotions and realize they are not alone.  I didn't expect it to be this rewarding so I definitely got much more than I bargained for and for that I am extremely happy! Calm Waters provides a service that cannot be duplicated and is so important to the many people served there annually.  I am so glad I get to be a part of such an awesome agency!
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	186596	1	/users/profile/243608	Clennaej	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	My son and I attended the grief groups following the death of my aunt.  My son had developed a "tick" becuase of the stress and grieving that we were experiencing.  After a few short weeks attending the support groups his "tick" had completely disappeared and he was happier and emotionally healthier.  The volunteers are wonderful and compassionate.  Calm Waters has been a great help to me and my family. 
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	186111		/users/profile/243090	bellvisions	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	My parents divorced when I was 4. Both remarried by the time I was 9, but my dad died unexpectedly when I was 12. I felt like the only kid who has ever lost a parent at that young age. My friends didn't know how to talk to me, what to say. I felt very alone. I ended up making a lot of poor choices in my life not long after my dad died. In 1997, I had the worst year of my life. To make this shorter, I had two major surgeries...one on my heart and one on my brain. after the second surgery, I had a very strong feeling to do something to benefit others. I needed to live my life no longer for just the benefit of ME. I heard an ad on the radio for Calm Waters Center for Children and Families and thought how amazing an organization this must be. I wished something like it was around when I was 12...I sure could have used it. A week later, I heard an ad for them saying they were in need of caring volunteers. I called immediately and said I want to help but am not a therapist, counselor, or even have a background in that. They told me, "Don't worry, we will train you as a facilitator and you will be with an experienced facilitator in your groups". I went through training in February 1998 and started my first groups in August 1998. I only work with teens, because I believe they have the toughest decisions at this point in their lives that affect who they become. I know...I went through that! I have been facilitating teen groups in both grief and divorce since 1998. Calm Waters Center for Children and Families is an incredible organization, and I am truly blessed to be a part of it. Stuart
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	182119		/users/profile/238882	LauraAnneB	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I am currently a practicum student at Calm Waters and I can't imagine having a better experience anywhere else. What Calm Waters does really changes people's lives and I have had the pleasure to see it for myself. I quickly found myself becoming attached with this organization and plan to volunteer form many years to come. Each staff member and volunteer that I've gotten to know has been unimaginably kind and knowledgeable. I am so incredibly blessed that I get to volunteer here because Calm Waters has shown me that I am on the right career path. 
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	177626		/users/profile/234194	sjwoodruff	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I was one of the founders of Calm Waters over 21 years ago after the death of my husband.  At the time I was looking for help for my son after his Dad died.  We were part of the first grief group and after that I facilitated the adult grief groups for 10 years until my job changed to evenings.  It is a program I believe in and is certainly needed.  I am in awe of the continual growth of Calm Waters to meet the ever changing needs of the children of the Oklahoma City area whether its due to recent tornadoes, the Murrah Building Bombing to children of deployment or incarceration .  The staff at Calm Waters sees a need and figures out how to meet that need.  They help a tremendous number of families each year with the dedication of the staff and volunteers.  I loved my years as a volunteer and continue to support them financially and when ever they ask.   I have referred many families there and all have later told me how much Calm Waters has helped .    
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	176432		/users/profile/232846	JordanDean	Client Served	5	10/10/2013	I attended Calm Waters Divorce Program as a 5 year old when my parents divorced. Divorce has changed my life and through everything I learned and gained from Calm Waters I knew I wanted to volunteer. I started volunteering in college during the summers. Once I graduated I was hired as the Development Coordinator. I cannot express what it feels like to be able to raise money for children just like me. I have the most rewarding job because I get to see the smiles on the faces of grieving children everyday. Calm Waters is an amazing life changing program and I am blessed to be able to part of such a wonderful organization. 
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	175335		/users/profile/231675	laurenmichele	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	I started volunteering with Calm Waters as part of a school requirement, but quickly fell in love with the organization and its mission. I have been blessed by the other facilitators, the employees, and the clients at Calm Waters. I love helping kids deal with the loss of a loved one or cope with divorce. Volunteering at Calm Waters is fun and fulfilling! 
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	175136		/users/profile/231454	lmkrok	Board Member	5	10/08/2013	I have had the honor of serving on the board of Calm Waters for over 5 years.  When I was first introduced to this organization, I was amazed at the impact that Calm Waters had on the OKC community.  Soon after joining the organization, a business partner and his family had need for CW's services.  He said CW gave his family healing and was a critical resource in helping his family recover from a trajic situation.  Several months ago, we lost one of our co-workers in a tragic incident.  She had three young children and CW quickly stepped in and helped the family to begin the healing process.  Although these are personal examples I experienced, Calm Waters helps families in the community like this every day.   
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	174870		/users/profile/231172	John193	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	I have the pleasure of serving at Calm Waters as a volunteer, but I also was fortunate enough as a young boy to attend Calm Waters after my parents went through a divorce. As a kid I remember the level of compassion I felt from the facilitators and how amazing it was to meet other kids who were just like me (at the time, divorce wasn't as prevalent as it is today). As a volunteer, I look forward to passing on that same level of compassion that I received on to other kids who need it badly. Calm Waters makes it possible through excellent training and support, shows incredible appreciation towards its volunteers and is willing to go above and beyond for the children and families that come seeking help...
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	174855		/users/profile/231157	DannyV	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	What do you need when you've experienced loss...whatever that loss may be?  You need a way to a new beginning because things will never be the same again.  You need tools to help you deal with the loss and a compassionate, caring group of people who are going through the same thing to help you along the way.  That's what I found at Calm Waters and what I believe anyone who has experienced a loss will find if they will allow the healing to happen.  It isn't easy but it is definitely worth it.  I've gone through the training and been a volunteer as well as experiencing the healing of being part of the group (my dad had died two years earlier and my sister died while I was volunteering).  In addition, one of the greatest things about Calm Waters is that it caters to all age groups and has age-specific curriculum for each.  It really is the total package.
Calm Waters Center for Children and Families Inc	174745		/users/profile/191728	Patricia52	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	Calm Waters is a great organization.  I work here part-time and also volunteer my time to serve the children and families in our community that are grieving. I love what we do.  I see the impact on the children.  We provide a safe-haven for them during their storm---- whether it is from death, divorce, tornado disasters or other catastrophic events / losses. We make-a-difference.  I see it in the children's faces and hear it in their voices----just to see a little smile that says:  'I'm feeling a little bit better because of Calm Waters'......That's why I do what I do----I just want to help and make-a-difference with some children.

Four of my family members have completed different types of counceling at this Organization.  Each one is a success story with long lasting effects that changed their lives in a positive way.

Phoenix Gate Inc	91476		/users/profile/104665	Twyla C.	Board Member	3	06/21/2011	As a professional in this field, I have been following Phoenix Gate, Inc. since its inception.  Many lives have been touched in a number of ways.  Families have regained the strength and guidance they need to continue a productive and healthy lifestyle, recovering users have learned to live a life that is free of drugs, and children have been taught ways to say NO to drugs and alcohol.  The guidance and direction you can receive from programs like this is immeasurable.  It's too bad that there is such a shortage of facilities and funding to support this program.
Phoenix Gate Inc	91473		/users/profile/104661	Linda Fineberg	Volunteer	5	06/21/2011	I became involved with this amazing organization as a Volunteer in August 2010. From the moment I first walked into Phoenix Gate, Inc. I knew it was a special place that improves people's lives. I never dreamed I would be given the opportunity to not only help others make a fresh start, realize they can achieve their goals, and hope for the future but also experience this for myself. In October 2010, I was hired as a full-time employee at Phoenix Gate, Inc. and embarked on a new journey. It's exciting to experience everyone that comes in contact with this organization learn and grow together. The counselor's provide knowledge and support in a non-judgemental manner.
Phoenix Gate Inc	91312		/users/profile/103126	Deana S.	Volunteer	5	06/18/2011	I have been privilaged to be a part of Phoenix Gate since its conception in 1999 both financially and as a volunteer.  This organization began when a group of counselors realized a need in our area for a Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Facility that would serve the indigent and low income people.  The counselors are highly trained, professional, and caring people; Willing to give their best even when a client could pay little or nothing for their services.  An award was given by  the state for the Company's involvement in hiring and training people to enter the workforce. They will continue to serve the indigent and low income. after all, that mis what their counselors love to do.
Phoenix Gate Inc	90682		/users/profile/103503	AMorriso	Volunteer	4	06/14/2011	I have had the pleasure of working with Phoenix Gate since 2005, first as a volunteer, then as an employee and now as a board member. I have watched so many people benefit from the programs that Phoenix Gate offers. Many of the clients begin with resentment and finish with the knowledge and confidence to choose a better life for themselves. I have seen clients, who have completed their programs, continue coming to classes just to revisit the environment that they grew to love. This says a lot! The counselors and staff at Phoenix Gate really care about helping people. 
Phoenix Gate Inc	90562		/users/profile/103323	LTN9000	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/12/2011	I have worked as a counselor at Phoenix Gate and have observed the personal and professional way in which it is operated.  I provided counseling and evaluation services, mainly for clients involved with the criminal justice system (probation & parole), in both individual and group settings. The support staff was excellent in assisting with the clients, staff, and the public. While all members of the staff exhibiting familiarization with their specialities, all very good with generalities with this type of work.More room in the office would have been nice, along with audio visual equipment to assist in group sessions. More private area for individual counseling and evaluations. An area to write reports would have been good to have. Cross training would help all members of the staff in case someone was unavailable. This would also help in not having to cancel sessions when a staff member could not make it to work. I found Phoenix Gate to be a very relaxing but yet organized place in which to provide services.

It's wonderful seeing how the children that live in the cottages are loved and given opportunities to excel.

The commitment this organization has to serving the children of Oklahoma, providing opportunities for each child in their care to develop skills and values necessary to be successful productive members of society is genuine.

Oklahoma Baptist Homes For Children Inc	171975	1	/users/profile/227667	Owasso	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/26/2013	I have been involved with the Baptist Children's Home for over 16 years.  I have seen first hand the positive difference the ministry is making in the lives of children and young people.  Staff are committed to providing a clean, safe, and loving home for children.  If a child is able to return home that is what OBHC wants.  If not, the ministry is there to provide "hope and homes".  The ministry does an exceptional job preparing young people to live out on their own.  The OBHC mission is to "help children become capable, caring, Christian adults".  Transitional living apartments have been built on all campuses and many OBHC alumni receive scholarship funds to attend a college or technical school if they choose.  Also, the Hope Pregnancy Centers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa have ministered to countless families and helped young mom's choose life for their babies.  Oklahoma Baptist Homes for Children is an exceptional organization and strives for excellence in ministry.

The more I know about Oklahoma Baptist Homes for Children and their ministries, the more impressed we are with their integrity and the love, acceptance & opportunities provided to the children in their care.  The children often come with tragic backgrounds of neglect and abuse, but at OBHC they are given loving care, encouragement, responsiblity, accountability and hope for a future.  I am thankful to be associated with this organization and recommend it to both those looking for help for children and those looking to make an impact in the lives of children in our community.

Oklahoma Baptist Homes For Children Inc	165106	2	/users/profile/219474	Tula	General Member of the Public	1	08/15/2013	There is political and religious indoctrination occurring a when 13 year old boy says he wont get into heaven unless he goes to Baptist church, President Obama is Satan reincarnated, and his spelling of his names Satan in Arabic and Hebrew. Just very sad that there are staff and clergy that are that bold to sabotage adoptions that don't fit their narrow minded view of a family.  There is also issue with the staff and caseworkers there interfering or sabotaging adoptions that are set up via OKDHS.

After 18 years of carrying around guilt and sorrow I am now truly set free in the Lord's forgiveness.  Now I am happy to be a volunteer at HOPE.  My days at HOPE are my best days of the week.  There is nothing like helping a woman think through her options in the midst of a crisis pregnancy.  All for the glory of God.  I can't believe I get to be a part of it all!!               
Oklahoma Baptist Homes For Children Inc	147918	1	/users/profile/195741	Nancy Reed	Donor	5	01/10/2013	I first became aware of OBHC when friends adopted a child from there. I heard about it occasionally. Then a former student went to work there and I heard more about it. That student wanted to do a fund raiser in our area and I became deeply involved. I am now totally committed to the organization. Other similar organizations, nationwide, use OBHC as their model. OBHC does a fantastic job of ministering to and taking care of the children in their charge. They make sure the children are loved, cared for, clothed, educated, and exposed to the gospel. The amazing thing is that OBHC does not charge anyone for all the services provided. I have spent time with the children involved and am amazed at the way they are cared for. My only problem is that I do not have enough income to donate more. Nancy

OBHC does not charge for any services they provide.  Every client is handled with confidentiality and in a non-judgemental; non-discriminatory manner.  Through my years as a volunteer I have witnessed lives changed in the men and women who come through the doors of Hope Pregnancy Center.  For some, it is the first time they can find hope and acceptance in the midst of an unplanned pregnancy.  It is wonderful to see joy on the face of a young woman who has just experienced an ultrasound and she sees her baby for the first time.  The volunteers are amazing as they walk with their clients through the pregnancy and often the parents will continue with the parenting education program that Hope Pregency Centers offer.  By attending  parenting classes for the first year of their child's life; parents earn the privilege of shopping for baby supplies in the center's baby boutique.  I am honored to be able to serve an organization that desires to encourage, affirm dignity and self-worth to the clients who seek our services every day.

There is so much compassion for animals. The Central OK Humane Staff and volunteers are not only doing an amazing thing by saving thousands of animals and placing them in forever homes, but also by serving and educating the community.

I have been impressed and pleased that the staff treats these scared little guys and gals with respect and love.  I could not be happier with what I have seen.  I support them as a volunteer, and also with my monetary charitable contributions each year.  That speaks volumes as there are a lot of charities out there to pick from, but I choose to support our Central OK Humane Society.  Please consider donating to help them save more lives of those who have no choice and no voice.  (I have also adopted one of my fosters).-Lisa
Oklahoma Humane Society	290281		/users/profile/380583	Caitlin10	Volunteer	5	05/18/2016	Adopted my dog Cosmo from Central Oklahoma Humane Society. All positive experiences! He had been returned by his previous family (as OK Humane is always willing to take back into their program animals adopted through them). I had the opportunity to foster him. After fostering 8 other dogs, he was the one I couldn't let go. The best part, he began my foster helper. I have continued to foster for other animals to get the chance to enter the program and find their forever home. Cosmo has made it his job to help the fosters learn how to be a dog! He helps me with socialization, appropriate behavior, etc. He couldn't have been a better fit for my home! Thankful for OK Humane and the work they do for our community, but most importantly, thankful they gave Cosmo his 3rd chance at a forever home where he found me.

Hope Ranch Inc	94515		/users/profile/109325	Hadleypaige16	Volunteer	5	07/27/2011	I have been a volunteer at Hope Ranch for the past three years; it has become like a second home to me. I love going and spending my time with the goats, the horses, and especially the kids. It is a great thing the Shelton's have started in the Ponca City community and I would love to see it exist and thrive for a long time to come. When I first started volunteering, I have to say I did not know that much about kids with special needs, the Shelton's taught me what to do and were always very helpful when I had a question. Now three years later, I find myself answering the questions asked by all the new volunteers. I pride myself in being able to make pretty much anyone smile, but when I go out there I realize that the kids make me smile as much as I do them. On the mornings I go out to volunteer in the summer I always wake up with a smile on my face because I am going to do what I love to do, teach kids about the love of horses, and how horses can help in so many different ways.  The love the Shelton's (and the horses) have for the kids is something special, and I would love to be a part of this organization for many years to come. I would recommend that everyone should come and visit Hope Ranch at least once to be able to feel the love and happiness that is shared there.
Hope Ranch Inc	94502		/users/profile/109302	Denise	Volunteer	5	07/27/2011	Hope Ranch is a wonderful place for young and old a like. The Ranch helps children gain confidence in all aspects of life. They learn responsiblities about the whole ranch:  feeding animals such as dogs, pigs, goats, donkeys, and horses. Grooming and care of horses adds to the delight of learning to ride the animals.  They also water plants and care for the fish in the fish pond.  All the activities help the child to grow and be a responsible person. It's a great ministry to the city and area of Ponca City, Ok.

This is a great way to help kids and I appreciate the hard work and dedication the people of Hope Ranch show.
Hope Ranch Inc	94463		/users/profile/109251	Good	Volunteer	5	07/27/2011	Horses never cease to amaze me.  They connect with the children and youth at Hope Ranch with a depth of understanding and patience in a miraculous way.  The children and youth learn to trust,  some have never known trust.  Confidence is gained where before obstacles hindered  their paths. Hope Ranch is a "Can Do" place not an "I Can't" place.  As a volunteer of four years I have been blessed to see this transpire.  Smiles are abound and the horses enjoy the Hope Ranch experience equally.  One morning Gallop, a favorite at Hope Ranch, was found standing at the hitching post, not haltered or tied, ready to enjoy her time with the kids.  When Gallop's eyes look in mine, we know our prupose in life.

Hope Ranch Inc	94312		/users/profile/109024	chelle	Client Served	5	07/25/2011	Kids and horses! Having both have always been a lifelong dream of mine. When I found I was unable to have children of my own, I was crushed. After several years of marriage, my husband and I decided to foster children in need. The plan was to help as many kids as we could in maybe 3 to 5 years. After 11 years of foster parenting, we  have adopted five wonderful children! My husband and I discovered we had a heart for children somewhere along the way. We met Dr. Darrel and Debbie Shelton at church. They also have hearts for children, and horses. When they first started Hope Ranch, I volunteered, and my two oldest children participated. Later, our third child participated.Hope Ranch provides one horse, with one volunteer for each child. Hope Ranch aslo teaches children about Christ, the Hope in Hope Ranch.  Our oldest, now 11, has ADHD, RAD, ODD, which makes focusing and staying on task very hard. We have noticed that since she has been going to the ranch, having one on one time with a volunteer, showing her how she can focus and follow-through has greatly improved her confidence in school and at home.  Our second child was timid, insecure, and 'flighty'. At age 9, she still has a 'blanky'. Although now that she has gained some confidence and matured quite a bit, as a direct result of participating at Hope Ranch, she only has her 'blanky' at night (she no longer carries it to school, or anywhere else in public). Our third child, age 8, is MR, ADHD, FASD... This child feared everything before participating at the ranch. We have watched her blossom into a more trusting, and less fearful child. She has even started to trust us and let us teach her how to ride a bike, and she is starting to get over her fear of water. With each year the girls participate at the ranch, they grow more confident in their abilities. Our third daughter has not only began to trust in people, but has trusted in Jesus as her personl Lord and Saviour!! I can't wait until my two youngest children are old enough to participate! 
Center for Children and Families, Inc.	87567		/users/profile/98281	dcsnell	Volunteer	5	04/27/2011	I have been volunteering for CCFI for 25 years and have always found the staff supportive of my work and of the children and families that come through their doors. My wife and I are extended families, meaning we do short-term child care and respite care mostly for single mothers or grandmothers (these days). We think there is nothing quite like this program in central Oklahoma, and it serves a great purpose in reducing tensions in single-parent households. CCFI is in its other programs too a beacon of information and hope to families who are struggling with economic and other issues.

Not only the ones of those who need services, but of those you can help with the giving and providing of services. It is an honor to live in a community with an agency that cares so much, does so much, and is making so much of a differance.

CCFIs staff and volunteers are some of the worlds most compassionate people, and they genuinely try their best to improve the lives of every client.  Each client is treated with respect and support.

This organization tires their best to help every family that comes to them. They know their names and backgrounds right off the top of their heads, which really impresses me.  It shows that this organization really cares and when we discuss the variety of situations going on in each family I'm always impressed that they care so much about help these families in need. It's a challenging environment for them as well and I congratulate this organization for doing its best to help as many families as possible and with great pride.

Center for Children and Families, Inc.	86546		/users/profile/96932	Gina B.	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	I volunteer for CCFI because I have seen what can happen when a family is broken and lost and then restored by this agency in less than six months.  I know that families that need a fresh start can get the encouragement they need to succeed from CCFI.  Families are able to learn in a safe and caring environment.  These parents are very brave to admit they need help and to seek this help.  CCFI gives them the confidence and knowledge needed to improve.  One of the smallest things this agency does is provide diapers to new families in need in our community.  This is such a small way of showing they care, but to the family that is hurting emotionally, it is an extreme gift.
Center for Children and Families, Inc.	86212		/users/profile/96414	Megan B.	Volunteer	5	04/18/2011	For the last 4 years, I have spent my Monday nights with the Center for Children & Families, Inc. at the Neighborhood Centers program. To say that it has positively impacted my life is an understatement. The people I've met, the kids I've spent countless hours with, and the programs CCFI has each year have all shaped me into the person I am today. My favorite aspect of volunteering is the mentoring relationships with the kids that we have built together over the last 4 years. I've been able to have meaningful conversations with kids and provide words of encouragement and affirmation on a weekly basis. I have to believe on some sort of level that this has helped each child move toward a greater grasp of their self-worth and self-efficacy. From playing on the playground to arts & crafts, Neighborhood Centers provides a consistent environment for children to play in the evening. The staff and volunteers year after year continue to blow me away with their positivity, work ethic, and compassionate hearts. There's a reason I've stayed with CCFI for 4 years and the only reason I will stop is when I move out of Norman. Even after I leave, I will continue to find ways to give back to this great organization. I've made it my mission to share my story with others and encourage them to volunteer with CCFI as well. My hope is that CCFI continues to see success as they strive to provide safe and caring environments for children and families.

As if being one of the oldest nonprofits in the area did not already speak for their success, CCFI is an organization that always stays true to their mission, constantly working to ensure that every boy and girl grows up safe, nurtured and loved.

Not only did I receive professional experience, but being allowed to work with the wonderful people who serve through this organization changed my life.   I began as a work study student and soon understood why this organization is necessary and so successful.  At CCFI every client was treated as an individual and their needs were what was important.  Each person that passed through those doors for whatever reason entered a place of compassion, honesty, and love.  I was able to see the differences client services made in the lives of children who had been abused and/or neglected.   
Voice of the Martyrs Inc	100695	13	/users/profile/124139	JMilor,	Donor	5	11/16/2011	VOM not only supplies food and shelter - they supply everything, and often risk their lives in dangerous countries that do not have religious freedom.  The world is rife with injustice and religious persecution that never makes it to the media - VOM is one of the few organizations in the world, reporting on human rights violations world wide, and fights against this injustice.
Voice of the Martyrs Inc	261721	18	/users/profile/350346	Bheki	Donor	1	10/05/2015	It seems that it has become necessary to review the reviewers.  I have a link which describes more irresponsible use of donations by V.O.M. and I have nixed this organization from my list.   They have built a new facility which is 2 stories and has a man-made lake.    There was nothing wrong with the former $90,000. offices.  One of their staff has an unlimited expense account.

Voice of the Martyrs Inc	115519	5	/users/profile/144203	Linda62	Donor	5	06/15/2012	This organization serves a niche filled by no other--persecuted Christians in other countries who are often forgotten by larger human rights organizations.  Jesus tells us to remember those in prisons and this is the best way to do that.  These are people who do not belong in prison at all.  The Western Church finds it uncomfortable to think about what is going on in other parts of the world, but Christ told us to face it and deal with it.  Many of us do not have the courage to do what these people are doing.  The least we can do is to support them financially and through our prayers.
Voice of the Martyrs Inc	113494	6	/users/profile/154436	Matthew Murray	Donor	5	06/01/2012	My conviction is to give aid to the children that have a parent in prison for being a Christian is one of the best places to invest in God's Kingdom. When a parent is imprisoned the society will treat their children and remaining parent in society as an outcast and refuse to help them in any way. The parent in prison is deeply concerned for there children out in society and this greatly adds to their afflictions because they can do nothing about it. So I recommend this VOM ministry to help the Children with parents in prison for being Christian.  This is a true way to serve Christ Jesus directly, because He said "If you have done it unto one of the least of these you have done it unto me. " Matthew 25

Voice of the Martyrs Inc	98030	7	/users/profile/115989	Vikki Bland	Donor	5	09/23/2011	I am sad to see VOM has not received a higher rating. This is a truly unique charity as it focuses in on an unplatable and fairly unmarketable need - providing relief for people persecuted for their Christian faith throughout the world. Many people may not realise just how many Christians are tortured, imprisoned and persecuted throughout the world on a daily basis. VOM works to be the 'voice' of these people and their families. It lobbies governments for prisoner release, provides financial aid to the victims of persecution, and to their families, and works tirelessly to raise awareness for the plight of persecuted Christians worldwide. Perhaps its rather unsual name is off-putting. But it is the right name. Hundreds of Christian lives are martyred daily throughout the world. Our family has supported VOM for many years. We rate their work highly, and will continue to support them no matter what their rating here. They are a real charity, making a real difference.
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	40846	10	/users/profile/41735	-Sarah	Client Served	5	05/26/2010	The National Uterine Fibroids Foundation (NUFF) has been a godsend to me, as a patient with severe uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are a disease which no one talks about, yet many women suffer from. It is most common in women of color and other minorities. Because it's a disease of the female reproductive system, it's difficult for people to talk about openly. Furthermore, most doctors aren't trained to treat fibroids.Uterine fibroids, while common, become a serious disease in some women. They can cause anemia, kidney failure, infertility, bladder obstruction, and severe pain.I am so fortunate that my husband discovered NUFF. My doctors weren't able to treat my fibroids effectively, and didn't know where to refer me. I was only 39 and had half my life ahead of me! My husband resorted to searching the internet, and found NUFF's online community. I honestly don't know what would have happened to me, had I not found the NUFF community.NUFF has empowered me, and countless other women, to educate myself, take control of my condition, and make an informed decision of treatment options. NUFF has empowered me to take my life back from this disease!I only wish NUFF -- and its founder Carla Dionne -- had a higher profile, so that more women could benefit from the unique service and community it provides. Please list NUFF in your "Great Nonprofits Top-Rated Women's Empowerment Nonprofits."
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	40109	8	/users/profile/41040	cmj7320	General Member of the Public	5	05/22/2010	This foundation has a website and sponsors a yahoo group for women seeking inforation on uterine fibroids. Many women, including myself, have been told by multiple doctors (usually their gynecologists) that their only options are hysterectomy or hormone shots.  Both of these options can have significant negative repecussions over the course of a woman's lifetime.  NUFF lets women know that less invasive treatment options exist.  This information empowered and encourages women to keep looking for the option that is most appropriate for them.  Without it, women are at risk for becoming yet another unecessary hysterectomy statistic.
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	39387	8	/users/profile/40347	victorianorton	Volunteer	5	05/18/2010	NUFF and the online support group founded by Carla Dionne inspired me to set up a similar group for German speaking women. I am British but live in Germany and suffered from debilitating symptoms caused by Uterine Fibroids for 16 years. NUFF and Carla have taught me so much about using online resources to do research and also about campaigning - and I have used these skills to help thousands of German speaking women in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	39294	10	/users/profile/40244	telluriantraveler	General Member of the Public	5	05/18/2010	I can't say enough about NUFF.  The organization epitomizes empowerment for women.  As others have already stated, there is no reason to give up your uterus because of a benign condition (fibroids) that can be treated with many options less radical and harmful than a hysterectomy.  NUFF gets the word out and connects women to share their experiences and knowledge and give each other support through their quest for appropriate treatment.  The yahoo group hosted by NUFF provides a moderated forum where only first hand information is shared and support is offered every step of one's way.
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	39289	10	/users/profile/40237	elmtree	General Member of the Public	5	05/18/2010	In 2008 I was diagnosed with numerous uterine fibroids and an enlarged uterus.  I was having serious symptoms which had crept up on me (the infamous "symptom creep").  My doctor offered me only a hysterectomy or injections of a drug (Lupron) with many known (negative) side effects.  Through the information and on-line dialogue (Yahoo list serve) which this organization provides, I learned about several other options and eventually chose one (embolization) which was more appropriate for me.  I continue to follow the dialogue to keep up with information on fibroids and their treatment.
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	39200	8	/users/profile/40153	kara2	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2010	This group helped me to avoid an unnecessary hysterectomy.  I learned that I had more options than those presented to me by my doctor.  I became informed, empowered, and confident in the choice that I ultimately made to remove my fibroids that were making me miserable.  Thanks to the group, I have my uterus, and my symptoms have greatly improved.
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	39156	1	/users/profile/40103	jlittle	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2010	Several months ago, after feeling lousy for quite some time and after a variety of doctors appointments to try to figure out what was causing my problems, I was diagnosed with uterine fibroids (benign tumors of the uterus).  Id never heard of fibroids before (even though I now know that many women have them!) and was shocked when my obgyn recommended hysterectomy as my treatment option.  At 48 and not yet experiencing menopausal symptoms the thought of a hysterectomy that might hasten my passage into menopause was not at all appealing.  I was also shocked by the attitudes of some with whom I spoke both inside and outside the medical community who very cavalierly said at 48 you dont need your uterus anymore so just have a hysterectomy.  This thinking was so counter-intuitive and upsetting to me.  As someone who believes that all our organs are intertwined and dependant on one another and serve a multitude of purposes for overall wellbeing, I felt surely there was a better way to deal with my fibroid problem.  I am grateful to be living in the age of the Internet and will be forever thankful to Carla Dionne for sharing her own journey through the fibroid maze (see http://www.uterinefibroids.com/) and for establishing the National Uterine Fibroid Foundation (NUFF.)  Through NUFF I was quickly directed to very informative web sites on fibroids and fibroid experts that gave me hope that I had other options other than hysterectomy.  More importantly, I joined the NUFF sponsored free online Yahoo Fibroid Support Group http://groups.yahoo.com/group/uterinefibroids that has proved to be an invaluable resource for me on so many fronts  from tips on how to deal with various fibroids symptoms, to insights on pros and cons of  various treatment options as well as recommendations on fibroid experts to see.  For any woman anywhere in the world confronting fibroids and how to treat them, joining this support group will be the best thing you can do to help yourself get the help, support and medical direction you need.  Thanks to NUFF and the online support group, Im happy to report that I recently underwent laparoscopic and hysteroscopic surgical removal of my fibroids under the care of an excellent fibroid specialist and am feeling better than I can ever remember!
National Uterine Fibroids Foundation	39102	2	/users/profile/40037	robindepaul	General Member of the Public	5	05/16/2010	I was shocked when my doctor suggested a hysterectomy. I was just diagnosed with uterine fibroids and came to him about the symptoms they were causing. I didn't even know what fibroids were! This was early 2000 and I was 42 years old with one daughter. I started my research about uterine fibroids and found Carla Dionne's book, "Sex, Lies, and the Truth about Uterine Fibroids, her group uterinefibroids@yahoo.com and the awesome organization NUFF. I read Carla's struggle with the medical communities ignorance about the inclusive role of a women's uterus beyond child bearing and the roles hormones play in our stability as humans. On the yahoo groups page I read daily of hundreds of womens struggles from around the world on how they were introduced to this condition and ultimately their medical professionals always choose hysterectomy first. Not because it was the best for the woman but because it was the easiest for them to perform. I learned that fibroids are begnin and I could wait to see if I could live with them. Eight years later I realized I had enough of the creeping symptoms; bulk in my abdomen, trouble breathing, GERT, incontinence and tired of being asked when the baby was due. I had stayed on Carla's uterinefibroid site and followed NUFF for those 8 years and was fully informed and capable by now to chose the doctor and the procedure of my choice that was best for me. Without NUFF and uterinefibroids@yahoo.com I would have been wandering in the wilderness. I chose, at 50 yrs, to have a myomectomy and preserve my uterus. It has been 2 years now and I am living life again! I am fibroid free and feel like a young vivacious woman again in all aspects. If it wasn't for NUFF and Carla's passion  for the truth thousands, no-millions of women would be lost, scared, and succumbed to the unneccesary hysterectomy and the whole other host of troubles that come with that. Thank you NUFF for saving my quality of life. Thank you Carla Dionne for your tireless passion.

People are anxious to tell you (as a volunteer) about their experiences and childhoods and how "my grandparents made the run and loved to tell all about it."  The museum is great and getting even better, and we couldn't have a better staff of folks who so involved with and caring for our museum!

Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center Inc	99644		/users/profile/120338	knoxmanor	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2011	As a citizen of Enid and a preservationist, I view the Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center has one of the greatest assets in the State of Oklahoma.  The Center provides guests an opportunity to share in the rich regional history of pioneers throughout the years (Past and Present); indivdiuals, who came to Oklahoma to built their homes, grow their businesses, and live their lifes.  The story the Center tells is one of our nation's and state's growth from before statehood until today.  The Regional Heritiage Center is both a history and a research center that should be included on everyone's bucket list of places to visit.  I invite every to come to Enid to share the Northwest Oklahoma experience (past, present, future).          
Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center Inc	99424		/users/profile/119441	heyhelm	Board Member	5	10/18/2011	The Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center is a gem. This museum tells the stories of those who settled this area after the Great Land Run, plus it teaches leadership lessons which are still relevant to business leaders today. The Center is a dynamic community organization with a full calendar of brown bag luncheons, family events and traveling exhibits. Beautiful exhibits, interesting artifacts, knowledgable staff and a completely remodeled "campus" make this someplace to add to your "to do" list for sure.
Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center Inc	99420		/users/profile/119427	George23	Donor	5	10/18/2011	This is a museum our "personal history".  Everybody in North and Northwest Oklahoma knows somebody that is featured in one or some of the exhibits.  Our history started in 1893 with those who "made the Run".  The Native's history was far earlier, and we are each represented in intimate detail that allows us to appreciate those who were here before us.   A "Window to Our Past" has to be experienced to be appreciated.

They are a pillar within our Tulsa community, and they have such a heart for our city's youth.  Our family met Jerry Jacobson and his team  through baseball  lessons and we were immediately impressed and moved by how this group donates  their time and resources to kids.  They sponsor several overseas mission trips each year.   So their impact in children's lives is much broader than just our city.  Jerry and his team are  truly a quality group.

After spending time at the facility and getting to know Jerry Jacobson, we learned that his true vision was to reach at risk youth through baseball.  My family and I have had many opportunities to volunteer our time and be a part of Jerry's outreach to kids in the Tulsa area.  We have found that when we volunteer to be a blessing to others, we usually end up being blessed ourselves.

World Baseball Outreach Inc	79599		/users/profile/86929	SoonerVIC	Advisor	5	02/28/2011	WBO changes lives of at risk youth by offering faith based encouragement and mentoring through the sport of baseball and softball. Upon my first experience in volunteering to help WBO with providing a Christmas party for a Boy's home, I witnessed the joy the boys there received by the events of the party (games, food, gift bags, testimony, etc.).  One experience it all it took to convince me how WBO's programs positively affect these at risk youth, offering them hope for the future. WBO also receives new and gently used baseball and softball equipment and distributes it to under-served youth in south central US and to international locations.  WBO also provides baseball and softball equipment for groups going on mission trips when requested. WBO also provides equipment and limited financial support to baseball academies in Brazil and the Dominican Republic. WBO would be able to offer programs to SO many more persons if it were able to receive more funding from like minded foundations, businesses and individuals.  For what they do, no gift is to small to make a difference in at least one life.
World Baseball Outreach Inc	72542		/users/profile/79303	Eric E.	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	WBO is an amazing organization.  It is so neat to see the intentionality of Jerry Jacobson and the other people involved: everything they do has a bigger meaning.  They have reached so many kids through baseball, and it is obvious their ministry is growing every day.  For them, baseball is an opportunity to share something bigger with kids, namely the gospel of Jesus Christ.  The coaches are truly interested in young players growth as both athletes and as men and women of character.  WBO's global outreach has touched literally thousands of lives, and the numbers are growing daily.

The staff had been dedicated to helping him develope into a productive person. They redirect him at the time it is needed. They've helped him feel better about himself and I am truly grateful for them being there for me. There is no other place in Tulsa that will take these kids. Most of these kids are kicked out of typical child care centers because the centers don't know how to deal with the kids challanges. Special Kids is always sending staff for training in ways to cope and handle different types of special challanges so they can care for these children in a meaningful way that will not only help the child but also the parents. Special Kids are not only there for the child but also for the parents. They are family oriented. They helped me understand my childs needs when I had no clue. They helped me through some very difficult times. I am a single grandparent raising a special needs child and there is no way I could have made it this far without all their help. However they can't pay their staff what they are worth, the funding just isn't available. Staff is dedicated to this cause. They need more space and more funding in order to better serve their clientel.

The staff is well trained, and probably underpaid for the caring service they provide.  I have observed their one on one interaction with the children and it is very impressive.  These children are well instructed, well fed, and lovingly cared for. The founder, began with almost nothing, but she perservered in her dream, her calling, and yes, a ministry to not only the children but to their families.  It requires a very special person for these children and the staff at Special Kids fills that requirement.  If, I had a son or daughter with special needs, that would be by far first choice.  It is certainly a five star facility.

Thank you to all the amazing volunteers and donors who help us provide pet food to these pets and the people who love them.
Pet Food Pantry Of Oklahoma City Inc	226717	1	/users/profile/290450	Ray_21	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2014	I have watched this non-profit grow from its birth.  It has developed into a very focused and well executed organization that serves those that many times make a decision to sacrifice their own well being to keep their pet (always as close as any family member) fed.  This is such a healthy and much needed service for the elderly and homeless folks of our city.  Its volunteers keep expenses almost to nothing so all donations can go to serve their clients.  This has been a passion for the founder for many years, and now she is able to make a difference is so many lives that truly need the help, serving a client base that gets so badly overlooked.

Pet Food Pantry Of Oklahoma City Inc	219339	1	/users/profile/282963	Keeslover	Board Member	5	10/02/2014	Pet Food Pantry is a certified 503c nonprofit organization that strives to help people keep beloved pets in their home by serving as a food bank for animals. We provide not only food, but also supplies and emergency medical care items to low-income seniors, homeless and veterans. We also are the suppliers of animal food during any disaster in the Oklahoma City area. The ultimate goal of the Pantry is to reduce the rapidly growing rate of animal surrenders to local shelters or the outright abandonment of pets due to financial strain. We help over a 100 seniors every month plus take food to homeless areas and churches to give out. For a senior their animal is their only friend and family. We have seen them give up their own food and money for medicine to help their animal. That is why this organization was started. We were also in Moore right after the tornado went through bringing hundreds of bags of food and we continued to help Little Axe into 2014. We depend totally on donations.  Our website is www.petfoodpantryokc.org   Please find it in your heart to help a senior hold on to their best friend by donating to the Pet Food Pantry of OKC!

CAP utilizes a two-generation approach to help low-income families break the cycle of poverty, through early childhood education and parental programing. Volunteering with these children and their families is engaging, rewarding, and fulfilling. Data and reviews show that CAP programs are not only enriching, but effective.

That's true.  Love Link Ministries mobilizes a lot of volunteers to accomplish it's mission of meeting needs and helped people experience life transformation.  It recently has brought back to life an historic old building that had fallen into disuse.
Love Link Ministries Inc	62892	1	/users/profile/68768	bekahboone	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	My name is Rebekah Boone and I used to volunteer at, FirstIndian Church. I helped with the After School Programs and lead my own small group on Thursdays. I also helped with Quizzing whenever I could get a chance. Volunteering at this church has helped my understand my own relationship with God as well with others. I do not volunteer anymore, instead I am just another attendee. I do, however, try to inform people about First Indian and how they can help out this church or the community around them. Volunteering had helped me a lot with my life. I try to get people to volunteer as well because I know they will love it. I know I did.

My church in Texas came up and did alot of different things that they needed help with. We went there for two summers. Then when I moved up here to go to school my church goes on the last Sunday of every month. They were very well organized and I think that the people that go there for help are showed alot of love and when they need something there is something all ways there.

The students are able to see exactly what their donations have added to our school.   Because of the visibility of Bodine HSA 's successes, (new track, lighted sign, brick planter around the sign, new outdoor basketball goals) the students are eager to work toward the next project, new playground "big toy".   The families in the neighborhood are also now using the track and basketball goals outside of school hours and seem to be taking pride and ownership in our school grounds.  We hope these projects will instill in our school community members a deeper connection to our school and their children's education.

Aim High Academy Inc	198193		/users/profile/258886	Lin Patterson	Board Member	5	04/17/2014	I have watched the love shared between coaches and students at many practices and competitions, and I can attest to the fact that a picture is worth a thousand words. Seeing an excited smile on the face of a student being hugged by a Christian coach is quite a picture as well as a statement. That coach and student both realized that a challenge had been overcome by hard work, discipline, and a focused commitment practiced for many hours in a loving and supportive environment. Many life lessons were learned. Aside from the pure joy experienced, that student was developing a healthy self-esteem and confidence that any dream is attainable, both in and out of the gym. I am thankful that Aim High Academy teaches its students that prayer and faith combined with effort and desire can result in spiritual and physical success that glorifies the Creator who has a plan for each student's life.

Aim High is a safe place and there is a lot of love and laughter that accompanies the hard work and dedication of the young people that participate. It is a privilege to be involved with this organization.
Aim High Academy Inc	196404	1	/users/profile/256724	SoonerGal	Volunteer	5	03/25/2014	As a volunteer for several years, I have watched as this organization has grown to where it currently serves around 300 children in one or more weekly classes. It has amazed me to see the development of such a quality program, which now offers homework help, mentoring, dance lessons, and fitness programs for the students and their extended families.  I have observed the enthusiasm of the children as they enter this place where they receive love and encouragement from their coaches and teachers. To watch them progress not only in their gymnastics skills but also in their confidence is heart-warming. The self-esteem the students gain from the sport of gymnastics is invaluable. I have watched joy as the children learn to set goals and reach them, and I have seen students learn a valuable lesson as they realize that hard work produces a great result. Discipline is another lesson that gymnastics teaches; I love to watch the two- and three-year-olds as they learn to sit on their star as they wait their turn (patience is such a hard thing for young ones).  Loving and caring about one another is modeled by the coaches and teachers as they seek to show God's love to each child. At Aim High Academy, each child learns that "God made him/her special."

Jennifer and her team are incredible people who are focused on building character and athletic skills in the youth. I loved watching my daughter's grow their faith while learning to improve their abilities as gymnasts. As a former college athlete myself, I particularly appreciate the fact that Aim High does not sacrifice quality just because it's a non-profit organization. I highly recommend Aim High for anyone seeking to help their youth grow physically and spiritually!

The class was structured in a way that the teens split up into two different groups to work together to prepare what they were going to make.  At the end they got to eat the food they made.  This learning experience helps to build confidence in teenagers cooking ability and to improve on team skills.

We were looking to do events that would assist the youth in learning skills that would assist them in being more successful at independence when they became adults. Youth Services volunteered the use of their facilities, particularly their fully functional kitchen for the events. The kitchen was well stocked with all the utensils necessary for the event as well as two complete kitchen set ups so that more children could benefit at once. I am grateful for the willingness to help of this organization. Could not have done it without them!

New Hope Oklahoma	320285		/users/profile/412619	Writer	Board Member	5	12/19/2016	New Hope provides help to kids who, through no fault of their own, are disadvantaged due to having an incarcerated parent.  The terrific staff and volunteers make a big impact on these kids through the numerous programs offered by New Hope.  It is easy to see the very special relationship that has been formed with these kids in helping them realize that they can rise above their circumstances and have bright futures, truly carrying out the mission of "Ending Generational Incarceration, One Child at a Time".   
New Hope Oklahoma	319934		/users/profile/411873	JWells	Board Member	5	12/07/2016	New Hope is a place where kids who have many difficulties in life can still be a kid. I've seen children's faces light up as they're receiving a gift or playing games with other kids.  It's a safe place that encourages people and gives them hope. You'll hear children talking about their future with plans for college and becoming doctors.  It's inspirational!
New Hope Oklahoma	319713		/users/profile/411511	CLindsay	Volunteer	5	12/02/2016	New Hope is an organization helping children of parents who are incarcerated.  I have been an active volunteer with both of my daughters for 3 years.  Watching the impact the staff and volunteers make on the lives of these children on a daily basis has been incredible .....The roles they play as mentors, teachers and counselors lift these kids up to realize new goals, tackle new challenges in different ways and look at life from a long-term perspective rather than seeing their future as a dead-end street.  New Hope sees them through high school and connects them to organizations who mentor them through college.  Statistics rate Oklahoma as #1 for incarcerating women - with 1 of every 6 children following in their parents footsteps.  The answer is intervention.  These kids get on the right track - succeeding in life beyond high school.  My family has been forever changed watching the impact New Hope has on these kids.  I am consistently amazed at what they are able to accomplish.  
New Hope Oklahoma	319651		/users/profile/411403	cdryke	Donor	5	11/30/2016	New Hope serves Oklahoma children ages 5-18 who have/have had a parent incarcerated. These children have experienced a serious loss and childhood trauma, yet few agencies exist to serve them specifically. New Hope provides a wide variety of programs, including summer camps, after-school programs, holiday parties, tutoring, and case management services, in order to connect with the child on multiple levels, and remain a consistent source of support in their lives.  Their staff is dedicated and caring, and focused on investing in the children at every step.

Dogs As Family Inc	257467	3	/users/profile/345898	Tarajlee14	Client Served	5	09/15/2015	We adopted our doggy Kiya from this organization. It was the best experience we've had adopting any pet. Brenda took the time to come to our home for us to meet the her and the dog. We were able to see how the dog was in our environment and make sure it was a good fit for all of us. The dog was a great fit so e kept her and Brenda emailed us about a week later to check on her, which showed me that she really cares. Something else that showed me how much this organization cares for its pets is that they micro chip as well as spay/neuter & get up to date on vaccinations and preventatives before the pet is adoptable. Most pet owners want to chip but just don't get around to it. I like that they take the initiative to ensure that their rescue dogs can be identified if ever lost again. They really are doing great things for rescued dogs.

Dogs As Family Inc	246900	3	/users/profile/334355	sccrchik20	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	I have been a foster parent for Dogs As Family, Inc. for many years (since it was established).  I had previously volunteered with other rescue groups, but I feel Dogs As Family is so much different in how they operate.  Every dog or puppy is seen as an individual, not just a number to try to get our adoption numbers up, which seems to be the main focus of other groups.  Each dog that comes to us, comes with their own unique quirks and background.  Brenda is great at knowing what special treatment or situation each one needs.  I've never known her to turn away a dog simply because it would cost to much to fix due to needed surgery or other issues. It is a great thing to be able to witness a foster dog being united with their forever families.  Since we know every quirk and personality trait of our dogs, we are really able to adopt them to families that are great matches!  The best thing about this group (as indicated in the name) is that dogs are seen and adopted out as true family members, not just dogs.  Every dog receives so much love and eventually finds its new loving family.
Dogs As Family Inc	236464	3	/users/profile/320379	Jenni6	Volunteer	5	01/07/2015	I've been volunteering for this nonprofit for over a year and enjoy it so much. I've learned so much about dog behavior, psychology and matching potential owners with dogs. Brenda the President is very knowledgeable about trapping homeless dogs and looked upon within the rescue community as the best trapper in Oklahoma City. This is a small foster based rescue that is extremely thankful for all help they are given from donations to volunteers. I've always wanted to be involved in a animal rescue but never found a place that I felt encouraged me to learn and be a part of their organization until I met Brenda and her volunteers. If you are looking for a great organization, I encourage you to join this one. 
Hope House Of Mcalester Inc	191967	2	/users/profile/250581	greatintheory	Client Served	1	01/02/2014	The Hope House is a great concept, but the majority of the current staff fall extremely short in actually providing the much needed services that are promised to the clients and advertised to the community. The DIRECTOR, COORDINATOR, and CASE MANAGER  go out of their way to belittle, berate, humiliate, and dehumanize the clients. All three also participate in gossip with clients regarding other housemates. On SEVERAL different occasions I have witnessed the coordinator withhold physician prescribed medications from clients for reasons as simple as being one minute late to the window, and even the coordinator herself coming in late. This means 'Med time' has come and gone, absolutely none of the clients received there medications, and were consequently told 'too bad'. The hope house is constantly requesting funds from the public to improve programs and toiletries clothing cleaning supllies etc yet these things are never actually bought they are also donated.

Needs vary greatly amoung those who request help, and each individual is treated with dignity and respect.  No need is too small for the staff to try to provide.

With the support of local organizations and churches each client is given training and direction to take care of themselves.   In the current economic situation - life is hard.

The work of the house parents and other staff members is nothing short of inspirational. They are changing lives -- not just the lives of the boys but of everyone who visits.  The Goodland staff have always made us feel welcomed and appreciated. Our trips have been a mixture of hard work and fun. I truly consider it a privilege to be able to contribute in a small way to the wonderful things happening at Goodland!
Goodland Inc	132543	1	/users/profile/178183	Christine52	Board Member	5	11/01/2012	My involvement with Goodland began well over 20 years ago.  Now, I warn people not to visit unless they want to fall in love.  One of the most important elements that Goodland possesses is that all the boys who attend are placed with two parent families on campus.  For many it is the first time they have had the influence of a classic nuclear family.  They attend church together, have family celebrations, work on homework and housework, and get support, love, discipline, and a promising future.  Goodland has been a haven for 100s and 100s of children. There are so many more good boys with, literally, nowhere to go. Originally, a mission, orphanage, and boarding school for Choctaw and Chickasaw at the end of the Trail of Tears, Goodland survives and thrives.  The philosophy and practice are years beyond most children's homes and even beyond many residential education facilities with many more resources.  I have never been anything but supremely proud of the efforts and RESULTS at this historical gem of a school and mission and family.  We honor the past but with a clear vision for the future.

I was so impressed with the love, care, educational and religious training that the boys received  I began contributing to their needs and eventually became a Board Member. The Good land Academy is the oldest instituion in the State of Oklahoma being 165 years old. I have witnessed boys having a complete turn around in their lives by growing up in Goodland. Many boys return annually to their "home" for the reunion. Their education speaks for itself as not only most of the boys become Eagle Scouts but go on to coollege on schoarships.

The case histories of successful mentoring and growth are impressive and the resulting lives are a testimony to the work accomplished by this organization. It is also impressive to attend alumni events to hear of the loyalty and emotional attachments held by graduates who are now 60 or more years of age. This facility has a long term record and a history as perhaps the oldest such facility in the state of Oklahoma.  Quality and performance are the true mesure of an organizations success and Goodland is unmatched. 
Honoring Americas Warriors Inc	259944		/users/profile/348473	jackdaniel	General Member of the Public	1	09/27/2015	I am very familiar with the "situation" of which mrcc speaks. This "founding" board member is aggravating an already explosive situation, with both KNOWLEDGE and MALICE. As far as I'm concerned, he has no business claiming that he "helps" veterans. He's complicit in the slander against and defamation of character of one of the BEST and most impressive soldiers I have the pleasure of knowing. The soldier slandered in these posts has more integrity and honor in his little finger than this board member/Facebook administrator has in his entire body. Take that one to the bank. I too am advising legal action be taken immediately. there are plenty of grounds here. This is just sickening.
Honoring Americas Warriors Inc	259865	2	/users/profile/348390	TerryHaney	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/26/2015	Journal Installment #4Army veteran Jimmy Crumling has an incredible story of overcoming substance abuse, and getting his life back on track. Over the coming weeks Jimmy will share his story about the dark side of what he has been through, and the people that have made a positive influence in his recovery. Jimmy served 22 years in the Louisiana Army National Guard 11B/M. 2 deployments 2004/05 & 2010 both in Iraq. Also worked with at risk youth as a cadre at The Louisiana Army National guard youth challenge program (YCP) in Carville, LA from 2001-03 & 2007-13. If you're a veteran dealing with addiction please reach out to us at www.honoringamericaswarriors.org. August 24, 2014I finally heard from my guard captain and he told me he was coming to OKC to bring my retirement papers help me fill the out and personally bring them back to the unit. This is the only thing he did for me. Looking back on it I think he did this just to say look at me I did this. When I asked him about my truck, my National Guard gear and my dog, he mentioned nothing about tough love or you started using again. All the captain did was laugh and say he had been so busy with his retirement from the National Guard and told me now that he is retired now and he he can focus 100% on getting my truck and National Guard gear turned in. As you all know that NEVER happened. That was a very hard pill to swallow. Its funny how everyone talks about responsibility for your actions until it applies to them. They can blame retirement, too busy or TURN it around and blame me then call it tough LOVE to cover their laziness, lack of responsibility, or lack of integrity.There was a lady at the nonprofit that was pushing me to get treatment. I kept saying I got this. She was always 100% honest with me and that was a huge reason I never gave up. She was a country girl from Woodward, Oklahoma and didn't sugar coat anything but at the same time she let me figure things out on my own. I hadnt been out of the Army very long, and I am a hard headed person. I kept thinking I could do it all on my own, I was wrong. So she told me about a week long event in Dry Gultch, OK Called warrior reconnect winning with integrity lead by Dave Roever, a Vietnam veteran who has a program helping wounded warriors find their way home. WOW, what an amazing week of hope. It gave me sense of value and made me realize I could help veterans and this would help me also. They found me a place to stay and a couple other guys who were keeping tabs on me helped me move in to this place. When they saw the place, they werent very happy, but it was better than where I had been staying. It was with another veteran who was also a user. I had to sign a contract not to bring or use drugs and had to go to at least one NA meeting a week. How ironic is that? Things seemed great, as it turns out, recovery would still have to wait several months. Ugh.
Honoring Americas Warriors Inc	259834	1	/users/profile/348361	mrcc	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/26/2015	Unfortunately, I do not have a positive review to give this organization. The administrator of the Facebook page, a founding member no less, posted some very harsh and untrue criticisms and accusations against a family member, along with my family member's NAME. When I contacted the organization to explain that my family has been receiving threats related to these posts, asking that the posts be removed immediately, this founding member's response to me was incredibly offensive and frightening-- he basically said that my family member deserves all of the threats he is receiving. I have sent my complaints to other board members, with no response from anyone. Honoring America's Warriors may be doing good works in other areas, but I am beyond disgusted at how this potentially dangerous situation, involving THREATS against and harrassment of my family, is being fueled and condoned by a board member.  Update: Terry Haney's subsequent "review" is exactly what I have come to expect from this organization. It is a juvenile lashing out at my honest review, of which I have all documentation to prove. Terry's "review" is one of the posts in question, although not the one naming my family member. Terry, you have gotten caught up in something you don't understand, you are simply proving my point. We have received documented THREATS based on this post and others, and you are listening to a board member, egging you on to mock fun at the situation. Shameful and disgusting.

Hope Academy Emp	122041		/users/profile/166137	Godis1	Volunteer	5	09/07/2012	Director Debbie McCullough of Tulsa Hope Academy provides exceptional, enthusiastic leadership which shines through to the students and staff.  The school fills the void lacking in the public school system in which so many students 'fall through the cracks'.  Every city in America needs a school like Tulsa Hope Academy where the students are cared about and have a 95 % graduation rate compared to 50% in public schools.  I've been honored to be a part of THA!
Hope Academy Emp	41722	10	/users/profile/42514	ron-d	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/29/2010	For the last few years I have been interfacing with Debbie McCullough and Tulsa Hope Academy, by providing them with a wonderful online curriculum resource. I am amazed and so pleased to see how committed and passionate Debbie and her staff are towards their students. Tulsa Hope Academy is a huge blessing to these at-risk students, and I wish them much future success.
Hope Academy Emp	41267	8	/users/profile/42120	donor2	Donor	5	05/27/2010	I have been a supporter of Tulsa Hope Academy since it's inception in 2005.  It's founder, Debbie McCullough, began this school in the living room of her home, when she found that public schools do not work hard to retain students who are not high performers academically. She worked with these first students to find out what kind of learners they were and found adaptive certified curriculum to help these students fulfill their credits needed to graduate high school.  Her population of students shifted dramatically, so that she now serves primarily underprivileged minority students.  I am always delighted with her "success stories", the lives of both male and female students, but I have had the pleasure of personally helping a few of the female students acquire clothes to go to job interviews and to listen and pray with them as they go through rough times on the road to graduation and on into tewch school or college.
Hope Academy Emp	41184	13	/users/profile/42063	tl1	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/27/2010	Tulsa Hope Academy is most ably and enthusiastically run by Debbie McCullough. The school develops the cognitive skills of its students while also instilling prosocial values and ethics. The school appears to measure its success based on the distance students travel academically, socially, emotionally and spiritually rather than merely applying arbitrary and conflicting governmental standards.Tulsa Hope Academy graduates are literally filled with hope. I commend Ms. McCullough and her staff in doing such substantive work with their charges.

Heavens Gateway Horse Rescue & Teaching Center Inc	173379	3	/users/profile/229520	MaryRose M.	Client Served	5	10/04/2013	My home was destroyed in the May 19th tornado. Of all the things I lost my cat, Toby and my daughter's dog, Sophie were the only things I cared about.  I knew Toby and Sophie survived they had been seen repeatedly. Sophie was adopted by a first responder and his family because I had no place to keep her. The days, weeks, and months went by with sightings and almost catchings of my beloved little black Toby cat, who had shown up at my house in October of 2012 emaciated,cold, and very feral. I finally earned his trust after almost a week of him hiding under my bed only coming out at night when I was asleep. Toby trusted me and only me. If someone knocked on my door he hid, if someone opened the door he hid, but if I went outside he would go window to windows crying until he could see me. He was my baby! We searched high  and low after the tornado but he was just too scared and was having too much fun (he was unaltered). When I met becca and ash I told them about Toby and they started setting live traps  to catch him and worked day and night on finding my cat and many other animals that were displaced by the tornado. I had started to lose hope that my sweet boy would ever come home. Nearly 3 months after the tornado on August 18 I got a phone call that Toby had been caught! I raced home, locked the trap and I in a small room in my new home talked to him,cried, and apologized for leaving him at home that awful day in May! He just loved on me purring and relaxing into the place he belonged, in my arms and fell asleep. I am forever indebted to No Kill Rapid Emergency Response. They never gave up hope that they would catch him and get him home to his mommy who missed him fiercely! I can never repay them for their hard work and the amazing gift of getting my baby boy back where he belongs!

Institute for Environmental Innovation	147052		/users/profile/194192	I4EI	Board Member	5	12/20/2012	As the outgoing Chairman of the Board of Directors of I4EI, I am delighted to have this opportunity to tell others what a great organization it is. I have been associated with I4EI's work for close to a decade, and I can vouch for the hard work, dedication and sincerity of the staff and my colleagues on the Board. The work that I4EI supports includes tree planting, conservation farming, enhanced local food production, education on HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, fuel-efficient stove construction, sustainable fuel use, and the empowerment of women. The TIST program that I4EI supports has resulted in millions of trees being planted and maintained that would otherwise not exist, and to date has sequested hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon, with much more to come. TIST helps mitigate global climate change and has engaged more than 60,000 subsistence farmers in India, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Though leaving my role on the Board, I will continue to support I4EI's vital work that truly spans local to global sustainable development.

Institute for Environmental Innovation	124308	1	/users/profile/169142	selph	Board Member	5	10/02/2012	As a strong environmentalist with great concern about the future of our planet for our children and our children's children, I have become involved with  The Institute for Environmental Innovation.  Their work has helped thousands of families that would have gone hungry learn conservation farming techniques helping alleviate hunger in many villages in the third world countries.  After hearing of grandparents willing to starve so their grandchildren could eat I became a strong believer in their work.   In addition the carbon credit exchanges involved help the whole world to be a healthier place for us all to live.  Trees are being grown in places that were barren and families are being fed as they learn conservation farming techniques.  The gender equity requirement for small groups participating in this program is a plus.  Women and men are valued and trained in techniques that build villages stong in relationships and ability to grow crops.   The result of hundreds of trees being planted and surviving helps us all.
Oklahomans For Equality Inc	200173	1	/users/profile/261311	tanukichan	Volunteer	5	05/13/2014	I have been volunteering at the Dennis R. Neill Equality Center since January of 2014.  I have fifty plus hours and am currently a student in social work.  As a Tulsa native, I was surprised and enlightened to learn about all the programs the Equality Center offers the entire community, as well as proud to discover that Oklahomans for Equality operates the 5th largest LGBTQIA community center in the world.  Even more impressive is that the Center has only three full time employees.  Their dedication, vision and determination has created the great center we currently have today.  This is the best example of a non-profit in Tulsa born from a truly "grassroots effort."  The Equality Center continues to thrive and grow with more than two hundred volunteers, in large part due to the grassroots spirit.  Volunteering at the Equality Center is an honor and privilege.  
Oklahomans For Equality Inc	162473	2	/users/profile/215649	z00my	Volunteer	1	07/12/2013	As a volunteer I was beyond disappointed with the lack of leadership ability and the lack of organization in most areas.

Oklahoma Community-Based Providers Inc	61363		/users/profile/66977	jgrigsba	Professional with expertise in this field	4	01/27/2011	Opportunity Center, Inc. is a non-profit agency located in Ponca City, Oklahoma.  We provide both residential and vocational services to over 75 individuals with developmental disabilities.  We are pleased and proud to be a member of Oklahoma Community-Based Providers, Inc.  OCP serves our agency, and our clients, as a source of information, advocate, advisor, and friend. OCP helps  keep us informed of pending legislation and happenings at the state and federal level that will affect agencies such as Opportunity Center, Inc.  They assist us in learning about policy changes, and advise us on how to implement those changes.  OCP serves as a voice for member agencies, a liaison with other member agencies, as well as DHS, DDSD, and the legislature.  They are strong advocates for people with developmental disabilities.  If it affects our clients, OCP is involved and on their side, effectively giving people with disabilities a strong voice in Oklahoma. OCP provides many valuable services to our agency and still manages to keep their dues structure to a level small agencies such as ours can afford.  They are very deserving of the $5,000 prize.  Without OCP, many small agencies such as Opportunity Center, would have had no choice but to close their doors last year due to proposed budget cuts in our state.  Thankfully, OCP was there to unite agencies and organize pressure on our legislative leaders.  As a result, many of the proposed cuts were not implemented, and agencies continued to be able to provide much needed services to people with developmental disabilities in Oklahoma.  We are rumored to be facing significant budget cuts again this year.  The $5,000 prize would give them additional resources and allow them to expand their efforts to see services continue at the level needed and would help them to accomplish their mission of advocacy for people with developmental disabilities and the agencies that support them. Thank you for your consideration of OCP, Inc.

We have access to provide input to policy issues that affect us and to provide feedback to improve the process as we go along.

On The Right Trail Horse Rescue Inc	203170	2	/users/profile/265001	CalabriaFarms	Volunteer	5	06/18/2014	I previously operated this rescue for approx. 10 years, when it was Angel Horse Rescue, Inc. prior to it becoming On the Right Trail Horse Rescue in 2013.  The location of the rescue is in Nowata, Oklahoma, where many of the rescue horses are housed, however, they also utilize several foster homes throughout the area to help shelter and care for the rescue horses in order to be able to save even more horses.  These people foster the horses out of sincere compassion for the horse and generously provide feed and care for the horses they agree to take in. I am one of the foster homes and have several of the rescue horses on my private property. I believe it is my personal facility that the one negative reviewer was referring to.  She does not live 1/4 mile from the rescue location, she lives 1/4 mile from my personal property.  I have 21 horses on my 64 acre property, counting my personal horses (many that were once rescues) and the rescue horses I am currently fostering.  Unfortunately, it is a personal vendetta against myself rather than anything that the rescue organization has done, but she continues in her attempts to damage the rescue, and consequently, the welfare of the rescued horses, knowing how much I care about the horses.  That is her way of "punishing" me for having what she believes is a nicer barn and facilities than she does.  In her opinion, its not fair that some people have nicer things than others, regardless of how hard those people may have worked to get what they have.  I do NOT receive any compensation from the rescue organization for the horses that I am fostering.  My agreement with them is that I provide the care, food and shelter for those horses and that is my choice to do so with my own funds, because I am blessed and fortunate enough right now that I can afford it.  I just felt that I should help clarify the negative review so that anyone that saw it, would not let it reflect badly on the rescue organization and realize it is just a personal, petty jealousy against another person, not the organization.

I do not believe this is a true rescue.  I would not donate to them and advise anyone to think carefully before donating.

It was started by Tarah Warren, a stage IV ovarian cancer survivor, who saw the need in other cancer patients needing treatment to know someone cared and was thinking of them.  It started as a simple gesture of giving bags of encouragement to meet physical needs.  Things like tea, mints, crossword puzzles, protein bars, hand sanatizer were originally in the bags.  Over the last two years, not only does this foundation offer care packs, but brave shaves and gas and meal cards.  In my opionion, they are creating a tenaciously teal lifestyle-to fight like a girl, and don't let cancer steal your thunder!

There have been countless people who would have gone hungry that found hope and food at Christs Food Center. I love working there and seeing the love.

A Chor Ministries Inc A Door Of Hope	39121	7	/users/profile/40067	deborah-harris	Client Served	5	05/16/2010	Hi, My name is Debbie and I came to "A Door of Hope" in January 2010. I didn't have a place to live and a friend introduced me to Rev. Brosha Gattenby who has a ministry and safe home for women in need. I was given a nice bedroom and access to all I need in the home. I am able to go to church for every service and now I can settle down to to focus on what to do and where to go from here, or while I am here.  I am so very thankful to have learned of this place and people that still care about those in need.  Rev. and Mr. Gattenby have shared their home and helped many through out the years. They are vibrant, healthy, dedicated and very capable of continuing their calling in ministry for homeless women in need of help or assistance.This home is very large and the entire 2nd floor has be designated for the homeless women.  There are 4 large bedrooms upstairs, 2 kithenettes, a very large Bathroom and designated area for Chapel, class and the ministry office with access to the large kitchen downstairs. Since I have been here I have such  a peace and feeling of well being. I believe I may be able to help in this ministry if God so leads. I have been able to get some direction for my life as I look for outside employment. I am very thankful to God and the wonderful people He has put in my life. He is The Awesome God who loves and cares for me and everyone. Thank you 'AChor Ministries, for giving me opportunity to enter A Door of Hope for safety and peace so that I may hear God more clearly regarding the direction He wants for my life. God Bless this Ministry in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

In the times I have visited them during their business hours they have always  been courteous and have invited me to view their animals for adoption.  The dogs and cats appear well cared for and some receive special training as needed to help with their adoption.

Vulnerable children that have been sponsored over the years are now going to college. Villages have received goats and instruction on how to raise their own vegetables. The hunger relief ministry has delivered food to starving people. Hundreds of pastors have been taught God's word and can now minister to others. This ministry truly pays it forward. Donations go to the ministry 100%.
WORLD CHANGERS INTERNATIONAL MINISTRIES	237931		/users/profile/251222	hlebo	Volunteer	1	02/11/2015	This is a follow-up to my original comment about "World Changers International Ministries," and the reply I received from them.  The reply reinforces the need for this organization to receive a one-star rating. In January 2014 I wrote:  After repeated requests IN WRITING over the last FOUR months, this nonprofit refuses to remove my very ill parents from their mailing list. We have taken this route to hopefully force them to care enough to hit the "delete" button. More than a year later -- in February 2015, the organization replied: "We are very sorry for the inconvenience, but we have not been at the address you were mailing to since 2008. If you still need assistance with this, please write to our Sapulpa, OK address listed in our profile on this site. Thank you." This is an interesting response, because all of our requests to them were sent to the address prominently featured on their envelope that requested money, Just thought I would pass this along as a alert to others

Waynoka Historical Society	53924	1	/users/profile/55086	wayne8	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2010	As a new-comer to Waynoka the Historical Society museum has been my primary source of information about my adopted town.  Waynoka Station provides hours and hours of entertainment to locals and visitors.  The complex continues to grow and is preserving the heritage of our area.
Waynoka Historical Society	53867		/users/profile/55007	okiefromwaynoka	Board Member	5	09/29/2010	The Waynoka Historical Society is preserving the unique history of Waynoka at Waynoka Station. The Waynoka Air Rail Museum is on the second floor of the restored Harvey House. The museum tells the history of the Santa Fe Railroad in Waynoka, the Transcontinental Air Transport, and Fred Harvey and the Waynoka Harvey House. The Santa Fe Depot and Harvey House are on the National Register of Historic Places, and were built in 1910. Fred Harvey civilized the west, building eating houses along the Santa Fe Railroad, and bringing women west to work in his restaurants. In 1929, Charles Lindbergh chose Waynoka as a site for a transcontinental airport, Oklahoma's first. The company was Transcontinental Air Transport, or TAT. The Harvey House has been totally restored or redone, and is ADA compliant. A restaurant occupies the first floor, along with a gift shop and restrooms. The BNSF Transcon rail line runs parallel to the Santa Fe Depot and Harvey House, with dozens of trains every day on the line from Chicago to LA. The depot exterior has been restored, and the interior will be restored as soon as funds are available. The Society is raising $100,000 to match $400,000 in Dept of Transportation funds. The complex is beautifully landscaped. A diesel locomotive adds to the ambience. Also in the complex are three buildings: a railroad section foreman's house, a 1904 pioneer log cabin, and a railroad scale house.  The houses are furnished. Big Fairbanks scales are in the scale house. The Air Rail Museum has displays for all interests and ages, with a model railroad, excellent photos and interpretation, Mrs. Fred Harvey's silk coat dress, Fred's eye glasses, aviation stories, stories of the famous TAT passengers, who also ate breakfast or dinner at the Harvey House. Groups of all ages thoroughly enjoy a visit to Waynoka Station.

It is truly an honor to be able to stand in a flag line for these heroes.   I see firsthand that donations given to this organization result in highly trained military road guards, much needed items used at missions to keep everyone involved safe and also for items given directly to families of the fallen, such as "Mission Accomplished" pins, coins, etc.  We receive many thank you letters from families who have been affected in a great and lasting way by the honor shown to their hero.

Red River Cowboy Church	121127	1	/users/profile/164816	Laura Causee	General Member of the Public	5	08/21/2012	I am a member of the Red River Cowboy Church of Mangum Oklahoma. I have attended several churches in my life and this by far is the best. My 13 yr old son was baptized a few years ago in this church. He is still going strong in their youth group. There is so much love and positive fellowship in this house of God. I have never felt so welcome and loved by such a large congregation. Our little town doesn't have a lot of positive activities for our youth but this church has changed that with so many great God centered activities for our youth and also the adults.
Red River Cowboy Church	85922		/users/profile/96013	Agnes R.	Volunteer	5	04/15/2011	I attended Red River Cowboy Church on a Sunday evening in March.  I and 5 other people from Peoria, IL visited this church to help them install restrooms and do some painting of a room that would become the Nursery, and also the entrance corridor.  We were greeted with the warmest of greetings and spent a wonderful week with these people.  I can say nothing but good things about everyone there.  We met so many wonderful, sincere, friendly, and true believers in the Lord.  They treated us like we had been there as long as the others.  Talk about feeling at home -- it was great.  I will never forget my trip there or the people I met.  We all fell in love with the people and had a tear fest when we left.  "They practice what they preach!"  We all hope to go back sometime - hope it is sooner than later!

The Blankenships and the staff are inconsistent in their treatment of these children. They tend to pick favorites and bully the boys who could really benefit from their help. most of the staff are completely unqualified to be in charge of teenage boys. Look elsewhere!!!!
Brush Creek Youth Ranch Inc	145704		/users/profile/192255	jehovasneaky1	Client Served	5	12/03/2012	Our entire family has learned about healthy communication because of the year our son spent with Brush Creek Youth Ranch. The counselors gave our son a great deal of coaching, and he had lots of time to practice through letter writing and phone calls. What we didnt expect was how much instruction would be available to us on parenting. What we learned about good communication strengthened our marriage and helped us with our other children as well. Our whole family is stronger because of the teaching of Brush Creek Youth Ranch.
WASHINGTON COUNTY SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS	229243		/users/profile/292893	RuthS,	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2014	This is a great group of compassionate people who work hard to get the most for each animal that comes to the shelter.  They do not have arbitrary timelines, or a maximum age for placing animals for adoption, etc.  They get seniors into great homes while kittens and puppies benefit from loving foster homes.  The leadership and board strive to bring more resources to the animals everyday...this means expanding transport to other places with more adoptions, breaking ground on a new building, better fund raising and sharing the things they learn with others by sponsoring educational opportunities.    Just a really good group of people doing their best at a very difficult task!

Its really amazing. The number of out reach programs they are doing, reaching out to schools, to rescues, shelters and other citys to help build a network to reduce everyones overhead and ultimately place more animals in homes is just tremendous achievement. They have made incredible strides to better the shelter at all levels.

They have never offerred job placement, they do not assist with baby items. This agency is currently running on only a few volunteers as the director has made some bad decisions in either running off key staff or finding a reason to get rid of them due to his inability to act in a competent manner. This organization needs some time to rebuild its trust with the volunteers and act in a professional manner before the public it claims to help is further harmed.

Council On American-Islamic Relations Inc	273981		/users/profile/363300	Jane1111	General Member of the Public	5	12/08/2015	This organization encourages open discussion regarding Islam and our global and local community. This is very important especially with how the media is shaping our perception of Muslims the past 30 years. I encourage everyone to really research what Islam is and what it means. You may be surprised to find out it is a religion stemming from Christianity. Muslims believe Jesus was indeed a prophet, however, they believe Muhammad was the "next" prophet. Rather than clicking on a link that doesn't tell you much about anything please research this religion and its meaning. I am not a Muslim but I think it is important to stay open-minded and to remember that all people have the ability to be bad and good. Thank you Council on American-Islamic Relations, Inc., for providing us with the resources to understand things more in depth, keeping the conversation open and encouraging us to increase our cognitive power.

CHRIST FOR HUMANITY INC	102044		/users/profile/131970	Craig Deegan	Donor	5	12/08/2011	I think that Charity Navigator's evaluation of this fine ministry is grossly unfair.  Until CN came up with their "new and improved" system, they consistently maintained a four-star rating.  One of the founders makes just over $10,000 and the leading executive makes a whopping $45,000.  Something like 96% of their collections go to those who need it most. Christ for Humanity should be a five-star charity.  I've given to them for a number of years now and, no matter what CN does (who, by the way have lost a great deal of credibility with me), I'm going to continue to do so.  God bless you Christ for Humanity.  Keep up your good work!
CHRIST FOR HUMANITY INC	82488		/users/profile/90974	Robert Ashinhurst	Board Member	5	03/17/2011	U.S. and International ministry:In addition to organizing and going on mission trips, Christ for humanity works directly with missionaries on the field to provide whatever need there may be. They are so willing to think outside of the box to meet changing needs. Water wells, mosquito nets, medical supplies, medications, Bibles, are some examples of what CFH has helped to provide in over 65 countries.   Local ministry:I am so blessed by every experience with this ministry. People come to Christ for Humanity already beaten down by the world. They are living with the humiliation of poverty, some for the first time in their lives due to the economy. Christ for Humanity is constantly aware of the need for people to retain their dignity and sense of worth, especially in the way that the Lord sees them.  People are always greeted with a big smile and reminded of God's love and grace.  Folks leave with tear welled eyes and loving hugs.  They have truly experienced the body of Christ.

Like any organization, it has its employee and employer minor issues. However, under its new directorship I have serious concerns about how all donations and earnings on the emergency forster care side of the house are being managed. The new director seems out of her element and not capable of managing anything from the money, to employees (director's lack of interpersonal skills) to donations, and understanding the legal issues such as hiring family and friends to perform work (paid for by the shelter), and failing to use volunteers rather than pay for services... I am afraid with the issues the shelter is having our children may not have a safe place to go to for very long.

Jenn Marable is a thief that stole from our base camp and was on the run from Texas from a warrant. Her information is slander and has no shred of truth in it what so ever. This review was the nail in the coffin our attorney needed to file suit against her for false allegations and slander. ARC was formed in Joplin and has the paperwork to prove it. Jenn is a liar, a thief and uses Moore to escape her problems in Texas. 
Moore Beautiful Inc	164597	1	/users/profile/218768	Jen_21	Volunteer	5	08/10/2013	I am a volunteer that is not with any affiliation after a bad experience with ARC (Allied Response to Catastrophes.) The founder of ARC told me that he developed the not for profit organization in 2011 after helping in Joplin, MO with the May 2011 tornado devastation. I have since been informed that he was asked to leave on several different occasions due to "giving too much attention to" the underage females in the various youth groups. This was after only 8 weeks of being on the ground in Joplin. I have spent some time with Serve MOORE of Moore, OK and they have an upcoming beautification project with Moore Beautiful, Inc. where MB, Inc. is donating up to 1,000 trees to any homeowner who was in the affected areas during the May 19th and May 20th tornadoes. Serve MOORE said the only stipulation was that there had to be almost 1,000 forms from homeowners in order to collect the 1,000 trees from MB, Inc. Thank you Moore Beautiful, Inc.!

Oklahoma City Community Foundation Inc	146026	11	/users/profile/192662	Holly22	General Member of the Public	1	12/05/2012	The president of this foundation, Nancy Anthony, has been vocal in the press regarding those for whom donations are intended.  Her remarks are hurtful, hateful, disparaging and unprofessional.  In 2001, in an interview with the New York Times, she is quoted: "There's a culture of victimhood, made up of people whose identity as Victim of the Oklahoma City Bombing gave them importance and visibility they'd never had before."   In 2005, in an interview with the Chicago Tribune, she told Howard Witt:  "The perception of people, unfortunately, is that you need to give people money and that money will make them feel better. Well, it probably does make them feel better. But heroin makes them feel better for a short time, too." 
1040 Initiative	160658	2	/users/profile/213014	RobGaribay	Volunteer	5	06/14/2013	1040i improves the lives of so many people in Africa as well as the people who travel to Africa to serve. I am amazed by the vision of founder Mike Cousineau and his singe dedicated focus to helping the poorest of the poor in the most remote regions on the planet. Mike lives a very frugal existence so he can dedicate as much funding as he can to bringing medical, water, and education to these people who have no hope without 1040i. I highly endorse 1040i and suggest that you go to their web site to learn more and how you can participate in a life changing trip! Rob GaribayBusiness Coach
Knights Of Columbus	236803		/users/profile/320910	David280	Client Served	1	01/14/2015	Knights insurance agent Troy O. sold me a whole life policy at 100k coverage and said it would pay for itself after 10 years.  It's now 16+ years later and not even close to paying for itself.  Apparently, Knights of Columbus agents had been using the same "vanishing premium schemes" widely hence a previous lawsuit filed against them for that same thing!     http://www.insure.com/lawsuit-library/knights-of-columbus.html Troy O. preyed on naive young servicemen like myself, as a 20 year old airmen at Altus AFB in 1998. Don't let the Knights of Columbus or Troy O. rip you off like he did me.  If you really need life insurance buy term, whole life and insurance agents like Troy are a rip-off!  That's why whole life insurance is sold and term is bought.  Thanks for reading.
Dillon International Inc	39709	2	/users/profile/40678	susan36	Client Served	5	05/20/2010	Dillon was professional in all aspects of both of my adoptions.  The best part of Dillon is knowing how much they care about orphans, not just helping people to adopt.  My first child was adopted from Vietnam in 2002.  Vietnam adoptions were shut down in 2003, but Dillon continued to do humanitarian work and even increased it's presence to make sure orphans were being taken cared for.  OrphanCare is about helping children all over the world and they do so many great things!  I highly recommend Dillion International!
Oaks Indian Mission Inc	164495		/users/profile/218621	jcb13	Donor	1	08/08/2013	In 2008, the Board of Directors contemplated closing OIM because of poor management and other indiscretions.  However, they chose to keep it open and hired an Executive Director with a lifetime background of working with children and in management.  With his leadership, the Mission turned around by hiring new staff, updating facilities, recruiting new donors and improving the overall care of the children.  It was in a state of much improvement in 2012 as stated by many donors and members of the tribal community. Unfortunately, in 2012, after four years, the BOD, lead by the board president conspired to terminate the ED and this board president took his position.  Since she took over as the leader, the Mission has dwindled from 25 children to 10 yet still has a staff of 13 or more. Contributions are down and some native tribes have been alienated by her lack of childcare and business exprerience.  The Mission has fallen back to it's state of 2008.  Some children were pulled out of the Mission by their state or tribal case workers because of the mismanagment within the organization.

Kibo Group International, Inc.	119395		/users/profile/162335	jomorton	Donor	5	07/27/2012	In addition to donating to this organization, and raising donations for this organization, I went with them to Uganda, which allowed me to participate in and see firsthand all the incredible things they are doing. Here are my personal top favorite things about Kibo Group. 	Kibo Group puts power under people in Uganda by empowering them to change their own world.	Kibo Group develops strong relationships and partners with Ugandans.	Kibo Group approaches issues holistically (from all directions)  educating Ugandans on hygiene and sanitation, building community cooperation, encouraging equal rights. A quick look at some of their projects	Mvule Project  Tree planting  The land is so stripped of trees that they do not get rain they need, they do not have enough wood to burn for cooking and heat and mud slides have buried people alive.	Womens Empowerment  Just one example in this project is the fuel efficient stove. Cooking over an open flame burns too much wood, causing overwhelming smoke and children often get burned. Kibo Group is now spreading from village to village how to build the new stove out of mud that burns little wood, is smokeless and children do not get burned.	Water Source  Clean drinking water - the biggest health issue. Kibo is working with villages to dig wells and rehabilitate existing wells.

The *full* article is available at JournalRecord.com, or through a general Google search. Well worth the effort:>> Businessman Walter Schumacher was named the 2006 Man of the Year in Clinton, where he is a popular figure. But questions surround Schumacher's not-for-profit cultural exchange program, which has paid his wife a six-figure salary, bankrolled annual trips abroad and donated cash for civic projects that bear Schumacher's name.>> Every year, hundreds of foreign adult students each pay more than $1,000 to participate in the Clinton-based Apex USA student exchange program. They provide their own transportation to reach their destinations, and then work at jobs near minimum wage to help pay for their housing.>> The tax-exempt Apex takes care of placing them in jobs across the country each semester as a cultural learning opportunity. Some of the students even end up in the small hometown of Chief Executive Walter Schumacher.> But that last aspect concerns a U.S. Department of State official, because the head of the nonprofit is also a landlord and business owner in Clinton. If those students have problems with their work or living conditions, they would normally seek help from the sponsor organization.>> Schumacher, who personally visits several countries annually to promote his organization at Apex's expense, said he has managers to deal with such issues, thus distancing himself from potential conflicts of interest.>> Apex contributions to Clinton's public parks in Schumacher's name further compound concerns of commingling personal and nonprofit finances. ...

Integris Baptist Medical Center Inc	306239		/users/profile/397514	debbye	Client Served	5	09/23/2016	The emergency room was very busy the last time I was in on September 14 about 6:30 pm but the doctor was great.  In fact, every time I have been in the Emergency Department the last 2 years which has been about 6 times they have been great.  My regular doctors, Dr Christopher Stellman and Dr. Donald C. Brown are very good.  When I had an angiogram done at the Heart Hospital Dr. W. Lance Garner and the staff were excellent.  They had to be!  I'm TERRIFIED of anything that puts me to sleep!  It seems that Integris attracts and hires the best medical professionals!!!!!!
Oklahoma Lions Boys Ranch	56791		/users/profile/59491	HisKid	Client Served	5	11/12/2010	BEEN THERE!!!Arrived just 2 days after my 15th birthday as a result of being declared a Ward of The Court in two seperate counties. One of the very first things I was told after I walked in the door was: "No bars and no guards. If you run, When you are caught, your next stop will not be here. You will be taken directly to McAlister State Prison." That kinda got my attention. A few months later, we (I think we had 10 boys at the time) were all loaded into a large van (destination unknown) and taken for a ride because we needed an 'attitude adjustment'. When I saw the sign, my first thot was "what unpardonable sin have I done?"Up until that moment, I had never seen anything or anybody that I was afraid of. When that steel door closed behind us, my heart almost stopped. I lost my voice and for the first time in my life, I was afraid. Afraid that I was going to be left there, and afraid of what those inmates said they would like to do with me. I stayed very close to the Ranch Dad, and made SURE that he knew where I was at all times. The tour lasted about 2-21/2 hours but seemed like much much longer.When we got back in the van, we all counted noses to make sure that everybody was there. On the way back to Perkins, there probably was not a dozen comments and there was not a hint of anything but absolute understanding and desire to stay out of that kind of place, forever!I credit the I.O.A. (Lions suppoted it even way back then) ranch with the opportunity to get my head straight and my 3rd "Second Chance".I stayed there exactly 2 years, leaving 2 days after I turned 17.Because of the guidance and training I received there, I was allowed to join the US Navy and complete a 30+ year career.Things I learned there include, but are not limited to: 1) how to milk a cow (we did 32 head twice a day till we got the pipeline milkers, then went to about 40 cows), 2) 2 inches of ice on a pond is not strong enough to hold up an Allis Chalmers "AC" tractor.3) Assistant ranch dads do not like to ride on the back of a manure spreader when the governor on the tractor is di-abled,4) rabbits can change directions faster than a tractor can, and don't roll over as easy.5) A case tractor can pull a 4 wheel trailor with 102 bales of hay and 5 boys up a hill at about 8 miles an hour, and down that hill at about 60 miles an hour if you take it ouf of gear. 6) When you miss the school bus home, it is a LOOONG walk and nobody does your chores for you.7) when you deliver a calf, make sure you teach it who is boss because someday they will challenge you for the job8) Balancing a check-book is a skill EVERBODY needs.9) The easiest way to find the middle of the pond is mark it before they put the water in it.10) Cows CAN kick a fly off their ear.
JENKS SPORTS INC	7414	5	/users/profile/9270	fling	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/27/2009	This is a baseball league operating in Jenks, Oklahoma.  It has come to my attention, as a 10 year employee of the league and recently let go, that individuals operating as Board Members are pocketing money and using the NPO for personal profit.  I was not given any warning nor was I officially informed in writing of my termination.  I have tried over the last 10 years to obtain copies of the leagues by laws.  The city of Jenks does not seem willing to assist in the search for the Jenks Youth Baseball by laws.
Cell Phones For Life Inc	86286		/users/profile/96539	Big D	Board Member	5	04/19/2011	Cell Phones For Life donates free emergency use cell phones to the elderly, the disabled and domestic violence victims and family shelters all over the U.S. These phones provide security and a sense of freedom. For the elderly they help these citizens and their families knowing they can leave their house and still be able to call for help if needed. For the domestic violence victims these phones are a lifeline when in a dangerous situation confronted by their abuser. The cell phone can be hidden because the first thing an abuser will do is break or disconnect their active phone. This organization makes people aware of how this simple little object provides more security than most people realize. I am proud to be a part of this organization and touched by the gratitude of people and their families who have received one of these phones.

Up With Trees	198648	1	/users/profile/259405	lparrott86	Board Member	5	04/23/2014	I started volunteering at Up With Trees more than 5 years ago. I am involved with several non-profits in the community and I always say that no cause is more worthy than another.  However, Up With Trees is very close to my heart and it promotes a culture of giving through growing.  Every tree planted is a gift to future generations and when I drive around Tulsa and see all the trees this amazing org. has planted I am astonished.  Even if you are not a tree hugger, planting trees benefits everyone!  Trees clean our air (combat greenhouse effect),  conserve water, save energy (literally, lowering utility bills), support local economy (tree lined streets increase traffic to businesses), and they have amazing healing properties!   For me, trees provide a sense of optimism.  On of UWT programs is the commemorative trees, planted in parks and other areas. These trees promote healing and allow people to honor their loved ones in a beautiful way.    With the help of UWT staff, I was able to arrange a commemorative tree planting for a dear friend and classmate who died suddenly and tragically.  With the permission of our high school, we were able to plant a shade tree by the soccer fields where he loved to play growing up.  More than 40 friends and family members came out for the planting, it was amazing!  There were a few tears, but more than anything we all felt that the planting was a healing  experience that provided a sense of hope.  It's been two years and now the tree is tall and every afternoon kids are resting under the shade of his tree.   Stories like this are what make Up With Trees such an amazing nonprofit.

Tri-County Indian Nations C D C	195597	2	/users/profile/255716	mebond	General Member of the Public	1	03/12/2014	In order to be candid and personal let me say I am writing to review this organization in support of the Melton Reed family.  I am at a loss to even begin to educate others on the ineptness of this organization, bordering on fraudulent and criminal in their dealings.  This place uses federal government grants to line the pockets of shotty business men.  The Melton Reed family qualified for program.  In less than six months tri-county distributed funding to contractors' who built a  structure. They inflated costs. Additionally Tri-County spent every penny with out documents of their expenditures.  They forged documents, they issued excuses and are dancing around being accountable.
Theatre Tulsa Inc	75215		/users/profile/82160	Im1ntulsa	Volunteer	4	02/24/2011	In a market flooded with entertainment venues Theatre Tulsa, a 501-c-3 non profit continues to sustain itself against incredible odds.  Established in 1922; identified as one of the 7th oldest community theatres in America and the oldest continuously running theater west of the Mississippi, Theatre Tulsa continues to entertain Tulsa & the surrounding areas; offering a chance for local citizens to learn what it takes to run a community theatre.  From board membership, acting instruction to the numerous technical trades of directing, costuming,  light & set design and construction, the organization provides the opportunity for anyone to master a theatrical craft  or provide voluntary assistance.  In recent years the decline of corporate support and the gaming industry has challenged the very lifeblood of this once thriving "little theatre."  In order to sustain itself, Theatre Tulsa was forced to temporarily suspend office staff salaries and eliminate the position of executive director.  The work is now being performing by a working board of directors and volunteers. To add insult to injury, there has been an increase in Indian gaming and numerous casinos have opened up.  These casinos have included entertainment venues in an attempt to generate gaming enthusiasts.  These venues require the support of local theatrical technicians and are offering monetary compensation over and above what Theater Tulsa can provide thrrough stipens and hence  many of Theatre Tulsa's technicians have left or have declined the stipends offered by the theatre.  Theatre Tulsa, in an attempt to meet the various challenges presented to them has taken great strides to market themselves by incorporating a new website (www.theatretulsa.org) ; using social media such as Face Book and Twitter to promote causes and provide the latest information not only to their patrons but to anyone who may be interested in assisting the organization. Theater Tulsa needs to get back to owning their own building like they once did from 1932 to 1987.  If they can purchase or obtain tax deductible donations to purchase a building of their own; they could then redirect rent monies to fund other areas of deficiencies.

Oklahoma Halfway House	205762		/users/profile/268008	exexpat93	Client Served	1	07/12/2014	Oklahoma Halfway House is a for profit, community Medium Prison, that violates Federal and State law, with a sole purpose of grifting off Federal, State, charity, and Inmate's income to keep up the lifestyle and car collection of it's Director.I have never seen so many drugs dealt there in my entire life (most brought in by the staff to sell to inmates).With two incentives to violate and send as many inmates back to prison (a $35k bonus for violating inmates and a kickback from Grady County Corrections Center) it is hard to survive this train wreak of a Halfway House.There is no incentive to get people back on their feet.  Employers avoid hiring from the OHH as they are harassed as badly as the inmates of the OHH.  Constant no notice lockdowns and compound restrictions hamper visitation from relatives who often drive hours or fly in from out of state to visit their love ones.Little funding is seen onsite.Mandates from Eric Holder to allow RESIDENTS of Halfway Houses cellphones, transportation to and from work, and mental health counciling ignored by the Director.No onsite job search facilities.  No computers available to inmates to look for jobs.  No library.  No law library.  No denomination religious meals available.  All technology is forbidden and feared by the Director.  Eating out of dumpsters would be better than the food provided there.Disrespectful staff that get off flogging the inmates (not residents) for little or no reason (entertainment?).If you have a love one on the inside, it is better to avoid this FRAUD of a Halfway House.  Do your time and go home.  Defund this abortion.

The club has ignored my calls and the man in charge has totally blown off our concerns.  The coach gets upset at the girls when they lose, yet he doesn't coach or teach them.

Teen Challenge Of Oklahoma Inc	203545	2	/users/profile/265518	djhinds	Client Served	1	06/23/2014	I  do not recommend Teen Challenge of OK. They gave up on my Daughter in less than 7 days.  And gave back just the education fee.  We paid 3800.00 and they gave back just $1000.00 for just 7 days for treatment.  I am having a hard time understanding why this happened and even in moving forward trying to prevent what happened again. I watch my daughter died a little each day. And I feel no one can help. And if a Christian based treatment center cant be honest they who can I trust.  Below is what happened:  Sept 2013 We pick them because they told us they handled stuff cases with ODD/ OCD and eating disorders. We did not sugar quote anything she did, we told them everything and also gave them permission to call her therapist she was currently working with. After we dropped her off Sept 6, we got a call that she was not eating and Drinking  and were told, that they were taking she to the emergency room. ( They knew she was getting food and water, but for health reasons and defiance reasons they wanted to not let her get away with anything ) So on Friday they took her to the emergency room  and told us they were looking to get her a 72 hour hold (5150)  and they told us she could do this all year long and for us not to worry. And the next day I was called and told she was being released from the program and put on a plane.( We had asked them before we picked them, how could she be released for the program and were told if her hurt another children and that has only happenonce) What they said " because she was not eating or drinking" they were worried about her health and released her . Fact: the doctor released her saying she was not malnourished or dehydrated. Fact they released her on a Saturday( no way for family to get other plans in place insurance company closed on the weekend.  Fact: the director did not call us herself the weekend guy director called Fact we had never was given any heads up or concerns before. They told us on Saturday and put her on a plane within 2 hours . On Friday we were told all was fine.Fact United airline did not want to put her on the place without a doctor note with a ok to travel. Fact : they rebooked under a difference booking and did not tell the airline that child was endanger to herself ( The endanger was given to us as the reason they were no long keeping her in the program)Fact: They refused to give us back any money at all we had to call Mr. Grey CEO of OK teen challenge to get $1000.00 back the education moneyFact: her therapist at the Ranch was not even aware she was being released.We called her in a panic thinking this weekend guy was over his head and since the Blankenship's would not call us back. They release our daughter without even a meeting or a warning. Just "she is done with the program send her homeFact: She did not hurt anyone  Reasons not to use them We told them to call and speak to all her therapist to get the full picture.If they had done that, they should have declined her in the program understanding that she was a very hard case and needed a lot. ( We had asked them if she need more mental therapy would she be able to get it. And they said yes, we would just need to pay for the drive to the office visit and back. We spent over 1000.00 to get her packed and driven to the OK. 3800.00 was the deposit and got back 1000.00. If we had known they were not equipped to handle her we would have never used them and would have kept looking. They do not understand eating disorders at all. They take on mild cases not major. ( we have been in and out of three eating disorders places in less than 1 year. They just took our money and said sorry the rest is non-refundable. It should be non-refundable if the parents pull her out of the program, not the other way around. Please take them off of your reference list and call me if you need any more details

She is also instrumental in moving dogs from tracks and farms around the country to various adoption groups around the country.  She has a real knack to getting it done in the most efficient way.  And she LOVES greyhounds!  She's like a greyhound whisperer!  She just has a special way with them, and can spot what kind of personalities they have in an instant.  And she can remember just about every greyhound she's met it seems!  When we've visited the kennels, she's told us tons of information about this dog or that one.  We've adopted three greyhounds from Halfway Home.  Sometimes, we'd see a dog we were interested in and she'd tell us, no, that wasn't the right one for us.  We just let her choose them - we didn't care about the color or anything, just that we got the right dogs.  And we sure did!  We have three very different dogs who together make up a wonderful trio.  They add so much love and to our home.  We are forever grateful to Teddy and Halfway Home Greyhound Adoption.

Cimarron Valley Humane Society	172395		/users/profile/228233	Anna53	Client Served	5	09/29/2013	We had difficulty with one of the fosters. Without going into detail, it was an instant when she decided at the last minute to keep the dog we were trying to adopt.  After contacting the people in charge, the situation was quickly resolved. The foster was released from her position and she will not be hurting other families.  I was VERY impressed with the manager's (for lack of a better term) quick response and even then, quick action. It showed that they care about being a GOOD agency, not just one in name only. 
20th District Drug Court Inc	169111		/users/profile/224129	teresa.wright	Client Served	5	09/11/2013	My name is Teresa Wright and I am a recent graduate of Drug Court. The Director is very dedicated and inspires me. She really cares. I have been to prison and court ordered rehab in Texas approximately 10 years ago, and, unfortunately went right back to what I was doing. After being released from rehab, I honestly tried, but did not make it. The Drug Court Program taught me to think early every morning by calling in about my recovery and by completing the community service, it taught me to help others and I met new people. I was able to rebuild strong, healthy relationships with my family, and am currently working on better employment by attending Murray State College fulltime. I am almost finished with my Associates Degree in Behavioral Science/Psychology and am also a member of Phi Theta Kappa (Honor Society). I have become very independent. Today, I am gathering some other graduates and we are starting aDrug Court Alumni Association. 
Purcell Lighthouse Worship Center Incorporated	273336	1	/users/profile/362548	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	12/01/2015	This church is family owned and operated.

The church would be dead if it were not for the little community outreach they do. Which is less financial and more for show.
Lab Rescue Ok Inc	235870		/users/profile/319600	Kelly159	Client Served	5	12/24/2014	Have volunteered and adopted three dogs from Lab Rescue OK, Inc.  Have had three incredible dogs from Lab Rescue OK, Inc.  All were 100% house trained and in tip top shape.  One was treated for heart worms by Lab Rescue OK.  He will turn 18 years of age in June.  I've had him since 1999.  I am so grateful he was rescued by Lab Rescue OK, Inc. Lab Rescue Ok is an all volunteer organization.  Adopters go through a rigorous adoption process that tries to insure a Lab is going to a forever home.  It upsets some people because they feel like they are being investigated.  The rescue tries to do what is best for the dog. They have to go in a secure yard, be a part of the family and inside, make sure the adopter has a history of good Veterinary care and has been responsible.  Not always easy! They error on the side of the dog and are their voice. It is a rescue that does everything right.  All of the fund raising goes to the Labs.  They are always overwhelmed with the number of dogs and medical care they need.  It is a very very good rescue with truly fantastic people making it successful.  It was the only Lab Rescue for Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri for a number of years.  Some incredible people have been lab Rescue OK, Inc volunteers.  They have rescued thousands of wonderful dogs. They don't come any better than Lab Rescue OK, Inc.  I volunteer time with Lab Rescue, OK as a foster home.I am also a client who has wonderful dogs from Lab Rescue OK, Inc.  FYI, I have a Golden Retriever, Black Lab, and a Chesapeake Bay Retriever from Lab Rescue OK.  Each dog was my good fortune to adopt.
Duncan Regional Hospital Health Foundation	62891		/users/profile/68767	kmiller	Client Served	4	02/03/2011	I was in Duncan Regional Hospital last March, 2010 when I broke my leg and shaddered my ankle.  They were very good to me.  I was taken back to the emergecy room almost immediately and had their attention the entire time I was back there.  They did not leave me alone and explained what they were doing every step of the way.  I was in a lot of pain and a very nice older nurse held my hand and talked to me to help calm me down.  The doctor, Dr. Wright, operated on me at 11:30 p.m. so that my leg wouldn't have time to swell which would make me have to wait about a week for the surgery.  This was very much appreciated.  I stayed in the hospital for 3 days after my surgery and the nurses there were very good to me.  They came when I pushed the button needing ice or to go to the bathroom, which I couldn't do by myself.  My family was there most of the time but I wasn't worried about no one being there because the nurse were checking on me constantly.  My family was treated well not asked to leave when I needed them there.  I feel that Duncan Regional Hospital is doing a very good job taking care of their patients and family.

Harvest House Outreach Inc	286369		/users/profile/376486	Writer	Client Served	5	04/21/2016	KristaKrista is a young mother of two children 8 months and 5 years. With her oldest child in the process of getting tested for special needs, she is facing additional challenges both financially and emotionally. Krista lives around the corner from Harvest House which is convenient. She used to have enough food each month when she had a roommate with SNAP benefits. Since the roommate has moved out, she finds it is difficult to stretch her food budget each month. Her bi-monthly paycheck working security for a local casino means she earns too much to qualify for SNAP benefits. Harvest House helps her with many essentials every other month like clothes, diapers and formula, as well as food they purchase from the local Food Bank and other local vendors. Reflecting on what it means to have generous donors to these programs, Krista quickly pointed out, Thank you, without you, theres a lot of people who wouldnt have what they need.MichaelaMichaela drives past Harvest House almost every day.  But one day Michaela was driving past and just happened to see it for the first time, probably because the van was parked directly outside.  The last time she had used an agency for assistance was over a year ago.  But now she is taking care of her two adult children with disabilities and her five grandchildren.  She counts her blessings just that they have a place to live with water and heat. I can usually make ends meet, but lately I find we are running short and need more food, Michaela told us. Its food and clothing where I need help meeting the needs of the children.  With food and clothing assistance from Harvest House, I found that I (and many others) have our needs met. BernardBernard found himself homeless for the first time five months ago. He mentioned, This winter has been cold. It was hard. Before that, he was taking care of and living with his disabled father who appeared to be dying.  Step-family members invoked power of attorney and left Bernard without a place to live. Fortunately, he had a chance encounter with a friend of his, who like Bernard is a military veteran. His friend mentioned the Community Service Councils BRRX4VETS (Barracks for Vets) Program to him and they helped get Bernard set up with housing, housing supplies including a bed. He was so grateful to have found Harvest House, one of the Tulsa areas premier agencies. This is my first time to this dance. I just got housing and now I have food and great clothes. I am so blessed. I know things are going up for me from here.FrankiFor a while, Franki lived with just her adult son and they could just make ends meet. With no small children in the house, they could prepare simple meals as needed. That all changed when Frankis daughter died leaving her with four children to care for. On top of that, she took in 2 other children.  All of a sudden it cost more to feed the children than she earned. She now receives SNAP benefits, and she can usually make them last through most of every month, but if there is no school in session due to a vacation or break, it drives up her food bill dramatically. When she finds that she needs to supplement her food supply she will go to Harvest House, the food pantry that lets her select the food she wants and gives the family a weeks worth of food with each visit. They provide a variety of food, and they take care of my physical and mental needs. She went on to state further, I feel comfortable coming here, and they treat me like a person, with respect.  At some other places, I felt shame going there, but here I dont feel any shame. They wont ever make me pray, but they will pray for me if I want them to; and they make me feel good. Franki said how grateful she was for the food that was provided by Harvest House.  I know there is a stereotype of people who need help with food, but now there are so many families and elderly people that need help. If it wasnt for this gift, we might be homeless or just not eating. I wish I could thank each and every one of the people who volunteer at Harvest House and those who made the donations to provide this food.John John & Kayla have been coming in to Harvest House to get food for the past few months. This particular day when they came in and were filling out their paperwork, they seemed unusually happy and excited. John suddenly announced, "This is the last time we'll be coming in to Harvest House for food". He continued, "I am starting a construction job tomorrow". He was smiling and standing in front of me looking a few inches taller and full of confidence and pride (the good kind). He thanked me for all the food Harvest House had provided for them and said "I don't know what we would have done without this food assistance".  I congratulated him on his new job and assured him that they were welcome to come back and have a sack lunch if they needed one as it would probably take a couple of weeks before he would be receiving a pay check. The smile on his face got even bigger. His new job was going to pay him daily. As I handed them their food, he thanked me again and they left. They haven't returned for assistance.

Special Care Incorporated	252383		/users/profile/340441	Concerned405	Volunteer	2	08/10/2015	Special Care has its perks, but also has its downside.  Over the past 4 years, I have seen teachers come and go and have noticed a change in how management interacts with parents.  Do they do a lot for the children? Yes, but it seems like everything else these days, they are more concerned with money.  Maybe it has to do with the large new edition they added to the building, but It certainly feels like they are not putting any of their "donor" money back into the class rooms or to their wonderful teachers.  Like I mentioned earlier, the turnover rate for teachers has been like a revolving door.  With it being partly a special needs school, you would think there would be more special needs toys and learning devices.  I hope that one day soon Special Care can become "special" again and not so worried about money coming into the school.

Operation Veterans Outreach	303712	1	/users/profile/394880	Cheetos051	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	First of all I want to say this organization is amazing! My husband is a Veteran, We lost our home last April 2016.We were given a 7 day notice to move out,not knowing where we were gonna go. We reached out to numerous organizations and referrals and got little to no help.We were told my husband had to be post 9/11 or injured in order to apply for any assistance from most places.Other places had no funds.We ended up moving into a hotel in June and stayed for three months while we struggled to either pay for our room everyday or eat. My husband works full time but his paycheck wasn't enough to get us through each week as the hotel rates were so high due to tourist season.I even pawned my wedding rings to cover the weekend rate as well as most everything we had of value.The rest of our belongings are in a couples garage and they want it out by the end of the month or it's going on the curb. We had contacted a page and a half of places asking for help in the state we live in. I even called our Congress woman's office. My husband was so stressed from worry as I have chronic pancreatitis as well as several other health issues.Then I found Operation Veterans Outreach on the Internet. I read thei information on the site and I sent them an email.A few days later I spoke with Daniel,the founder. It didn't matter to him if my husband was post 9/11 or injured. He just wanted to help us.See we live in Maine and Daniels organization is in Oklahoma.I was really touched by this, And truely surprised.He moved us out of the hotel we were in and into one his organization works with. Giving us some room to breathe,Hes now  working on housing for us. If it had not been for Daniel and Operation Veterans Outreach we would have literally been living on the street.God bless you Daniel!!  and everyone in your Organization!! Thank You!!  S &J
Nina Willingham Senior Housing Inc	280454		/users/profile/370333	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	02/17/2016	My mother lived there approximately 2 years.  The administrator there was so mean and hateful, that my mother was afraid to hang even one picture on the wall.  So for 2 years, she did not have any pictures or decoration on her walls.  The administrator tells all the seniors that if they hang anything on the walls to make their apartments feel like home, they won't get their deposit back if they ever have to move out.  After 2 years, my mother had to move out due to failing health.  The administrator wrote on the move out sheet that her walls had to be filled and painted due to "nail holes".  This was an absolute lie.  When my mother called to discuss this, she was never treated more rudely.  I even tried called and talking to the administrator, but again she was very rude.  I would never let any I know or care about move there, and I pass this suggestion on.  After all, this is America's most valued and vulnerable population.

Meals on Wheels	286947	2	/users/profile/377019	Eileen_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My mother taught me the importance of giving whatever you can, and now I give in her spirit and memory.My earliest memory is of my mother reading. She read voraciously; she wanted to understand everything. It was a window on worlds she would never experience. My father was a mailman, and I was the youngest of four kids, so there wasn't money for anything as luxurious as travel. Which is why it was then confusing, but later profound, that I would see my mother writing several checks every year to a handful of carefully chosen charities or organizations whose work she supported: Greenpeace, Southern Poverty Law Center, Planned Parenthood, Doctors Without Borders, Habitat for Humanity, the Humane Society. The checks were sometimes only $10.Later, when she couldn't see or hold a pen, she would ask me to write checks for her, including one that had come to matter deeply to her: Meals on Wheels. We were both grateful for how much easier those always-there, always-cheerful volunteers made our lives, bringing hot meals to her door, chatting companionably, giving her a window on the world.Now that my mom is gone, I still give to Meals on Wheels. I want it to be possible for those volunteers to help someone else's mom.My non-religious mother didn't have many traditions, but she did tithe. Even when she had little to give, she believed in giving.

Crisis Pregnancy Outreach Inc	286948		/users/profile/377020	Linda_H	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Time, Talent, TreasureAbout 35 years ago I found an organization that I feel is doing important work in our community.  At the time, women who were pregnant out of marriage were given few choices and often had to 'go live with an aunt' to protect the family's reputation in their community.  Fortunately this stigma has changed in our society, but the problems a woman faces in a crisis pregnancy have not.When Crisis Pregnancy Outreach (www.cpotulsa.org) began in the early 1980s, many of the women who came to us were teenagers who did not want to have an abortion.  Today, CPO works in coordination with local hospitals and operates a 24 hour hotline.  The majority of woman we now serve are homeless; addicted to drugs/alcohol, gambling, or relationships; physically abused; and/or are totally alone.  What I love about CPO is that we make a lifetime commitment to these women.  It is not just about the 9 months of pregnancy. This crisis brings women to CPO, but this is only the presenting problem. Our goal is to provide the services necessary to help women move forward out of a very difficult situation to live heathy, productive lives. CPO provides a plethora of programs, which include, living assistance (utilities, food, clothing); childbirth classes, educational and employment assistance, life skills seminars, medical care with a private physician and dentist, mentoring, parenting classes, transportation, weekly support groups, and a storage area with maternity/children clothes, child-rearing supplies (cribs, diapers, toys, et al), and furniture. CPO facilitates a mentoring program that forms relationships between the CPO women and other women/mothers.  These volunteers meet with them weekly and often incorporate them into their own family activities.  The purpose of this relationship is to encourage healthy living, academic achievement, and generate educational and career interests. CPO began as a grassroots organization, but has continued to develop into a well-run organization where I am proud to volunteer.Since the beginning, some of the women stay in volunteer homes, some continue to live on their own, but as we grew, CPO was also able to purchase a Transitional Home where up to eight woman at a time can live. This is a lovely residential home where the women are provided three meals a day, a study area, medicines, transportation to appointments, schooling, tutoring, counseling and mentoring. Once a birth mother is settled in, she is encouraged to begin advancing her education by going to school (high school, tech, or college) or taking the GED.  She also is provided a personal, professional counselor who she can see at no charge.  What a privilege it is to see women put into practice what they learn and become more self-sufficient.  Many holding jobs for the first time and purchasing their first cars! During the time the birth mother is pregnant, she makes a very difficult decision to raise or relinquish her child. If she chooses to relinquish her child, the mother looks through life-books submitted by the adoptive families and selects her babys family.  These are open adoptions, which means she will have a relationship with the family and her child.  Most years CPO facilitates 20 -30 adoptions. We offer programs for waiting/adoptive parents, conduct interviews and home visits, provide workshops, support groups, mentoring, and hosting for out-of-town families. It is so heartwarming to see the adoptive parents, the birth mother, and the child come to love and respect each other.  It is a process that also requires lots of work and emotional risk on everyone's part, but CPO is committed to the children to provide for them a loving home AND the knowledge of where they came from.In the last few years, more women are choosing to parent as single mothers. CPO has expanded our services to meet the many needs of these women to provide healthy, safe homes for their children. We teach classes to prepare her to be intentional in her child-rearing practices; we help her get started living on her own; and CPO continues to provide counseling and support groups for as long as the mother is willing to attend. Many CPO women stay in Tulsa and continue counseling, attend parenting classes/small groups, finish their education, and become part of the CPO community -- helping each other. We now have children who were born with CPO who are in their 30s.  What a joy to see the adults they have become and to know that we have played a small part in giving them a positive future.Finally, what I love about CPO, and why I am willing to invest my time, talent, and treasure with this organization is that it is 100% volunteer.  In 35 years, no one has received a salary.  All the monies raised go directly to helping women and children and the tangible expenses to run the office and the transitional home.  What a privilege to watch these many loving, talented and dedicated women come alongside another woman in crisis and walk with her through one of the most traumatic times in her life.  Many are available 24 hours a day to go to the hospital, answer the hotline, provide transportation, baby showers, and events for the children.  Many of these volunteers have been with CPO for 10 - 25 years, a few for all 35 years.  They are seasoned, loving women who understand the unique struggles of being a young woman in a crisis situation.  My role has been small compared to the sacrifices of their time, talents, and treasure; nevertheless, I have reaped a deep sense of hope for our future as I watch lives changed for the better with CPOs caring human touch.
