They need your support. Join me in helping educate our residents of the destructive nature of the meth curse, and help build people up. Support the Idaho Meth Project with your time, money, and/or talents. Meth is more dangerous than most people know. 
Idaho Meth Project Inc	222968		/users/profile/286714	Seriouslyawkward	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/15/2014	The Idaho Meth Project continues the awesome and difficult work of bringing attention to the issue, as well as creating opportunities to help solve the problems. Leveraging communities to be their own advocates and take a leading role in reducing the impact of this drug and helping eliminate abuse is a challenge, and the Idaho Meth Project has provided the guidance necessary to meet this challenge. 
Idaho Meth Project Inc	222870		/users/profile/286616	Birdie8	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2014	The meth project is a vital necessity in Idaho and our world today.

Idaho Meth Project Inc	221803		/users/profile/285495	Kayla7	Volunteer	5	10/10/2014	As an almost two year member of the Idaho Meth Project Teen Advisory Council, I have been able to witness the good that this organization does for my community. The message itself is amazing, but then the speakers, presentations, and events make it completely inspiring. Every single story I hear, whether it be from the speakers or from recovering addicts who come to our events/booths, changes my life. I am forever changed by the selfless and interactive nature of this non-profit. The fight to end meth use is not yet over, and I am glad that the Idaho Meth Project works every single day to deter use among my community! They make Idaho a better place to live in!

General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	As the lead advisor to the Meridian Mayor's Youth Advisory Council, I aim to partner the group with local organizations with a heart and soul for the true betterment of our community. The Idaho Meth Project could be the poster organization in this regard. They are inclusive, collaborative and out-of-the-box thinkers when it comes to bridging their messaging to all demographics. A joy to work with, the lead team of the IMP builds meaningful relationships and undertands the dynamics of reciprocal unions. Adrean, Cyn and Alix are top notch at what they do and have made great strides in the prevention of Meth addiction. Bottom line - They are deserving of  any and all accolades pointed in their direction!
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221441		/users/profile/285132	Methisevil	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	The Idaho Meth project has had one of the most successful campaigns I have seen on drug abuse awareness. It hits right at the heart of not only the dangers of meth but the consequences to those who partake in it. I am proud of all that the Idaho Meth Project team has accomplished.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221260		/users/profile/284966	LGOETZ	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	I am not even a resident of the state of Idaho and I still know what great work the Idaho Meth Project does. Its employees are outstanding people and truly care about improving the lives of the people around them.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221210	1	/users/profile/284918	MomAgainstMeth	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	This campaign is effective.  How do I know?  Because I know of many young adults who use alcohol or other drugs, while adamantly refusing to touch meth due to the effectiveness of the graphic images that bring to life the wreckage meth causes.  The project has also been effective in equipping parents with the skills to have crucial conversations with their kids at a time when it can make a difference.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221183		/users/profile/284892	Genesis M.	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	The Idaho Meth Project is comprised of an amazing group of caring, compassionate citizens.

Idaho Meth Project Inc	221179		/users/profile/284582	JenniferCouch	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	The phenomenal efforts of the Idaho Meth Project have made a tremendous impact on keeping teens in our communities free from drugs. Achieving lifelong success begins at young age and this project has helped thousands of teens understand the negative impact meth can have on their lives. I believe our community is a more educated and stronger place because of the determination of the Idaho Meth Project. Kudos to this amazing group!
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221092		/users/profile/284795	kg43	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	As a member of the Teen Advisory Council with the Idaho Meth project, we do many activities and programs that we can engage the public in to make sure that they are aware on what's going on in their communities. Joining the Teen Advisory Council has been the best thing that's happened for me. Not only am I volunteering my time with the Idaho Meth project but I am also taking part in shaping my community for the greater good. This is a great program and I would love it so see many teenagers and adults join to make it greatly known.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221086	1	/users/profile/284789	Scott96	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	Idaho Meth Project is one of the most outstanding groups I am aware of.

Idaho Meth Project Inc	221077		/users/profile/284778	macwrigley	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	The Idaho Meth Project plays a vital role in the Idaho Community in helping educate youth of the dangers of drug use. This nonprofit not only raises awareness and benefits the community at large, it saves lives by helping to prevent recreational first time use of a very addictive and lethal drug. They are a nonprofit that is very deserving of recognition.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221076		/users/profile/284776	Blonde	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	My first knowledge of Meth and the dangers came from this organization.  They came and talked to us and educated us of the danger that was going on in our state, area, communities, neighbors and our children.  The ease of obtaining the drug and the dangers and the control it has ruining the lives of so many promising children and adults.  I then later had a friend whose family was torn apart by this horrid drug.  Later I became friends with a older gentleman who became addicted and truly just about lost his entire world.  Everything that he has worked for his entire life.  Hanging in the balance by whether or not he could kick the addiction.  Only to say that is was by far the hardest thing he has ever done in his life.  I then became a CE Instructor for Insurance Agents to maintain their license.  One of the classes I teach is on Meth Lab Clean Up.  The pictures that I saw in the room that first time will forever be with me and appreciate the education aspect that the Idaho Meth Project has given me as a parent.  It is a amazing to me someone who was never exposed to the drug world how this has affected so many people that I personally know.  Without the Meth Project I don't know how many years it would have been and who know how many times my children would have been exposed without the ever so important talk from their parents.  Grateful for the work they do tirelessly on Idahoans behalf. 
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221075		/users/profile/284775	Connie49	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	I love the Idaho Meth Project and everything that it stands for. What an amazing program. Going into the schools and watching a group of kids suddenly become silent listening to the real life stories is amazing. This program is one of the most valuable tools we have for our youth. Its graphic yet real. The sad part is listening to the kids talk about the struggles they face watching their friends and parents battle this addiction. Everyone should spend time using the Idaho Meth Projects website. It is a wealth of information. Without this organization and the work of some very passionate people, I truly believe Methamphetamine usage would be much higher in our schools. 
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221074		/users/profile/284773	kayla8kiwi	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	This program has and continues to do great things in Idaho. The decrease in drug use is only one of many benefits! 
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221071		/users/profile/284770	Doug5296	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	As a former law enforcement officer and Chief of Police I would have loved to have had a organization like this at my disposal.  Kids, and adults for the most part, tend to listen and soak up what someone says if that person has life experience in the topic.  I believe having people that have used methane have beaten the demons is the best way to get through to the kids.  The kids get to hear and feel the emotion that your speakers share in their talks about what meth did to them and how it affected their lives.  I happen to have known one of your staff for 30 years and wish I could have been there to save her from this evil drug.  I know that when she talks that the audience will feel the emotion of her story. This is a great project and one worth supporting so we can fight the use of meth and other drugs in our communities and schools.  Great job folks!!!!!!
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221068		/users/profile/284767	Shami Y.	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	Idaho Meth Project is an Awesome Program....not only does it Arm children with scary yet very accurate information on methamphetamine use....It also allow past meth users a chance to give back to the community as a way of retribution for our involvement in this terrible epidemic and help us heal from all the damage it's done to our lives.   very very useful to both those being informed and those that get the chance to do the informing!!!  =D
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221066	1	/users/profile/284766	twarzyn	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	I experienced the Idaho Meth Project as a middle and high school student in Payette, Idaho, where there is an undeniable meth problem.  What the Idaho Meth Project really excels at is putting meth use outside the realm of normal behavior. Unlike a lot of their contemporaries, I feel like they actually know how teenagers think and how teenagers consume media. That's why their commercials are so, so, so effective. The commercials are: smart, terrifying, haunting, and effective.  If the Idaho Meth Project's goal is to educate the public (and I think it is), they are doing a damn fine job. 
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221061	1	/users/profile/284761	Dani6	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	What a great program. Really making a difference in this community.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221060	2	/users/profile/284759	Julia46	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	The dedication of those invilved with IMP are an inspiration. Spreading the Not Even Once message to our area youth shows them the true effects of drug use; showing young people who may be affected by drugs among friends or family and letting them know they have support and are not alone. The Meth Project is a vital tool for our communities to help win the war against drugs in Idaho and around our nation.  Kudos and a huge thank you to all involved in this mission.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221056		/users/profile/284754	Dana68	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	I think this is an A+ program! Keep up the great work! Meth needs to disappear from Idaho!!!

Idaho Meth Project Inc	221053	1	/users/profile/284751	belnkita	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	The Idaho Meth Project is one of the most successful drug deterring projects out there. Their organization is amazing and the difference their message is making across the state can clearly be seen. People of all ages know their "not even once" slogan and I think they've improved community safety exponentially. All in all, awesome program that is improving our communities!
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221044	1	/users/profile/284741	Audrey22110	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	The Idaho Meth Project is an amazing organization that has been life changing for me. As a Teen Advisory Council Member, I have helped organize many events around the community to spread the Not Even Once Message. Our presence around the state is making the community a healthier place and has changed many other lives as well. The Idaho Meth Project has shown me how to be selfless and how to prevent teen meth use.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221041		/users/profile/284738	younglj	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	Idaho Meth Project to me is a necessity in our world today, without it the younger generation could get headed in the wrong direction at the beginning of their early lives. If they have the chance to see what this drug does to there bodies they at least could have a chance to avoid it.  Great job in getting this info out there.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221032	1	/users/profile/284729	Michael282	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	Idaho Meth Project is a very necessary program. Meth can take the nicest person you know and turn them into a psychopath. I've known the director for years, and she always does a great job.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221031	1	/users/profile/284728	Heather178	Client Served	5	10/08/2014	As a college student I have seen the effects of meth in the youth of the community of Idaho, and this project has brought awareness to people of ages. Many times have I discussed posters, commercials, and people close in others lives that have gone through the rehabilitation program.  This project is one of great importance to the citizens of Idaho.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221029		/users/profile/284725	Cindy147	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	I have been a volunteer with the Idaho Meth Project from 2007 to the present, which during this time I have had many opportunities to share frighting experiences from all the brave human beings who have given back to our community by sharing their experience, strength, and hope. I did not use their names, however I have had many positive responses from young people whom I've had the opportunity to share these stories with.  Among them include my son, his friends, and so on.   If one person out of 100 listened to what these brave souls shared, then family members, neighbors, friends, and our community have been graciously blessed with the Idaho Meth Project's continuous commitment to educate our youth to the dangers of meth, and its rapid escalation.  I have been so fortunate and enriched with a wealth of information regarding this heinous drug that  I proudly continue to display the,"Not Even Once" Idaho Meth sticker on my window.   Cynthia Eden
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221027	1	/users/profile/284723	Sheridan S.	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	This organization is truly a wonderful part of the community and does so many positive things. It is great to see the many impacts it has in bringing a community together. Through both awareness campaigns and informative events it teaches and spreads a great example. Every event I have been lucky to be a part of with this group has been an awesome experience! What a wonderful example of a nonprofit organization! Keep up the tremendous work.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221010		/users/profile/284707	kwoodhead	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	The Idaho Meth Project is a fantastic organization, and I have been so grateful to be a part of this organization!  I am on the Teen Advisory Council and have gotten the opportunity to work with other students across the state by spreading the 'Not Even Once' message throughout our communities.  The presentation that IMP gives at schools are life changing, and are hard hitting to teenagers.  If there is one organization making a difference in the state of Idaho, it's the Idaho Meth Project.
Idaho Meth Project Inc	221008		/users/profile/284704	add.wil	General Member of the Public	4	10/08/2014	The work they've done to prevent meth from getting a bigger foothold in the community is really important, and its made a significant difference.

Idaho Meth Project Inc	221003		/users/profile/284701	Kati7	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	My work with the Idaho Meth Project has been completely life changing! As a 2nd year Teen Advisory Council member, the opportunities I have been given are experiences that I could never find anywhere else. I've been able to work with staff, other volunteers, and drug free personnel from all over the state, and I contribute it to the confidence and strength that I have as a leader now. The work done by IMP is life changing, not just for the people that get the opportunity to work with them, but also for the students, parents, and young adults that are educated and inspired by presentations and awareness events all over the state. The Idaho Meth Project has helped me shape where I want to go with my life and helped me form a strong personal message in my leadership philosophy, and is overall a wonderful organization!  
Idaho Meth Project Inc	220995		/users/profile/284692	Shannon79	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	I love great Nonprofit organizations that improve awareness of the  dangers of drugs &/or alcohol.  Educating our youth and adults will give them knowledge to avoid the horrible addiction of Meth.  I have been involved thru a loved one who has helped, thru her career, many trying to get off Meth and get their lives and their own children back in their lives.  The Idaho Meth Project is very admirable and a wonderful program. Thanks to all involved in this Project!
Idaho Meth Project Inc	220994		/users/profile/284691	Cindy146	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	This project has made a huge positive impact on our communities throughout the entire state of Idaho.  More teens are turning from drugs, and beginning to understand there is hope for everyone, regardless of past behavior. I have seen the teens in my own community become more social, more open, and clean, to take charge of their own lives. Wonderful program! Keep it up!
Idaho Meth Project Inc	220989		/users/profile/284684	Deanna15	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	This is a societal challenge that needs a larger footprint in our state.

Idaho Meth Project Inc	220987		/users/profile/284682	AubreeWinkles	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	The Idaho Meth Project does an amazing job at spreading the message of the danger of not only the general use of meth, but particularly first time use. They do an AMAZING job at engaging teens from throughout the state in activities to teach them the negative effects of meth use as well as spreading the concept and message of prevention in our community. I strongly believe Idaho teenagers are positively impacted from the strong campaign message that the Idaho Meth Project communicates. They are given the opportunity to find their voice and be a positive influence in the lives of their friends, classmates and families. Thank you IMP for all the great work and dedication to such an important cause!

Idaho Meth Project Inc	220983	1	/users/profile/284678	BrianWard	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	This past year I was invited to participate in a project, headed by 'Cyn Reneau', to give the youth in the state of Idaho a means to occupy their time in a more positive way. This event included, not only a place for the younger generation to legally meet, but also included snacks, drinks, 'Live' entertainment, and 'free give away' items with the premise Logo of.... METH... NOT EVEN ONCE'.	         As a touring & traveling musician, I've had the opportunity to see many different areas of the States, observing many different cultures, but the one thing that most have in common is the younger generation getting involved in the use of Meth due to the lack of more constructive activities to lead them in a manner of growing up to help the community in which they live and better their own lives. 	In my belief, this project had kept many of the youth off the streets, (so to say) and a very positive notion that, for one.. we do care about them & their future, and secondly, that there are better and more constructive ways to spend their time with their peers. In closing, I support all efforts to keep this project alive and going, And especially want to thank 'Cyn Reneau' for all her dedication and selfless efforts to pave a better road for younger generations to come! 					                                                                                 Sincerely, Brian Ward

I'm also a reserve police officer for the Parma.  I have worked with the Idaho Meth Project on several occasions and have to say it is one of the best programs that I have seen to help kids stay away from Meth.  This project also helps recovering addicts by allowing them to give back and pass the message on.  It is really an honor to work with such a great program and Cyn is truly the best at what she does.

Idaho Meth Project Inc	220955		/users/profile/284650	Paul141	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	This organization does important work to help Idahoans.  Meth leads to tragic results for those who make the decision to use it and eventually to anyone around them.  It destroys relationships, tears apart families, and it ruins the lives of both users and innocent bystanders.  Education for prevention is the only realistic cure, and we are fortunate to have the Idaho Meth Project and their tireless staff and volunteers to give Idaho a fighting chance.  As an Idahoan, I recognize your efforts and I thank you.

I freely give my time telling my own personal story in schools around the treasure valley.   I lost my son to drug abuse and the Meth Project has givin me hope that my story can change the lives of young people everywhere.   Getting the Not Even Once message out there is my best contribution. . . I could not save my own child but through The Meth Project maybe i can save someone elses. . . 
Idaho Meth Project Inc	220935		/users/profile/284630	Sean20	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	The Idaho Meth Project is a valuable and vital resource in our great state of Idaho! I have been to many of their functions and have seen firsthand the direct impact they have made in many peoples lives and in our community as a whole. I commend them on their amazing efforts and continuation of helping those with need and desire to get off of meth more importantly, prevent our youth from even trying it in the first place. Awareness is key and the IMP does exemplary work in bringing that awareness to light so that we as parents or loved ones we can assist in beating this horrible problem. Bravo IMP!!! Keep up the great work!!!

Idaho Meth Project Inc	220906		/users/profile/284599	brandonw2	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	My daughter is a volunteer for the Meth Project.  Engaging our children to help promote a cause I am proud of her and the engagement the program allows her to help promote a cause.  More parents need to be aware of this program and get their kids aware and engaged into the Meth Project so that we all can have safer communities and understand the challenges our children face everyday.  People have no idea about what drugs and issues our children are facing every day.  I encourage parents to get their kids involved with Meth Project, their leadership and program will help one person change their life and may save your kid as well.  
Idaho Meth Project Inc	220902		/users/profile/284594	Renee50	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	Before Idaho Meth Project started their campaign in Idaho, I had no idea of how rampant and damaging the drug is. Society is so callous to violence these days it takes a very strong message to get through.  Idaho Meth Project has done a fabulous job making meth a drug to not try even once. The message is clear that you can't go back and the damage is permanent. It's not cool and not accepted. Thank you Cynthia and everyone at the Idaho Meth Project for your valiant efforts. They have made all the difference!

Idaho Meth Project Inc	220884		/users/profile/284574	IDcandy	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2014	Four years ago when I moved to the small town where I now live I couldn't help but notice the head of a wolf painted first floor high on the side of a building with the words "I bite. Meth devours." I've driven past that building and looked at the painting just about every day since then, as have nearly every person in this town. Idaho Meth Project provides the awareness that is undeniably needed thru their billboards, school assemblies, etc.  I'm proud to have selected Idaho Meth Project to receive donations on my behalf thru smile.amazon.com and Fred Meyer Rewards.

It's really amazing to see how broad of a (very positive) footprint they've left in many lives, and it is especially encouraging to note that the results of their work "trickle up" into the greater community-including those at risk for experimenting with Meth.

I have found them to be incredibly passionate and professional in their presentation. We have seen a significant decline in the effects of meth on the side of the state since becoming involved in the Idaho Meth Project.  I have found everyone from the organization to be very responsive and proactive on helping us put on a successful event. I wish the majority of my vendors would bring that integrity to the table.

Make A Difference	262372	3	/users/profile/351044	singee01	Volunteer	5	10/08/2015	My family and I were volunteers with MAD in 2010. We have continued to stay involved with this organization because of the sustained impact it has on children, and because of the long term vision it provides.  Not only does MAD support the education of disadvantaged children who have suffered the death of one or more parent, as a path out of poverty, but it also teaches them to give back to the community of which they are a part.  The organization teaches children true leadership values, fosters a balanced diet in an area of the world where poor nutrition and malnutrition are quite prevalent, and helps provide for the medical needs of the children it supports. The children that MAD sponsors go on to rigorous secondary schools, and even apply to competitive colleges in Tanzania and the U.S. Because this organization has its roots set down locally, in Moshi, it is able to have  a large impact  on the community it serves in a truly sustainable manner.
Make A Difference	257944	3	/users/profile/262740	Nancy159	Volunteer	5	09/17/2015	Early last year I volunteered with Make A Difference (MAD), a small grassroots organization that is passionate about educating orphans and vulnerable children in Tanzania. I was so inspired by this organization that I took a sabbatical from my business and am volunteering for a year.  Now eight months into this assignment I am more impressed than ever. Not only does MAD educate children, they do significant investments in the children's school. This not only supports all current students, but future students and the community.  The children are beautiful, smart, and grateful for the opportunity they've been given. I work closely with Theresa, the founder and Executive Director. She works hard, is creative in fundraising, spends money carefully, and has a vision for growth that will help MAD educate even more children. 
Make A Difference	201274	2	/users/profile/262740	Nancy159	Volunteer	5	05/29/2014	Make A Difference has a unique and powerful focus on educating orphans as they provide support to develop them into leaders. I appreciate that they not only provide quality education but also care for the children holistically. This was apparent as I visited Tanzania earlier this year. They not only educate but provide housing, food, clothing, health care, enriching experiences outside of school, and the love and support that have resulted in children who are smart, polite, healthy, happy, and an absolute joy to be with.  A focus on finding ways to support the larger community also inspired me. It may be by the children volunteering to help others, planting trees at one of the primary schools, or helping to build a community library that both the children and others can benefit from.  So impressed with this non-profit I'm volunteering again next year.
Make A Difference	257924	1	/users/profile/346397	Janeth E.	Former staff	5	09/17/2015	Administrative Assistant (Current Employee)" Providing quality education is the first and foremost goal for Make A Difference (MAD). Children are sent to private schools where quality education is provided. MAD is also dedicated to providing balanced diets, medical care and sports therapy to the children it supports. Additionally, MAD supports schools by building libraries and technology centers for the schools it sends its kids. MAD must hit high goals and by this way, its contribution to end poverty in Tanzania is great." 
Make A Difference	253313	1	/users/profile/341487	wleung12	Volunteer	5	08/18/2015	I had the great opportunity to volunteer with MAD in May. It was such a great experience meeting the MAD kids, visiting one of their villages, and helping at the Royal School. I could see how grateful the MAD kids were for the opportunities they've received through this org. They are so smart and have such a great attitude despite their difficult pasts. MAD is truly making a difference in their lives!
Make A Difference	253247	1	/users/profile/341417	starburst	Volunteer	5	08/18/2015	Make A Difference's attention to each and every orphaned child's education and overall well-being is phenomenal.   They truly focus making them productive members of society with education and experiences they otherwise would never have without this organization.  They are really Making a Difference in the world!  I have been volunteering for many years of my life and I can truly say I am blessed to have found this organization and to be a part of it.
Make A Difference	253189	2	/users/profile/341364	KMc.	Volunteer	5	08/17/2015	3 years ago, I had the opportunity to volunteer with Make A Difference Now.   The work that the Founder, Theresa Grant is doing to help improve the lives of these children  with a focus on education is inspirational.   The children through education, have been empowered to become whatever it is that they want to be, and have the capability to be lifted out of poverty.  Make A Difference is  making a positive local impact on the community of Moshi, and Tanzania as a whole.   Responsible, Transformative, Inspiring, and Sustainable.    Make A Difference Now will always hold a special place in my heart.  So much so, I have visited there on 2 occasions . And continue to support their efforts from afar. 
Make A Difference	252160	5	/users/profile/340212	thacpj	Donor	5	08/08/2015	Our involvement with Make a Difference happened purely by chance.  Please be patient as I tell our story  My husband and I traveled to Tanzania in August of 2013 to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro and go on safari in order to cross a couple of items off our bucket list. We trained for months for our climb and digested every possible scrap of information we could find to help facilitate successfully reaching the summit. While I am pleased to report that we were successful in reaching Uhuru Peak and our safari was truly an amazing experience, what we didn't anticipate or prepare for was the life changing experience we encountered a few miles outside of Moshi at the Kilimanjaro Kids Care Orphanage. We stumbled upon the orphanage via the Pack for a Purpose website.  While I was checking out the Bristol Cottages website, the hotel where we stayed before and after our climb up Kili, I clicked on the Pack for a Purpose link and began to investigate what that organization was all about. I learned that PfaP was affiliated with Bristol Cottages, and that the hotel supported the Kilimanjaro Kids Care Orphanage.  We found the current list of needs at the orphanage and then decided that this would be a great mission project for our church to become involved in. I prepared a flyer, and for a couple of Sundays before we left for Africa I did an announcement in front of the congregation. Donations began to pour in. We not only filled up one huge suitcase, but two! We were so excited! We had 102 pounds of donations making the trip to Africa with us!! Since we arrived at the Kilimanjaro Airport on a Saturday evening and didn't actually start our trek up Kili until Monday morning, I inquired with Gloria Moshi, the owner of Kindoroko Tours (who we booked our trip through), if she could arrange for someone from Bristol Cottages to take us to the orphanage on Sunday so we could deliver our supplies in person. Gloria graciously volunteered to take us herself  she picked us up on Sunday afternoon and personally drove us out to the orphanage, stayed there with us for the afternoon, and returned us to Bristol Cottages! When our car pulled up at the orphanage, we were immediately greeted by the smiling faces of children spilling out the front door. We were hugged over and over and over again. And not just any hugs. These were the kind of hugs where the kids just kind of melted into your embrace. Yes, we were already fighting back tears and we hadn't even got through the front door! All the kids gathered in one of the rooms where the seats were arranged in a circle around the edge of the room. Each beautiful child stood up and introduced themselves in English -- stating their name, how old they were and what they wanted to do when they grew up. Mark and I then introduced ourselves, and we were able to show the kids where we were from (Indianapolis, Indiana) on a map of the world that was painted on one of the walls. We then began passing out the supplies we brought with us to the kids. We had soccer balls, tennis balls, backpacks, lots of shoes in all different sizes for both boys and girls, medicines, vitamins, personal care items, bath towels, solar calculators, pencils, pens, rulers, etc. Each child was so happy to receive something new, and lots of smiles and hugs were exchanged! After everything was passed out, the kids wanted to know if we would play football - soccer to us in the U.S. We had to break in those new soccer balls, you know! We spent the next couple of hours playing with the kids in the yard in back of the orphanage. We kicked the soccer ball around for a little bit, but quickly figured out that we were out of our league! Those kids can definitely play soccer! Being from Indiana where basketball reigns supreme, Mark spotted the basketball goal and felt more adept with that sport. While Mark was shooting baskets with a few boys, a young boy named Peter wanted me to throw a soccer ball back and forth with him. Peter kept wanting to throw the ball faster and faster, and then we got two balls going back and forth at the same time. I think he likes to play goalie. Towards the end of our visit, we all gathered together in a circle in the backyard and the kids sang some songs for us. One song involved lots of repetitive clapping and dance moves. We tried our best, but I think the kids were pretty amused at the Americans with no rhythm! LOL! After the songs, one amazing young man stepped forward and spoke on behalf of all the kids. He spoke in English -- very articulate for his age -- and thanked us for the supplies we brought and for spending time with them. Once again, we found ourselves fighting back tears as said goodbye and drove away. A little over two weeks later we were back home in Indiana and couldnt stop thinking of those beautiful children.  So, I got on my computer and began to investigate the orphanage further.  That is when I discovered the phenomenal work that Make a Difference Now is doing.  I found the MAD website and read about Theresa Grant and the organizations history.  I shared it all with my husband, and what we read and learned further solidified our desire to help.    Through the amazing work of MAD, the children at the Kilimanjaro Kids Care Orphanage all have amazing spirit and hope. Their smiles are contagious. They are all good students and are working hard to make a difference not only in their own lives, but in the lives of other Tanzanians.   The local community surrounding the orphanage is benefiting from the ongoing support and assistance provided by MAD as well.  In addition to supporting and educating the children at the orphanage, a library/technology center, cultural center, science lab, outdoor educational trips for the children, libraries at the schools that the children attend, and a sports program are just a few of MADs projects.  All this is possible because of MAD and its philosophy of changing lives through education.  The world needs more organizations like MAD.  People have an inherent desire to help, and MAD offers many opportunities to do just that.   Many blessings to all who work to Make a Difference! Pam Thacker

What initially started out as a mere orphanage has now become a transformational organization in the Moshi area.  In 2012 I was won over the many opportunities MAD's progam provided to interact with the children it supported. in 2014, I was impressed with the impact it has achieved in the Moshi area overall via the Public Library program and the technology center. MAD is truly inspirational! Thank you for everything that you do! 
Make A Difference	143974	1	/users/profile/190473	Vivek N.	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I spent time earlier this year in Feb / March with MAD. Theresa is an amazing force of life! An inspiration for both the volunteers and the children.  I worked with the children closely for about 4 days and spent time with Theresa as well discussing how to ensure that the children get through to college. I was impressed by how far-sighted she was - she even had a spreadsheet with the education costs going all the way through 2020! I've kept in touch with MAD since and watched how she takes her charges along with her though the ups and down of life - so refreshing! 
Make A Difference	247026		/users/profile/334504	jbs342	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	Writing this as a past volunteer and current donor. Couldn't be happier with the work MAD is doing. Having worked with a few other orphan and/or education support programs, I can say this is light years ahead. I was happy to donate funds because with MAD, I know exactly where the funds are going. 5-star, for sure.
Make A Difference	246975	2	/users/profile/334439	Alexa E.	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	I've had the great opportunity and honor to work with Make a Difference NOW since 2013, and the experience has truly been life-changing! Initially, I traveled to Tanzania in 2013 to meet the 22 children that MAD supports through education, shelter, and a family environment.  That experience was so impactful, as I was able to see how transformational the work MAD does is to the lives of these deserving kids.  The kids are intelligent, educated, kind, warm, and, most striking, HAPPY, despite having experienced so much loss and hardship.  Seeing first-hand the impact MAD is able to make has shaped me into a committed and grateful volunteer.  Since my first visit, I've participated in the Machu Picchu 2014 fundraising climb, and am currently the group leader for the upcoming Patagonia 2016 fundraising climb.  Through my company, Salesforce, I've worked to spread the word about this great organization, participating in information sessions and being interviewed for their corporate responsibility video.  We've organized company-wide Bake Sales and bartending events to fundraise for MAD, donated iPads to the school and orphanage MAD supports, and helped spread the word about upcoming volunteer opportunities.   The reason for my commitment and passion has everything to do with the impact I see MAD make, the value the organization brings to the lives of these 22 children, and ultimately, to the world!  As an organization, MAD has its heart in the right place, and the dedication and action behind it to make things happen and TRULY make a difference.  I have no doubt that this organization has single-handedly TRANSFORMED the lives of these kids, as well as the many volunteers, employees, interns, board members, and donors lucky enough to be a part of it. I am endlessly inspired by the work MAD does, and honored to be able to help in any way.  
Make A Difference	216822	3	/users/profile/279743	sophiandjike	General Member of the Public	5	09/24/2014	As an administrator of one of the schools that MAD is working with, I have to say that MAD has really changed the lives of not only the children that they sponsor at our school, but also of the community around them. For these children, being an orphan equates a lifetime sentence in torture. Orphans have no way of accessing a good education, health services and even decent living conditions. More often than not, they end up as someones housegirl/boy, early marriages for girls or as street urchins.  MAD has changed that for the lucky few that they can afford to host. I always wish that they could help more, that they could touch more lives. We are greatful to MAD for their priceless help and contributions in building of the school computer center, school library and are now working on the playing grounds. All these ammenities not only serve the school, but also the community around it.  So thankyou Theresa, MAD and MAD volunteers. May God bless you so much.

I like MAD because they help me with my education, clothing, food and anything else I need. I lost my parents and my grandparents are the only ones to take care of me. They are old and it's too hard for them. They live in a small room and make very little money. They can barely take care of themselves.  I love the volunteers who come to help us. They are fun and also support us in many ways.  MAD also helps all of our schools we go to here in Tanzania. They help the schools with computers, books and sports. They really make a difference in many ways and believe in us!  I hope to be an eye doctor one day and with the help of MAD, I think I will be!

The school that I attend is called, Anwarite.  I have had the opportunity to meet many people from around the world through MAD, improve my English, learn about technology, read a variety of books and go on educational trips within my country.

It is the heart of all that I am right now and who I will be in the future. MAD has made it possible for me to go to school and receive the best education that is available in Tanzania. I have already graduated from best primary and secondary schools and I am now receiving advance education at the International School Moshi  a VERY special opportunity that I would NEVER dream of without MAD. This organization has lit up my future, shown me my potential and installed in me the desire to help others and give back to the society - I owe a lot to this organization. I only wrote about myself here, it should be noted that there is so many other children that MAD helps get proper education, food and shelter, in Tanzania and India. I LOVE MAD so much!

Theresa, the founder, is an amazing person that has created a well run organization. I loved not only the work we did on the technology center, but the one on one time that we got to spend with the children. They are really amazing kids with so much love and enthusiasm for life, you cannot help but fall in love with each of their awesome personalities.  I am thankful to have come across this organization and look forward to finding more ways to help stay in involved over the coming years. 
Make A Difference	212789	3	/users/profile/224585	Sociologist	Volunteer	5	08/30/2014	I have traveled around the world and visiting the orphanage in Tanzania was by far my best travel experience ever. Make A Difference and Theresa are the real thing! The organization supports 22 children with nutrition, excellent education, life skills and hope for the future. Furthermore, the organization focuses on sustainable when making connecting with the local community. I volunteered there for a week and we now have a fundraising for the orphanage every year in Phoenix as well as sponsoring one of the children.

It is a a grassroots organization committed to educating children and improving on the society that they live in. I had the pleasure of volunteering at the orphanage in Tanzania. It was the most incredible experience to see someone so dedicated to 22 children. This is about making a difference and doing it in a sustainable way. It is about improving the lives of not just the 22 children but their family members and villages!

The program is also unique in that it has helped one group of kids throughout their school years so that no one gets lost along the way.  MAD has kept their program manageable to ensure all the kids make it through school.

Make A Difference	201639	1	/users/profile/224703	Courtney28	Volunteer	4	06/02/2014	I first heard of MAD in August 2012 when I volunteered for a week with my university. Before I left, I was trying to change my flight to Cape Town to stay with MAD for that week instead! Needless to say, I had instantly fallen in love with the organization. I finished up my undergraduate & stayed home for the holidays, before returning to Tanzania for 3 months. My three months here is almost up and I couldn't have imagined a better experience. I genuinely felt like I was contributing to the organization. Even after getting an inside look at the organization, I still believe that it is run by incredible, talented individuals, and that everyone who comes in contact with MAD is deeply touched by the organization. 
Make A Difference	169536		/users/profile/224703	Courtney28	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	I first discovered MAD in August 2012 on a trip through Western Washington University. In 4 short days those kids stole my heart. A year later I light up just talking about them. They are the happiest people I have ever met, and it is all because of MAD. These kids go to the best school in the area and are brilliant, dedicated students. MAD provides food and shelter for them, but the most important thing they give these kids is love. Everyone working there would do anything for them. I will be going back to Tanzania February 2014 to work at Make A Difference for 6 months and can't wait to see everyone again!

By educating the children at the best local schools, Make a Difference prepares the students for further education at the best learning institutions in the country, thus preparing them for leadership positions in the country and beyond.
Make A Difference	170157		/users/profile/225462	Jessica128	Donor	5	09/17/2013	Make a Difference (MAD) is filled with loving, amazing volunteers and people who are servants at heart. This organization has made an incredible difference in so many lives, not only in the lives of the children and families that are touched, but in the lives of the volunteers and donors as well. When I see pictures of the children with smiles on their faces, I wish I could be there to embrace them.  It is so beautiful to see the work and love, generosity, experience, willingness, giving, sharing and joy expressed throughout the organization.  Due to health reasons, I am not able to volunteer, but if I could, I would. Make a Difference continues to do great work in Africa and India, and are appreciated by so many people, including me, around the world.  So thankful for this organization, their leader is amazing and it ROCKS!

I met Theresa, the founder, spent time with the children at the orphanage and visited with the teachers at their school. I cannot say enough good things about this organization. The caring and loving atmosphere enables the children to thrive. The value of a good education is instilled in them and they are eager to learn. I have since then been sponsoring a child and supporting MAD through donations. I am getting ready for my next trip to Tanzania in a few weeks and am looking forward to do some more work with all the children.

Make A Difference	169596	1	/users/profile/224781	nicflow	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	I spent a few days with the kids at Kilimanjaro Kids Care and MAD for the first time in 2011. In that time I was able to get to know each of the children (who weren't away at school at the time) by playing soccer, reading, and even visiting with two of the families in their local villages. Along with getting to do a fundraising climb of Kilimanjaro, I also participated in the inaugural Machu Picchu climb. Theresa's continued commitment to getting people involved in the fundraising for and interaction with the organization is commendable and I will continue to to support whenever I am able.  The children are wonderful and they will immediately capture your heart and Theresa is a strong and capable leader. The sustainable approach is one that should be mimicked and I can't wait to see the growth and development as the years go by. I love MAD!

I have known this young lady all of her life, and have always known her to be a caring and loving individual, but never thought that she would go in this direction in her life.  When she revealed her story to us, and showed us the pictures of all the children and families that she has helped, it was amazing!  She is an inspiration to all who know her.  We're all so proud of everything she has been doing, here in her home town.  Her cause is so worthy, and she just keeps expanding, and finding more ways to help the families in Africa and India to educate and establish a successful future for themselves, and especially their children. 
Make A Difference	169577	1	/users/profile/224758	madebykyle	Volunteer	5	09/13/2013	MAD is a wonderful organization with a great mission. They really put a lot of focus on the development of the children and their well being, and when you visit you can definitely tell that the kids are the first priority above anything else. They have a wonderful local staff, and when you are there they really go above and beyond to make you feel at home and like you are really a part of something great. Theresa is a wonderful woman with a great vision and she has created one of the best NGOs I have had the pleasure of working with from the ground up. In 2012 they also had one of the best long term volunteers on staff that worked amazingly well with the volunteers, and made for a memorable experience for everyone who was involved. I would recommend Make a Difference to anyone, and encourage people to get involved with the organization in any way that they can.

And with Make A Difference, my actions with them speak more than any review could say. I have volunteered with MAD every year for the past 3 years.  I fell in love with the NGO, Theresa (the founder), the kids, and their mission back in 2011 and from that moment on I knew I wanted them to be a daily part of life not just a distant memory MAD moves you. It moves your soul and your heart.  As a volunteer you better their organization and as an organization they better you.  I have volunteered with MAD Tanzania, MAD India, and did the MAD Climb for the Kids.  I have had two friends go and volunteer with them, and will continue to encourage everyone I encounter to do the same. MAD is truly a great non profit. Thank you MAD!
Make A Difference	143343	1	/users/profile/189794	nina.ps.reyes	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	Volunteering with Make a Difference Now is like joining a family.   From the moment I stepped off the plane in Tanzania and was greeted by Emmanuel to meeting Theresa to the kids, I felt like this is where I belonged.  From the food, the Kswahili lessons, the pen pal letters, my host family, to the laughs of all the kids and the songs, everyday I think of being a part of MAD and it makes my day better. I have volunteered with MAD at both Tanzania and in India.  I loved both and am hoping to return to Tanzania to do the Climb for the Kids.  Make a Difference NOW is truly changing lives- not just the kids they are setup to help, but they are changing the lives of every volunteer who joins them. I wish I could make MAD a part of my life everyday.

Make A Difference	144479		/users/profile/191015	vthiel	Board Member	5	11/29/2012	My trip to Tanzania to volunteer with Make a Difference was meant to be a one-time experience that has turned into four trips in total and a position on the Board of Directors.  Executive Director and Founder, Theresa Grant, is the heart and soul of an organization that gives so much to children in both Africa and India.  She inspires the kids, the staff and the volunteers each and every day.  It's impossible for the kids not to touch the hearts of everyone who volunteers with the program.  They even inspired me to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro this summer to raise funds for their education funds.  This is a first-class organization! 
Make A Difference	143962		/users/profile/190461	darius_li	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	As someone who was fortunate enough to spend time volunteering with Theresa and the wonderful kids at MAD, I can truly say it was a life-altering experience that changed my perspective on Africa, orphans, and the magnitude of change a few, dedicated individuals can make. Our trip to Tanzania was the first time any of us had been in Africa or an orphanage and to be completely honest, we had no idea of what to expect. All we knew up to the point of our departure was what we had seen through images in the news, television, and movies. or in other words, an unflattering image of a highly-unstable continent full of danger and desperation lurking on every corner. Yet, nothing could be further from the truth, and I give much gratitude and appreciation to Theresa and MAD for designing a comprehensive volunteer program that enabled us to truly see the country and the orphanage as it is. She ensured that our experience spanned beyond the orphanage walls to include the local environment, culture, and its people, leaving us with a holistic impression of the world the orphanage operates in, thereby better informing the work we were doing. Our experience far surpassed our expectations on every conceivable level and I highly, highly recommend MAD to anyone looking to make a difference. You will not be disappointed!
Make A Difference	143812		/users/profile/190300	svbw	Donor	5	11/28/2012	My name is Barbara Wilkinson.  I have been a donor for MAD for two years as well as a volunteer.  I volunteered in Tanzania in 2011 and 2012.  My experience has been incredible with this organization, the wonderful children, the culture of the country, the warm welcome of Theresa and Emanuel (Theresa's assistant) upon arrival and through-out my stay.  With each visit I have stayed just a little over 2 weeks.  Getting to know these children has been the  most rewarding experience of my life.  The children are grateful and appreciative for everthing the organization/Theresa has given them...the opportunity to learn, to grow, to plan and look forward to a successful life.  They each have a drive to give back to their community once they have finished school.  Theresa, her team, donors, interns and volunteers have truly made a difference for so very many in Tanzania and India.  I know that the money is funneled directly for education, clothing, food, medical and dental expenses.  There is so much I could write about Theresa and the children of the orphanage in Tanzania.  I encourage all to look at the MAD website, plan a trip to meet this fanastic group.  I will never forget my experience there.  I will continue to support this great organization and plan to make my 3rd trip in Sept. 2013.   Theresa truly is a dedicated, loving, motivated and brave young lady.  I admire her strength and ability to give so much of her life in helping others. 
Make A Difference	143782		/users/profile/190262	BHakala	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2012	Make A Difference works! With the support of donors, volunteers and staff they have improved the lives of the many people in the communities where they work.  I highly recommend volunteering at one of their programs, which is a life changing experience; or donating to fund the work of their staff and volunteers. Go MAD!  
Make A Difference	143675		/users/profile/116031	marcialiebich	Donor	5	11/28/2012	I  met Theresa five years ago. Since then I have served in an advisory capacity and my husband and I have been  donors. I am impressed with her dedication to the children she serves and her efforts to work with their extended families. The academic achievement of many of the children is excellent. We have not yet volunteered, but intend to visit her in Tanzania in 2014 with our family. 
Make A Difference	143672		/users/profile/190143	es3143	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2012	MAD is a wonderful non-profit in Tanzania that helps educate orphaned children through secondary school, as a means out of poverty. They also provide housing, medical care, nutrition programs, sports opportunities, and art therapy and emotional support for these children who have lost their parents. The children have consistently performed extremely well in school and routinely go on to excellent secondary boarding schools in Tanzania. This program nourishes both the soul and minds of these children and it's leader, Theresa Grant, is wholly invested in their futures. The program receives much local acknowledgement and is on its way to being a self-sustaining program.  It was an honor and privilege to volunteer in Tanzania with this non-profit.  I can't wait to see what type of men and women these children become.

The Make a Difference adopted me when I was in grade 5(2006). From then my life chaned. Its paiful to think of how my future would be a misery if MAke A Difference would have set an eye to me. It helped me, it helps me and I believe it will continue helping me. Its not only be but with many others whose fate would just be as mine without MAD. I am greatful for that uneven that cant be well experssed by these short words. I am in school now, as one of so many services the organisation is taking care of for me. I finding myself short of words for the orgaisation has already done a lot. Madam Theresa and others at the organisation use a lot of time to think of our future. I once heard her say, "we will sell everything we have for our kids education". They pay us frequent visits to school. They normally ask for what do we need(timely). Make a difference means my future! Anyone who gives Make a Difference, changes the life of so many African Children and many more.

I have been supported with Make a Difference since 2006. MAke a Difference is a hand that holds many of us who were about to fall under the pit of poverty. We could not pay for our basic needs, education nclusive. Now we are provided with education and other basic needs. MAke a Diffrence is really interesting for we are highly cared for. We can imagine our future,we are certain that with MAD we will make our dreams come true. We thank the Make A difference organization for all it has done to us. I would like to ask for the donours to support this non profit for the benefit of young poor African children who are living in vulnerable conditions.Thank you!

Working with the happy smiles and hearts of the kids at MAD made each activity .from delivering sports programs to educational workshops and tutoring such a fun and enriching experience.  MAD works hard to address the needs of the community and ensure that the children it cares for are provided with sustainable, meaningful and engaging opportunities.  I am happy to know that such programs work hard to ensure peace and development for vulnerable children.
Make A Difference	143589		/users/profile/190051	Jeannie3	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	The greatest thrill of my life was to be asked by Theresa and MAD to serve on their Board. I had first met Theresa in 2010 at a friend's birthday party where instead of gifts we gave donations to MAD. Theresa came to make a presentation and she had pictures of all the children displayed at the party. The moment I saw them, I knew I would be going to Tanzania and indeed, I went with 3 friends that Fall. The children changed my life and ever since that trip, I've been spreading the word and getting others involved. It is so wonderful to see how the kids respond to the attention and love provided by volunteers and donors. And, absolutely everyone who participates in some way feels their lives have been changed for the better. It's difficult to explain the magic that is MAD, but it really does live up to its name -- the organization is not only changing the lives of the children and their families/villages, but all who have the privilege to work with them.  -jeannie logozzo

During my nine months in Tanzania and Moshi I got the chance to get to know her and the wonderful children at Kilimanjaro Kids Care. The experience was incredible and this is really something I recommend to people out there who wants to volunteer. Theresa is an amazing person with a big heart and when I saw how much she has given these children and how much they love and appreciate her as their guardin it was stunning. She have thought me a lot about life at my young age and I couldnt be more thankful for having her as a friend. Thank you!

Actually before i learned about this non profit, I met two beneficiaries who are the students at the school i was once the Headmaster. this is Tengeru Boys. Its this MAD organization that has manged to send these well perfoming boys and many others in other schools. MAD has chosen to give to kids, quality education. Yoy know most of the charities just use to educate the boys and girls! MAD offers the opportunity for the girls and boys to have the access to the best schools on the land. Tengeru Boys Secondary school for example, is one of the best schools in Tanzania, its the first in the Region. Any student who secures a place for admission there, is assured of scoring the first grade i.e division I.I would like to advise other non profits to take a leaf out of MADS page!!!!!Thank you,Andrew Ngazu, Arusha, Tanzania.
Make A Difference	143375		/users/profile/189829	Kelly66	Donor	5	11/27/2012	M.A.D is a fantastic organization that goes out of their way to fully-serve the children they work with.  They focus on the whole-child and work within the community to provide individualized care and services.  Here in the states we might call something like this an I.E.P - and individualized education plan....this is what this organization provides...but it goes beyond education.   In addition, they are willing to think out of the box and come up with creative approaches for support.  I had an idea for Christmas gifts this year.  Theresa worked with me via email to make my Christmas Gift Project a reality.  Last year I did this project on a much smaller scale and it was a HUGE success.  I'm excited to take this project to a higher level this year and can't wait to see the response.  I couldn't have done this with any other organization.  Theresa's personal knowledge and expertise about the region and children have been invaluable with my project.
Make A Difference	143348		/users/profile/189801	jessn	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	Volunteering with MAD was one of the most incredible experiences I have had in my young adult life. I participated in the Kilimanjaro fundraiser climb and I cannot recommend it enough. The joy that these children brought me during my short time in Tanzania will stay with me for a lifetime.  Everyone was so welcoming and embraced us from the moment we arrived. As a volunteer you are encouraged to bring your own special touch to the orphanage - whether it's teaching the kids how to swim or introducing them to a basketball. There is a huge emphasis on education at Kilimanjaro Kids Care, and much time is spent working with the children one-on-one. One of the most exciting things for me is being given the opportunity to now watch the children grow and learn. Theresa is so passionate about this organization and it shows. Many volunteers are repeat visitors - I hope to be one someday, too! Theresa and her local staff also run a tight ship when it comes to the volunteer logistics, which was so important to me while being far away from home.
Make A Difference	143347		/users/profile/189800	Bridget6	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I spent spend a week with the kids in Tanzania volunteering with Make A Difference. The program was established to develop, promote and support orphanages and schools in Africa and India. They have helped disadvantaged children rise above poverty and given them the tools they needed to establish and reach their education goals. With their focus on empowering orphaned children to focus on their education and health, we knew this was where we wanted to volunteer. We had an incredible week with the kids reading to them, making jewelry and painting their school cafeteria. The kids all have an intensive drive to succeed and great plans for helping their community once they are finished with University.  They time I spent with MAD and the kids was truly life changing and one I will never forget!   
Make A Difference	127140		/users/profile/172179	Jana4	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	Volunteering for Make a Difference was one of the most inspiring experiences I have had. When reflecting back on my time at Kilimanjaro Kids Care I can't help but smile and feel extreme happiness for the opportunity that I had hanging out with them. Theresa Grant has created an environment of safety, full bellies emphasizing on nutritious foods, and lots of play time. The biggest emphasis however is on education. Theresa believes that even though these children have had horrific pasts, they can and will become productive members of society in the future. When writing back and forth with these children they always write about their very big dreams that can become realities because of the emphasis on education they are receiving. I will continue to support this group because I can clearly see that the money I am sending really will Make A Difference.

Theresa Grant is really a perfect coordinator and knows how to work with every body under any condition. The funds and material that are targeted to kids are surely taken to the proper place. If you ask me  I will say she is the best women and coordinator that I have currently see in Tanzania.
Make A Difference	125252		/users/profile/170377	clarkeza	Volunteer	5	10/12/2012	I often reflect how incredible my time I spent with MAD was, how much it has given me and how I will carry the experience with me throughout my life. Given the freedom to offer up my own personal skills within a structured volunteer time gave me the realization that all that is needed to give back is a spirit of open mindedness, and the ability to realize your own knowledge and pass it on. I feel incredibly lucky to have been apart of a community, as well as a family half way across the world. MAD has given me the ability to make connections with the world around me and offer up my skills willingly. I fully plan on returning and spending time with my Indian family again, as well as all the students!
Make A Difference	125239		/users/profile/170363	sandj	Donor	5	10/12/2012	I am so proud of Theresa Grant - the founder of Make A Difference. She truly has made a difference in hundreds of lives. She has proven that one person with a vision can change lives and make the world a better place. She and her team are making education the foundation to give orphaned children the opportunity to succeed in their own lives. They are gaining the confidence to know that they can grow up to make a difference in their own community. These children are driven and grateful for every chance they have to learn and grow. We need more people like Theresa and her team in this world.

The Mentoring Network Inc.	318178		/users/profile/409313	marilyn.sweeney	Volunteer	5	11/02/2016	I am a newbie to this wonderful program since joining for the first time this fall.  Having been a classroom teacher for 33 + years I appreciate very much the value of such a program Many of our children are products of dysfunctional families and have no stable caring adult in their life .  Presently I am a mentor for a 4th grade boy who has experienced a number of losses in his young life. He was depressed and below grade level.   An elderly couple mentored him  last year and because of their love and care little Johnny made substantial progress.      Due to circumstances beyond their control they had to move out of state.  I took their place.  Little Johnny is up to grade level and is a delightful young  man.  He communicates well with me and in the 5-6 times we have had together I find him quite creative with a good imagination. He looks forward to our times together and is disappointed when the school schedule interferes with that time.  I look forward to each Thurs. afternoon and come away feeling that that  hour was well spent.

The Mentoring Network Inc.	316337		/users/profile/407597	Nelda	Volunteer	5	10/28/2016	I have been a mentor for just under a year.  However, I have worked with Donna as a school counselor for several years previous to that.  I have nothing but positive things to say for this organization.  I just wish we could get more mentors to meet the needs of so many students that could use them.  As a counselor, I would sometimes hear parents or teachers say that students misbehaved because they were just trying to get attention.  I would think they were probably right and so wish that there were someone who could answer their need for attention.  As a counselor with all the responsibilities of a school with over 600 students, the mentoring just didn't happen.  This organization sets up all the logistics to make the good things happen.  
The Mentoring Network Inc.	315735		/users/profile/407031	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I have had the opportunity to be a volunteer with The Mentoring Network over the past several years and have seen the amazing work that is being done through this program. The mentors and mentees have such an amazing bond and it is obvious that each one plays an important role in the other ones life. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	314283		/users/profile/405642	Lawrence V.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	I have been with the Mentoring Network for 12 years now.  I have had the pleasure of mentoring 3 young men.  I have enjoyed seeing them grow.  It's fun to listen to them and learn to trust you so they can share their experiences, hopes, fears, and the future.  I have also experienced several summer camps over the years.  One of the most rewarding experience was on a challenge course.  Seeing the fear they are experiencing , but then watching as they overcome this fear and complete the course.   Also , the leadership at the Mentoring Network is extremely dedicated to the mission of the Network. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	314189		/users/profile/405549	dmhansen51	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	I have been a mentor for almost 2 years now, I have a young girl who was very angry and distant.  I am so thrilled to see how she has come so far.  I went to see her last week and it was wonderful to see her surrounded by friends and laughing and smiling.  I know she can have a very bright path with the right choices and I want to help her understand this.  Thanks you Donna for this amazing connection.

The leadership at the Mentoring Network is  dedicated to improving the lives of the at-risk children in our communities.  As I have shown up each week to bring encouragement and love to my kids that I mentor, I have  personally seen the changes in their lives.  I am very thankful for the opportunity to mentor that is provided by the Mentoring Network.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	311597		/users/profile/402959	Kaitlin.Vasil	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/18/2016	I have worked closely with the Mentoring Network and Donna Shines. I cannot speak highly enough of the amazing work that is taking place within our community. It is because of people taking time to mentor that we will begin to see less kids drop-out of school, participate in illegal activities. The kids will know their self-worth and understand they are loved beyond measure. So happy to have the Mentoring Network in our community!
The Mentoring Network Inc.	311441		/users/profile/402793	Tami V.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2016	I have worked with Donna Shines and the Mentoring Network for approximately 15 years. I first became acquainted with this fantastic program as a classroom teacher and, as an administrator, I recognize the valuable service this organization provides for my students. It started with a young man in my classroom who needed a positive male role model in his life.  His mentor stayed with him through high school and into the armed services. I am still in regular contact with this young man, and he attributes much of his success to his mentor, Ray.  Throughout my career in education, I've witnessed the powerful transformation of many students who have been able to form bonds with mentoring adults. One student who has bounced from foster home to foster home struggled to form relationships. It took his mentor well over a year to convince him she was not going anywhere and no one was paying her to visit him.  Having someone that shows up every week just for him, has given him confidence and strength to handle all the difficult situations that are beyond his control. I could share several stories about this wonderful organization that matches at-risk students with caring adults to form life-long friendships which can be the cornerstone of healthy productive lives. I encourage everyone to join with The Mentoring Network in any capacity whether it be financial support or volunteering time. Together we can make a difference in the lives of children. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	311376		/users/profile/402722	sstrickler	Volunteer	5	10/17/2016	The Mentoring Network Inc has provided a great amount of positive experiences and transformations in our school district's students.  As an employee of the school district I have been able to witness social and academic growth through this mentoring program.  I was so deeply affected by the amazing work The Mentoring Network Inc does that I became a mentor myself.  I would highly recommend becoming a mentor with The Mentoring Network Inc to experience the power of mentoring in our students' lives!

The Mentoring Network Inc.	268889		/users/profile/357621	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I began volunteering with the Mentoring Network six years ago in the fall of 2009 and continue to do so now.  My first mentee was in third grade when we began meeting and he is now a sophomore high school. We continue to meet and discuss whatever he chooses --mostly interactions at school and what's going on in our local area.  In addition I met with with a middle school girl for two years.  Presently I also meet with a 4th grade boy .  Each of  these children have shown me how important it is for them to have someone to share with and talk to ... a person who listens carefully to whatever they are trying to express, one who plays with them and helps them learn more about interacting fairly with classmates, etc. etc.  The reward that I get from helping these children is watching them grow in so many positive ways.  The Mentoring Network is truly a caring and compassionate organization that is making a difference in the life of the children it serves. And for the Mentors who help!

They do an excellent job of training mentors, keeping mentors motivated, and communicating with the schools.  Its is fun watching students flourish emotionally, academically, and socially because of the strong bond they share with a mentor.  I look forward to continue working with the Mentoring Network in my school.

The Mentoring Network Inc.	267346	4	/users/profile/356076	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	I have been involved with Mentoring Network since 2002.  In that time, I have had 5 mentees.  It was  a little disconcerting to have a parent pull a student from the program with no explanation,  but, that's what happened.  I've enjoyed each student, and have been with the current one 4 years.  She's reaching the teenage life, and sometimes I wonder if and how I'm helping her, but then say to myself, just relax, be a friend, play another game of Rummy.  That seems to be what she wants/needs.  The program has helped me, too, getting me going on days I'd just as soon not go, but once I do, I find it worth it.  I have enjoyed the day camps, and can see so many of the kids grow, so I have seen other kids' progress, not just my own.  The staff is tremendous, and although the volume of mentors/mentees has grown so much, care is taken to get to know each of us, so we each feel special.  This community would be so much poorer in soul without the MN.  The sponsors seem to be as interested and involved as those of us with our weekly sessions. The schools have been more than willing to work with my schedule so I can spend time with my special kid.  I can only think positively about everyone involved, and am glad I'm in the network.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	267257	4	/users/profile/355989	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	Like a lot of these kids, i did not have the greatest childhood growing up.  I have always wanted to help children and thought this is a great way to do that.  When I first met  "Matt Man" we had a lot in common.  During the 2 years I have mentored Matt we have become good friends, and have helped Matt get through some tough times.  Matt will now visit me a the Police station just to say hi.  Getting involved in The Mentoring Network was the best thing for me,  it has allowed myself, and Matt to grow.  Being able to spend an hour a week with Matt just hanging out, or being able to help him through his struggles is something i looked forward too each week.  Thanks Mentoring Network for allowing me to do this!

The Mentoring Network finds and trains amazing mentors. These mentors are committed to making a difference in the life of a child. It is a compassionate and caring non profit that gets visible results. These caring adults follow our transient students as they move through the valley to different elementary schools and really show they are committed to supporting kids. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	260717	5	/users/profile/349302	RHurd	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2015	The Mentoring Network honors and catalyzes the power of relationships. This is a high-impact, low-resource, replicatable and proven model that offers a life-changing-positive-impact way of being together for both the mentor and mentee. The ripple effect of what The Mentoring Network makes possible is felt throughout the community. What will it take for every community member to feel valued, seen, heard and a deep sense of belonging? The Mentoring Network strives to achieve that vision through deep community engagement as a way of being together, not something we do as an activity. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	260715	2	/users/profile/349300	DoctorDon	Donor	5	10/01/2015	My wife and I are financial supporters of the nonprofit The Mentoring Network Inc.  This organization has done a remarkable service to our area by organizing volunteer mentors to spend an hour or so each week with a student from one of several local rural school districts.  The students are referred by the school counselors because of a variety of social and academic needs.The program has been very successful at furnishing the student with an interested friend to help the student keep an interest in school and relationships.  The graduation rate of the mentored students is very high and the need for legal interaction is very rare in this group.The program is run with minimal staff but with great success.  This is money well spent!
The Mentoring Network Inc.	257201	3	/users/profile/345608	Perren	Volunteer	5	09/14/2015	I have been a volunteer with the Mentoring Network since February of 2014 and have a great relationship with a young man that is in 6th grade this year.  You never have any idea how you might influence someone with just a little bit of your time.  I was amazed when I got a report from this young man's teachers, school counselor, and principal of his improvements in grades, behavior, and overall attitude in a very short period of time.  I did nothing but listened and became his trusting friend.   I am humbled and grateful for this experience.  What an opportunity to reach out and touch a life.  These kids need all of our help.  One hour a week is so insignificant to the positive impact you can have on them.  The Mentoring Network is a huge difference maker.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	254734	1	/users/profile/343098	mario923	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/02/2015	The Mentoring Network is a non-profit organization that is more than just a place to feel good because you helped someone.  The children that get matched with Mentors, don't just gain another adult in their life.  They receive a friend who is committed to giving them a listening ear and a person to cheer them on with their dreams.  I train, work and assist Mentor's within my program and those who help with the Mentoring Network have impressed me.  I am very thankful for the help they bring daily to the children in our area and how much they continue to strive for what is possible no matter what roadblocks may seem to exist.  Truly a class-A group and non-profit.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	254600		/users/profile/342962	lself	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/01/2015	I am the school counselor at an elementary school with many students who might be categorized as "at-risk." The Mentors that my students receive through the Mentor Network spend their own time to make sure that my students feel special.  I can't say enough how the Mentors have impacted the students.  I love seeing the difference after a new match is made, the student truly blossoms.  It is amazing what an hour of one-on-one time a week can really do to brighten a child's life. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	254563		/users/profile/342912	Randee_Garrett	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/01/2015	As a counselor at a small school with a large percentage of low income families, I can easily say that the Mentoring Network is an invaluable  resource for us.  The mentors who come to us trained by the Mentoring Network are committed, reliable, loving and so generous toward our students.  They spend countless personal hours and significant financial resources to simply show our kids that they are cared about.  I have heard adult children who were mentored in the past speak about how their lives were impacted by their mentor.  It is very apparent that mentors change lives and those changed lives go on to change others.  There are very few individuals as committed to children as those who volunteer for the Mentoring Network.  I cannot speak highly enough of this program!

We have several students who have participated in mentoring through the mentoring network.  Mentoring Network is life saving for these students.

The Mentoring Network Inc.	212242		/users/profile/275217	Deborah97	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/25/2014	The Mentoring Network Inc. is a school-based mentoring program that matches a caring adult with an at-risk kid (identified as such by their counselor or teacher) during the school day and on-site at school.  Adults are from all walks of life, background screened, and masterfully matched to their mentees.  This program boasts the stellar record of not one of these at-risk kids dropping out of school or becoming involved with law enforcement while participating in the program.  Hundreds of lives have benefited over the past decade from the work of The Mentoring Network Inc.  As a professional psychotherapist, I see how the therapeutic relationship is powerful.  This non-profit at a margin of the cost of professional services accomplishes much to help the community.

I first meet my Friend Johnathon Z with and event called shop with a cop. Later I learned that I would be mentoring Johnathon. Jonathon come from a low income household. Each week I met him at his school to play and talk. I coul;d count on a big smile when I showed up and from there it was non stop talking, sharing stories and playing games. The Mentoring Network has made amazing oppertunies to spend with theses kids that may have little or no role models in their life. I am dedicated to the program and the amazing effort the Mentoring Network puuts in to change the lives of or kids.Captain Frank WyantCaldwell Police Department
The Mentoring Network Inc.	211403		/users/profile/274329	dolsen	Advisor	5	08/20/2014	The mentoring network absolutely positively has an impact on some of the highest needs students who live in our area.  I am a fifth grade teacher and I have watched matches made in 2nd or 3rd grade go into the high school level and beyond.  The work of this  organization is so effective, because of the long term relationships that vested mentors cultivate with their mentees.  I have watched this organization with great interest and can tell multiple stories of how the lives of students have been impacted  for the good!
The Mentoring Network Inc.	211310		/users/profile/274217	Idahoflygirl	Volunteer	5	08/20/2014	I am a teacher of the year at our school. I have had students' lives changed for the better from chaos to being given a reason to be at school. I also retired a few years back and have taken up mentoring. I have two students I visit with weekly and not only have I seen great kids turn better but I look forward as they do to my weekly meetings.  We talk, play games, throw frisby, and eat lunch together.  I look forward to a new school year and checking back in with my kids.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	211284		/users/profile/274193	Paul Dubya	Client Served	5	08/20/2014	I am a principal in an elementary school where several mentors are assigned.  We have a number of students with high levels of trauma and chaos in their lives.  I have seen an amazing impact when a mentor steps into the life of a student.  They meet once a week with the student and provide a positive and stable role model.  The mentors are of the highest professional quality and they continue to follow the student, even though the student and their family may bounce from school to school.  I know some mentors who have followed their kids all the way up through high school.   Last year one of our students lost their mom.  Her mentor, who had only been assigned a couple weeks earlier, stepped in and helped the extended family with the funeral.  She even shared from her heart during the service.  Wow!  These mentors really impact lives.

I have been involved with the Mentoring Network on several levels over the years.  This is an amazing organization that runs on a shoestring for what they provide.  The love, caring and compassion with which they give themselves to kids is nearly unequaled.  Not only are many children the beneficiaries of all they offer, but the mentors that work with the kids have been hand picked as to make sure everyone is given a chance to succeed.  The Mentoring Network is one of the unsung heroes as far as organizations that cater to kids.  Experiences and lots of TLC are given to help kids build self esteem, character and personal growth, so that they will have the opportunity to live  productive lives.  Kudos to the Mentoring Network.

I have seen so many positive results because of the mentoring and relationships developed over the years.  I wish more people would become mentors so we could affect more students!!
The Mentoring Network Inc.	211199		/users/profile/274093	docpaul	Client Served	5	08/19/2014	I am the principal in a school that is a regular recipient of mentors from the Mentoring Network. The Network was worked with us to help match mentors with students for long term effects and relationships. Most importantly are the positive changes we seen our mentored students. Socially awkward students have started making friends, academics have improved and classroom behaviors have become more appropriate. While we looked for other variables that would have prompted such changes, we continually came back to the addition of a the mentor. I thank you, my teachers thank you and my students thank you.

Working with this organization has had dramatic positive impact on graduation rates, truancy rates, crime rates, as well as connected many wonderful youth with caring, kind adults!!  We have been so impressed with the positive results of this program, that we now allow our employees to mentor on company time so that they share their time and talents with the children of Caldwell. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	172893		/users/profile/228894	Sharon87	Volunteer	5	10/02/2013	I have been involved with the Mentoring Network for nearly six years and it has been a very positive experience for me. Every week I would look forward to my hour with my student. It has been such a joy to watch the personal growth that each of my girls attained! My first girl just needed a boost to her self-esteem and some encouragement. She has moved out of the area and drops by occasionally. Such a beautiful young lady. My second girl has also moved, to Boise so I can no longer work with her. She had a lot of issues with lack of respect for others and by the end of school last year had made an improvement in how she treated others. We worked really hard on ways to show respect. I really miss having her in my life...but look forward to mentoring another child. It has been one of the most gratifying experiences in my life to watch these youngsters grow.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	171391		/users/profile/226937	dadams173	Volunteer	5	09/23/2013	I've been mentoring 2 kids for 5 years. One is is in 5th grade and the other is in high school.  I'm amazed just meeting with them for just 1 hour a week, how much I have seen them grow and and develop.  I am more amazed on how they have taught me about what they go through everyday.  I look forward to my time with them every week.  
The Mentoring Network Inc.	167605	1	/users/profile/222470	Mary193	Volunteer	5	09/05/2013	I have had the pleasure to be involved as a mentor with The Mentoring Network for the past 8 years.  I am having a great time with my current mentee; she is an outstanding young person.  It is not difficult, but does require a commitment of an hr. a week plus some other occasional get-togethers.  The most important thing that I do is be a friend to my young lady, but I also encourage excellent school attendance.  We talk about life, classes at school, siblings, pets, cooking and goals for her future.  Because of my age, I can give her lots of free advice and she listens to me.  I think she is fun and keeps me young. Additionally, I support her mother and all that she does for her family and try to help my mentee see how hard she works for her family.  This young lady is an excellent role mode to her five younger siblings.I love the activities the Network provides for the kids and the enthusiasm & professional attitudes the leaders provides for the program. Honestly, I have a great time and would encourage others to get involved.

The professionalism of those involved is excellent and the dedication to the kids is great to see.  They are perfect examples of selfless service to the kids at need in the comminity. I love the fact that this program is one that is through the schools in the area and that is the meeting place for the Mentor and Mentee.  This is an excellect program. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	160844		/users/profile/213254	Terri K	Volunteer	5	06/17/2013	I have been involved with The Mentoring Network for almost three years.  I volunteered to be on their board when I realized what a significant impact that they had on the lives of children, and did so with such a minimal budget.  They touch the lives of so many, with so little.  I am proud to be associated with them and cannot think of a more deserving non-profit.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	160105		/users/profile/34416	requirk	Volunteer	5	06/09/2013	I have been a volunteer with The Mentoring Network for over seven years.  What a great group of people to be associated with here in SW Idaho!  I have now worked with two different students at the elementary school.  The support the Mentoring Network offers mentors is excellent and the whole scope of the project is admirable.  As school budgets continue to be cut (and proposed tax levies fail), the role of volunteers - especially well-trained & supported ones from the Mentoring Network - is invaluable in the schools.  One hour, once a week really does change lives!  www.MentoringNetworkID.org
The Mentoring Network Inc.	159936		/users/profile/212135	Lennie	Volunteer	5	06/07/2013	I must start by saying that we are all mentors be it good or bad people look at you and see what you are doing.  This program helps me as much as my Kid.  I have had my boy for 3 years now.  I have been his shoulder when he needed it but more then that I have been able to watch him grow to a man and see the way can problem solve.  What a young man he is he has gone from a problem child in school to a student that others look to and teachers like to have in the class.  Yes it is for the kids but when you open your heart to them it is for you too.  What a program everyone needs to be part of it.  I thank Donna and staff for all that they do the kids is worth it.  Thanks Lennie
The Mentoring Network Inc.	159850		/users/profile/212032	Toni12	Volunteer	5	06/06/2013	I mentor two little girls, ages seven and ten.  It has been a privilege to work with them this past year and see them blossom.  My friends tell me how lucky they are to have me in their lives.  I tell them it is just the opposite--I am blessed to have them in my life.  I'm really looking forward to being with them for years to come, watching them continue to build their confidence.  This program is a tremendous opportunity for children, but no less so for the adults who volunteer and work with them.  My thanks and my hat is off to those who worked so hard to move this program from idea to reality.  It can't have been easy.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	159848		/users/profile/212029	Debbie Geyer	Volunteer	5	06/06/2013	I have had the privilege of mentoring three students through the Mentoring Network over the past few years.   It has been a very rewarding experience.   I truly believe the adult mentors can make such a difference in a young person's life.  I was blessed to have adult rolemodels in my formulative years that were such a positive influence in my life.  My goal is to do the same for other youth and The Mentoring Network is making it a reality.   The Mentoring Network is a wonderful organization that has made such a difference in our community and schools.  I am always sharing with other co-workers and friends how they can get involved was well.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	142297		/users/profile/188751	Molly19	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/24/2012	I worked with The Mentoring Network for six years as a school counselor. The Mentoring Network provided us with top-notch mentors who met with several of our students on a consistent, weekly basis. I was always impressed with the quality of the mentors in The Mentoring Network. All of them were highly-regarded, caring individuals who had a soft spot in their hearts for kids. What most impressed me of The Mentoring Network mentors is their consistent caring. I have worked with other mentors before who showed up inconsistently. That was not the case with The Mentoring Network mentors. They showed up every week, regardless of what was going on in their own lives, and they often brought an interesting activity to share with their mentee. I saw mentors and mentees make holiday cards, play board games, and share books together. The activities  provided a route for the mentors and mentees to connect. I would often see them laughing and talking together as they worked together. Also, The Mentoring Network mentees would continue their students for years. That sense of continuity and consistency gave my students a feeling a connectedness that they so desperately needed. The Mentoring Network fills a huge need in our community and it is an organization that I trust and respect to always do what's best for kids!
The Mentoring Network Inc.	142011		/users/profile/188430	Sue_41	Client Served	5	11/21/2012	My son Mark is an Asperger Syndrome child, he was so lonely and bullied in grade school, he just never fit in. He was enrolled in the mentoring program in 6th grade and it literally changed his life. His friendship with Donna gave him self-confidence and gave him the introduction to social skills that we as parents were unable to do. Coming from Donna things made more sense to him, he didn't battle her the way he did with us, and accepted her advice as help not criticism. He graduated from High School this year and I am so proud of the young man he has become, I sincerely believe without the mentoring programs guidance and encouragement he wouldn't be where he is today. The program involved him in social functions, fun events, and learning programs that got him out of his comfort zone and into the adventure of the real world with others. We are so grateful for everything the program does for the kids in need in our community!!
The Mentoring Network Inc.	141158		/users/profile/187410	Shelley E.	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I have been mentoring the same student for almost 3 years, and it is such a blessing to watch her grow and mature.  The Mentoring Network offers students a chance to have an adult mentor with whom they can develop a meaningful relationship.  There are so many great kids already benefiting from this program and in reality every child needs a mentor who they can call a friend.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	141139		/users/profile/187386	REGreenlee	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/19/2012	I have had the pleasure of facilitating a mentoring relationship with students at my school.  As a school counselor, I frequently receive information about students' lives and the impact of their circumstances on their academic performance and general well-being.  The students at my school who have been in mentoring relationships through The Mentoring Network transform from sullen to smiling.  One teacher remarked, "I wish I had 30 of him" (of the mentor) because she was so impressed with the impact on her student and the benefits mentors could provide to her entire class.  This mentor proved his dedication by continuing a mentoring relationship through letters when the student moved to another part of the state.  The mentors receive an excellent orientation prior to beginning and I am impressed by the organization, opportunities for summer camp, and data from The Network.  I have to agree with the teacher quoted above--I wish we had many more mentors available.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	141134		/users/profile/187380	school counselor	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/19/2012	The Mentoring Network is a meaningful program which helps kids experience genuine kindness and acceptance.  
The Mentoring Network Inc.	141088		/users/profile/187318	dprice	Board Member	5	11/18/2012	One hour a week truly does change a childs life!  Working with The Mentoring Network the past few years has afforded me the opportunity to hear many, many stories of kids that have been positively impacted through spending time with their adult mentor.  This organization is one of the most efficient organizations that I have been a part of.  Over 140 current matches with a staff of 1.5.  No doubt that a donor's investment goes a long way with this group.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	140597		/users/profile/186798	chelseapelton	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/16/2012	I am a counselor in the Nampa School District, and have seen amazing things come from the Mentoring Network! The mentors that they set up with our students are truely making a difference in these kids lives. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	140582		/users/profile/186781	Sue_39	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	I am in my 3rd year of mentoring the same child.  When I was first approached to be a mentor, I said no.  Then, when it was explained to me, that the child was very sad because he didn't have a mom, due to her death at my mentee's age 3, I decided to just try it and I have was pleasently surprised.  I was able to show up as a  mentor every week for an hour my first year.   During my 2nd year, we ended up getting a new 2nd home, where I began spending a lot of time.  I asked my mentee if he wanted a new Mentor that could show up each week, and he said no, he would take me whenever I could show up.  So, I began coming just once a month, which was still very satisfying for both of us.  This year, I have been able to see him more often.  I look forward to every meeting with my mentee.  He is always so excited when he sees me waiting for him in the office, which reminds me that this is good for both of us.  We spend time talking and playing games, which is one of his favorite things.  When it's good weather, we play outside.  Every winter, we make something special for a Christmas gift for his Dad, and he really loves this, as he normally wouldn't have anything to give his Dad for Christmas.  My mentee really loves hot chocolate, so each time I see him, I bring him a thermos of hot chocolate, which he enjoys immensly.  If I have any homemade treats, I also bring these, which he loves, since he doesn't have a mom to make these goodies for him.  When there is a special occasion in his class, I will bring treats for all, and this makes him so happy as he is able to share with his class members.  I try to go to his sports events and support him.  I love being able to watch the games and I think he likes me coming to watch him.  He told me that he had a friend who needed a mentor, because the boy was acting out.  He thought that having a mentor would help his friend.  This is further confirmation that this is a great program. The mentoring network is awesome and I really think that it helps kids as well as the adults.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	140559		/users/profile/186758	pacsms	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2012	An boy with some anger issues, has a constant adult in his life.   No matter what he may or may not have done each week, she shows up to be One Of His People.   It makes a difference.   A girl who struggles with self esteem has an adult that thinks she is wonderful and treats her as such.  It makes a difference.  A young boy working on making better decisions in his life, has a role model that is firm, but fun.    It makes a difference.  These are examples of the mentors that come to our school.    Our kids are so thankful for the mentors provided by The Mentoring Network and we are, too.       South Middle School
The Mentoring Network Inc.	140552		/users/profile/186752	Sziemer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/16/2012	I work as an elementary school counselor in the Nampa School District.  I have seen mentors from the Mentoring Network change lives and help put kids back on a positive track.  Sometimes a student's needs are truly overwhelming, and yet, one person in their lives can and does make a huge difference.  That student now has a caring person to help direct them, dialogue with them, and give the valuable feedback for their decision-making and choices, where they may go unchecked before.  This one person walking into their lives can help foster a relationship of support and positive rapport that generates encouragement for a child like non other.  A student often needs that one person who is not an authority figure, who helps draw the safe and healthy boundaries that lead a student down the road of success.  Mentors do all that, and more!!  Thanks to the Mentoring Network for helping youth in a big way. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	140523		/users/profile/186716	Scott45	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/16/2012	I am a school counselor and have had several kids mentored by your fine people.  All of the kids have had a very positive experience.  On my end you have been a pleasure to work with also.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	140518		/users/profile/186709	Jennifer Deroin	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	I am both a volunteer, a board member, and a donor.  I've been mentoring the same girl for the past seven years and to watch her grow in confidence during this time has been a real gift for me.   The Mentoring Network provides a safe mentoring opportunity for both volunteers and their mentees in a school-based setting.  It's run so efficiently and so effectively, I'm convinced it's the best return on investment for anyone involved in any capacity - as a volunteer, as a donor, or as a friend of the network, you know that your gift is being well utilized to help change the course for a child that so very much needs our help!
The Mentoring Network Inc.	140502		/users/profile/186688	mpalmer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/16/2012	I'm a school counselor in the Nampa School District, one of the districts served by the Mentoring Network.  I have seen firsthand the significant positive impacts this program has for youth who need, more than anything else, a committed positive adult in their lives.  I have many things I can offer to kids: groups, individual work with me, incentive programs, assistance with coping.  But for kids in certain circumstances, those things cannot substitute for the committment of another human being who says, with their weekly attendance and consistency, "you are worth my time".  Many of these children have never had a person make this kind of promise to them and they've never had someone's undivided attention for a whole hour, simply because someone chooses to give it.  I've seen a child's life path altered, for the better, over and over, and unbelievably quickly.   Sending a message to a child like, "Simply because I care for you, I will spend my time with you every week.  I will be here for you.  You will be able to count on me, because I will keep my promise."  That changes people in a profound way.  Hearts change.  Approaches to life change.  Belief in others changes.  Trust and hope begin to blossom.  Solutions are found.  Grades improve.  Behavior improves.  I had one child who could always name at least 3 people whose fault it was that his homework wasn't done, that he'd punched someone, that he'd cursed on the playground, etc.  After 3 months of mentoring, his attitude improved and he began to say things like, "I know my grades are low.  I didn't turn in my assignments.  That's my fault."  His whole life will be different because he is now taking responsiblity for his decisions.  He will grow to be a different man.  The differences seem small at first, but they are huge in terms of life trajectory.  Mentoring Network makes these things possible.   It is an organization run with great integrity and a heart for changing the world, one child at a time.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	139362		/users/profile/185475	fairlight	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	As an organizational development expert, I know change happens one individual at a time, and the Mentoring Network changes many lives for the better with its program.  I so believe in this program because I can see it making a difference to both mentee and mentor.  It is rewarding to have a chance to be a special friend to a young person and it helps kids see the world has people who want them  to have good lives. The way the mentoring is set up it builds real connections and genuine concern. I think it is a priviledge to be a mentor.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	139360		/users/profile/185473	Barblynn	Volunteer	4	11/14/2012	What a great experience for both me and my mentee!  We have been two years together now and I can see a remarkable difference with Abby, our conection, her behavior, and my feelings for her.  I am not sure who is learning the most, Abby or myself.  I am so glad I got into this program and I urge anyone with an extra hour a week to give, try it it works.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	139328		/users/profile/185441	Jamie Milan	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	This is my second school year with my mentee, and it has been such an amazing experience for me. The second my mentee and I met, we instantly bonded. Each week he brings a light to my day, and brings me back to reality. I know being a constant in his life has added to his self esteem and school work, but he brings me just as much joy when I get to spend time with him. -Jamie M. 
The Mentoring Network Inc.	139240		/users/profile/185343	rajbucci	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	This is my third year as a mentor with The Mentoring Network, Inc.  I started with a mentee who was in 7th grade.  She is now a freshman in high school.  It has been such a positive experience that at the end of last school year, I agreed to mentor another student who is now in 5th grade.  There is so much to be learned and experienced by the mentor and mentee.  There is conversation, creativity, getting to know a special human being and their getting to know you.  In sharing in each other's lives, you experience joy (Joy of Youth).  The program is designed in the best interest of each child.  I find it to be a very fulfilling way to use my time and would recommend it to any person who has a genuine interest in the well being of children.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	139182		/users/profile/185292	Brdawa	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	I have been a board member of The Mentoring Network since 2010 and it has been nothing but a positive experience. I have met many of our mentors and the kids they work with. The results are incredible. One hour a week can make a difference in someones life. Recently (November 2012) I became a mentor for a young man in one of our school districts. I have met with him only twice but already have a connection with him that hopefully grows into a great friendship. The Mentoring Network is truly a game changer for kids that need that little bit extra in life. I hope to be a board member as long as they let me.
The Mentoring Network Inc.	139173		/users/profile/185277	Kenton Lee	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I have been volunteering with The Mentoring Network for two years now.  And I absolutely love it.  I work with a young man every week for about an hour.  We play basketball together and talk about school, family, and life.  I care a lot about him, and I am excited to mentor him throughout his school years.                 I would not have been able to have this relationship if not for The Mentoring Network.  They do a very professional and compassionate job of connecting mentors and mentees.  And they do an incredible job staying in touch with the students during the summer.  Great people who are always helping and looking for others to join them.  It has been my pleasure to do so.
Orphan Acres Inc.	194329	22	/users/profile/253915	APK62,	Volunteer	5	02/14/2014	I have been donating and volunteering at this organization for almost two years, and I find Brent's (the president of Orphan Acres) dedication and tenacity inspiring. Currently, over 80 horses reside at this wonderful nonprofit, either living out their lives, or waiting to be adopted into a forever and loving home. Some horses are brought from horrific situations, and are then rehabilitated at this sanctuary. Most horses are brought in because the owner could either no longer care or afford the horse, so many of these horses have great potential and would make a great family pet. Going out and volunteering is really a great experience because you get to bond with all different kinds of horses, and help your community. This organization is in great need of help, for both manual labor, and financial expenses. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone.
Orphan Acres Inc.	319766	1	/users/profile/411605	taymorgan10	Volunteer	5	12/03/2016	Today was my first time volunteering at Orphan Acres, the first of many. I had a great experience during my time here, spending time with the horses and helping around the farm. It's an amazing thing that Orphan Acres does for these horse, cares for them, loves them, feeds them. I would definitely recommend volunteering at Orphan Acres to my friends, it is something everyone should experience for themselves. 
Orphan Acres Inc.	318396		/users/profile/409564	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/06/2016	The things that Orphan Acres does for these horses is remarkable. I am always happy to help out here, I feel like it benefits me almost as much as it benefits the horses. Overall, great place I fell in love it.
Orphan Acres Inc.	307774	3	/users/profile/399117	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/03/2016	I have volunteered with Orphan Acres several times over the past three years that I've attended Washington State University, and each time is more rewarding than the last. My sorority has done multiple service projects at Orphan Acres. When we first got there, Brent gave us a brief history lesson of the ranch and how he came to care for dozens of horses. His passion for his nonprofit organization was warming and my sorority sisters and I took it to heart. We've volunteered at Orphan Acres multiple times since then and will continue to volunteer with Brent for as long as he needs us.

Orphan Acres Inc.	305794	3	/users/profile/397070	ksaxe0467	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	I began volunteering at Orphan Acres in April of 2016.  It has been an invaluable experience and I have learned so much.  This organization provides a safe space for community members to volunteer at any commitment level and prior horse experience.  I started volunteering with very little horse experience, and have learned more and more with each visit.  This organization is backed by dedicated volunteers, a selfless owner, and generous donors.  My life has been profoundly impacted through this organization and the interactions I have had with the horses.  
Orphan Acres Inc.	305765	2	/users/profile/397042	Quinn2	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	I have been volunteering at Orphan Acres for about a year now. I had never been around horses before and was unsure at first to enter such a large herd. It turns out they are very gentle and fun to be around! Now I have learned not just how to brush horses and clean stalls, but also how to interact with horses, train them, and read their personalities. The owner, Brent, is always willing teach if you want to learn more about horses. Orphan Acres is a great place to volunteer if you like to get outside and hang out with animals like I do.
Orphan Acres Inc.	302468	2	/users/profile/393603	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/02/2016	It is an amazing place!  We were welcomed with open arms to go reach out to all of the horses.  He even invited us to help out when the hay was coming in.  The owner knows every horse by name, age and condition.  All 80 of them.

Orphan Acres Inc.	287416	3	/users/profile/377510	Laura289	Volunteer	5	04/27/2016	I started Volunteering at Orphan Acres in January, and am extremely impressed with the operation. I have never met someone with a more giving heart than the president, Brent. He has a unique relationship with each one of his animals and it is easy to see they all love him very much. With Brent no horse is a bad horse, and every horse is worth saving. When at OA, you are surrounded by success stories from this philosophy. Volunteering has become a part of my weekly (and sometimes daily) schedule and while I try to do everything I can to help Brent and the horses, I am unable to repay them for the invaluable experience and horse therapy they give to me. In an effort to help raise money for Orphan Acres, I have designed some home decor and accessories using photos of the horses. These items are for sale on Etsy and can be found with a simple search of "orphan acres" All proceeds from sales of these items will be donated to OA. 
Orphan Acres Inc.	282131	4	/users/profile/372248	Anna27	Volunteer	5	03/11/2016	I recently volunteered at Orphan Acres Inc. and was blown away by the dedication of all the volunteers and Brent. He truly cares for the welfare of these horses as well as making them as comfortable as possible. I thoroughly enjoyed helping plant trees and brush horses. I cannot wait until I have the opportunity to go back and help some more. This is a one-of-a-kind experience no person should pass up. 
Orphan Acres Inc.	281104	4	/users/profile/371127	Writer	Volunteer	4	02/29/2016	I visited Orphan Acres twice and each time the experience left me with a memory that will last forever. I find beauty in the outdoors and in the life of animals so spending time helping the farmers of this ranch was a pleasure!
Orphan Acres Inc.	270632	1	/users/profile/359356	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/01/2015	I volunteer with this organization when I can, and find it to be accomplishing incredible things. Unfortunately, it seems to be constantly in need of long term volunteers to function more autonomously and let the operators of Orphan Acres work without having to constantly tell volunteers what needs done. Regardless, an amazing volunteer organization maintained by truly compassionate people.
Orphan Acres Inc.	268253	2	/users/profile/22676	morahsandy	Donor	5	10/28/2015	I visited Orphan Acres on Sunday, October 25th, 2015.  It's an amazing place and doing really important work to save the lives of abused and abandoned horses.  They've worked very hard to rehabilitate horses and find loving homes for many of them over the years.  I'm making a donation today, and I encourage all people concern with animal welfare to join me in supporting Orphan Acres.  Thank you, Brent for the big zucchini which I turned into zucchini bread when I returned home to Issaquah.
Orphan Acres Inc.	267418	2	/users/profile/356150	Cecilia A.	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	I helped brush and interacted with the horses.  I cleaned out the food and water bins which made it a good workout.   The personnel were very friendly.
Orphan Acres Inc.	266550	3	/users/profile/355312	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/22/2015	Went out to complete required hours for a class but plan on becoming a regular volunteer. You can tell how much Brent cares for these horses and the effort put into their care is amazing. Can't wait to come back and help!
Orphan Acres Inc.	264825	3	/users/profile/353550	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/17/2015	As a new student orientation leader at the University of Idaho, I took a group of students to volunteer at Orphan Acres as a part of our "Serve Your New Community" project. Myself and my students were amazed to find such a wonderful organization in our small town, the things they do to rehabilitate and find forever homes for horses is so wonderful! It's all done on volunteer time, and they've rehomed over 2000 horses. Everyone who is there full time is so passionate about what they do and it is such an incredible operation!
Orphan Acres Inc.	263033	2	/users/profile/351742	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	Every time i have gone i have had a great time helping brent with chores that need to be done.  The horses are well taken care of and watching brent interact with them is really amazing especially since he knows all of their names and stories. 
Orphan Acres Inc.	262982	3	/users/profile/351686	Kent_M	Volunteer	5	10/11/2015	Orphan Acres provides a great service to the community by providing a home for horses that need one.  The horses are well cared for by the on-site caretakers, and a host of volunteers regularly come from local universities, and surrounding communities to pitch in to help with the chores as well as the ongoing maintenance needs of the farm.  There is always plenty that needs to be done and it is fun to get involved when it is obvious that the help is needed and appreciated.
Orphan Acres Inc.	194329	22	/users/profile/253915	APK62,	Volunteer	5	02/14/2014	I have been donating and volunteering at this organization for almost two years, and I find Brent's (the president of Orphan Acres) dedication and tenacity inspiring. Currently, over 80 horses reside at this wonderful nonprofit, either living out their lives, or waiting to be adopted into a forever and loving home. Some horses are brought from horrific situations, and are then rehabilitated at this sanctuary. Most horses are brought in because the owner could either no longer care or afford the horse, so many of these horses have great potential and would make a great family pet. Going out and volunteering is really a great experience because you get to bond with all different kinds of horses, and help your community. This organization is in great need of help, for both manual labor, and financial expenses. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone.
Orphan Acres Inc.	262979	3	/users/profile/351683	Lynn_M	Volunteer	5	10/11/2015	This is an amazing place that helps abandoned/neglected horses.  Every weekend students from WSU, UofI,  and local community members come out to volunteer for a few hours or all day.  To be able to work with these horses is a true gift for the horses and the volunteers.
Orphan Acres Inc.	262962	2	/users/profile/351665	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/11/2015	Really enjoyed volunteering at orphan acres! The horses are all very sweet and the owner truly cares about each one of them. Would recommend this for both  large groups and individuals. Please consider volunteering! They need all of the help they can get!! 
Orphan Acres Inc.	262961	3	/users/profile/351664	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/11/2015	Such a great place! I went with a group to volunteer and there was so much that needed to be done, we helped feeding and brushing the horses and some of our group even helped with building new fences. They need a great deal of volunteer help as well as financial help, but they are truly worth your time and money and need to be recognized as they are such an amazing organization!
Orphan Acres Inc.	262896	3	/users/profile/351596	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/11/2015	I absolutely love going out to Orphan Acres to volunteer. It's such an amazing opportunity to get horse handling and care experience. Plus, Brent knows every horses' name (he has over 70!), and will tell many of the stories about how certain horses arrived at the rescue while you're helping with the chores. As a pre-vet student, it's exciting to be able to ask questions to the visiting vets while they work on the horses, and everyone is very willing to explain what they are doing, why they are doing it, and to allow you to feel/hear/see what exactly they're looking for while they examine the horses. I always look forward to coming back!
Orphan Acres Inc.	262867	2	/users/profile/351564	Patty123	Volunteer	5	10/10/2015	I love volunteering at Orphan Acres.  Helping the horses is such a gratifying and humbling experience.  I always learn so much about them and I love how accomplished and exhausted I am afterwards.  Such an amazing experience! 
Orphan Acres Inc.	262762	2	/users/profile/351457	Arika A.	Volunteer	5	10/09/2015	I really enjoyed helping out at Orphan Acres. It was an amazing experience to spend time with the beautiful horses. I'm so happy that there is a place like this to take in horses in order to treat them humanely and to fully take care of them. This is a great place, and I recommend visiting to see all the kind things that are being done for animals in need.
Orphan Acres Inc.	261213	1	/users/profile/349809	Writer	Volunteer	4	10/02/2015	I have personally donated to this organization and it was so rewarding! These horses and the people that care for them, do tremendous amounts of work!

Orphan Acres Inc.	248274	4	/users/profile/335980	CourtneyRaven	Volunteer	5	07/13/2015	Brent knows all of the horses by name! He truly cares about every animal he has in his care! I have volunteered here a few times and every time has been wonderful. All the horses, and any other animal, has been healthy and well taken care of. 
Orphan Acres Inc.	248273	5	/users/profile/335979	Jcsd	General Member of the Public	5	07/13/2015	All you need to see is the video of these beautiful creatures being horses to know that they are lucky to have been given sanctuary at Orphan Acres.  I wish I had the ability to help in a more substantial way.  I believe in this nonprofit's mission and hope others can and will step up to keep it running for the sake of these horses and others that need rescuing.

I got a chance to meet Brent, and was surprised by how kind he was. This is a great place to spend some time to help out with the horses. :) 
Orphan Acres Inc.	235188	6	/users/profile/314578	flesher12	Volunteer	5	12/09/2014	I volunteered here and I loved it. It is obvious to me that everyone there really cares about the animals. They were also extremely nice to volunteers, showing how greatly appreciated we were. They gave us hot chocolate because it was cold and windy outside while we were working. I helped give the horses de-wormers and brushed their coats. Everyone there was amazing to work with. It's a great place.
Orphan Acres Inc.	235075	5	/users/profile/312428	draftyacres	Client Served	5	12/07/2014	I met Brent Glover several years ago as a delivery driver in his area. After researching his organization I find that very few people are as compassionate and knowledgeable  about horses as he is. His dedication is understood only after a visit to his rescue. His organization is responsible for saving literally thousands of perfectly good horses. The proof is in the pudding!
Orphan Acres Inc.	235048	5	/users/profile/311559	Hannahf996	Volunteer	5	12/06/2014	Loved volunteering here! Everyone was so kind and truly showed a passion for what they do! It's easy to tell that their intentions are genuine and that they have a true love for helping others!

Orphan Acres Inc.	234622	7	/users/profile/301626	anne.p.39	Volunteer	5	11/29/2014	Im a volunteer at Orphan Acres. I admire Brents dedication and respect for the horses, the boundless patience and infinite love he has for them. I love going to Orphan Acres, working there and meeting other volunteers. This is such a noble cause and it is the most rewarding work you can ever do. You can help care for the horses, get to know them and have memorable moments with these wonderful animals. I feel like what you give comes back to you tenfold. Its an amazing experience. I wish I had known about Orphan Acres many years ago and volunteered a lot sooner.
Orphan Acres Inc.	234621	6	/users/profile/301625	sercos	Volunteer	5	11/29/2014	I have gone to Orphan Acres about 3 times now, and every time I am amazed by the selfless dedication of Brent Glover, the president of the organization. He toils year long through thick and thin with the help of other volunteers to give the horses of the sanctuary the best possible lives. Despite not being what one would call an "animal person," the satisfaction of knowing I did something to help these animals is enough to ensure that I will return.
Orphan Acres Inc.	234545	2	/users/profile/300227	dcm242	Volunteer	4	11/27/2014	I have been to Orphan Acres about 5 times, in the times i have gone there i have brushed the horses, fed them, and cleaned stalls. Orphan Acres, however, really needs more volunteer help, along with donations. Brent (the president of Orphan Acres) cares for the 80 horses on their property and cares for them 24/7. I wish to see this organization grow to be able to support the current animals and future ones as well. The reason I put 4 stars in stead of 5 is because it needs more support to reach its full potential in the near or far future to come.   P.S. (It also counts for volunteer hours if thats something you need)
Orphan Acres Inc.	233891	5	/users/profile/297909	Mark-V95	Volunteer	5	11/18/2014	I have been volunteering here about once every weekend or other weekend for the past year and I find that Orphan Acres is not only a great place for the horses to go when they need help, but it is also a great learning experience for those that come out to volunteer. Whether its learning how to feed them, haltering, putting blankets on, brushing, walking the blind horses or working on many of the construction projects there you will always learn something. Going out there for over a year, I find that I still learn something new every time, but I also try to teach those that come out for there first or second time. Recently we started putting blankets on for the winter and I learned how to put the blanket on, then showed several people how to catch, halter them, and put blankets on. The horses there are often very friendly because of the care that they get there. This shows that the horses truly are getting rehabilitated, but also allows the volunteers to enjoy the company of the horses as well and helps them become less afraid and more confident around horses. Overall, this is a great organization that Brent has going there and he could definitely use all the help that he can get whether monetary or as volunteer work.

Orphan Acres Inc.	231142	6	/users/profile/294745	Lynelle	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	My daughter and I have had the distinct pleasure of volunteering at Orphan Acres for a few years.  Brent Glover has made it his life's work to give neglected and rejected horses a home.  Brent is a patient man and has taught us so much about horses, ourselves and life.  Although his place seems and appears (at first sight) to be run down, it is just the opposite.  Orphan Acres currently has over 80 horses they care for and when no volunteers are able to be there, Brent does everything on his own.  With what little money he obtains from donations, he insures these horses have a food in their bellies, roofs over their heads and medication when needed.  Brent has truly made his mark in this world.  We love Orphan Acres and our time spent there.  Brent is a wonderful individual and Horse Whisperer.  Brent Glover is a very dedicated, caring individual that has earned the respect of his volunteers and horses that supersede anything Ive ever seen.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend stopping by for a tour.  Thank you Brent for all you do and for all you have taught us.  Lynelle and McKenzie
Orphan Acres Inc.	229193	5	/users/profile/292848	LeeAnne123	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	My children, my high school students, and I have volunteered occasionally at Orphan Acres for over 10 years.  Brent Glover, the director, is selfless in his dedication to the horses. He effectively models and mentors others in the art of "gentling" horses.  Volunteers are always needed, and Brent is more than willing to share his expertise to train them. Orphan Acres is a great place to help horses who have been mistreated or neglected and to give something back to these majestic and deserving creatures.  
Orphan Acres Inc.	229181	5	/users/profile/292837	Panzer7	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	I've been to Orphan Acres several times, and I can guarantee that it's an amazing place, yet it needs your help. Brent is a hardworking man, and his work deserves more recognition. He has dedicated his life to rescuing horses from all different kinds of neglect. You can help Orphan Acres by donating, volunteering, and following their work on social media; Facebook. It's a great cause, and your help will make a difference in the horses' lives. Help is always needed, I highly recommend this non-profit organization.
Orphan Acres Inc.	229170	5	/users/profile/183725	Cindy56	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	I relocated four years ago from Tucson to come and help Brent and his wonderful horses. I love volunteering there each weekend. Brent truly cares for each and every horse. He has rehomed 3900 horses in 39 years. He knows each horses name and their story. We love donations and if you are local here in Northern Idaho come and volunteer. My company Earth and Animal wellness helps with safe products at the horse rescue and at the ranch.  If you want to know how you can help with fund raising email me at Cindy earthandanimalwellness.com
Orphan Acres Inc.	137727	9	/users/profile/183725	Cindy56	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	I have been working with Orphan Acres, Horse Rescue for two years. I love all animals, especially horses and when I met Brent Glover from Orphan Acres, the summer of 2009, on the internet, I had to go up to Viola, Idaho and meet him and the horses he has rescued. I flew up 3 times the summer of 2010.  Brent has 75 abused, abandoned and orphaned horses that he takes care of.  Some of them have been so abused, they can never be rehomed. He has found homes for 2500.  In the 35 years, he has devoted his life to taking care of horses, he knows each of them by name. They respond to him, run to him and he is like the Horse Whisperer. I relocated from Tucson, AZ up to Princeton, Idaho to help him with fund raising and also take care of my "Horse fix.".  I had 3 of his horses this summer on my 8 acres. I brought my husband, my 4 rescue dogs and 3 indoor cats. Brent is loved and respected by all of the people in the Palouse Community. That entails the City of Moscow, the City of Pullman, Washington, Troy, Viola and other surrounding cities. He has many volunteers that come out to help take care of the horses and we also have Washington State Vet students that come out to get experience with taking care of the horses. I highly recommend this sanctuary and respect the work that Brent does.  Come out and visit us or see us on the internet at www.orphanacres.org.
Orphan Acres Inc.	229166	4	/users/profile/292826	wildhorseaction	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	Orphan Acres and Brent, who runs the sanctuary, are the real deal. The horses come first no matter what. My partner and I volunteered to help at the sanctuary about 4 years ago when we were on the road traveling. Brent treated us like we were family those 4 days when we were helping on the ranch which is the same way he treats all of the horses under his care--like family. He has a magic touch with these animals which was a joy to see. They know he's there for them 100%. We've been donors to OA ever since that wonderful experience. Keep up the great work for the horses, Brent!
Orphan Acres Inc.	229111	4	/users/profile/292774	Stephen42	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	Orphan Acres is one of the few non-profit organizations that actually dedicates 100% of their time into doing their work. Orphan Acres is an organization that deserves every penny donated to them, and much more. The people of this organization show a pure passion for what they do. They save the lives of countless animals of all species, but not only that, they change the lives of all the people that get involved. Without Orphan Acres, thousands of lives would have been lost. I highly recommend not only donating to this organization, but volunteering also. You will not only change the lives of the animals you help, but they will change your life too. Orphan Acres is an incredibly important organization to the community of Latah County. It has inspired hundreds of people from  all walks of life, including high schools, elementary schools, and the community as a whole. I HIGHLY recommend this incredible organization.
Orphan Acres Inc.	228947	3	/users/profile/292623	imusic	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I have volunteered for Orphan Acres for 5 years. They show true care and compassion for all the horses. One person who is the heart and soul of Orphan Acres has devoted his life to saving these noble animals.
Orphan Acres Inc.	227991	4	/users/profile/291700	nell.lokteff	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	This organization shows true care and compassion to those who really need it. Getting to see these animals revived and full of life again is amazing, and being part of that is a real gift. Not only do I get to help the horses and give them a second chance, but they help me too. I have always had a small fear of horses. The atmosphere, other volunteers, and sweet animals have helped me in overcoming this fear.
Orphan Acres Inc.	226807	4	/users/profile/290541	Axel77	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2014	I have known Orphan Acres now for several years and have to say that this is an absolutely amazing place.  It is run by a person, Brent, who really puts his life into the cause of helping horses and he has that magic touch.  Orphan Acres has become an important part of my wife and daughter's life, who both like to spend as much time there as possible.  Whereas helping is only one part of the equation, the organization needs support from the public, i.e., volunteering and financial support.  I can only say that one would be hard pressed finding a better local cause to support than this animal refuge. I highly recommend it!

Orphan Acres Inc.	205002	5	/users/profile/267084	Earthandanimal	Volunteer	5	07/02/2014	I relocated from Tucson, AZ to Northern Idaho 4 years ago  to volunteer and help with marketing for Orphan Acres. This horse rescue has been around for 30 years and Brent Glover does a great job with all of the horses. We always need help with volunteering and so many of them would love a good home. I just moved to 6 acres in Lenore, Idaho and I am getting up fencing so I can take two maybe three of them. I am a beginner rider and I know who ever I take, will be welcome at our home. We have 4 rescue dogs and 8 cats.  5 of our barn cats live in the loft of our cabin. I love going to Orphan acres as often as I can and I also donate when I can too.  If you are in the Palouse area, we love volunteers and also need help with representing our booth at the Farmers Market in Moscow on Saturday mornings.
Orphan Acres Inc.	141918	5	/users/profile/188329	Katy T.	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	I only volunteered at Orphan Acres a couple of times. Wish I would have gone more often especially since I don't live in that area now. I don't have much horse experience, but everyone was made to feel welcome. I most enjoyed going out to the barns, feeding/grooming. There's always work to be done here. I'm sure Brent can use help any day/time. 
Orphan Acres Inc.	137194	5	/users/profile/183151	Katie R.	Volunteer	5	11/11/2012	Being able to go out to Orphan Acres Inc. and do good work - knowing that it is helping both people and animals is a great feeling. It doesn't feel like volunteer work -it feels good, its not boring, not hard and most of all it IS important. Brent Glover was nice enough to allow Alpha Rho Chi the opportunity to help build a new barn for the horses. We are rushing to get it done before winter and although we have run into challenges throughout the process of the build so far we are constantly learning and making progress. We are able to harness our skills to give back to the horses and community. We are lucky to have this opportunity to work and use our skills to help the horses in need. 
Orphan Acres Inc.	133354	6	/users/profile/179065	BJ R.	General Member of the Public	5	11/04/2012	I first became aware of Orphan Acres when I needed to do some research for a screenplay which in part included a horse rescue operation.  In doing so, I became fascinated with the place and the dedicated man behind it. I have never visited Orphan Acres in person but have followed as closely as possible via news, website and social networks. You do not have to go to Idaho in order to comprehend what Brent Glover and his volunteers do.  Running any kind of animal rescue is not for the faint of heart but one man made it his mission to save horses. While I am able to do very little from TN except for raising  awareness,   I commend all the local people who show up to lend a hand.  
Orphan Acres Inc.	133186	7	/users/profile/178890	Creat	Volunteer	4	11/03/2012	In a time of an unstable economy many people are leave their pets. One of the hardest hit industries is the equine industry.  Brent Glover of Orphan Acres Inc. has taken it upon himself to home these animals in hopes they can find love and a family somewhere else. They always have something different to do when volunteering. Sense volunteers are the main support of the rescue I find myself doing different things everyday. My only wish is that this place be more organized for volunteers, other then that is warm welcoming and I feel like I am helping and making a difference.

The First Tee of Idaho	221225		/users/profile/284931	KateMcGwire	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	The thing that really stood out for me with The First Tee of Idaho is how dedicated the volunteers and staff members are to the children benefiting from the program. They all show such passion in getting kids on the golf course and making a difference in their lives. The passion resonates with the kids. They can feel it, they can see it. These individuals invest so much that these children can't help but benefit. The game of golf is such a great way to teach children about character and life skills but even more than that, these kids build confidence in themselves. That comes from the dedication of the staff and volunteers and for a young person, that is priceless. 
The First Tee of Idaho	220593		/users/profile/284260	kevinandmaggie	Client Served	5	10/07/2014	My husband & I were thoroughly impressed with the First Tee program this past summer. It was our first experience with the program as our daughter had just turned 6 and wanted to try out the sport of golf. Not only did she acquire some basic skills for beginners, but she also came away with some wonderful life lessons. One of our favorite moments was when she learned that anyone can play golf - they simulated playing golf with one arm, standing on one foot, blindfolded, standing on the range ball baskets, and placing a ball under their shirts as if pregnant. The whole session was incredible, and we look forward to another session next summer!
The First Tee of Idaho	219433		/users/profile/283047	AJacobs	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2014	My experience with the importance golf in the life of a youngster is with my family.  My son learned golf from his grandfather, began to play at a young age, and became a caddy at age 14.  He is now an adult working in the industry.  Golf has a way of helping kids learn processes, manners, goals, strategies, how to get someplace on time and do a great job even when its physically taxing, and its all topped off by meeting some fabulous people and getting some one-of-a-kind experiences because of those people.  Helping kids who may not have another way to learn these life skills  thats a fabulous idea.  I wish First Tee of Idaho all the best!

The First Tee of Idaho	177138		/users/profile/233656	Jennifer267	Client Served	5	10/12/2013	I found First Tee through a friend of mine a few years ago. My son, who was 8 at the time, started showing an interest in golf. I'm a single mom and couldn't afford private golf lessons, but First Tee of Idaho allowed my son to take lessons at an affordable rate and further his knowledge of the game. He's 12 now and has greatly excelled in his abilities thanks to the wonderful instructors. I also like the "life lessons through golf" concept. He's become a more responsible child and better golfer since starting, even winning a longest drive contest and longest chip contest this year. My favorite part is seeing the pride my son has when he golfs well. He's not your typical boy and didn't enjoy the typical boy sports so had never had that feeling before. Golf is something he loves and we would have never been able to let him blossom in this sport without First Tee of Idaho. Thank you!

(Honestly, Integrity, Sportsmanship, Respect, Confidence,  Responsibility, Perseverance, Courtesy and Judgement).  The coaches are great with the kids and the program is very cost efficient.  They also offer a club loaner program.  This gives a set of clubs to the participants for them to use as long as they are involved in the program.  If the kids outgrow the clubs they just talk to their coach and exchange them for the proper size.  I highly recommend this program

My husband is active duty military solider and our two boys were awarded a scholarship their first class. After the first class the boys (and us) were hooked on golf and First Tee's whole person approach. Besides teaching the game and techniques of golf. They reinforced values such as honesty, integrity not only in golf but life as well. One of the first lessons that I loved was they taught the boys how to approach a stranger, shake their hands, look them in the eye and introduce themselves. The instructors are top notch who are so committed to First Tee and their students. The boys have been involved now for three years and have had the same group of instructors whom have really helped shape and evolve them into young men who can not only play a great game of golf but can follow rules, have integrity, honesty and know how to act respectful not only on a golf course but can relate those values to most part of their lives.  After the first class we knew how much the boys wanted to continue but we couldn't afford it. But First Tee stepped up and has provided scholarships to the boys all three years! The boys know it is a privilege to go to each class and we are so thankful to First Tee of Idaho and ALL their supporters who have made it possible for our boys! GREAT GREAT organization!!!

Many local golf courses offer them, but they are very, very expensive and the classes are often large 10+ kids with one instructor.  The First Tee was able to offer partial scholarships for our two kids and the classes were great!  There were 4-8 kids per class.  The lessons were wonderful and focused not only on skills, but on the honor and integrity of the game. They learned so much in just 10 lessons.  Each week had a theme (Character, Honesty, Perseverence, etc) that was integrated in every part of the lesson.  We are very happy with their progress and hope to participate again!

Last year my son received tutoring through Lee Pesky, free of charge at his elementary school.  The staff provided an engaging and fun educational experience for my son, and we immediately saw results.  His confidence and skills in reading improved a great deal through this experience.  Then, this summer, we decided to enroll our son in one on one tutoring, and have been thrilled with his progress.  Not only have we seen his skills continue to improve, he loves to go to tutoring as well.  The staff was very thorough and thoughtful in their evaluations of our son, and have carried out an educational plan that not only targets the needs of our son, but uses his strengths to enhance his tutoring sessions.In addition, I myself have benefited from Lee Pesky's education for teachers.  As a director/ teacher of a preschool program I was appreciative of the opportunity Lee Pesky provided to attend their "Building Blocks of Literacy" and "Every Child Ready for Math" classes.

The teachers at the Lee Pesky Learning Center were so caring and sensitive that this learning-averse child loved going there!  His progress was amazing and he continues to use what he learned there both at school and at home.  The professionals at the Center also included me by keeping me up-to-date on what he was doing so I could follow through at home.  It was an excellent, productive experience for both of us.
Lee Pesky Learning Center, Inc.	98066		/users/profile/116041	RainyPark	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2011	I am a Parent Educator working in the Parents as Teachers program with the Madison School District 321.  Recently I attended the Every Child Ready for Math training through the Lee Pesky Center.  It was a marvelous, FREE, hands-on training that has benefitted me greatly.  I learned tips for teaching the early math literacy skills needed for all young children such as: counting; creating math stories; gathering as well as leaving stories; incorporating manipulatives; subatizing; and cardinality. The class provided a superb syllabus, explaining every skill in an easily understood manner, and a bag overflowing with teaching aids to help us be able to add enriching math activities to our curriculum.  This was a marvelous opportunity to expand my knowledge and be able to pass it on to the parents we work with in Madison County.  There was a lot of knowledge that was totally new to me.  I had never heard of some of the literacy skills like subatizing.  Since mathematics is a progressive skill, in order for children to become proficient in higher mathematics, they must first understand and master these foundational early learning skills. This method for teaching the early math literacy skills is fun, easy and engaging for young children and their teachers.  If America is ever going to increase our students scores in math testing, it has to start with the foundation.  This is the program that will really help!

I have been able to focus my teaching in a more intentional way because of this training, and the materials that I received in the training. The Lee Pesky Center have been leaders in the early childhood field in our state. Mary Jo and Cristianne were also great supporters of a series of family literacy events that we had at our center. Our student's parents were very fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn literacy skills through these events.

These classes were to help educators teach mathematics in early childhood. I learned many new approaches to make math fun and attainable for my students. The center also provided materials and Ideas to create math games and activities. After the class, the instructors asked us to report back about how the activities were working for us. We then had an opportunity to refine activities and materials with the instructors in order to improve them for ourselves, as well as for the next people who took the class.The instructors were caring, patient, and concerned that everyone should be able to teach and understand mathematics. They have a real interest in furthering education, and are committed to their jobs.

Dr. Anne Clohessy is fantastic.  Respect is a big issue for our son and one that, because of his learning challenges (moderate attention deficit, processing speed, etc. issues) he has not always received from education providers.  Knowing this, Dr. Clohessy went out of her way to make sure that he was respected and treated as an equal throughout evaluation and testing process--and even designed the report to be personally addressed to him.   The entire process shed light on the unique ways that our son learns.  It has helped us understand our son so much better--and has helped him understand himself.  I wish all kids could have this type of caring evaluation--it would vastly help teachers, parents and children and make the educational experience a much more positive and fulfilling one for all concerned.

Lee Pesky Learning Center, Inc.	97784		/users/profile/115393	GaylL	Client Served	5	09/20/2011	Our daughter received testing and remediation at the LPLC for over three years as we discovered her dyslexia and then worked to provide her skills to deal with it.  The Pesky Center identified Megan's strengths - as a first grader!! - and helped her to use those strengths to overcome her difficulties with reading.  Megan could not tell an "M" from an "N" - after 2 years of preschool, 1 year of kindergarten and half of first grade!  She is now in 10th grade - and through recent testing, the school district psychologist mentioned she had the deepest dyslexia he had worked with over his 19 years of testing.  Megan still needs extra time on assignments, struggles to read, and uses oral books from the Recordings from the Blind and Dyslexic.  She is also exceptional in science and math - and is taking accelerated courses in both.  These strengths would have disappeared by third grade if the Pesky Center had not helped us recognize and develop them.  She will always struggle with reading - BUT she knows that she IS NOT - "the dumbest kid in fourth grade" - which is what her "friends" said about her behind her back.  Megan went to remediation at the Pesky Center for over three years to learn how to rely on her visual skills when reading, how to chunk words into small pieces, how to identify the word chunks with pictures in her mind - not the letters, how to outline written material, reading highlighted information in text, how to skim material - and more importantly - how to ADVOCATE for herself as an individual with dyslexia.  The Pesky Center has truly saved our daughter from what could have been a pretty tough path.  Their focus on her strengths, the development of those strengths, and the development of skills to compensate for her dyslexia - these were all skills the Pesky Center staff helped her develop.  We are grateful for the years of expertise and guidance.

As a teacher at the Center, I daily see students who come here because of their learning differences. They are students who, first coming in, are discouraged about school. Many feel like failures, as they have tried so hard but have gotten such poor results. Their academic history affects their behavior, their social lives, and their willingness to keep trying. I've also seen these students, who after going through testing and academic intervention, transform into hopeful, hard-working students who have an understanding of their strengths, know better how to compensate for their weaknesses, have learned how to advocate for accommodations if they need them, and believe that they can get through school. Although they know that school will never be easy, they also realize that it is realistic to believe that they can fulfill their professional dreams. Working with older students, I have seen many go on, successfully, to post-secondary schools. I believe that Lee Pesky Learning Center, with all that it has to offer in the way of testing, intervention, and counseling support, has truly made a difference in the lives of all that have had an opportunity to receive our quality services.

Then volunteers, such as myself, help to prepare the kits. The completed kits are then shipped to missionaries in Africa. The missionaries then provide them for pregnant women who are near their delivery time. Such a blessing! Not just for the Moms, but also for the missionaries who are able to help the Moms in this very personal way.

The teachings on the computer have also been an encouragement to me as well!  I would definitely say keep Eden's Song alive and running.   Jonathan and Michelle ThorntonMissionaries to Belize
Edens Song Ministry Inc	258799	1	/users/profile/347328	Tammy104	Volunteer	5	09/22/2015	Eden Song Ministries has been a huge blessing to HEART in so many ways.         Deb and Roy (Eden Song Ministries)  and Bob and I traveled to Brydges   Center Childrens Home on October 13, 2014.  Deb and Roy donated 2   computers to the center.  Rosemary (the founder) and the staff were very excited as Roy gave a brief training to some of the     children. The children were so eager to learn the many educational programs installed.  It was amazing and an eye opener to realize that the children did not even know how to use a mouse.  In the US children learn this at a very early age.  These        computers will give the much needed education and training for their future.  Also gift bags of various items were given to the 100 plus children.    HEARTS WEEP (Women Equality Empowerment Project) has received great support from Eden Song Ministries.  These are women who were dying in their homes as a result of HIV/AIDS and now receive training and support from concerned donors in order to survive and care for their  children.  This is an orphanage prevention project because if you keep mom alive, she will take care of her children.   Thank you Eden Song Tammy FrancabanderaHEART WEEP Spiritual Advisor/Children Ministry www.africaheart.comwww.facebook.com/africaheart

They provided us with our first-ever iPod, complete with scores of songs, teachings, etc., to take with us into Central Africa.  They were prepared to assist in the training of hundreds of pastors through donating a complete computer lab set-up (the reason this did not take place related to the realities we faced in-country rather than E.S. not being able to supply - they were ready, we simply could not facilitate it at that time).  Twice we shipped our personal computers to Edens Song and Roy did a fantastic job in fixing the bugs that had developed over time.  He saved us money and hassle and helped us jump ahead with the tasks we were working on.  After we broke our first iPod E.S. outfitted us with another, this time in a near-indestructible Otter Box.  We greatly appreciate the joy with which Edens Song helps us as missionaries, and we love their heart to serve around the world in any way they are able to.  Thumbs up, with thanks!

River Discovery Inc	152719		/users/profile/88044	Rachel Bowyer	Client Served	5	04/05/2013	Last year was my third year at River Discovery and each successive year brings me more happiness and hope through friendship and adventure.  There are many great aspects of River Discovery, but its best attribute is that it treats everyone on the trip as a healthy adventurer able to take on challenges they are faced with despite their current medical condition.  When I am on the River I forget about my struggles with cancer and the weaknesses I harbor; instead I am absorbed with the beauty of the river and the genuineness of the staff.  One of the main reasons why River Discovery is so successful is that it is a metaphor for life. To me the river symbolizes the flow of time, the rapids represent adversity and challenge, and the flat water sections embody the stagnation of life energy.  But despite the challenge of the rapids or the slowness of the flat water, we steadily journey down the river with hope and eager anticipation.  River Discovery tempers its participants for real life experiences and teaches them the value of facing challenges that you know are inevitable, all while having a great time in a safe environment.  River Discovery is successful on many levels of self development and gives the inspiration of strength to its participants.  It's impossible to participate in River Discovery without transforming into a better version of yourself and discovering new strength inside you.

And best of all I got to raft on the MIddle Fork of the Salmon River.  Something I never could have imagined doing after having cancer.  During which time it was a very real possibility that I could have my leg amputated.  Although I kept my leg thanks to the amazing doctors and other medical staff at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center I spent a year on crutches.  That year was particularly depressing for me.  At least when I was in the hospital I was one of the more mobil patients, but at school I was always being left behind and stared at.  Getting to go on an amazing week long trek into the wild beauty of the Salmon really put me back on track with my life.  I really can't wait until next years trip.

As someone who has worked in nonprofits for 20+ years that's quite an endorsement.  As a cancer survivor, heck as anyone, rafting the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho was a trip of a lifetime.  White sand beaches, 3 squares a day, unsurpassed weather, incredibly competent River Discovery volunteers and river guides, and the most beautiful river.  (A huge hurrah also goes out to whomever saved the Frank Church Wilderness area.  Wild and scenic is where it's at.)  It shook some deep healing loose inside of me.  My first day kayaking rapids elicited laughter from deep within, like being a little kid on a roller coaster for the first time - sheer joy at the adrenalin rush. And the camaraderie - cancer survivors from throughout the U.S., who just "got it."  No need to explain the hell I've been through, just a set of awesome people focused on healing.    The river literally moved us forward.   I came home so deeply relaxed that it was revelatory - so that's what it feels to be unstressed!  That was life changing, and it's not something that I get in a day-to-day setting.  It's a gift of the wild and scenic, campfires, good company, and one amazing river.  Floating down a river for days and days, and laughing so much left me feeling like *I* was floating, and so light of heart.  Thanks to River Discovery, I found the healing I'd craved the entire 5-yr cancer journey.  Now I know what that feels like.  ( NB: I felt completely safe and cared for the whole week. The lack of cell phone service was a blessing - remember when we weren't on electronic leashes and could just be?)  I thank River Discovery from the bottom of my heart, and I am so honored to have been included - I think this is *the* healing retreat for cancer survivors and I expect it to be mobbed for years to come.

River Discovery Inc	69429		/users/profile/75868	nicolecassity	Client Served	5	02/16/2011	Summer of 2010 was probably one of the toughest times, if not the toughest, in my cancer journey. While my treatments and most of my surgeries were over, the emotional term-oil cancer would cause was only just beginning. Through out my fight I was in warrior mode. I was determined to beat this disease and leaving my young family behind wasn't an option. Once the fight was over and life started to get back to "normal" I found myself suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. All of the emotions that I refused to let in while in the heat of the fight came straight to the surface and all at once. It was so hard to sort through everything and it came on so quickly that I felt very overwhelmed and lost in my feelings. I felt like I went from a warrior to a scared child overnight.  River Discovery showed me that the scariest part was already over. I fought my battle and won so life could only get better from there. River Discover provided a structured and safe atmosphere where I could go outside of my comfort zone almost daily, face fears, and prove to myself that I could do anything I set my mind to. It showed me that although I had cancer, it didn't have me and things I used to be terrified of were nothing compared to the battle that I had already fought, and won.  I took rapids head on in an inflatable kayak (something I would have never done before), flipped the kayak, and swam the rapid. The fear of doing so is what kept me away from kayaks, yet once I faced it and lived through it, I came out the other side feeling empowered to face more fears. I repelled down the side of a steep rock cliff and faced my huge fear of heights. I went an entire week using a pack in/pack out toilet, soaping up while standing in the middle of a 5 gallon bucket, set up my own tent nightly, and lived with much less than I ever imagined possible.  I enjoyed some of the best meals I've ever had - all of which I didn't have to cook, clean up after, or prepare.  I enjoyed nature hikes and was astonished by the passion and knowledge the guiding company had for the river and the land. The history lessons alone would have made the trip great.  Finally, I met a group of amazing survivors both young and old, men and women, which inspired and encouraged me along the way. We were all from different walks of life and most of our paths would have never crossed had we not experienced this incredible journey together. I still keep in touch with many and I walked away with the realization that cancer is cancer. It doesn't matter what kind you had, you still connect and understand other survivors on a level that no one else can.  Thank you so very much for a once in a lifetime trip and a week long adventure that I will remember for the rest of my life!

From my experience being on a rafting trip, I can only imagine what beauty and healing it brings to cancer survivors.  Many organizations provide funds and services to those who are dealing with cancer, but clearly it is just as important to empower those who charge through their disease and give them a good foundation for the recovery process.I through and through support this organization because the experiences that are provided for the attendants will last them for the duration of their lives.

This is the most unique "Cancer Camp" experience that I am aware of.  It is a true wilderness high adventure on the beautiful Salmon River, with all the challenges and opportunity for growth that this entails.  This allows for individual and group growth through challenging outdoor physical encounters.  Any other "cancer camp" that I'm aware of involves a fairly regimented activity schedule, and usually is based out of a central "camp" where campers stay in cabins.  On River Discovery the camps are in a different spot along the river each night, with daily opportunities to navigate new whitewater rapids, swim, hike, climb, rappel, star gaze and so much more!

I felt kind of guilty by the end of the trip for having had such a good time! I felt personally renewed and reinvigorated, as if the windows of my mind, body and soul had just been opened to a refreshing breeze.  I felt calm and alert and happy to be alive!The guides' expertise is blended with such a sense of fun that it is possible to truly and deeply relax at the same time that you are challenged by the river setting, knowing you are safe in their hands.  We floated whitewater and flatwater, swam, hiked, fished, climbed, soaked in hot springs, laughed, ate great food, talked around the campfire and slept under the stars.I saw the participants come alive as they tried out new skills like paddling kayaks, or as they enjoyed well loved hobbies like photography.  I saw them compare their scars from treatment and talk about losing their hair.  I saw them face down what scared them and helped each other do the same.  I saw them emerge victorious!It was beautiful and truly inspiring and I felt so grateful to be a part of it that I joined the Board to help make this experience possible for more people.

We both expereinced challenges firsthand, I am a breast cancer survivor and Joe lost his battle to cancer in March 2007. We spent many days and nights at St. Luke's Hospital in Boise, Idaho.  The 4th Floor accommodated not only alults but also had a wing for children with cancer.  After continually seeing these young people fighting for their battles, we couldn't help but want to do something for them. We started suppling their play room with a mosaic teacher and supplies so the kids would have something fun to look forward to.  After a time we wanted to do more. We were longtime whitewater rafting outfitters and ranchers from Lemhi, Idaho.  We envisioned an adventure program where participants addressed the emotional and physical challenges cancer survivors face after treatment.  One thing lead to another and the organization has evolved into a river based program offer a 6-day rafting trips, one to teens and one for adults.

When we, as the board, have read and heard the feedback from trip participants, the therapeutic effects and joy of having participated in this outdoor experience are reflected time and again.

Most of our group had recently completed treatment, so it was a particularly welcome relief to leave behind the daily medical grind and also the cell phones, e-mail....   We were able to focus on living.My son and I, both having undergone cancer recurrences in 2007, attended this trip in 2008.The River Discovery team is phenomenal, with a true love of the river and an appreciation for the environment and local lore.  The outfitters provided top-notch equipment and phenomenal food including fresh fish, meat, vegetables and fruit.    Our six days on the river involved idly riding the raft, the challenge of paddling a kayak thru the rapids, fishing and hiking, and exploring settlements and native American writing on the walls.After a personal loss to cancer, the River Discovery founders and board have succeeded in their goal of giving back by providing a unique experience for cancer survivors.   It was apparent that this is a costly trip to outfit.   The rafts, kayaks, camping gear and food not only need to be purchased and maintained, but also transported several hours to and from Salmon.   I heartily endorse this nonprofit as worthy of your support.

This is great time to provide support to small enterprises and doing charity programs to support the poor people in Viet Nam. With enterprises, Thriive has provided encouragement loans to support their business plans for development. And the enterprises have responded Thriive support by donating their products and services to the poor. Besides organizing charity activities, they have been linked together to care needy people and to be more responsibility to society.With poor people, we care and share their difficulties, try to support and creat good condition for a better life. Thousands of people were supported, receiving goods and care service from the program. There were many charity activities had been done such as giving clothes to poor pupils; pigs, chickens to poor farmers, offering iron roof to poor families, health care etc, The people were happy and excited with Thriivesupport. Looking their happy smiles, the happy tears, the heartfelt thanks from the poor, I feel very happy. I myself thank you Thriive, thank you Board of Thriive who have found the program and help poor people in Viet Nam as well as other countries in the world. I wish the project will continue to develop and I vote for Thriive
Thriive	182249		/users/profile/239018	dstraley	Donor	5	10/24/2013	A unique aspect of this development model is the "doubling effect" of my contribution.  A traditional grant to a micro- or small-enterprise project leads to increased employment and incomes for the poor beneficiaries.  In this model, my funds not only increase employment and incomes in developing economies, they also deliver charitable goods and services to the under-served in the entrepreneurs' communities.  The Thriive model promotes free enterprise, and at the same time, develops a local, business-culture of philanthropy.
Thriive	182036		/users/profile/238792	gwenls	Donor	5	10/24/2013	I worked as a consultant with Thriive on two past projects, and recently became a Thriive donor through 3rd Creek Foundation. In 2008, I conducted the first external evaluation of the Thriive program (then SMI) in Palestine and Vietnam. I was highly impressed observing the program model, which uses market-based solutions to improve communities and promote strong local cultures of philanthropic giving. Since that time, Thriive has expanded into two additional countries, Kenya and Nicaragua, and continues to progress in achieving scale and expanding impact. Thriive has established excellent partnerships with outstanding local organizations in each country of operation, which is also key to the program's success.
Thriive	174130	1	/users/profile/230340	cmhsk	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2013	What a novel concept!  Loans that actually BENEFIT society and individuals!  Taking an individual, fostering their drive and creativity, and helping them to be productive citizens.  Who then sell their products which create economic growth for them, their towns, and countries.  Loans that create social responsibility with the pay it forward component and positive feelings.  Thus creating a need for more workers.  A very POSITIVE way of doing business.  FINALLY!
Thriive	174098		/users/profile/230311	koensuidgeest	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2013	To me, Thriive encompasses the future of international development. The business loans provided in countries like Vietnam, Nicaragua, Palestine or Kenya help small businesses develop into to medium size businesses, create job- and training opportunities and require forward-paying returns on the loan. So their loans are paid back by recipients to their community - through donation of goods and/or training. A brilliant and unique concept which has helped and touched many already.
Thriive	172937		/users/profile/228945	Linh Nguyen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/02/2013	I used to work as manager of ThriiveCapital Loans program in Hue, Central Vietnam for two and a half years. Thriive focuses its resources on supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs who show promise for job creation and income growth within the community.  As a result, it did help to impove social and economic situation of both loan recipients and beneficiaries of charity goods and vocational training donation.  I am always proud to be a part of Thriive and look forward to having opportunities to work for this meaningful program again in the future.

It was an extremely good feeling to watch these hard workers in their country get the help they need to thrive in their business and then pay it forward in their communities. This is a great concept that creates jobs and teaches businesses give back in order the help change the world.

Thriive	167181		/users/profile/222024	maggie_kamau	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	I have been on the Board of Thriive since 2010.  I joined the Board because I completely believe in the mission of the organization. As an international organization, Thriive does not dictate to the implementing organizations to do what the organization thinks should be done, rather, it empowers the implementing partners to be the leader as they have the contextual knowledge and understanding of reality on the ground. The Board is proactive and very engaged in the work of Thriive around the world. Its a real pleasure to serve on the Board of Thriive and I look forward to the time when Thriives work is adopted as a model on how to best invigorate small businesses around the world. 
Thriive	151190		/users/profile/201767	marcialiebich2	Donor	5	03/17/2013	We have recently returned from visiting several businesses which THRIIVE supports in the Palestinian territories. THRIIVE works with the Small Enterprise Center in Ramallah to identify viable businesses and then to offer consulting services as well as funds. Emphasis is on promoting entrepreneurship among women and  providing training, internships and job growth. The money is not repaid to THRIIVE, but goods and services are "paid forward" to needy nonprofits. We witnessed the smiles on the faces of orphans as they received delicious yogurt and baked goods from two THRIIVE supported businesses. The most promising part of the program is that this philanthropy continues after the loan is repaid. THRIIVE is building a culture of philanthropy where little existed before. We visited a greenhouse where organic produce is grown, a sewing    business producing piecework and an olive oil soap business producing impressive herbal varieties of soap. All had created jobs and were owned by women.
Thriive	149241		/users/profile/198836	Torydh	Advisor	5	02/11/2013	Thriive's model combines capital, technical assistance, community understanding and network building to grow small businesses, create jobs, improve lives and build new socially responsible business networks.  Arthur Schultz's original vision has grown to address an important vacuum in the small and growing business space - the program's ability to scout talent through local partners, continually innovate on delivery of technical assistance and pay attention to the role of women and the environment as they grow is impressive. - Tory Dietel Hopps
Thriive	149219		/users/profile/198812	anndown	Donor	5	02/11/2013	I have known the directors of this foundation for many years and have traveled with Erik and Linn to the Occupied Territories in Isreal to see their projects. They have local managers who monitor the work and impact on the local communities. Their "pay-it-forward" approach encourages empathy and generosity in a very unique and meaningful way.  Because I am the director of a private foundation,  I have many years experience visiting and evaluating projects worldwide and feel confident in the choices and policies of Thriive.
Thriive	149199		/users/profile/198771	tommys	Donor	5	02/10/2013	Thriive is an innovative,  professionally managed, and  committed social entrepenneurial organization to fund and work with.  Their creatiive concept of "pay-it-forward" loans is relatively unique in my experience of grantmaking and micro-credit loans.  By finding organizations and companies that will produce a service or product that can be useful to the local community, they help to enhance the concept of localized, direct, small scale philanthropy where it most counts- right at the neighborhood, village, or regional level.  Grant dollars are therefore leveraged multiple times, and most important, the decision-making is in-country by local people.  By focusing on capital loans they are able to make the transaction accountable to its intention, which is to "pay forward" the principal and intrest into the community.  I believe that they have worked hard to monitor the loans and ensure that the goods and services do get released into the community.
Thriive	149056		/users/profile/198586	chrisbunting	Donor	5	02/07/2013	I have been a Thriive donor for over three years and I continue to be impressed by the organization and its impact throughout the globe.  They are creating powerful change in the developing world by helping local people develop strong businesses that in turn give back to their communities.  I have had the pleasure of seeing their work first hand in Kenya and was touched to see the impact that is being made on the ground.  The various entrepreneurs I met were building thriving businesses that employed more people and provided social resources for their communities and this creates a powerful ripple effect in every region Thriive operates.

Land use issues are really contentious here in Teton Valley, and for 15 years, they have worked so hard to stay above the fray. They cover stories and issues for years, long after the newspaper has discontinued coverage. I am always sure to read their email reports and letters  because I want to learn more about local issues regarding our lands and open spaces. They go to all the meetings and hearings and read through the long reports so I don't have to. I feel like they are my advocate.

I am from a small town in MT and moving to a "large community" like Idaho Falls gave me cause for concern in terms of having my children miss out on that small town community feel that I had experienced. When we found SRMS we quickly discovered a community of  people, dedicated to improving the larger community of Idaho Falls through the education of our children. While the school's atmosphere is that of a small town community, the innovative education provided at the school is second to none. My wife and I are very grateful to the staff at SRMS for the dedication they have shown to our children. Our two children are very different in what motivates them and their interests and yet both continue to impress us and our extended families with speed at which they are learning and progressing to be successful young people. This is because a Montessori education is tailored towards encouraging success from all learning styles. We are very proud to be a part of the SRMS community and look forward to many more years of continued involvement.

They have been in the Montessori system since preschool, which has allowed them to excel academically, but when we moved to this school, we found a whole different level of nurture and academic performance than we had seen before.  In general, the children thrive.  I see big differences between the behavior of children that go to this Montessori school versus those that go to public school: attentiveness, inquisitiveness, ability to interact appropriately with authority figures, self-driven, etc.  In addition, the school provides a very positive and respectful environment, from drop-off to pick-up.  My kids come home happy, everyday.  Every day.  Not only are the teachers well trained, intelligent, thoughtful and nurturing, but all of the staff is as well and I feel confident that they will make good decisions with/about my children on or off the playground.

At the same time my children experienced a joy of learning, which I still see today even though they have long since moved on in their education.  While my children have very different styles in which they learn, they were able to thrive in their learning at Snake River.

It incorporates peace, kindness, generosity, community service, and the general respectfulness that is missing in our youth today. It also teaches the child to be responsible for their own choices and decisions, whether that be a right or a wrong choice. It teaches that every choice they make has a consequence, good or bad. I have enrolled all three of my children there and have had my oldest daughter as part of their community for 8 years and I couldn't think of a better place for my family.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/02/2013	I've been a Montessori teacher for sometime and I can not express how wonderful and amazing Snake River Montessori School is!  I've recently moved to the area from Montana and did my research of Montessori schools in the Idaho Falls area and Snake River Montessori was just the community of learning that I wanted to be a part of and SO thankful that I am part of that community doing what I love!  Snake River Montessori School is Montessori Education at its BEST!
Snake River Montessori School Inc	156961		/users/profile/208166	S. Rose	Client Served	5	05/02/2013	Years ago we met a youngster on a river trip who impressed us with curiosity and independence in stark contrast to others his age.  His parents largely credited his Montessori experience and recommended SRMS.  Though devoted public schoolers of many years, we checked it out. Our youngest attended SRMS from preschool through fourth grade.  It turned out to be the very best foundation we could have imagined for a lifetime of learning and good citizenship. We also enjoyed the incredibly convenient, high-quality Extended Day after school program.   There were days when we literally peeled her away at closing time; she begged to stay for spend-a-day even when we didnt need it.   The Montessori philosophy, the quality teachers, amazingly-equipped classrooms and the culture of peace, nurturing and acceptance combine to help children grow and develop naturally.  An SRMS education uniquely fosters independence, curiosity self confidence and an open mind.  And now our older daughter is a Montessori teacher at SRMS.  We just love this school and recommend it highly.

It is truly a village that is interested in the best education for their children.  I have taught in Idaho public schools (3 school districts) and another private school and this is absolutely the best learning situation I have encountered.  Each child is allowed to learn, to think, to problem solve individually and reach their own potential.  Our graduates come back to visit regularly and are welcomed in the classroom with open arms.  
Idaho Drug-Free Youth Inc	127606		/users/profile/172677	Alyssa6	Volunteer	5	10/22/2012	Idfy has been a part of my life since I was in the 7th grade. Since then they have slowly worked hundreds of other wonderful people into my life. All of whom have impacted my life in someway. I am now a freshman in college and am still a big part of IDFY. They have helped so many young lives live healthy drug free lives and have helped me in such a way I wouldnt know how to thank them. They have helped me grow into the bright young leader I am today. If it werent for them, I may have ended up an alcoholic or drug addict because of family issues, but because of IDFY I am a healty 18 year old college student working toward my teaching degree to help better more of our youths lives. IDFY is not all about being drug free. Its much more. Its life-changing, impactful, and probieds a promising, positive safe-haven for any youth of Idaho.  IDFY helps youth be themselves, also become better leaders of their future, and to shine! Everybody has their own story, and IDFY gives us a place to share them. 
Idaho Drug-Free Youth Inc	126548	1	/users/profile/171560	Todd11	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2012	Our oldest daughter was contacted through her middle school about attending Idaho Youth Summit, a summer camp for Idaho Drug Free Youth.  As parents, we were very skeptical, and very cautious, as we didn't know anything about the organization.  After looking into IDFY, we somewhat nervously allowed her to attend the 4 day camp, wondering if we had made the right choice.  Seven years later, we realize that it was one of the best choices that we have ever made for our children.  Since then, we have had two additional children who have attended the camp (the older two have both been youth staff) and it continues to be an exceptional experience for them.  Each summer when they come home, they return with stronger personal conviction to stay drug free, more personal heroes that they have met at camp, and with stronger self confidence.  They realize that they are not alone in fighting the battle over drug/alcohol/substance abuse. They have seen first hand the consequences of addiction as key note speakers present their stories. They participate in funfilled "character building" activities that have helped them to deal with those awkward teenage moments. They have returned to their schools and actively participated in the local IDFY Club, trying to spread its influence to other peers.  With all the battles that parents face raising children in this world, it is wonderful to have the the staff and members of IDFY on our side to help keep our kids DRUG FREE!  Thank you IDFY, you have our support! If we could give you more than a 5 star rating, we would, you deserve it!

The Idaho Drug Free Youth Summit is a must-attend and so worth it to expose middle school and high school kids at every level and walk of life. I have two siblings who struggled with substance abuse most of their lives and this program was instrumental in helping me reflect, learn and grow from that impact. I defy!
Idaho Drug-Free Youth Inc	98045		/users/profile/116017	Kristin23	Volunteer	5	09/24/2011	I have been both a participant and a volunteer for IDFY for a total of 9 years. I am currently a graduate student of Social Work, and IDFY prepared me for this program in so many ways. It taught me leadership skills, within both large and small groups, as well as creative thinking for activities and group planning and facilitating.  IDFY is a powerful program that impacts both the teenagers that it works with and the adults who give their time to be a volunteer. It teaches connectivity and compassion towards others; IDFY also celebrates our differences. IDFY is a great program for promoting drug and alcohol free practices within teenagers. But this program doesn't stop there. It seeks to reach not only teenagers, but teachers, parents, and other adults in the community to help with the mission of eradicating drug and alcohol use and abuse among teenagers. 
Idaho Drug-Free Youth Inc	98038		/users/profile/116006	neverwispernever	General Member of the Public	5	09/24/2011	I have been apart of this LIFE CHANGING organization since I was in the sixth  grade! Now I might not have had much to do with it back them, but as I went to more meeting and got to know more and more people I realized that I loved this place that I was at in my life. Having IDFY in my life helped me become a leader I would have never become! It broke me out of my shell and showed me that no matter what I am doing as long as I am doing it for the good I can help to change peoples lives! Being a part  of IDFY to me wasn't just another club from school I was in, and going to the events wasn't just another school thing I was going to it was part of me! They made me feel welcome and loved and I grew to not just appreciate that it was there, but to love that I could have those people around to just talk to and help me get through things. I didn't have a problem telling people no to things like drugs. IDFY helped              me to realize that drugs where such a small problem in my life, but for others it was hard for them to get a way form them. They changed me from a person that tried and did any thing just to fit in to a person that made friends because they like who I was as a person, or they loved that I was there for them. I can truly say that all the members of IDFY are my family. From the kids that are just joining to the board of IDFY that helps us make all of this happen! If it weren't for IDFY I truly think that I would have been in jail for the rest of my life because I had the friends to get drugs from and the friends that would or asked me to do them. Other teenagers might say that sports helped them or their parents helped them, but I say IDFY helped me and this place is one place that I love to call home even though I can't live with every person that is part of it, I would love to!      SURPRISE IDFY! I LOVE YOU SO SO SO MUCH!

If you are a youth, get connected with your local chapter. If you are an adult that works with youth and/or are a parent, find your local chapter.

I had very little self confidence and was scared to death of large people or making a fool of myself.  IDFY has helped me become more concrete in my decision to stay drug and substance free and has also made me a more self confident young woman.  IDFY has helped me realize that people love me for who I am, and that I, even though I am just one person, that I have the potential to change the world.

Idaho Drug-Free Youth Inc	97887	1	/users/profile/115566	Andrew Charles	Volunteer	5	09/21/2011	Idaho Drug Free Youth. This organization is a miracle in and of itself. It provides an open road to opportunity for everyone who reaches their hand out for help or who looks deeper into the program. On top of the outstanding leadership development and networking opportunities that everyone is exposed to everyday. IDFY has without a doubt, changed my life forever. When I was in Junior High (the teenage transition)...I was literally the most shy person in my entire school; most likely one of the top hermits in the community/county as a matter of fact. Basically 'zero' friends. Yet, one of my only friends at the time insisted that I attend this meeting for a substance-free living group called 'insomnia outbreak.' Upon attending the first official meeting, I was struck with fascination. My curiosity was radiant and I had this little voice telling me, "There's more Andrew, there's actually more to this life!" That meeting alone prevented my thoughts at the time. Suicide. Now, I don't mean to write that to freak anyone out, because there's a light at the end of this dark tunnel. Long story short, I was later invited to attend this event called the "Idaho Youth Summit." Now, I had no idea what to make of it...frankly, I had no intent on attending, but at the beginning of being a member for this group, my benefit was to get to attend events for free. Therefore, I went...not knowing what was in store for me. I'll save you the emotional rambling and tell you this...because of this spectacular organization, I'm alive. This program has saved my life and saved the lives of SO many others. I no longer focus on the benefit of getting free admission to events/activities; I focus on the benefit of helping others, making a difference in the world, changing lives one idea at a time. I believe that there's a potential for everyone...an extraordinary potential that we can all tap into and evoke the most sincere compassion, the most meaningful acts of kindness...I believe that we can change the world. "Be the change you have been waiting for." ~ Well my friends...Idaho Drug Free Youth IS the change we have been waiting for. With much love and warm regards,Andrew Charles (aka Super Cow)
Idaho Drug-Free Youth Inc	97794	1	/users/profile/115407	Kerri W.	Volunteer	5	09/20/2011	The culture of IDFY is one of education, empowerment, and fun! From the week to week chapter meetings in the schools, to the annual Idaho Youth Summit they hold, youth are experiencing an environment where they know they can be themselves, they can share their joys and worries, and they are encouraged on the path of healthy maturity.  Research proves that connectedness is essential to good health, good choices, and good behaviors. IDFY provides quality connectedness for thousands of youth across our great state!

Idaho Drug-Free Youth Inc	97754		/users/profile/115350	Isabelle M.	Volunteer	3	09/20/2011	I would like to introduce myself, my name is Isabelle Messica, and I work with the Dr. Waismann.  His work is remarkable, he has been treated over 16.000 patients worldwide.If you could advise families that there is a light after the  tunnel. http://youtu.be/QcX9vPHvYe8   Dr Waismann's MissionIn this age of violence, when death is often viewed as a legitimate commodity, when policies on management of famine, terror, diseases and ignorance are determined by political lobbies, when one persons tragedy becomes anothers evening of entertainment, we must seek grace and find a place where each one of us can still make a difference.Millions of people worldwide suffer from Opiate Dependency. Too often society condemns them for crimes they are not responsible for, and moral prejudice together with theories about addictive personalities prevent these people from obtaining the medical care they urgently need.Opiate abuse is widespread with no effective available treatment. Its victims are not viewed as patients, but more usually - as outlaws. Society has pushed them to the gutters and the dark alleys of life, in an attempt to protect itself from them. The solution has been addictive opiate replacements and long term isolation from society. Rehabilitation centers around the world offer sufferers of opiate dependency a treatment that involves a long tormenting withdrawal syndrome which is bad enough but to make it worse, this withdrawal syndrome is followed by biologically-rooted craving.Failing to provide a better solution, the suffering is justified for its so-called "therapeutic value". This process prevents patients from seeking treatment, and among those who do seek treatment, many drop out. Worse of all, is that the minority that does complete the treatment is likely to relapse and as a result is more reluctant to seek treatment again.Opiate Dependency requires professional medical care. Unfortunately, it has been treated by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and law enforcement personnel. However, times have changed, and Opiate Dependency has finally been recognized as a central nervous system disorder caused by continuous opiate intake. Therefore, we must not judge, punish, or morally confront those with Opiate Dependency, but provide them with the appropriate medical attention, they urgently need to reverse the withdrawal and its cravings.Join us in the fight against human suffering, and witness the birth of a new era. Angie, I will be more than happy to assist you for more details.Best Regards, Isabelle Messicaisabelle@anrclinic.infowww.anrclinic.info Tel: + 972-546960748

I would like to say thank you to Kelsey Wood for sharing this site and volunteering all her time to IDFY! So my experience started back in middle school and went all the way through high school. As one of the drug free youth, I needed this organization. See I was a kid who was surrounded by peers and adults who were looking for there next fix. IDFY was there to help with keeping me busy at school by doing pizza parties or gave incentives to be drug-free. One time in the 8th grade I was able to fly in a small airplane! I was able to go on hiking retreats and camping all because there are amazing people out there that care! Thank you to all that have helped and to those who are planning on helping!

I have attended activities at various times with my sister.  Sometimes I am moved to tears for the welcoming efforts to involve each person, no matter the limitations. Other times I chuckle with delight at the obvious positive responses to the fun the participants are having.  Of course there are limitations to what activities can be offered due to financial restrictions, but the activities that are creatively offered are the only ones in the valley for this population that I am aware of.  The need is huge.  Applause to Amazing Amigos!!

Youth With A Mission Idaho Boise Cascade Inc	74908		/users/profile/81834	TracyFacie	Client Served	5	02/24/2011	I guess you could say I was a client that served?? I did a discipleship training school in Cascade Idaho, with YWAM. It was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. I was in a lecture phase, which opened my eyes, ears, and heart to a better understanding of whom Christ Jesus is (To know God). Week after week we had new speakers, experiences, discussions, and opened up every morning with breakfast together, alone time devotions, worship and prayer together, and then started up on our topics of the week, (for three months this happened). During this time the people i was around in and at the Idaho base amazing me more and more. God used each and every single one of those people to show me the true love of Christ. The base is located up by Warm Lake in the beautiful mountain area, and for some reason it just seemed right for me to meet with Jesus everyday on that mountain, growing in my understanding of whom Jesus is. I also had chores, which I did not enjoy at first, but God took that time to soften my heart, I was able to overcome some anger issues/ selfish ways, and God was able to speak to me though that experience. I learned what it means to serve God by serving others, with joy. I learned how to let go of my past and how to daily give my all to my Savior, I learned how to love other around me like Jesus would have intended, and I learned how to see the rest of the world through the eyes of Jesus, to have a new world view, that was and is so much more beautiful, then what I saw before. God is alive in Cascade Idaho. God is alive everywhere. But what it comes down to is the openness of your heart, so that you would seek. He is desperate for you, and weather you realize it or not you are desperate for a Savior (him).  Cascade Idaho YWAM is doing amazing things in Jesus name; they have so many opportunities for disciples to lead, and share the word, and to grow. YWAM Idaho also seems to have the vibe of openness, towards what ever they hear God calling them to do. They seem ready to drop anything of their own lives, willing to daily surrender, and always striving for the goal God has set before them. All in humility, all in joy, love, truth, hope, desperation, and in compassion. Thank You so much YWAM Idaho for once having me as a student, my life has been forever changed, Thank you Jesus :) I miss you all :) The last three mouths of my YWAM experience was over seas in India. The leaders, and staff from the YWAM base did a great job encouraging me, answering my questions, and showing me how to take God's love to a different location (Make God Known). They actually let me have some leadership opportunities which was new for me. It was amazing too! We traveled all over central India, stayed a good while in Aragabad. We had many outreach "tools." We prayed, which was power :), we built relationships, we shared testimonies with a translators help, we went to villages and taught about proper hygiene with a bible story at the end, we provided hygiene kits for children in villages, we attended Indian Christian church serves, we went to orphans, and we did the life house skit. There was so much more we did too, even divine appointments. All of this was previously prepared during lecture phase. God did some amazing things though our team from YWAM Idaho that season (2009-2010 Fall DTS).   
Youth With A Mission Idaho Boise Cascade Inc	73834		/users/profile/80687	does not apply	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	We recently became the pastors of a small Church in Cascade, ID. Getting to know a new part of the country, it's people and culture while at the same time trying to make in-roads of ministry in our new town we have had a challenge with such a small congregation to draw volunteers from.The local WYAM-ers have extended a ready hand of assistance and quality ministry-minded hearts whenever they have been called upon. You can tell they have great training and are qualified in a vast array of need meeting skills to promote Christ. We greatly appreciate them. Ps J + D Wagner

Client Served	5	02/21/2011	We received great training while working with YWAM Idaho.They provided 4 days of training which was a huge blessing to our group and for the lives of my students.  The training was terrrific and was mixed with activities, games, free time, and group building.  My students and my adult leaders loved the experience.  Our training provided great resources for when we went out to serve and we were well prepared through the training.  YWAM Idaho did a great job organizing and working through different organizations to plan the places and things we would take part in from helping open a Community Center by doing various work projects, to street and park evanglism, to our work with the regugee population.  I would definitly recommend them to anyone and we are looking forward to returning this coming summer with another group of high school students.  I am also excited to promote to our graduating students YWAM Idaho's other training like DTS opportunties.

My experience says that their staff truly care about people, not only those who come to them as I did, but also the people they feel called to. I appreciate their desire to pour the majority of their energy into one region, rather than spreading their resources and staff thin. This tells me they have a desire to see quality rather than quantity, which is exactly what you want when working with people.

Having served as a pastor for 21 years I have been impressed and inspired from a distance by the achievement of seemingly impossible goals through faith and perseverance. With its connection to India and other Asian areas YWAM Idaho demonstrates how to think globally and act locally--the primary action being to raise up a generation of missional leaders. And I know I can trust the organization implicitly because I know the character its leader.

Marty Meyer, its director, has a huge heart for the lost, and is a gifted leader and teacher. He is my brother-in-law, a mentor to me over the years, and a friend and brother in Christ. When it comes to the kingdom of Christ in this world, I'd say this: Marty "gets it."I had opportunity some years ago to participate as an instructor on a "Backpacker's DTS" outing.

Youth With A Mission Idaho Boise Cascade Inc	65205		/users/profile/71267	Juli S.	Client Served	5	02/08/2011	Our youth group traveled from eastern Nebraska to the mountains of Idaho for training at the Youth with a Mission base camp before heading to Boise to put into practice all that we learned. The young men and women who opperated the camp were wonderful. Each one invested themselves in serving us. Their joy was contagious as they lead us in worship. They shared their hearts through personal testimonies that connected with our students, encouraged us with skits and they taught us things that we could take with us into our every day lives as followers of Christ. The message theme was reinforced throughout the week as we learned to write and tell our own testimonies, use an evangicube to share the gospel, and pray from the heart, together.  At our time away from the camp the YWAM staff challenged us to get out and apply what we had learned by providing us many opportunities in Boise. Some highlights include working on a building that was to become a food pantry, painting at a homeless shelter, sharing the gospel through conversations at the park, and playing games with refugee children. The YWAM staff seemed to have thought every moment through finding opportunities that would have the most impact on us as well as on the community we were serving. We had such a grteat time at YWAM Idaho that we are packing up our vans and heading back again in the summer of 2011.

God has smiled on this ministry and time and time again has blessed its existence with miraculous affirmation of his love,  his presence,  his encouragement and his protection.  This was incredibly evident when we witnessed a raging forest fire in the immediate area of  the YWAM property.  It totally skirted  the camp's grounds.

I was raised in a Morman husehold and we were going on a mission trip to Salt Lake City. The training we received was in depth and very useful. I learned a lot more about the religion than I had in 14 years growing up. When we got to SLC the staff was extremely helpful. They had things set up for us to do each day and provided food for all of us. They made such an impact on me that after the trip, I used the YWAM Cascade base for my family's family reunion. Like I said, they are morman and were weary of doing it there. Marty and the staff made them feel completly relaxed. I would use them over and over again.

Their style is open, honest, brave  and just.  If you hike, backpack, bird, hunt or fish western lands or care about the watersheds you should be thanking this unique and fine organization for their tireless work at bringing the renegade livestock industry to abide by laws and regulations on the books. The industry has always had their way by way of threats and intimidation. WWP doesn't buy the threats. They meticulously document the damage, go to court and win.

Western Watersheds Project Inc	190666	3	/users/profile/248935	mostlymike	General Member of the Public	5	12/14/2013	Although the livestock industry likes to portray Western Watersheds as anti-rancher, I think they are one of the few that propose a way to resolve issues over public lands grazing. I like their proposed (and introduced) legislation in Congress that would allow payment to retire a grazing lease if a rancher wants to sell it and a non-profit wants to buy it and retire the lease for the benefit of wildlife, watershed, etc.  Despite this difficulty, WWP has gotten grazing leases in harmful locations closed, wildlife and water protected. Currently there is no way to retire a federal grazing lease except for bad performance or other illegalities by a permittee and subsequent permittees.  So at the present, retirement requires a tactic of pressing the agency to strictly enforce the laws and regulations. They are loath to do this, so WWP has to go to court on behalf of the public.  It would be terrible if urban law enforcement had to use this method! Anyway, cheers for WWP. They are braver than other organizations that deal with our public lands.

I recently became involved with WWP through visual monitoring of the impact of livestock on public land in sensitive grizzly bear habitat in Idaho and Wyoming.  As a photographer and videographer, it has been appalling to document the damage and land degradation from grazing by cattle and domestic sheep.  Top predators are a key part of a healthy, functioning ecosystem.  For them to thrive, cattle and domestic sheep need to be removed from our public lands.  WWP is working to help make this happen.

The abuses go on in spite of efforts of many employees who know, as I did, how livestock was compromising public values like water quality, soils, wildlife habitat, and even recreational opportunities (camping among cow pies is not an experience most people enjoy).  That is why I so admire the tenacity and exceptional knowledge of WWP staff. There are few organizations in the West willing to challenge the livestock juggernaut. WWP is the most dedicated, and most effective organization I know speaking up for our public lands ecological health and integrity. That is why I recently joined the board.

I couldn't believe the number of cows everywhere.  I started to look into it and over time came to believe that public land grazing is the single most damaging activity to the environment in the Intermountain West.   And that taxpayers have to subsidize the ranchers to deplete the land this way was obviously nuts.  I started a publishing company to try to help create awareness through the power of pen and story because I thought most environmental organizations were not able to get much done without greater public awareness.   Except for Western Watersheds.  They keep getting results.  I am a big fan. Mark BaileyTorrey House Press
Western Watersheds Project Inc	190529	4	/users/profile/111256	Barbara Warner	Volunteer	5	12/13/2013	Western Watersheds Project is working to stop the abuse of our public lands by the welfare ranchers. These ranchers have millions of cattle on our public lands which were proven by a 1990-91 Government Accounting Office study to cause over-grazing and destruction of riparian areas. Government agencies are killing predators and are wiping out our wild horses and other species to benefit these ranchers , all at tax-payers expense.They are also destroying native trees and plants in order to seed the ranges with non-native grasses to benefit livestock. WWP is one of the few organizations that has managed to protect some of our public lands. I am proud to support them.

It is well documented that bighorn sheep will die from disease when they come into contact with domestic sheep on our public lands and Western Watersheds has stepped in to remove domestic sheep from my public lands for the benefit of my bighorn sheep, while state game and fish agencies have shied away from this controversy.   Ranchers are not the saviors or our public lands and their self imposed statements of feeding America with their cattle and sheep from my public lands speaks to their self  imposed delusions of grander, usually  from watching too many John Wayne movies.

It's time to put an end to welfare ranching. My beliefs are based on facts and evidence, not cowboy myth. Public land grazing has become a looser for public interest and a winner for a few wealthy ranchers. We must stop this, It is not sustainable. We should be managing public lands for the long term public interest, not for short term financial gain for a few private individuals. Ranchers who cry loud and long about jobs hire foreign nationals to do the real work.  Western Watersheds does more than any other organization to provide real information and protection of our public lands. Stop welfare ranching.

Western Watersheds Project Inc	142338	3	/users/profile/188803	cpcoping	General Member of the Public	1	11/24/2012	The Western Watersheds Project is an organization determined to put people out of work any way they can.  They want to wipe out all ranching on federal lands. This has nothing to do with conservation and everything to do with bullying innocent people out of their jobs, homes and heritage. In Arizona alone, federal lands ranching delivers a positive $3.2 billion economic impact. 98%  of farms and ranches in the USA are family owned and operated. The things the WWP says about the ranchers are not valid and often inaccurate. The photographs they use in their propaganda are misrepresentative.  For example they are currently posting photos on their website taken at the end of a severe drought and saying the vegetation is gone because of cattle. However, the most recent summer had good rains and all those bare places they photographed, which still have cattle on them, are carpeted in perennial grasses and green vegetation. The WWP would never publish photos of the same places after a good rain! There are dozens of peer-reviewed, journal published studies showing the environmental benefits of ranching but the Western Watersheds Project relies only on "science" that is biased by pretending ranching is managed today the same as it was in 1890-1925. All grazing on federal lands today is scientifically managed and all the "science" WWP relies on looks only at the effects of unmanaged grazing (vintage 1890 management) versus grazing exclusion. The WWP abuses the ESA to harm people, not to care for endangered species. For example they submitted a petition to the US Fish and Wildlife Service claiming that cattle grazing was a major threat to the Sonoran Desert Tortoise. Their "scientist" came up with that claim by manufacturing "threat scores" that had no basis whatever in actual measurements of anything whatsoever. They just imagined these numbers and then pumped them through computer models to impress people with no scientific background. They pump this garbage out on boilerplate petitions and force the government to deal with it or get sued.  A local government organization that is responsible for watershed conservation called the Fish and Wildlife Service into coordination. They presented a study that had been conducted by collecting data over a 20- year time frame. That study showed there is absolutely no impact of managed cattle grazing on the Sonoran Desert Tortoise, so the US Fish and Wildlife Service accepted that and did not list cattle grazing in the U.S. as a threat to the species. The problem with groups like WWP is that hard working, honest families that depend on cattle grazing for their livelihoods must continually, and at great expense, prove their innocence from bombardment of scurrilous endangered species petitions, just to continue to put food on their table -and yours -while bully groups like WWP burden the rest of society to pay their taxes for them. I've clicked "life changing" below because WWP ruins innocent people's lives.
Western Watersheds Project Inc	63143	3	/users/profile/69024	oakotter314	General Member of the Public	5	02/03/2011	The Western Watersheds Project has single handedly revolutionized the way America's public lands are being managed by the governmental agencies responsible for protecting them.  Agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service have traditionally allowed ranchers to abuse public lands with little if any real oversight.  Decisions were routinely rubber stamped while the environment continued on a downward spiral.  This all changed when the WWP challenged the status quo and forced the agencies to actually take steps to monitor and start protecting and  restoring abused lands and watersheds.  
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	156544	1	/users/profile/207645	thabo	Donor	5	04/28/2013	If you are looking for a great non-profit to support where you can be confident your contribution will make a big impact, I'd recommend Laptops to Lesotho (L2L)!  This organization is taking on the challenge of bringing computer technology to a remote area of Lesotho in order to improve primary school education.  By bringing this technology in at primary school level, the students at these schools will have gained an immense advantage in furthering their education, not to mention computer skills.  Young lives will be changed forever.  The laptops are a wonderful incentive to encourage the students to attend school and be fascinated by a new means of learning.  The enthusiasm for learning has sky-rocketed! I have personally visited one of the schools involved and witnessed the extremely dedicated L2L volunteers in action as they worked with students and staff.  L2L is a low-budget, low overhead operation that depends on local and international volunteers who are willing to sacrifice the comforts of home, as well as a bit of their finances, to make a major impact in another part of the world.  The volunteers live at the site with the school staff and establish a true partnership.  Their goal is to get the project into the hands of the local school staff and students.  They don't just hand stuff over; they spend weeks at a school teaching and training so that when they leave (until their next trip to check in how things are going) the laptops will be used, cared for and maintained. L2L is well-worth you consideration, so check it out!
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	150248		/users/profile/200369	CMRS	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2013	When they decide to do a Survivor: Lesotho reality show my money would be on Janissa and the Laptops To Lesotho team to come out waaaay on top. Although I had met many of the L2L team before and am very familiar with Lesotho this was my first visit to Ketane region and Nohana Primary School. The area is very beautiful and the people even more so but the terrain is rugged, the living conditions challenging and the "roads"  are some of the toughest in the region. There's a song by the late lamented Syd Kitchen of Durban called Africa Is Not For Sissies which could have been the theme tune for this journey. In my three day visit in late January 2013 I met with the Nohana principal & teachers and enjoyed time in classes with some of the children and their XOs. It was a chance to see L2L in action and also to meet some of the volunteers. I had wanted to see how things actually work, what kind of involvement there was from the school staff and assess how well suited the XOs are to this kind of context. I also wanted to see how well the children - who had had little or no other exposure to this kind of initiative - responded. On all counts I was truly impressed. Although everyone was a bit rusty after the long summer holiday it was clear that teachers and children alike relish this opportunity. The younger children in particular seemed to `get it' very quickly and I am sure this project has already had an extraordinary impact.  Of course there's always `more' which could happen but the strength of L2L is that it proceeds at the pace at which local stakeholders can handle. They are, after all, the ones who will take L2L from being a great idea to being a practical, replicable model which makes sense in the Lesotho mountain school context. Or not.  The volunteer corps - Tony, Mamatsepe, Mary - were all inspirational, indefatigable and versatile.  Above all Janissa's calm, hands-on and sleeves-rolled up approach sets the tone - an approach which I saw perfectly mirrored by 2 Grade 7 girls as they set about replacing a screen on an XO. No mess, no fuss. Just get the job done. It made my heart sing. I am a South African educator, linked to a small donor organisation which has been working in rural Southern Africa for over 30 years. We have funded L2L since 2011 and look forward to learning more invaluable lessons as the initiative develops.

I saw firsthand how well this organization is run and the benefits to students and teachers.  Janissa Balcomb, project leader, impressed me with her problem solving abilities and organizational skills.  These are two important assets to have to make Laptops 2 Lesotho the effective organization that it is. Teachers were very receptive to the training, and the efforts they put forth in learning the laptops showed a true commitment to the project.  Unfortunately I had to leave before the project started working with the students.  I did observe the excitement in the students the day we took several laptops to the village.  It was obvious they knew how to operate the computers as they quickly found music and other programs on the laptops.  It was an honor to be part of this organization that is helping to bring technology to a small village in rural Africa.

What strikes me most about the people involved in this work is their dedication and commitment, especially in view of the difficult area of Lesotho which they have targeted as well as the limited resources they have.  The people involved are extremely enthusiastic and excited about their work and the people they are serving are also excited about the opportunties they are provided with in having these laptops at their schools.  The work relies on volunteeers, both local and from abroad.  Training is given to put the power of the project into the hands of the local teachers who will be working with their students.  The fact that the Basotho are so involved in managing the project is very inspiring and indicative of the true partnership that has developed.  Certainly a project worthy of mention and support!

For instance, more than four-fifths of its villages are not accessible.  The whole region is not connected to the internet, except only one government clinic. In general, this is a technologically underdeveloped place, e.g. there are some villages whereby residents know nothing about cellular phone.  Some residents have never seen and watched a television in their life.  In some villages, majority of villagers have never seen a car.  The same applies to the computers.  This is the place where Nohana Primary School is located. It is really true that these laptops are a treasure to our local community.  We give great thanks to everyone who contributed to make this precious project success. ACHIEVEMENTSTeachers were equipped with basic computer skills.Teachers started to train 24 student group leaders.Teachers mobilised the pupils, community, local stakeholders and educational authorities.Two teachers went to a one day training at Kliptown Youth Centre and Lilydale Primary School in Soweto.Project leaders briefed Maseru Rotary Club members about our project.All Nohana Primary School teachers got a three week school based training.  My colleagues highly appreciated it.  It encompasses laptop repairing, shelves fixing for computers, wiring and running generator.  We got chance for practical activities that served as preliminary implementation of the project.We formulated the regulations and contracts for teachers and parents.  All these people would abide by their terms.  This will guide us on how this mega treasure should be handled. The next quantum leap was to make a work plan and schedule that classes 4, 5, 6, and 7 will be our target.  Each class will have practical lesson twice a week.  They can feel the presence of this treasure of Laptops to Lesotho, and also promote the sense of ownership.We registered all 50 of these computers.  This helps us to know and trace their movements.We fixed burglar proofs in three rooms; one for computer lessons, another one for computer storage and charging and the last one for the generator.To raise funds for the project, we have decided that our school's solar panel be used to charge cell phones and people pay as little as 30 cents per phone.  This is used to buy fuel for the generator.  We have also planned to have a concert once a session. SUCCESSOur school's roll has increased from 314 to 374 pupils.  Implementation of this computer projects has reduced the rate of absenteeism.  It has also improved the learners behavior as they now compete to score points about good things they do at school so they can take laptop home.  Pupils are excited and motivated.  They are grasping very quickly.  Some community members have also shown interest in learning.  We are trying to fix a plan to accommodate them in the computer reaching learning programme. THANKSMy school gives great thanks to the people and companies that have been so instrumental from the planning up to the launching of this project. PART 2Nohana Primary School is engaged in a campaign against HIV and AIDS.  Lesotho has infection rate of 23%.  In rural and poor societies like in Ketane the case is worse.  We have decided to formulate a policy whose main objectives are:- to reduce stigma- promote self awareness amongst pupils and community- encourage the regular use of ARV's. Our motto is "Education is the best vaccination for HIV/AIDS."
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	52269		/users/profile/53157	saraikristi	Board Member	5	09/13/2010	Laptops to Lesotho is a nonprofit organization founded by my aunt, Janissa Balcomb. After donating two laptops to a school in Lesotho, they asked if there was any way to get more because the laptops were so well received. Janissa started by looking into the OLPC grant program, which at the time seemed to be the perfect opportunity to deliver 100 more laptops to the students at Nohana Primary School. Janissa invested a lot of time communicating with the community in Lesotho, organizing volunteers, researching the laptops and necessary technology, and laying groundwork for the project in hopes of being awarded an OLPC grant. After several months, we realized the requirements for the OLPC grant program had changed, and we would not be eligible to receive grant money from them. Instead of giving up, Janissa forged ahead, creating this nonprofit organization Laptops to Lesotho so that the project could continue. The entire Laptops to Lesotho team is hard working and incredibly dedicated to this project. Through our combined efforts, the students at Nohana Primary School will receive their own laptops which will give them access to a better education and a better future. The best part about this organization, in my opinion, is how community-driven it is. The idea for more laptops came from the community, community members are actively involved in the project, and the entire organization will eventually be run completely by members of the community.
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	52212		/users/profile/53076	dog5024	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/11/2010	Laptops to Lesotho is a well-run, well-organized nonprofit with a clear mission.  Their communications are effective and efficient.  Their leaders have both skill and imagination.  I am very pleased to work with them.
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	43992	8	/users/profile/44895	diana9	General Member of the Public	5	06/15/2010	The organization is very focused on obtainable objectives in equipping students of Lesotho with laptops.  This connects the students to the outside world, inspires them to further their education, and opens them up to other educational opportunities.  I like how the organization is dedicated to working directly with the educators in Lesotho.  The organization is not taking on more than they can readily accomplish, so trouble-shooting is effective and timely.  From my discussions with them, it sounds like they want to grow cautiously and gradually so as not to compromise the current mission.
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	43091	11	/users/profile/43865	craig7	Volunteer	5	06/05/2010	Laptops to Lesotho is a small, but admirable organization. With a small group of dedicated people and few resources it is beginning to make an impact in the educational future of children in one of the world's poorest nations, Lesotho. Laptops to Lesotho is endeavoring to provide laptops and internet access to the children of Lesotho. In so doing they are helping the youth of Lesotho to gain access to technology and educational material that would otherwise not be available to them. By providing children of Lesotho with small durable and interconnected laptops they are opening the channels of communication and education among the youth of this impoverished country. This organization, Laptops to Lesotho, and its project is still in the early stages of development, but it is growing. Small investments in this organization could provide large positive results for the children of Lesotho.
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	41644	11	/users/profile/42445	mitch1	General Member of the Public	5	05/28/2010	I learned about this organization through my wife, and what I learned convinced me that contributing was a very good thing to do. Laptops to Lesotho is a small but very dedicated, active nonprofit that has made considerable progress, considering it's very young. They  already have some laptops, and they also have volunteers in place in North America, Lesotho and South Africa, ready and able to help get these laptops to students, and to provide the technical expertise and support for the program. Once the laptops get to Lesotho (later this year) I hope to learn more about how the training went and how the program is received. I have absolutely no doubt given some additional support this program will make real, significant changes in the lives of students and teachers in Lesotho.
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	41069	13	/users/profile/41964	andrewd	Board Member	5	05/27/2010	I was a PCV in Lesotho from 2007-09. When I first arrived at Ketane, a group of teachers approached me and asked me if I would please teach them computers because they and their students were lacking skills and far behind others from big cities. Living in remote Ketane, which is a 10 hour taxi from the capital, I thought they were joking. Eventually, the idea grew. 7 months later we were all crowded around my laptop in my small mud hut learning the basics of computers because an area bishop had given me a small solar panel for the project. This eventually grew into the first ever computer school in the area and the school now has a large 120w solar panel and 4 computers for approximately 300 children. Of course this is not enough! Janissa Balcomb, a RPCV from Lesotho formed a non-profit to build this computer school and others like it around Lesotho. Even the few laptops we have distributed now have made such an amazing impact in the students' lives and their educational level. I have seen it firsthand!
Laptops to Lesotho Inc.	39012	5	/users/profile/39909	Janissa_Balcomb	Board Member	5	05/14/2010	We are a small young organization but we have already made significant strides in improving the lives of the children in Ketane, Lesotho.   So what sets us apart, and why should you support our work?  We have an amazingly talented group of volunteers who are tenacious, energetic, and passionate about our mission. Most have lived and worked in the Ketane community, so we have first-hand knowledge of the immense need for our help and the great potential for improvement, as well as the obstacles we face.  We've seen what other aid organizations  have tried, what has worked, and what hasn't, and we've learned from their mistakes. We built a strong organizational foundation and integrated our work into the community at a pace the community is able to absorb and support.  We have spent a great deal of time ensuring that the local community is completely engaged and directly invested in the success of this project.  Local teachers and principals hold positions of leadership in our organization, and we mentor and train them so they can run the program effectively.  We know from experience that this local support and participation is critical to making long-lasting changes.   We have worked with the teachers and the principal, helping them to write detailed rules and regulations for the project along with contracts and fine schedules that each teacher, student, and parent or guardian of a student must sign in order to participate in this program.  These documents clarify exactly what each persons responsibilities are in addition to how they will benefit from the program. We have spent time intensively training the teachers not only in computer skills but also how to use computers in the classroom to enhance the existing curriculum, and we are helping them develop lesson materials with the computers. I hope you will give us a chance to continue the work we've started to help the children of Ketane.

Being in the water is absolutely magical for him. It calms him like nothing else and the constant use of different tools in the pool help him so much. Being able to swim is just a happy side effect of this program, because we've been given so much more! I have a happier, more regulated child and we have formed so much more than friendships...we have a little family here. We LOVE Aquability!

It was her first experience in a pool since she lived in an orphanage her whole life and is paralyzed.  She gained so much confidence and was able to move her body in ways she had never imagined, making her "land life", that much more mobile!  Swimming in this program has given her a new way to exercise and has helped keep her body healthy in many ways.  Thank you Aquability for giving my daughter access to something new which is helping to improve her quality of life!

This amazing program is the highlight of my special needs daughter's week.  She knows all the instructors by name and the freedom of movement she feels while in the water shines through her happy face.  We are so grateful for Karen's dedicated efforts and for the difference she and her handpicked staff are making in the lives of our children.  Every week I see improvement in not only my child but also those others around us also taking a one on one class with the AquAbility staff.  The pool is full of happy faces where Abilities are encouraged and are thriving in the water.  Thank you AquAbility!!!!!

I was active in biking with handcycles but, was looking for another sport to carry through the winter months. Began swimming with the AquAbility program roughly four years ago to see if was even possible for me to swim independently. Admittedly, is was a struggle the fist few months but, with a lot of coaching and pool time we were able to figure out a system. My swimming has progressed to the point where I have participated in masters meets and have done a few open water swim events.I have continued to swim with the program twice a week since the beginning. I enjoy the camaraderie of fellow swimmers and the cardio conditioning that comes from swimming with a body that doesn't function properly. I highly recommend this organization to anyone looking to explore new avenues in health and conditioning!Jet Turner

Aquability proved me wrong!  My son Kellen not only learned skills as a swimmer but very nearly could swim the width of the pool at 4 years of age.  Swimming enabled him to gain more muscle control and self confidence he couldn't have gained any other way.  All of the instructors were incredible and I will always be grateful for the gift they gave my son that will last throughout his life.

From local children with challenges of all kinds to a Nationally recognized Armed Services program for PTSD, TBI, and physical injuries. The SVAS staff and community understand the symbiotic relationship to reaching out to anyone with a challenge and the long term benefit of learning a new sport or a coping mechanism through outdoor activities. I have been privileged to participate with family and local friends in the program and have seen the results over many years impact many people from all walks of life. I have taken the role of volunteer and donor at SVAS and am proud to acknowledge that over 80 percent of the SVAS funds donated goes towards their programs. From a small grass roots organization to a Nationally acclaimed Veterans' program, Higher Ground, SVAS is an organization the Wood River Valley can be proud of!

Going to the Sun Valley Adaptive Sports, Higher Ground - Veteran's in Arms Program was the best experience that could have happened to me.  The thing that happened to me opening up about feelings to others I knew could relate.  The bond we developed was no simple thing.

They took a group of women with severe PTSD and gave us hope again.  It was the first time I felt "normal" since returning from Iraq. Every need we could have possibly thought of was met, and then some.  They treated us like we were worthy of being treated not only as "normal" human beings, but even better.  As if we had done something great (most of us barely believed we were even human anymore, let alone worthy of praise and adulation.).  To anyone that dares to badmouth this program, clearly you have not walked in our boots and lived with the grief, panic and frustration of PTSD, nor have you found the relief offered at SVAS.

If we want our children to be giving adults we must take the time to show them how while they are young.  WOW Students has had a profound impact on the kids that have participated in community projects and I am hopeful that other communities will want to do the same.

They are champions and cheerleaders for our community and youth.  Because of WOWs hard work it is easy to get students involved in making a difference.
Wow Students (Wood River Foundation Inc.)	313126		/users/profile/404498	Whitney17	Donor	5	10/21/2016	Wow Students gives every student an opportunity to experience generosity. What an incredible value to learn at a young age. At a time when our country is more divided then ever it is crucial that we continue to instill the value of giving our time, our money (whenever we can) and our open hearts to the people who need it most in our community. We all have the power to help someone's life,  regardless of age or financial status.  This program is a gift to our community and our young people.

Families Together For People With Disabilities	85664		/users/profile/95646	Marla	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2011	   I have been wth FT for over 10 years.  In that time, I have shared the sorrow of my sons diagnosis of "severe autism" as well as the death of my husband.  The one weekend we all cherish in memory and anticipation are the Family Together getaways...Even my non-verbal son will say "Families together?" as he anticipates the event!   It is the only place that we have discovered that accepts as ALL as a family, not the pieces of us ..ie: not just a camp for special needs children, not just a camp for parents, not just a camp for siblings, but a FAMILY camp that understands the needs families like mine need to be able to attend such an event~  ! Families Together is one of the few organizations in the country that "get it".   The families-together weekends caters to building family strength in an arena that usually serves to divide families (by ability) .  The people and the events hosted by Families Together is a rare jewel in the maze of "special needs".  Its a resting spot where a family can get their bearings and assimilate the meaning of terms, events and resources dropped on their families by the acquisition of a child with Special Needs.  The hard copy information, as well as the hands-on help is the epitome of what a "non profit" should be.
Families Together For People With Disabilities	85541		/users/profile/95488	Gracie	Client Served	5	04/13/2011	Fifty years ago I was given an incredible gift of a child with disabilities.  At that time there was no help for families like ours.  So, we met the challenges the best we could by determining to raise an independent, happy, victorious child who would function at the very best level possible   Early on I realized how blessed I was to have the privelege of being chosen to be this child's mother.  What a joy and learning experience she has been not only to us, but to every school teacher and classmate she has had.  Yes, the journey has been rocky at times but we all persevered and our child has become someone who is looked up to and loved by many in her world.  Because of Families Together, she has continued to make us proud of her continuing accomplishments.  She loves the work of FT with all her heart and has given much her energy to the work it does for others.  I cannot thank this organization enough for all it means to us.

They have given use a multitude of support in meeting the needs of our special needs twins, but never forgot our other children who are impacted as well. Insurance companies focus on client driven 1 on 1 treatment & disregard the training & support needs of the parents and the emotional needs of the siblings. Families Together supports the entire family. Their family enrichment weekends focus on the family as a whole & link you with other families that understand what day to life holds for families devoted to their special kids.

The family enrichment weekend in Washington was a welcome retreat and great opportunity to meet other families of children with disabilities.  Raising a child with a disability can be very isolating at times and Families Together has done a fabulous job of getting families together and letting them see that others share their problems, concerns, etc.  As my son is beginning the transition process from school, Families Together has been helping me by identifying and advising me on the steps I need to take to make a successful transition.
Families Together For People With Disabilities	85235		/users/profile/95041	Gerriann A.	Client Served	5	04/12/2011	Now it is over 5 years ago my family was first served by Families Together for People with Disabilities.  When life gives you lemons.be grateful you have something to eat. Not exactly what you were expecting right?  After a year of working with Chris Curry and the Families Together staff I finally feel like I have some idea of what to make with those lemons so that they are not so bitter to swallow. Many people try to help you by saying things like, Only special people are given kids with special needs,  You are such a good mom, at least you know how to work the system and finally Things just take time but everything will be ok you will see. Unfortunately, life sometimes gives you lemons and then you need a new cookbook because you only learned to cook using apples.  That is what it is like to live everyday with a child who has significant developmental delays.  I know in the past 6 months I have told everyone that will listen that the parenting skills in my tool box dont work with this child.    I have asked everyone who will listen to just tell me where the parenting book for developmentally delayed children was and I would gladly pay whatever the price of the book and will implement the techniques today.  Only there is no such book called, What to Expect When you have a Developmentally Delayed/Autistic/CF/Physically Challenged/Mentally Challenged Child  That is were Families Together comes in.they have a cookbook and they are willing to share the recipes with families like mine.  My family met the staff of Families Together in September 2006 at an Enrichment Weekend that offered assistance and hope for families who include Children who Challenge.  This sounded like our family and when we were offered an all expense paid weekend where each child would have a one on one caregiver, we were ready for a break and hopeful for some answers. When we arrived to the weekend, I was not a happy camper- I had been eating lemons for the last 2 years.  I was not used to being on the receiving end of services.  I need some answers but I was sure that my sons developmental delays could be overcome by intensive therapy and changing some things about our parenting style and life would be wonderful just like all the other normal families in the world.   I sat in the back of the room angry and unwilling to admit that my family was struggling in the same ways that the other families who were attending the weekend were.   At the end of the weekend we were offered a program that including some home visits to assist in implementing a positive behavior approach to parenting special needs children.  Again, I was not a happy camper.  Chris came to visit us in November right after I left my job to stay home with my 3 year old son, Harrison, who was on the verge of being kicked out of daycare because of his behavior.   I cried most of the first visit and just need to have some answers on what to do and how to make sure that we were going to be able to make it with medical co-payments ranging from $150 to $250 per month, in addition to all our other living expenses as well as a parent a child who did not seem to be making much progress in therapy or at the preschool.  We had a appointment with Department of Developmental Disability Services where it was determined that we had a high level of need but because we did not have a Medical Coupon issued by the state that we would need to be on a waiting list that could take up to 3 years to come to the top.  My family was offered some referrals for services but Energy Assistance and Mortgage Assistance are limited to low-income families and we were just over the income guideline.   The most distressing event was that I had called to make an appointment with a specialist to have a formal evaluation and diagnosis as to what we were dealing with only to learn that we would have to wait 6 months for an appointment.  I researched the specialists in the area only to find that there is only 3 in all of Spokane County and one was not taking any new patients.  I was so discouraged and felt that I was given the sourest lemons ever made. In the months that followed, we started to look forward to our monthly visits with Chris.  I started to learn new ways to engage my son and communicate with him.  It was really hard at first to admit that we did not know how to implement a picture schedule (we were offered one for toilet training from the school district but no instructions).  My son started to learn simple sign language at preschool and this was really the first time that Harrison was able to communicate his needs-Chris taught him waiting and that one word has helped make our life more manageable daily.   Many of the providers assumed that we knew the language associated with services that are normally offered to families with children who have disabilities.  As a social worker I was familiar with the Alphabet Soup of many fields but PEC, SLP, IEP, and DD were all new to my soup bowl.  Chris defined the alphabet soup for us on each visit and offered us hope.  Most of all Harrison bonded with her and started to interact with her more on each visit. The day Harrison received a diagnosis of Autism I called Chris and cried.  She was the most supportive to my family that day.  I was so sure at that time that we were forever to eat those horrible sour lemons now that we had this horrible diagnosis.  She offered us the most encouraging words and reminded us that Harrison is still the same little boy that he was only hours before, yesterday, and a week ago.   Only now we had a name for what was wrong and proven research on how to deal with this disability to help Harrison become that person he needs to be.  The help that she offered kept us going.  The skills she was teaching us were working and we were starting to see some progress in Harrison. We continued to juggle the costs associated with a special needs child and daily life but the money kept getting tighter and tighter-our savings was now gone.  Finally wondering were I was going to get money for milk one week in June I called and asked what the income guidelines were for the WIC program (my husband was working all the over-time he could to keep a roof over our heads and to pay for the therapies that were needed).  I learned that we were just under the income guideline by $20.  I made an appointment and was offered some assistance there, but the best thing that we learned is that the Childrens Medical Income Guidelines were a bit higher.  We qualified for a medical coupon (by less than $40) to cover all the co-payments for therapy and this gave us the Golden Ticket to Department of Developmental Disability Services.   Again I called Chris, only this time it was to share the good news that we finally were going to qualify for the services that we needed through Department of Disability Services.  Once we were assigned a caseworker with DD Services we learned other new things like incontinence supplies were provided, respite care and personal care was offered and hope.   This past month I can honestly say that we have started living again.  For the last couple of years we have just been surviving and trying to getting through the daynow we are starting to enjoy the wonderful flavor of lemon pie, lemonade, and mixing that lemon with sugar, and also adding other fruits and foods too.   Life is still crazy but now we are able to do more than exist. we are able to LIVE.

Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	271867	1	/users/profile/360775	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/11/2015	This group is the environmental heart of the Palouse. PCEI gives us a focus our activism.
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	265373		/users/profile/354116	Sandi14	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2015	Oh my gosh, where do I even START to say how great PCEI is?  I'm lucky enough to live just a few blocks from them and my 11 year old daughter and her friends spend hours playing there on the carousel and exploring the grounds.  They have offered so many wonderful community programs for kids and adults such as after-school nature camps and reading programs and stream clean-up days.  They enrich our community in so many ways through their education programs and activism in the area.  Every single person who works at PCEI is passionately dedicated to making our environment better and teaching people about sustainability and protecting the environment.  This non-profit agency is the BEST!
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	265329		/users/profile/354075	Writer	General Member of the Public	4	10/19/2015	PCEI was one of the first organizations I sought out to volunteer with when I moved to the Palouse. Their work in environmental education re-affirms my own belief that you need to start young for people to care about their natural surroundings and local resources.
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	240159		/users/profile/283606	Benjames D.	Volunteer	4	03/29/2015	This is a great place to go to learning events and receive environmental education - especially for those with children. It is a good place for implementing environmental conservation projects. College students and community members find a place to help out at the nature center, and at the local nature preserve. Locals also have a good opportunity to pick up stream-side litter at the annual events in April, and more consistently as stream section stewards.
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	154646		/users/profile/205492	kimharristhacker	Volunteer	5	04/14/2013	My family and I love the PCEI's many family-friendly events, particularly the summer storytime series.  The PCEI staff work hard to help those who visit the institute to learn about the importance of the natural world as well as the importance of communities acting together to preserve this world.  Thanks, PCEI, for all you do to make our gorgeous Moscow an even better place to live!
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	152272		/users/profile/203334	Idaho DEQ	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/05/2013	I have 30 years experience in environmental regulation and management, specifically water quality remediation, restoration, and project management.  I have worked with PCEI prioritizing and funding water quality restoration projects since 1994 and continue to monitor their work. PCEI provides a value added social and environmental service to our watershed communities through example.  I recommend involvement in PCEI to everyone, including my grandkids.          
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	148868		/users/profile/198278	Janet60	Board Member	5	02/02/2013	PCEI is one of my favorite places to experience for many reasons, these are a few...  1)  The outdoor campus inspires learning and positive engagement for the environment.  2) Several internships and service projects are open for young people to build their skills and resume.3) PCEI creates forums for the free exchange of views and ideas. PCEI is great for all ages to experience...it's an amazing place! 
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	148811		/users/profile/198204	James71	Board Member	5	02/01/2013	I am a current Board member and have been volunteering since 2006. I started volunteering in the native plant nursery when I first moved to Moscow, ID as a "trailing spouse." Then I successfully applied for the Community Outreach Coordinator AmeriCorps position. My research on community organizations and volunteerism (in that delightfully juicy, messy, and complicated intersection among poverty-environment-resilience-social capital) helps me to understand PCEI's importance within the community. The learning opportunities organized by PCEI staff and volunteers are amazing, as are the development of rich networks and community connections. PCEI is welcoming of many points of view, and is a great place to find information about a wide variety of potential solutions to environmental problems. The two Nature Centers are delightful respites from everyday bustle, and the events that PCEI sponsors bring many fun and interesting people together. Connecting People, Place, and Community is our theme. 
Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute, Inc.	5829	15	/users/profile/7634	dirtdiva	Donor	5	06/30/2009	The Palouse-Clearwater Environmental Institute is my most cherished local nonprofit. Their work is so diverse. From planting trees near a local wetland and educating children about climate change to organizing a reused plate project or donating bikes to Africa, this group is the premier environmental organization in Idaho. They work with the UI to run the McCall Outdoor Science School, the only residential science school in all of Idaho! And the staff, volunteers and members are wonderful people working to make a difference!
Wyakin Warrior Foundation	192724		/users/profile/251676	yengstc	Volunteer	5	01/17/2014	I have been involved with Wyakin as a volunteer for nearly a year.  The primary reason I offered to get involved was my personal expereince with the high degree of integrity and caring of its' founder, Jeff Bacon.  When I learned he had founded this group, and that its' board of directors included several other retired Naval Officers that I have known and worked with over many years, all with impeccable honesty and dedication, I knew that I too must get involved.  My experience with Wyakin in the past year has been VERY rewarding, as we move to expand outward from their original program in Boise, Idaho to serving additional wounded veterans with an expanded presence in San Diego, CA.  The Wyakin Warrior Foundation focuses on providing tailored counseling and continuing education for the most severely wounded of post-9/11 veterans, and with its' unique multi-tiered personal mentoring program, has become one of the most successful veterans organizations in the Nation today.
Wyakin Warrior Foundation	187992	1	/users/profile/245195	Ronald8	Volunteer	5	11/07/2013	After leaving the military, the only job I really ever had, I was lost.  Structure, defined roles, expectations, responsibilities were all part of the culture that I grew up in.  Outside I found ambiguity, vagueness, petty competition, and a lack of focus for a higher purpose than Profits.Wyakin Warrior Foundation provides a structure that mimics, replaces the team/squad foundation that I missed.  Accountability and Leadership are present at all levels, exercised and encouraged in each warrior.  This is the same accountability that I had inside the ranks now found outside the ranks.  It is no wonder that the current Wyakin Warriors are doing so well.Of all the veterans groups that are plying for donations THIS one is on the top of the list.  I haven't seen another group that even comes close.
Wyakin Warrior Foundation	187236		/users/profile/244233	AndyKraft84	Board Member	5	10/31/2013	There is no other organization in the country that takes America's young severely injured veterans and helps them every step of the way through the very demanding transition into the work force.  These veterans have many more obstacles than your average college student, and the Wyakin Warrior team/volunteers are dedicated, in any endeavor personal or professional , to ensuring our veterans get through the program. 
Wyakin Warrior Foundation	183870		/users/profile/240784	denisemonroe88	Donor	5	10/28/2013	The people in this organization are "top-notch", genuinely compassionate individuals.  These people are truly giving of themselves and making great strides towards their goal of helping in a very meaningful way, the wounded and disabled warriors they serve.  What a very REAL way to actually help someone who wants to make the effort to help themselves--as extraordinary as that effort my be, given the disabilities involved.  This organization is absolutely changing lives on a shoestring budget.  Real successes are happening here in Boise, Idaho with these Veterans.  Amazing and beautiful to watch lives transformed!  Definitely money well-spent.  
Wyakin Warrior Foundation	182701		/users/profile/239577	Mkuypers	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	I have been involved with this organization for 18 months and can truly say it has been one of the best run organizations I have ever seen. The positive impact the Wyakin Warrior Foundation is making on the lives of the nation's severely wounded warriors is immeasurable. The effectiveness of this program and the caring shown by members of this organization will make everyone who hears about it want to give more to allow it to grow. I am so proud to be a part of something so meaningful.
Wyakin Warrior Foundation	182541		/users/profile/239365	Lucky01	Donor	5	10/25/2013	As a retired vet, this is the most comprehensive program I have come across in the nation. This is what the VA should be doing!  Losing 22 vets a day to suicide, programs like this are what is needed to help them transition from the structures military environment to the public sector. The success rates of this program are more than impressive, they are unmatched.  100% graduation and job placement rates show that they have found the formula for successful transition of those who provide us with the securities and freedoms we all enjoy. 
Wyakin Warrior Foundation	182518		/users/profile/239343	jtmonroe	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2013	This organization makes a positive difference in both veterans lives, and within the communities it serves.  The people involved are genuine patriots who care about the important mission, and believe in servant leadership; and that severely wounded and injured young men and women who have honorably served this country can and should absolutely be future community and business leaders and role models.
Friends of the Clearwater	226895		/users/profile/253915	APK62	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2014	I am an involved community member at Moscow, and Friends of the Clearwater has helped organize many events, such as the Climate Change Rally and Dance, sponsored by the Palouse Environmental Sustainability Coalition. I believe this organization exceeds its mission to save what is left of our environment. I highly recommend this organization!
Friends of the Clearwater	137220	1	/users/profile/183183	LovesBugs	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2012	I have lived in the Pacific Northwest for over twenty years now.  I have also been very lucky to have had a job that allowed me to work outdoors in and around the Clearwater Basin. I have wandered through thousands of acres of heavily wooded mountains, surveyed all of the North Fork of the Clearwater River, that is now part of Dworshak Reservoir, and roamed over the rolling hills of open prairies.  I have worked in many parts of the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests.  I have lived many days, for many years, at campgrounds on the Upper and Little North Fork of the Clearwater River. All of it breathtakingly beautiful. It became part of me. Just experiencing the magnificence of the wilderness and wildlife of what is called, the Big Wild, has seeped into my soul. I have favorite places, but certain memories stay tucked inside my heart. One memory I will never forget happened while a group of us were surveying the Little North Fork. The reservoir was drawn down about 150 feet. We got to see the river free flowing as it should be. We had just sat down to take a break on the banks to admire the sounds and beauty of it when we heard a bull elk bugle. We sat in silence and watched him and his herd come trotting down from the treeline on the other side of the river. We were as still as stones, so they never knew we were just a few hundred feet across the river from them.  It was again, as it should be and we got to be a part of it. Memories like that stay with you and are burned into your soul. I want that to be able to happen to others for generations to come. I am so happy to know that a non-profit organization like Friends of the Clearwater cares enough to help preserve and protect the Big Wild. This organization has the knowledge and expertise to keep the Clearwater Basin a protected wild and scenic part of our nation. Without non-profit organizations like the Friends of the Clearwater, wilderness areas like this will be depleted of all natural resources and some of the wildlife will become endangered or extinct. They are a very important part of keeping the Big Wild alive. Thank you Friends of the Clearwater for all you do and for helping to keep my memories alive. Thank you!!!
Friends of the Clearwater	136752	1	/users/profile/182690	boyingtonfieldchamp	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/10/2012	I became involved with the Clearwater country as a fishery technician with the US Forest Service in 1979, when I joined my mentor in extending my efforts to conserve the aquatic and land resources for fish and wildlife to my private life.  "Economics" in the local area emphasized extraction of public resources as inputs to sawmill and pulp mill economies, with the result that the thin topsoil of the Idaho Batholith, a granitic shield rock, were washed away by rains and snows.  This area of north-central Idaho was facing extirpation of chinook salmon, and recent natural establishment of gray wolves traveling from Canada.  Both were considered endangered species, but the wolves were colonizing in the area and expanding their population (without human intervention).  These two species apparently thwarted timber harvesting on National Forest lands.  This organization formed after my departure to conduct stream surveys on the Tongass NF, where I thought the economics of commercial fishing might be considered in timber harvest plans on public lands.  Nope, it doesn't happen in the US Forest Service...   Friends of the Clearwater is the last of the organizations working to conserve the natural resource values of the area.  The latest victory was in prevention of the transport of oversize "megaloads" of oilfield processing modules (Exxon/Mobil and Imperial Oil) across Idaho on US12 adjacent to the Clearwater and Lochsa Rivers, which are designated "Wild and Scenic Rivers".  In 1979 and 1980, I experienced the incompatibility of commercial truck traffic on this road as 105,000 lb. grain trucks regularly went off the highway, either into the mountain or the river, on their loaded return trips from Montana and North Dakota to the Port of Lewiston.  Spilled grain on US 12 did not help wildlife survival, due to the traffic.  I submitted comments to various agencies on the issue, while still living in Alaska, and shortly after relocating to Idaho in, joined FOC after contacting my former boss, mentor, and friend.  
Friends of the Clearwater	43668	1	/users/profile/44550	caliope	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2010	I became an activist a year ago at a ripe old age due to the above issue. My personal concern over the extremely flawed exchange proposal linked me to a variety of other concerned people. I found it interesting that other environmental groups were ignoring the intricacies of the issue, and thus favoring the exchange. Friends of the Clearwater recognized the inequity associated with the exchange from its inception. I have continually been impressed by their effectiveness and their broad-based approach to handling this issue, and their appeal to a variety of people and groups. The work they do, on a shoe-string budget, is worthy of note, and puts them first on my list of environmental orgs. Gary Macfarlane, long term director, in his humility, deserves a world of credit for his diligence in promoting ethics in environmentalism. To Friends of the Clearwater--we are grateful for your presence, thank-you.
Friends of the Clearwater	42997	10	/users/profile/43758	swiftcarpentry	Former staff	5	06/04/2010	I served as the Education & Outreach Director for Friends of the Clearwater for 6 years. The number of important issues that this incredibly lean organization tackles is incredible. Not to mention the geographic area of concern, the Clearwater River drainage of North-central Idaho, is several million acres. The wildlands here and the rivers and their tributaries within the public land system are remarkable for many reasons. This "commons" serves thousands of visitors annually, provides wildlife habitat for rare species like steelhead, chinook salmon, wolverine, and lynx, and provides important services like clean drinking water, clean air, and tangible and intangible benefits. FOC knows this ground exceptionally well and has members in every community throughout the region. This is a true grassroots group that holds fast to its mission of serving the "public lands" and its inhabitants. These public lands, owned by all Americans,remain this way and will also remain thoughtfully cared for if Friends of the Clearwater remains an active participant and public service organization.
Friends of the Clearwater	42736	1	/users/profile/43453	Brett Haverst	Volunteer	5	06/02/2010	My experience with Friends of the Clearwater changed my life. As a graduate student at the University of Idaho, I was prepared to use my advanced degree in Natural Resources to work for a federal land agency. As my studies evolved, I became increasingly concerned and agitated with the utter mis-management and abuse of our public lands system by the federal government and corporate America. That's when I started volunteering with Friends of the Clearwater and eventually enrolled into an exciting internship program with them. At just over 9 million acres, Idaho contains more federal roadless land than any other state in the Lower 48. Friends of the Clearwater strives to protect each and everyone of these acres, including the proper management and protection of all native plants and wildlife species. They are strong advocates of the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act, HR 980, a bill which would designate the remaining 24 million acres of federal roadless land in the Northern Rockies bioregion as Wilderness.Besides the important wildland conservation work the group does, my favorite thing about them is the people that are associated with them. Because it always has been, and always will be a grassroots organization dedicated to serving the public, Friends of the Clearwater is about community, place, and voice. The longer you go through life, the more you realize that this is what matters.Thank you Friends of the Clearwater for changing my life for the better!
Friends of the Clearwater	20383	1	/users/profile/21539	mtstorms	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2009	For 22 years Friends of the Clearwater has been successfully defending the rivers, forests, wildlife and wilderness in central Idaho's Wild Clearwater region.  They are experienced, accomplished, dedicated and they are survivors throughout periods of economic turbulence.  FOC remains the only public lands protection group with a physical presence in this vast, rugged and largely rural landscape.  My interactions with them include as a citizen, member and volunteer and formerly as a colleague while working for another land advocacy group.  Two things that impress me most about FOC are: 1)they work from a position of strong environmental ethics and principles rather than swaying to political expediency to claim empty "victories".  They can articulate the principles that guide their work beyond the standard and sometimes hollow rhetoric employed by some conservation groups. This group has a huge amount of integrity!!!2) FOC accomplishes SO MUCH for the Clearwater region and its wildlife on an extremely modest budget.  When things are tough they tighten their belts and keep going.  No posh offices, fancy catered board meetings or multi-million dollar advertising campaigns simply to market their name.  Instead, every dollar donated to FOC stretches a long way toward getting real work done "on the ground".  During some rough economic times over the last decade the staff has even taken itself off salary at times while continuing their full-time advocacy and protection work for this special landscape.  I have worked/interacted professionally with many public lands protection groups around the country both large and small and FOC continues to garner my highest respect as one of the most dedicated, capable, principled, knowledgeable and accomplished groups out there in achieving real protections for wildlands and wildlife.  They deserve our support!

They are so grateful for everything and feel that God has blessed them beyond measure. His love for the Lord is palpable and he is so humble he makes us feel as though we are in the presence of Jesus. It is impossible not to love him.
Medex Foundation Incorporated	205168	1	/users/profile/267272	Don_30	Donor	4	07/04/2014	We love to support missions, and especially smaller indigenous ones where you can stretch your giving dollar by having either no or minimal administrative overhead expense.   The outreach work of Pastor Miguel is exactly the type of such ministry work that we endorse.
Medex Foundation Incorporated	205087		/users/profile/253346	arthurbasl	Donor	5	07/03/2014	My experience with this non-profit is exactly what I wanted and expected--excellent.  I know there is not one dime wasted and the purpose of it's existence is to help the Mexican people learn about the gospel and come to Christ.  It does this by supplementing the support of Pastor Miguel and his family so that he can continue to start churches in Mexico.  I personally have witnessed what the foundation has accomplished and am amazed.  I have met Pastor Miguel and know that he is committed to bringing the gospel to the Mexican people.
Medex Foundation Incorporated	193940	1	/users/profile/253346	arthurbasl	Donor	5	02/07/2014	The people associated with the Medex Foundation are very helpful and have the utmost integrity.  They are doing wonderful work in Puerto Vallarta with Pastor Miguel to help the Mexican people learn about God's saving grace.  I am amazed at the things they are accomplishing.  Of all the non-profits I have worked with, the information we need to have is very forthcoming and encouraging.  I am happy to support this team of volunteers.

Greyhound Rescue Of Idaho	212084		/users/profile/275035	Patricia103	Volunteer	5	08/24/2014	My daughter and I have been volunteers and a foster home with GRI for almost 20 years.  Their concern for the greyhounds is born out of a deep love for them by all the leaders and volunteers.  We are always learning and incorporating new and better ideas to make sure everything goes as well for the adopted racer as it possibly can.  There have been many greys that have come through GRI from the track to loving homes.  Any time you are with GRI, you and your grey are welcomed with open arms and hearts.  It is run with the utmost integrity for the dogs and adopters.  In fact, it has been copied by others and GRI has also helped several rescue groups start and get set up properly.  I am very happy to be a part of this conscientious and loving group.   
Greyhound Rescue Of Idaho	211436	1	/users/profile/274363	Duds1529	Volunteer	5	08/20/2014	I adopted 2 wonderful Greyhounds from this rescue Group. They are a truly dedicated rescue. Both Greyhounds were wonderful. My sweet Teca has since passed, but I still have Zack, who is also very precious to me. The group is very mindful of getting good homes for the Greyhounds they rescue and are on going about teaching people about Greyhounds. I was a volunteer for awhile but then moved to another area, but still keep in touch. recently they helped me adopt a darling little Italian Greyhound- an addition to out family of all rescued dogs (and one cat)  I really thank them for all the wonderful work they do in this area of Idaho and {ray that they can continue for many years to come!
Greyhound Rescue Of Idaho	211320	1	/users/profile/274234	Greymom3	Volunteer	5	08/20/2014	As a volunteer and foster home for GRI, I have to say that this organization is awesome!  They truely have the dogs interest at heart and want to make sure that each adoption is the right one.  Being a foster home for these dogs has been a rewarding and heartbreaking experience, but I wouldn't change it for the world.  It's rewarding to see a track dog go from scared and into the unkown to an adjusted loving pet who want nothing more than to be with their people.   I will continue to foster until all these dogs are no longer used and abused or I leave this world.  GRI keep up the good work and know that you can count on me to take in the returns and unwanted dogs whenever needed!

Hands4uganda	304051		/users/profile/395218	vinera321	Volunteer	5	09/13/2016	Hands4Uganda has been in existence a little over 5 years now and has gone from making a difference in just over 50 child's lives to more than 250!  What an accomplishment!
Hands4uganda	303582		/users/profile/394757	karlareynolds	Board Member	5	09/12/2016	 Hands4Uganda is making a big difference to the children who attend  Rock of Ages Community School in Mbiko, Uganda.   Prostitution thrives in Mbiko because it's location at an  African crossroad. Trucks line the road every night and the women make themselves available.  Rock of Ages was started in 2007 by Betty Wasswa, a Ugandan who sought to serve the children of these women. It  is now a full primary school serving over 250 students.  The  school is supported largely thru sponsorship. Each sponsored child receives an education, medical care, a lunch each day they attend school.    The school is impacting the lives of the children, their families and the community.  When you sponsor a child 90% of your  donation goes to supporting the school and your child. 
Hands4uganda	303462		/users/profile/394634	kimdrake318	Board Member	5	09/12/2016	It's been 5 years already since Hands4Uganda organized into a 501c3 and the noticeable difference in the health and learning levels of the students is remarkable! Due, in part, to the percentage of each contribution  (90%) that actually makes it in the hands of the partners in Uganda at Rock of Ages school and also the dedication of those here in the States and those in Uganda. The continued growth of Rock of Ages school is amazing! Now that land has been purchased, it'll be marvelous to watch the next chapter as funds are raised for building.

They are very active in reaching out to other organizations, schools and in being available at a moment's notice to take in injured animals. We need more organizations like AHWF.

American Heritage Wildlife Foundation, Inc.	109063		/users/profile/124456	localwildlife	Volunteer	4	04/05/2012	American Heritage Wildlife Foundation started its journey over 10 ago. The volunteers have dedicated well over 1,000 each year. The prompt reply to phone calls, the willingness to give up sleep to feed the orphaned babies, the sacrifices of personal time to attend public events and spread the word about this group that is working to preserve local wildlife and provide information to the community. Studies show the human population in Idaho will increase by half a million every 10 years! Where can the animals go to recover from injuries? Where can the public learn how to cohabitate with their native neighbors? I will continue to volunteer at AHWF because they are the only group with this mission and plan to build a (full service) Nature Center!

I was on the board of IFB for many years and seen how they have given panrtries access to food and taken food to communities that had no pantries.

The Idaho Foodbank	95727		/users/profile/111237	Community Member	General Member of the Public	1	08/15/2011	This charity doesn't actually feed the hungry - they are strictly a warehouse that stores and then charges nonprofit entities that deal directly with the hungry people for the food that is donated by the community.  So when they say they have "fed the hungry" they have not..........they have simply taken the food that in the past has been directly to social service entities and pantries and now "store" it.  This has hurt the social service entities as now they have to deal with the Idaho FoodBank to get their pantries filled in order to feed the hungry.

Treasure Valley Institute For Childrens Arts	9148	15	/users/profile/10937	Karena	Client Served	1	08/14/2009	TrICA has drifted far from their service and programs mission of providing dance and arts experiences to children.  Their onsite programs are widely enjoyed by young children, but they charge thousands of dollars for these programs to cash-strapped public schools, using up PTA budgets.  While they are draining arts funding from public schools, they are also paying executive salaries of $125,000 each year as well as launching a capital campaign to raise $5 million for an elaborate, fancy facility.  If they can raise so much money, why not spend it on services, programs, and teachers?
Treasure Valley Institute For Childrens Arts	9088	15	/users/profile/10878	Sylvia Flynn	General Member of the Public	2	08/13/2009	Dance and arts programs are good.  The facility/church that they're renovating is expensive and massive. The note on the property is still held by one of the founders. All donations should be earmarked for programs only until the property is owned in full by TrICA and all proceeds can benefit TrICA and not the private note-holder.

We hadn't had a true meal in our home for three days when someone gave me the phone number for Jumpin' Beans Food Bank.  The same day I called they delivered a few bags of groceries and put me in touch with someone to help with my vehicle, along with other community resources I didn't know about.  They asked me to help someone else when I could, to pay it forward.  I cried with relief and joy that night, knowing my kids finally had a square meal in their bellies as they went to bed.

The eight required hours have long passed and we are still showing up weekly to clean cages and help give meds.  The work being done at The Rat Retreat with little to no funds is phenomenal.

We have rats from other rescues that are from hoarding issues, rats that have been rescued from dumpsters, because the owner no longer wanted them, rats from the Humane Society that have many medical issues, such as cysts, tumors, respiratory problems with secondary infections. Many need several antibiotics and emergency care. The Rat Retreat is a hospital, rehab, hospice and forever home to many.

They have supported and advertised many other organizations, such as Orphan Acres Inc., a local horse rescue in Viola, and local bands, such as Bare Wires. They helped these organizations/bands when they were turned down by profit making stations, that only care about the money. They helped organize our Palouse March for Survival, parallel to the 2014 Climate March in New York, and have supported many events! I highly recommend this station!

I am currently a student at the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication at Washington State University, and this place has taught me a lot. I came here not knowing a single thing about how a radio station worked, but in a matter of one week I had my own radio show and I learned all the fundamentals on how a radio station operated. Not only that but I had hands on experience outside of the radio station doing interviews and recording panel discussions. KRFP has taught me a lot and I will be using what they have taught me in the long run.

We invite listeners to become radio DJ's, citizen journalists and news writers so you can share  the voices and happenings  of rural Latah and Whitman counties and the City of Pullman with our listener community.  I had no broadcasting experience when I first walked into the KRFP station in downtown Moscow  3 years ago.  I have  learned how to be a confident radio DJ, and talk show host, meeting so many new and interesting people.  KRFP has broadened my  political, social and music horizons.

They are making a huge impact with the messaging to cowboys and the rodeo participants.  Their creativity with forming a campaign to work in each community they enter is timely and specific.  They are very professional but also available to brain storm with grass roots organizations that shelter or counsel survivors of domestic violence.  It is a pleasure to work with the founders, directors, and volunteers of this organization.  They are all individually committed to ending domestic violence.

The unique organization focuses on the social aspect of violence where being masculine is not about the physical toughness and aggressive nature of masculinity, but to "Man-Up" equates to taking responsibility to end the cycle of domestic violence,  Thank you for all of your hard work reaching out to communities across the United States with this important message.

There would be no other way for the people who go there to receive treatment that they need due to lack of insurance and low income. They are terribly under funded for the amount of need in Sandpoint and could use all the support they can get. I have watched the good they do through several vantage points. Those being as a referring professional, friend to the staff and as a friend of a person being treated.

Since then I have seen many people turn their lives around and become successful members of our community, including several veterans and women with children. Working with this organization has changed the way that I view our community and the individuals that SHIP works with. The most amazing part is watching the individuals that have gone through SHIP's program coming back and volunteering, not only for SHIP but for other organizations in our community. They have created opportunities through Second Chance Building Materials Center to help individuals with barriers to employment. They are community oriented and have helped many other non-profit organizations in Boise with donations of items for auction fundraisers and the creation of a website designed to help link offenders with resources.
Supportive Housing And Innovative Partnerships Inc	100465	1	/users/profile/122642	Executive Director 83702	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/09/2011	This comment is in response to Momma dated 12/3/2010.  We are truly sorry that you feel that you had such a negative experience.  During the 2009-2010 fiscal year we experienced a $250,000 cut in state funding with very little notice.  Prior to that time, we managed 12 safe and sober houses with a total of 120 beds serving persons who desired recovery.  This included homeless veterans, persons being released from jail or prison, others experiencing homelessness.  Due to these severe cuts we were not able to maintain all 12 houses.  We began closing houses as leases expired and unfortunately we were slow in paying expenses during that time.  We consulted with our CPA who advised us to pay in the following order: payroll and related taxes and fees, house rents and utilities.  We ended up closing down 6 houses with a total of 55 beds and laid-off 5 staff members.  Since this time we have further diversified our funding base and have made great strides in paying off all of the back expenses.   I have also checked with our donors and was not able to find anyone who was unhappy with the services we provide.  I do recall a person that I did have a conversation with during that time frame regarding a contract between SHIP and another entity.  The person was quite upset that I refused to discuss the situation because she was not a party to the contract.  The person is not a substance abuse professional, nor was she a large donor as reported in the review. I am happy to report that the SHIP did not go down as the reviewer had hoped.  We have turned around a situation that was beyond our control.  We have secured new funding that has allowed us to add 2 new houses, so we are up to 8 houses with 75 beds.  
Supportive Housing And Innovative Partnerships Inc	58450	1	/users/profile/62221	Momma	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/03/2010	SHIP is a poorly run organization that lacks positive communication with community members, supporters and vendors. The organization has a history of inability/unwillingess to pay their debts and due to the lack of quality leadership puts their tenants at risk. An organization that specializes in stabilizing persons who are used to a chaotic environment should be stable - not add to the chaos. Unfotunately, the "SHIP" is going down, due to the incompetent leadership that values coping an attitude with peers, vendors and supporters rather than engaging in healthy, positive communication.

For visitors who wish an entertaining and educational experience, this facility is first class.  During your visit you will learn cool facts about birds of prey, you will learn about the sport of falconry and the Peregrine Fund's mission.  Upon arrival most visitors do not realize we have over 200 birds of prey at the Center.  Many do not know that one of the Peregrine Fund's important missions is the propagation of endangered birds of prey for release to the wild.  Fun and educational  experiences await visitors of all ages from children making birds of prey masks to seniors who grab the "Kodak Moment" to get photos of the grand kids dressed up like birds of prey.  You will likely leave with a greater appreciation for these awesome raptors.   I have heard  more than one visitor walk away saying they had no idea this place had so much to offer.  For us tour guides, that is our reward.   Steve Lewis

I spent three and a half hours here that day and knew when I retired I'd volunteer to work at Birds of Prey.  Four years later I began my volunteer position.  As someone who has visited all 50 states and about 30 countries, I can say without reservation The Interpretive Center and Peregrine Fund are at the top of my best experiences. It is a place where every week I've volunteered, I've learned something new.  The greatest experience of course is to show a live raptor to visitors, however every moment is enjoyable.  We meet some of the most fascinating people in the world (literally).  True satisfaction is knowing each month my five year old grandson is going to ask, "Papa, can we go up to Birds of Prey?"

Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities dba, Sun Valley Center for the Arts	294172		/users/profile/384891	Gayle18	Donor	5	06/29/2016	I often exclaim to people from other parts of the country what a treat it is to live in the Sun Valley area. The people, the natural beauty, the outdoor opportunities all make this a truly special place, I tell them. But one of the first things I mention about why I love Sun Valley is the incredible selection of cultural events available to us throughout the year, for which the Sun Valley Center for the Arts is largely responsible. I had been a fan of the Center for a long time, but a few years ago when I attended a concert given by Jake Shimabukuro, an amazing ukulele player from Hawaii, I noticed the enthusiastic reaction of several middle school and high school students sitting near me. Wanting to see more students enjoying the artists who come to our community, I met with Kristine Bretall to discuss my commitment to help sponsor their educational outreach program. She and her staff leapt at the opportunity. I am proud to continue to be a part of an organization that allows students to experience up-close and personal interactions with professional musicians, and to even perform with them on-stage!

If I could choose how to best enjoy the last weeks of my life, in addition to being with my wife, I would attend David's workshop again. He is never short on sharing kind and supporting words, he is the ultimate teacher, touching your heart and always quick to put a smile on your face and yes, along the way you become a landscape painter.
Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities dba, Sun Valley Center for the Arts	293996		/users/profile/384693	Bethmagee	Client Served	5	06/27/2016	David Dunlop is by far the best instructor I have ever had.  He truly enjoys teaching and he made me feel like he had all the time I needed one on one with him. He sparked my creativity and taught me how to add symbolism to my work.  I loved the plain air sessions and I wonder if we could go into the Sawtooths on horseback for a day to see how he approaches our beautiful mountains and lakes. Redfish corrals could take us in as individuals and the liability issue would be taken care of. This would be an attraction for the plain air painters of Idaho and others who would be interested in that
Trailing Of The Sheep Cultural Heritage Center Inc	142150	1	/users/profile/188586	GSBoecker	General Member of the Public	5	11/23/2012	Each summer, my husband and I live on our wilderness property in a wild canyon not far from Hailey and Sun Valley, Idaho.  A nearby sheep rancher and his men bring a large band of sheep to our mountain valley for summer grazing.  We have been able to see up close how hard and amazing the life of the rancher is, and the effort and skill of his Peruvian herder, his dogs and horse.  This is difficult, often thankless work, and we have seen the dedication of the men and their amazing herding dogs and fascinating guardian dogs.  In fact, we have as a pet an Akbash dog from the rancher.  The Trailing of the Sheep festival brings the spotlight to this life, to the great effort involved in raising livestock.  The Festival has showcased the colorful costumes, music and dance of the ancient Latin American heritage from which these herders come.  It brings to children and 'city folk' the beauty of the horse and dogs and the wildness of the sheep, as they race through the town of Ketchum.  It brings Basque food and delicious lamb.  It highlights the wonders of wool, often forgotten in these days of synthetics.  The Festival, the genius of Diane Peavey, a sheep rancher's wife and a well-known author,  has exploded into a multi-day, multi-faceted celebration of the glory and difficulty of living with nature.  In its color and vibrance, it celebrates our multi-cultural America.  It celebrates all that is wild and real.  
Trailing Of The Sheep Cultural Heritage Center Inc	141286		/users/profile/187569	edominique	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	What an amazing experience to be a part of the Trailing of the Sheep Festival. It was such an educational and energetic celebration of the valley's heritage, and the beloved sheep. I recommend this event to anyone who loves a beautiful setting, great food, great people and lots of fun!
Trailing Of The Sheep Cultural Heritage Center Inc	131156	1	/users/profile/176709	PoppyHay	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	The Trailing of the Sheep Festival, held this past October 11 - 14 was amazing.  The Sun Valley are (home to the famed Ski Restort) was filled with tourists and locals alike in search of all thinks lamb!  And noone was dissappointed.  There were free lamb tastings at some of Ketchums finest restaurants on Friday night, followed by a gathering of women writers from the West, sharing their stories about raising themselves, their families and sheep on ranches throughout Idao and the West.  On Saturday, the city of Hailey (everything is within 14 miles) was the place to be.  The Folklife Fair had everything from great entertainment - Basque Dancers, Scottish Bagpipes, Peruvian music and so much more - to craftsmen selling everything wooly - and Hailey's best restaurants prepared lamb dishes of all sorts, for a very reasonable lunch ticket.  Along with all this, throughout the weekend, there were lectures and lamb shearing, fleece judging, kids activities, wool crafting classes, cooking classes, museum exhibits, and a couple very special presentations by Linda Cortwright, Founder and editor of Wild Fibers Magazine.  The Festival is also home to a Points Qualifying Sheepdog Trial.  This year 54 dogs competed to pen 5 wild sheep after herding them through a course in 12 minutes.  It is an amazing sight to watch these dog work the sheep.  The Festival is a stand alone 501 c 3 and raises the funds each year to bring the Festival to life with all events free or for a minimal charge.  The biggest event closes the Festival with a parade of 1500 sheep "trailing" down Main Street in Ketchum - which isn't staged - it is the rancher's right of way to bring the sheep from their summer to winter grazing lands.
Idaho Lions Sight and Hearing Foundation	198918	1	/users/profile/259742	curtkelley	Board Member	5	04/25/2014	The Idaho Eastern Oregon Lions Sight and Hearing Foundation was created to help fulfill the Lions Mission of We Serve by changing lives through sight and hearing preservation services.  The Foundation sponsors  Sight and Hearing screenings, assistance with eye surgery expenses and providing hearing aids are among the Foundation programs.  I have volunteered to work on many school screenings and it is very gratifying to be thanked by the students and school staff for providing this service.  The Foundation has an excellent record of transparency and provides information to the Lions Clubs and public in our service area on a regular basis.  The fact that it impacts the lives of a large number of Idaho and E. Oregon residents is absolutely fantastic.   The Board of Trustees is also proactive in the long term planning of the organization and participates in outreach to the community at large.

Idaho Lions Sight and Hearing Foundation	198862	1	/users/profile/259678	nanthony24	Board Member	5	04/24/2014	I have just finished my first year as an elected Trustee for the Lions Sight and Hearing Foundation.  I serve on a volunteer basis. Our eye bank is one of the largest in the country.  There is no waiting list for corneas in Idaho and we routinely send corneas throughout the United States and overseas when requested.  Our Mobile Screening Unit travels around the state to screen people, especially children, for vision and hearing.  We collect eyeglasses by the thousands which are sent overseas to provide the gift of sight to those in need.  We also collect and recycle hearing aids which are given to the hearing impaired right in Idaho. And our Personal Assistance program helps pay for eyeglasses, hearing aids , and some eye surgeries if possible.  Our greatest need is for additional funds for the Personal Assistance Program. We are not able to fulfill every request we receive and the need is great.  I highly recommend the Idaho Lions Sight and Hearing Foundation to anyone considering a charitable donation specifically for Personal Assistance. 100% of your donation will go to helping those in need. 
West Valley Humane Society Inc	217042	2	/users/profile/280560	TheWorldIsMad	General Member of the Public	5	09/24/2014	I think it's sad that a group of individuals who claim to be "allies" of the shelter have done nothing but tarnish the image of a great animal shelter and operation.  It is a very clean facility for the shelter animals and the employees do an amazing job at taking care of these animals.  I've been in and out of the shelter on a weekly basis and all I see are friendly faces and happy animals.  It's like my father use to say, "Remember this, when you point your finger at someone, there are 3 more pointing right back at you."  It is a sad day that people put their own needs or desires over the welfare of the animals they claim they are protecting.  Allies my ass.  They should be ashamed of themselves and banned from the shelter.

The people at SRCC are very friendly and very helpful.  I had a thorough examination, received labs, and got my meds all for free.  And they treated me with respect the entire time.  I didn't feel like a "charity" case.If it had not have been for SRCC, I am positive that I would have become too sick to work again.  SRCC gave me back my health and saved my job.  They do much more than just provide health care.  What a great bunch of people!

SNAKE RIVER COMMUNITY CLINIC INC	10137	7	/users/profile/11999	GreenShag	General Member of the Public	5	09/09/2009	The Snake River Community Clinic (SRCC) will be starting its 10th year October 2009.  It has filled the gap of health care for uninsured, medically needy with one paid staff member (their director) and an entirely VOLUNTEER health care provider staff, nursing staff, pharmacy staff, phlebotomy staff, and clerical staff.  Over 400 medical, nursing, phlebotomy, pharmacy, and public health students from area colleges and universities have gained valuable experience at SRCC.  It serves an area nearly 16,000 square miles in size, including all homeless, victims of domestic violence, and uninsured mental health patients.  A free medical visit, $20 single tooth extraction, free labs & x-rays, dedicated volunteers, and enthusiastic community support make SRCC a free clinic for the uninsured of which we are very proud!  It is a member of the Free Clinics of the Western Region, National Association of Free Clinics, the Nez Perce County Mental Health Court team, and works on the Advisory Board for the local Salvation Army.  Collaboration and quality care are SRCC's secrets to providing years of care for thousands of uninsured.  It receives no government funding!
Northwest Animal Companions Inc	104427		/users/profile/140025	openriver	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/25/2012	This "charity" must be shut down immediately!  The "director" Troy Jackson is a criminal with a loonng history.  The latest is guilty of pot possesion  which he happened to find while chasing with a gun on seat of his car a guy "stealing " from a dumpster!  He makes $60,000.00/yr and the "thrift shop" takes in $5000.00/wk.  Read the Idaho Statesman or enjoy a number of lawsuits.  I had the honor of being a past office manager for the Vancouver Humane Soc.  I worked with a wonderful Manager - Jeff Orme whom upon accepting the position immediately slashed his sallary!!! I never knew what it was, but I do know it takes a Real Man and Humanitarian to Slash a very good sallary for something (some lives) they love and believe in.  I went to NAC to offer my assistance only to hear a man pleading with a representative to pay their bill as he had bills to pay and had really worked with NAC but noone would return his calls.  I was very rudly treated.  When they found out who I was; the charm was turned on.   PLEASE shut this scam down!  Innocent animals are counting on your help.
Northwest Animal Companions Inc	50599	1	/users/profile/51118	casper123	Volunteer	5	08/17/2010	I have been involved with NAC for several years.  The organization used to be a small group of volunteers that did the best they could with the small amounts of donations the public provided.  About 2 years ago, a new Executive Director was brought on.  He is a volunteer and until recently, was the only full-time person trying to handle all aspects of the organization.  There were many volunteers that did not want structure but without it, NAC would continue to be a small, relatively inneffective organization.  Now NAC is making huge strides toward our goal of building Almost Home, a no-kill companion animal sanctuary.  We were saddened to part ways with a few of our dedicated volunteers but we have to strengthen the organization and, unfortunately, that means clarifying structure and responsibilities.  We have increased our spay/neuter numbers and are now able to assist low-income pet owners with medical care that they would be unable to attain elsewhere. Our volunteer numbers are growing and right now is a very exciting time for our organization. However, like any other growing charities, we face hurdles and obstacles and must learn through trial and error.  We receive almost 200 calls every week for rescue and rehoming and do our absolute best to help everyone as effectively as we can with the resources and volunteers that we have.
Northwest Animal Companions Inc	47788	1	/users/profile/48548	citykitty	Volunteer	1	07/05/2010	This organization used to be fantastic. In recent years, particularly the last year and a half it has taken a nose dive. Many long term volunteers have left. There have been reports of the Executive Director and staff being visible drunk at events. I would do a very in depth inquiry into their finances and debts before donating any money to this cause. There seems to be significant mismanagement in this area. As far as donating time, if you want to be treated with respect and as a valuable resource do not look at giving time to this organization
FNDH INC	299517		/users/profile/390433	ProjectFND	Client Served	5	08/06/2016	FNDHope's website is a much-needed resource for FND patients, carers and doctors. They also provide a brilliant support group which is available to all those who suffer from FND, or care for someone who does. They have used research and input from leading researchers in order to make the website as accurate and up-to-date as possible, and support patients regardless of the cause of their symptoms. The admin team of the support group are all approachable, kind and caring. They are always available to get in contact with with questions or concerns, and they keep the group up to date with the latest information and research about FND and related conditions. 
FNDH INC	279387		/users/profile/369460	Writer	Former staff	1	02/09/2016	The micromanaging leader of FNDHope has done nothing for awareness for functional neurological disorder (FND), we found out she stole another company's website information, and she claims she was getting millions of dollars in awareness money from an MECFS grant or $5.4 million.  For several months I was a volunteer and they have a message of pushing people out who can't conform to a conversion disorder theory they harp on.  Now I'm sitting on there as another name just watchin her destroy this nonprofit.  She kicks people off for asking questions none of them like the looks of, doesn't know how to get any funding, hasn't brought awareness (except to herself), and we are all left dangling with this organization that doesn't know now to make a website or run a company.  We have no "hope" with FND ever getting recognized!  She just had a bunch of friends become board members recently and I know them as farmers but nothing with this disorder or running a charity.  Not one of them.  They need a real board so we can get research money.
Lemhi County Humane Society Inc	194263		/users/profile/253811	Cindy122	Volunteer	5	02/13/2014	I would like to rebutt the previous review.  The folks who are on the board of the Lemhi County Humane Society donate thousands of hours and dollars to the organization on a yearly basis.  The Humane Society concerns itself with both animal sheltering and animal welfare. The past few winters have been especially bad since hay prices are high. There have been many cases of animal abuse and neglect by horse owners. So...if the previous poster is one of those people that considers what we do as policing...... Damn right we're going to police the people who allow their animals to starve and we're going to prosecute them if possible. Now, about that veterinarian...yes, the board did send a letter to the State Board of Veterinary Medicine because there were many failed spay surgeries where shelter workers walked in to the shelter and found the guts of the spayed animal (be it a dog or a cat) on the floor of their pen. THIS JUST WON'T FLY WITH US!. The vet has been asked repeatedly to get more help to become a better surgeon but this hasn't happened. The Humane Society consulted two veterinarians from out of the area (actually out of the state) who recommended we do what we did. We don't do things willy nilly or without reason. Finally, If anyone out there thinks they can do a better job then step on up and start doing it.
Lemhi County Humane Society Inc	192583		/users/profile/251474	mwmm	General Member of the Public	1	01/15/2014	This organization started out as a truly wonderful non-profit, doing all they could to help animals in need.  But---over the years, and after many changes to the board of directors, they have become a group of people who seem to be more interested in policing pet owners, livestock growers, and even the veterinarians they do business with.  They have trespassed on private property to check animals and to trap feral cats.  They have made false accusations about a local veterinarian, which were investigated by the State Board of Veterinarian Medicine, and said veterinarian exonerated.  There are two members of the board of directors who have conflicts of interest and the organization doesn't have a Conflict of Interest Policy.  Their record keeping is not sufficient and there have been complaints from the public about some of the staff at the Animal Shelter.  Rude is a word that has been used to describe them.  Too bad-- because they have a wonderful facility and this community needs the services they provide. After reading the rebuttal to my review and in light of recent activity from this organization in our community, I will add a little.  Starting a Facebook campaign to discredit local law enforcement officers is not what their mission statement is.  Maybe they need to review that and amend, as that is exactly what they have done. I noticed the other reviewer did not give any statistics of what they have done with grant money received.  Nor did she address the fact that they have a serious conflict of interest.  Further harassment of said veterinarian has been noted and Idaho State Board of Veterinary Medicine, monitoring the situation, continues to find no wrong doing by the veterinarian. If I could give them 1/2 a star, I would.

Luke Commission Inc	242864		/users/profile/329428	Cent	Donor	4	05/12/2015	Luke Commission helped us provide funding to a Swaziland TB hospital.  Due to the remoteness of the hospital, this isn't easy.  I contacted U.S. embassy personnel and they referred us to the Luke Commission.  They were quite helpful and good stewards of our donation, and they got the funds where we believed they were needed.  We will contribute to this group again.  
Luke Commission Inc	194701	4	/users/profile/254450	colleencopple	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2014	The Luke Commission has grown from a small medical outreach to address HIV/AIDS in Swaziland, the country with the highest HIV/AIDS rate worldwide, to a sophisticated and effective mobile medical outreach model recognized as a leader in the field. TLC provides free, compassionate, comprehensive healthcare to under-served rural populations through mobile medical outreaches. The Kingdom of Swaziland, Ministry of Health has upgraded these from clinics to mobile hospital outreaches, since they provide the same types of services in the field that hospitals do (medical intake and medical history, surgery, pharmacy, lab, x-rays, assistive devices for people with disabilities, triage, doctor visits, diagnosis and referrals for treatment). TLC will see an average of 650 patients in a day and up to as many as 1,000, because they do not leave until every patient is seen. Process: TLC works with community coordinators to mobilize outreaches in isolated locations. The coordinator secures a local primary school for the day and engages the entire community in the day long event. TLC transports staff and equipment to set up a mobile hospital with rooms for medical intake, triage, lab, pharmacy, x-ray, surgery, counseling and testing, doctor visits, vision screening and assistive devices. They depart early in the morning and often travel up to 2 hours or more to reach a location. They set up the unit while a community dialog is taking place with the 1,000+ community members waiting to be treated where key health issues such as HIV and TB testing and treatment are discussed. Then each patient is seen by a Swazi staff person for a detailed medical history, lab tests, doctor visit and referral for follow up and medications at the pharmacy. Additional services such as vision care and assistive devices for people with disabilities are also going on at the same time. A room is set aside for voluntary spiritual counseling and support. All medical instructions and prescriptions are provided in siSwati. The staff:TLC has a very strong locally trained team of Swazi's who provide counseling, translation, testing, and administrative support for the mobile outreach. The medical team is led by Dr. Harry VanderWal and his wife Echo VanderWal (PAC) with a team of 3 nurses.  Results:TLC delivered 50 mobile hospital outreaches in 2012 and saw 24,000 patients, in 2013 they increased 50% to seeing 36,000 patients in the most inaccessible locations in Swaziland. They test more patients in a single day (100+) for HIV than all the rest of the providers in the country combined and have the highest percentage of patients who successfully enroll and maintain treatment. They  perform more male circumcisions than all the rest of the providers in the country on an single day and have the highest rate of followup with patients and the lowest rate of complications. Since their beginning in 2006, TLC has seen more than 150,000 patients and delivered more than 350,000 medical services. The Kingdom of Swaziland has embraced them as an extension of the national medical system, USAID and the CDC recognize their outstanding performance in the field reaching the most isolated populations. Funding Sources:The Luke Commission is funded by donations from individuals, churches, corporations. In recent years, some additional funding has come from grants with USAID and the CDC. Expansion:TLC has purchased 30 acres of land and is building a permanent campus in the heart of Swaziland as a base from which to expand their capacity in country and to become a training site for teams from other countries to replicate the mobile medical outreach model that they have perfected. As a volunteer and supporter, and professional development specialist working across southern Africa. I am extremely impressed with their commitment to the patient, the dignity and compassion with which they approach their work is exemplary. Their vision for what the patient needs to be successful and their drive to remove the barriers preventing them from accessing care and being retained in treatment sets a new standard for the field.

BGB HORSE SERVICE AND RESCUE INC	88546	1	/users/profile/99801	Iwanttohelp	Donor	5	05/10/2011	I've taken the opportunity to both donate time and resources to BGB Horse Rescue.  Over the years, I've contributed to many worth causes, and I can say I'm extremely satisfied with BGB.  Not only have they welcomed my help on their facility, I have watched as they have been very respectful of the donations that are received.  Feeding and maintaining over 30 horses on any given day is both time consuming, and resource intensive.  Each donation has been used directly for the horses benefit, and I've never seen any frivolous spending by the founders, or their helpers. I can confidently say that I fully support BGB Horse Rescue's mission, and also there organizers and their use of funds and resources.

Because International Corp	286479		/users/profile/327773	paulakiger	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Healthy Steps for Children in CambodiaHealthy Steps for Children in CambodiaIn the last week alone I have spent $15 many times I over. I bought two birthday cards for relatives last night which cost almost $15 -- just pieces of decorated paper which will be appreciated but in the long run won't change anyone's life.Through Daniella's effort to put 'The Shoe That Grows' on the feet of 500+ children in a village in Cambodia, these children's lives will be changed! Because so few of them have shoes, they are subject to infectious diseases and injury. Even if they can manage to get one pair of shoes, children grow so quickly that they can't afford to replace shoes as they grow.Linda Freeman and her daughter-in-law Daniella have a goal of providing 600 pairs of 'The Shoe that Grows' which is made to last five years/five sizes to the children of Light of Future School in Cambodia when they visit in 2016. These children have inspired me; their sheer joy at getting an education, at getting even a PENCIL in order to pursue an education, is humbling. And I think a shoe that lasts five years is probably a better cost proposition than a piece of decorated paper; I'm betting the children of Light of Future School will find that to be the case!More about this project from Linda here: http://iamthriving.org/2015/10/the-shoe-that-grows-in-cambodia/And the 501c3: www.becauseinternational.org

The program is designed to help people get back on track to help them stay where they are and not on the street.  We have found that the largest number of people that are in need are children.  We want the family to stay where they currently live.  The children need a stable place to go to school and live.

Just Strays Animal Foundation Inc	223827	2	/users/profile/287580	purplecollie	Client Served	5	10/17/2014	Six years ago I found a lovely cat at Simply Cats who had been there awhile. She still sleeps with me and "talks" to me. This year I adopted another that had been at the facility for over a year. Andromeda is so loving and kind! Over the years I've observed that this organization makes good use of its resources. It is a no-kill shelter, and all animals receive health care plus time with humans. They have programs for weight loss, exercise, temperament testing, and helping to keep the cat happy while in care.   Those wanting animals are thoroughly screened.  They continue to promote themselves to obtain donations and find good homes for unwanted animals. Their cadre of volunteers stay for many years and also deserve praise for all the work they do with the animals and in the facility (cleaning, assisting).  The facility is well-lit, calm, and clean. The cats wander their rooms and outside areas freely, unlike being caged at other places.  I can't thank them enough for my cats, and for helping me find my "fur-buddies" in such a calm atmosphere.  They deserve notice and praise for their hard work!

Mission Aviation Fellowship	93604	4	/users/profile/107783	Debra S.	Client Served	5	07/08/2011	Five of my trips to South Sudan have occurred at the hands of MAF in Uganda. The first time the previous coordinator of our diocesan trips was showing me the ropes and we actually visited the MAF offices. Since then I've been the coordinator myself. We make all our arrangements via email, and the MAF staff members are quick to reply, friendly, and efficient. We wire our funds to them, and they keep excellent accounts. Their office is very small and the staff is also small -- I could see that they aren't wasting their donations on staff perks -- but they're organized and juggle a lot of needs and requests like storing provisions and luggage for transport when weight allows, managing the changing needs of indigenous and international travelers, helping with visas, etc. I've known them to switch planes for a flight or add a second plane when passenger needs changed, although they can't always make last-minute accommodations, of course. I've also dealt with MAF Kenya via email regarding transport of a seriously ill passenger, and they were equally efficient and capable. Flying with MAF is awesome, from the time you buy a ticket till the time you land where you're going. Their email explains how everything works, the weight limit of luggage, the need for passenger weights and documents, etc. Once you're at the airport, they have efficient and pleasant inspectors of luggage, and they get everyone weighed in and ready very quickly. The commercial airlines could learn a thing or two from them. The waiting room at their airport, Kajjansi, is clean and hospitable, with sofas, coffee and tea, and bathrooms. The planes are all sparkling clean. Every pilot prays before taking off, and then the plane flies low enough over Uganda and Sudan that you can really see the land -- a breathtaking view of Africa. They explain everything without messing around, so for example when you get to Arua for immigration control, you know exactly what to do. They're also very flexible -- usually we return to Kajjansi from Sudan, but when we had a flight out of Uganda the same night, they returned us to Entebbe instead. When we're returning to Uganda from Sudan, we call them to find out what time to be at the dirt airstrip, and the first hum of the plane and the first glimpse of it are always exciting. The MAF guesthouse in Kampala is equally wonderful. The managers are so friendly, and they keep the place spotless. The food is simple but excellent, and they are very flexible too -- when we want to invite guests to have dinner with us there, they are very welcoming. They also help us arrange our ground transportation in Uganda -- we have a favorite driver there now -- and give advice on what to pay taxis and where to find anything we need to buy. The rooms are simple but extremely comfortable; bathrooms are shared but there's almost never any waiting. The porch has comfortable furniture and a beautiful view across the hills of Kampala. It's such a perfect transition between Sudan and the West that we like to spend a day there for mission prep before going into Sudan and a day there afterward to debrief, relax, and -- sometimes -- see some of the Ugandan countryside. If you aren't actually going to Juba, it's much faster and less complicated to enter South Sudan by another way, and we have found MAF to provide the perfect combination of efficiency, know-how, and Christian hospitality.

There is a team of dedicated and smart staff who are knowledgeable about every aspect of environmental issues in Idaho.  I particularly like their work advocating for the protection of public lands, because Idaho's quality of life depends on it.  They also work on water and air quality, resource extraction issues, growth and urban planning, wildlife and fish, energy and just about anything else that is related to conservation of our environment.  I feel like every contribution I make will be well-spent.

If you are unable to become a sponsor they have numerous ways to help children and their families throughout the world.  I choose both sponsorship and donating to clean water projects, financially assisting heads of households to open and operate their own businesses or become part of a community producing/making products to be sold through various means.  I also have purchased chicken, goats, pigs, etc. so families could make a living selling eggs while enjoying the meat from non-producing chickens; selling the milk from goats; selling the piglets from a bred sow, etc.  I will continue to sacrifice so that others can achieve an education, know God, make a living and help their children to become Christian leaders, heads of their own families, etc.

Alzar School Inc	248729		/users/profile/247406	EnviroFan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/17/2015	The Alzar School provides an education that is truly world-class. The school's ability to blend engaging outdoor activities and cultural experiences with traditional academic requirements is second to none. I highly recommend the Alzar School for high school students who are ready to go beyond the traditional high school experience and step into a community that is extraordinary and life changing. They make learning fun, exciting, and effective for their students.

Ryans Rainbow Connection Inc.	275711	1	/users/profile/365365	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/05/2016	I cannot think of a worthier cause than one with a mission to keep our precious children alive, teach them how to love themselves as they are -- while still respecting differences in others -- and reassure them that they all have a place in this world no matter what they may believe in a moment of despair.And I cannot think of a worthier person to be at the helm of such an organization.  Julie Kesel Zicha is a woman who has personally experienced the unimaginable heartbreak of losing her beautiful child by his own hand because he could no longer bear the torment he experienced for simply being "different" in the eyes of one narrow-minded community.  Ryan Joel Zicha is a perfect example of someone who fought valiantly to live his life authentically.  Sadly, those who sought to silence him won that battle.  Through Ryan's Rainbow Connection, however, Julie Kesel Zicha has shown her determination to win the war.  Julie Kesel Zicha's ability to speak from the heart and to guide others in seeing the world from a more compassionate perspective is well documented.  Since Ryan's passing five years ago, Julie has established herself as a force to be reckoned with.  She is a tireless advocate, as well as a hard worker with the passion, intelligence, integrity and work ethic necessary to lead this organization to success.  There can be no doubt she will one day be counted among the ranks of other well-known parents who crusaded for change after losing their own children far too soon: Adam Walsh, Polly Klaas, Natalee Holloway and Megan Kanka, to name just a few.  The potential reach of this organization is infinite.  The need for societal change is resounding.  People from all walks of life have children, are a part of or know someone in the LGBT community, have been affected by mental illness or have fallen prey to bullying.  Ryan's Rainbow Connection is a great non-profit for all of the reasons mentioned above.  At the very least, it will ensure that Ryan Joel Zicha's untimely passing was not in vain.  At best, it will save a life.
CATCH, Inc.	301061		/users/profile/391935	EddieTVF	General Member of the Public	5	08/19/2016	Very impressed with this operation! The individuals who run this organization are dedicated, inspired and compassionate. They have a good base of donors, but they could certainly use more. They help families who have lost their homes find new ones. This and many other services are among the many things they do.

Humane Society Of The Palouse	249704	1	/users/profile/253915	APK62	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2015	I have visited this animal shelter multiple times, and I am blown away every time by the amount of care and love the animals receive. If you are looking to extend your family with a dog or cat, please visit their facility and give one of their deserving animals a try. I highly recommend this organization!
Meadowinds Ministries Inc	48529	3	/users/profile/49609	rattana-chan-	Volunteer	5	07/21/2010	Throughout my life i have never met and witness people with an incredible heart and compassion like the founders and supporters of Meadowinds Ministries. The compassion and commitment to help improving access to primary education, school lunch project to reduce rate of malnutrition among poorer children, improving access to micro-finance and basic shelter for family disparately in need, improving access to clean water by the organisation has touched many lives; families and children living in poverty and people who are at disadvantage. Over the years, Meadwinds Ministries has provided consistent supports to many projects that have made positive impact to many lives.  The compassion i have seen shown by the founder and supporters of Meadowinds has inspired me in so many ways to serve the community and people in need. In short as a volunteer I feel extremely lucky to be involved with Meadowinds Ministries supporting their mission to make a difference to people and community in need.
