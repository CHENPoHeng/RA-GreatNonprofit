ONE Spirit	313218	1	/users/profile/404590	Jenny108	Donor	5	10/21/2016	I visited the Pine Ridge Reservation a couple of months ago. I fell in love with the people and their vast needs touched my heart. Since then I have found ways to help through One Spirit.I am so very excited on the progress of the buffalo meat processing facility. They did not wait until all of the funds were raised to begin construction! The exterior walls are up, the concrete is poured, I think the water lines are in. Now enough money has been raised for the electrical. The electrical materials arrived this week and the electrician is coming in!!! In order to be USDA certified, the interior walls will be expensive. Also, freezers/coolers and equipment is needed.It will take all of us spreading the word, donating and raising funds to have the facility completed by the spring when it is needed. I'll be helping financially and I hope everyone who reads this will help.With all of us together, the facility can be completed by spring.

ONE Spirit	292196	1	/users/profile/382691	christelleny	General Member of the Public	5	06/05/2016	One Spirit is a group of committed, generous, honest, kind individuals working to make a difference on a personal level in a place "conveniently" forgotten by all, and help develop intercultural friendships between the Lakota people and the rest of the world. Whether you choose to sponsor a child, send food to an elder, help bring buffalos back or participate in any of One Spirit's many programs, you know you're making a real difference in a real people's life  people you get to know and enjoy a friendship with. You know the money, clothes, food you send are going where they're needed. You know that only a tiny percentage of your donations is used to run the nonprofit. And more importantly, you know that you're part of something bigger; something that changes the world one person at a time.
ONE Spirit	292192		/users/profile/382687	Writer	Volunteer	5	06/05/2016	B"HONE Spirit is an exceptional nonprofit. Not only do they provide hands on aid to people on the Pine Ridge reservation, but they do it with sincerity and encouragement, bringing together sponsors, and those in need, in a good way. Friendships develop, help is actualised with respect and warmth in the giving. Truly it is commendable. Additionally, the continued addition of new programs uplift the people in an empowering manner, that things are set in place for the now and the future, covering various populations, i.e., veterans, the elderly, the children; family structures of every kind. In my experience sponsoring an elder, I have thus far been able to "meet" online her daughter and others of the extended family, seeing photos, "hearing" from the everyday sort of living to also points of art, activism and beliefs. It has been enlightening to find our connexions even with lives so far apart yet with commonalities too. One fundamental belief I have as a Torah observant Jew, is the understanding of "tikkun olam" or repairing the world. Should there be anyone in need, it it is part of our path to help, in what manner we can, to uplift that person in their way, making the world a better place. Connecting the Lakota with others, assisting with the dire circumstances of their lives having and continuing several centuries of extreme trauma, a small bit of healing can take place, one by one.
ONE Spirit	292104	1	/users/profile/382589	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2016	I moved to South Dakota during the 90's with people I became friends with who are Lakota Sioux and were returning to their home state.  Not only that I learned the culture of the people, I experienced first hand the reservation life and to know that much work is needed whether it's financial, educational, spiritual to improve the quality of life.After returning to the east coast in 2000, I continued my support through social media and financial contributions when possible.  Online, I discovered ONE Spirit and other groups in order to keep up with current events in South Dakota.  Although I have no direct experience with ONE Spirit, I do promote their work through social media and like the domino effect, it does spread on the world wide web.I certainly can simply say ONE Spirit continues to make every effort to improve and change lives.
ONE Spirit	291588	1	/users/profile/345954	Reva M.	Donor	5	05/31/2016	The character and integrity that this organization exemplifies is only two of the many attributes it has.  They work diligently to ensure nothing corrupts their purpose.  They are dedicated to the strengthening of their food sovereignty and continuance of a culture that will benefit all of humanity.  There are so few charities by which you can see daily how the recipients are benefiting from it.  The vast majority of the funds go directly to the programs that are key to their basic survival.  It is really a no-brainer to give to this stellar organization.
ONE Spirit	257517	1	/users/profile/345954	Reva M.	Donor	5	09/15/2015	Team One Spirit has the goal of taking care of the positive experiences and health of their people.   They do this with no glorified expectation of government handouts or the use of corporate wage earners to manage their program.  They are truly Of The People, By The People, and For The People, with no need for thanks and with a lot of volunteer efforts, because taking care of their own is what they do.  I like supporting this group because I know it gets at the very root and basic needs of their people, and because I know what it's like to go hungry and go for long periods of time without proper nutrition and basic clothing.
ONE Spirit	291409	1	/users/profile/346123	Grim R.	Donor	5	05/30/2016	Very good, donations go directly to who needs them, they are quick to respond to any messages, good hearted people.
ONE Spirit	257668	3	/users/profile/346123	Grim R.	Donor	5	09/16/2015	There are just a handful of organizations that I regularly try to donate to.  I support and respect One Spirit because it is driven by local communities coming together to help those in need among them.  What could be more important than helping Elders make it through the winter, feeding children, getting school supplies to students, and providing a positive environment for teens.  I know that whatever I send will go directly to those who need it, maybe passing between one or two hands before it gets there. No big outside organization sweeps in with poverty commercials. They keep people informed of their progress, highlighting all the positive things that are being done.  While I usually donate or volunteer for local groups in my own state of Texas, I think the nation as a whole needs to step up and take responsibility for the conditions of our Reservations. Despite all the promises, the only way real change seems to take place is when people like One Spirit stand up and make it happen in their own communities. Much respect to those who do.
ONE Spirit	291327	1	/users/profile/381733	Trina8	Client Served	5	05/29/2016	I love them. They genuinely care and are super great people. 
ONE Spirit	291237	2	/users/profile/381627	Lisa547	Volunteer	5	05/27/2016	If you're hoping to help Lakota families,  One Spirit is the only non profit endorsed by the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council. It's unprecedented and speaks to how highly regarded an organization they are. 90% of every donation goes DIRECTLY to the oyate...not to salaries or overhead. 
ONE Spirit	291224	4	/users/profile/381610	Shirley36	Donor	5	05/27/2016	I have been a sponsor with ONE Spirit for over 4 years. I sponsor an elder and the grandkids she is raising. I speak to her directly often, and find out what she and the kids need. With other charities, you send in your money but never get to find out who or how it's helping. This direct approach shows me how I'm making a positive difference in a needy family's lives. I feel blessed to be able to help this family.  I highly recommend ONE Spirit! Mrs. Peterson
ONE Spirit	291122	3	/users/profile/381490	Joyfl	Donor	5	05/26/2016	I Love ONE Spirit because I have the option to get as close as I want to be or as distant Without the Pressure of Phone Calls and Mailins every 2 Weeks!!!  They have List where I can actually see a Family and their needs, and recently chose an elder on dialysis that needed clothes & an elec fry pan. I felt Connected. I'm sending her a Fresh Food Box every Month to help with her diet and Empty Pantry. I have randomly sent $ for Bring Back The Buffalo, wood Project and Elder Christmas Party. I could have stopped at. $5 donation but I believe in tithing 10% of my Income and some months I can really help. ONE Spirit is NEVER Pushy like other Organizations and that's why I can give with my 
ONE Spirit	291109	2	/users/profile/381467	Elly2	General Member of the Public	5	05/26/2016	ONE Spirit helps anyone in the Lakota Nation who is brave enough to step forward and ask for help.  When veterans of our Armed Forces came to them hungry with no food to feed themselves or their families, they found the resources to add them to their food deliveries.  They help those in need find sponsors to help with food, clothing, hygiene, whatever is needed.  These people rarely ask for sponsors for themselves, but usually for the children or grandchildren they are raising.  The people of our country tend to either forget or pretend our Native American nations exist and were 'given' the worse land in the country to eek out an existence.  Thanks to ONE Spirit, the Lakota have a voice and volunteers to help bring a bit of hope to those most desperately in need.
ONE Spirit	290273	1	/users/profile/380573	DaGriz B.	Donor	5	05/18/2016	One Spirit is a unique and well run organization dedicated to assisting  Native Americans in South Dakota that struggle to meet minimum necessities.  Everyone who works with One Spirit is a volunteer and they are dedicated to doing everything they can to assist people.  They are  the best charity organization for Native Americans in South Dakota.  My initial contact with them was participating, as a donor, in their Okini program, which wound up being absolutely great  due to the volunteers and satisfaction knowing what I did was 100%for the individual family.  Since that time I have become a volunteer for One Spirit and cannot say enough good about the organization and people.  I strongly recommend One Spirit to all people looking to assist those in need
ONE Spirit	275614	4	/users/profile/365255	Writer	Advisor	5	01/04/2016	how are you doing:Ive been coming to South Dakota for about 7 years and Ive seen a lot of what goes on in pine ridge.... it hurts my eyes, and sometimes I say how can i help..... but I don't have all the answers.but I feel like every little bit help..... when I talk to the people in in pine ridge.... I could hear the hurt in a certain fashion..........I'm opening up a clothing store in rapid city this year.. actually this month towards the end going into February......I also own a film company and have a clothing line as well....... thank you for your time
ONE Spirit	274308	1	/users/profile/363691	Kayla K.	Volunteer	5	12/12/2015	One Spirit is the only non-profit group to have been recognized and accepted by the Sioux Nations as a partner. Seeing the real work and how impacts directly to the people in need is nothing short of a miracle idea. Much gratitude to Jeri Baker to listening to Spirit and making this all possible. Truly One Spirit is an inspiration to us all right here in our homeland to help the most deserving.
ONE Spirit	259872	1	/users/profile/348399	Maria137	Donor	5	09/26/2015	there are far and few organizations which use your donation dollars to the fullest. This is one of them...be it cash, food, building supplies, what ever you can donate is being put to good use and makes an actual impact on real people. It's people helping people, as it should be. They have many, many local volunteers,  so you can rest assured that your money will go to the actual cause. I can't afford to give much, but when I can and when I do, One Spirit is it. There are many ongoing projects that could use more support. I had the pleasure of meeting and talking to couple of folks in person. If you're going to give, then do it to those who won't squander your gift. Check them out, please, you won't be disappointed. Make your generosity count and donate to One Spirit!
ONE Spirit	257672	2	/users/profile/346127	Jim_144	Donor	5	09/16/2015	This non-profit came highly recommended by another non-profit, who ceased operations. I've donated to the "End Hunger" campaign for several years now.   
ONE Spirit	257571	2	/users/profile/346010	anivdelarev	Donor	5	09/15/2015	I participated in the One Spirit Okini list. They quickly answered my many questions and concerns. I helped a family with school supplies and some clothing. I later got a Thank You note from the family. I was really happy and will definitely help as much as I can. 
ONE Spirit	257505	2	/users/profile/345940	Istagi	Volunteer	5	09/15/2015	I get asked by many people how to help the residents of Pine Ridge South Dakota.  There are many groups that send help to the area but only One Spirit has been recognized and authorized to work on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation. One Spirit uses many sources to gather funds and 90 percent  of gathered donations go to many excellent assistance programs.  The largest being food distribution for any residents, help for heat during the brutal winter months, They built a new youth recreational center in Allen, Running camps and cultural camps during the summer months.  They also sponsor families that need items. I have worked with One Spirit a few times, documenting activities, and also assisting with food distribution.  One Spirit is the only organization that I trust to provide services to anyone who has a need or request.
ONE Spirit	257497	1	/users/profile/345931	Tricia30	Donor	5	09/15/2015	One Spirit provides services and goods for people on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. They rely on volunteers, which enables them to utilize 90 % of proceeds for programs. They have recently been accepted by Guidestar. Their programs range from providing heating supplies to families / individuals during HARSH South Dakota winters,  to their recently completed Allen Community Center which provides much needed programs for youth and families. I wish they would get more visibility as a model nonprofit, one that provides much with relatively little resources. If you have not heard of them, that is because they don't have the marketing budget they need + deserve. Take a minute to research them + spread the word ...... in the way SO MANY nonprofits grew.
ONE Spirit	256817		/users/profile/345216	Just_Lisa	Volunteer	5	09/12/2015	One of the things I look at when I decide to make a donation to any charity is the percent of money that actually goes to the intended recipients. Because One Spirit is an all-volunteer group, they are able to give 90% of all donations directly to the Lakota people through their programs. The other 10% is administrative costs such as a CPA for book keeping, paying Lakota helpers, etc. That's pretty amazing for any non-profit! So, I feel good knowing my donations are making a difference and making a difference is really what it's all about.
ONE Spirit	256186		/users/profile/344583	Lunaplanting	Donor	5	09/10/2015	What I love about One Spirit is that I get to send things directly to the family that needs them. No middle  man, no cut for them, no run around. I feel like what little I can give DOES make a difference because it directly touches other people's lives. I will continue to support all their causes until the  Lakota people are once again self sufficient.
ONE Spirit	251798	2	/users/profile/339792	bbwfromphilly2	General Member of the Public	5	08/05/2015	I'm an admin for a Native American facebook group and learned of One Spirit through the searches I was doing for material to post on the group site.  The more I saw of the wonderful programs offered through this non-profit the more I understood the need of the people of Pine Ridge Reservation.  In my opinion, there is no other non-profit that equals this agency.  I believe them to be totally trustworthy and recommend them to as many as I can to try to help get the word out.  I am not affiliated with the agency in any way, nor do I profit in any way from highlighting their efforts.
ONE Spirit	210267	1	/users/profile/273031	byugirl22	Donor	5	08/12/2014	One Spirit was brought to my attention through a blog I read, written by a young Lakota man. He recommended One Spirit as an upstanding organization that actually does what it says and impacts the lives of the people on the reservation. As I researched One Spirit myself and visited their website I was impressed with all of the various ways they provide to make donations - direct sponsorship, monthly or one-time donations through paypal, and the okini list. I was also impressed with the fact that money and contributions go directly to the people who need it and not into an administrator's wallet. I have donated several times through pay pal and the raffles/contests that pop up and will continue to support them any way I can. It's a cause and an organization I feel good about supporting.
ONE Spirit	210204	1	/users/profile/272957	Lori112	Volunteer	5	08/11/2014	South Dakota reservations have the highest poverty level in the United States. It's shameful and unnecessary. I believe all people have the right to human dignity that includes a roof over your head and food on your table. One Spirit helps give dignity to the most impoverished yet honorable and proud deserving people.
ONE Spirit	210187	1	/users/profile/186929	digitsgirl	General Member of the Public	5	08/11/2014	I have supported this group over the years because I know all of the contributions go to help the people.  The volunteers are very dedicated people.
ONE Spirit	140722	2	/users/profile/186929	digitsgirl	Donor	5	11/16/2012	I started supporting this group several years ago by sponsoring a family.  The amazing thing was they didn't want money, they just wanted me to supply basics to three young boys.  I now support the group with donations for food and/or wood for heat.  They give you a list of exactly what will be delivered to these needy families.  They are well organized and have only the welfare of the Lakota people in their hearts.  This is the one group I would not hesitate to help or recommend.
ONE Spirit	210178	1	/users/profile/272930	Zipper	Donor	5	08/11/2014	I haven't donated much, but what I have donated was acknowledged and thanks were sent promptly by e-mail.  I feel appreciated and I know my contributions make a positive difference. I'm so glad this organization exists because I know there is a big need for their services.  
ONE Spirit	210170	1	/users/profile/272920	Inlakesh B.	General Member of the Public	5	08/11/2014	We love sponsoring children through One Spirit! It has been very rewarding and a positive experience for the whole family. We feel like we are making a difference in one families life. 
ONE Spirit	210167	1	/users/profile/272918	sheriangell	Donor	5	08/11/2014	I have been a donor to One Spirit as well as contributing through their Okini program.  I know that my contributions make a difference in part because of their transparency in their emails, postings on social networks and such.  If there was every a non-profit making a difference, One Spirit is it!
ONE Spirit	210039	1	/users/profile/272778	sungmanituthanka	Volunteer	5	08/11/2014	I've talked to Jena Baker several times, always a pleasant conversation and to the point. What great honesty and pride I hear in her voice when she speaks of One Spirit mission to help her people. I help out personally a couple times a year with donations. But all throughout the year I help by posting their site information and start food drives and such. This is a very good organization with nothing but 100% commitment to help the people of Pine Ridge.
ONE Spirit	205732	1	/users/profile/267971	Rianne d.	Donor	5	07/11/2014	This group helps people so much and i'm happy to be a small part in it! 
ONE Spirit	205674	1	/users/profile/267907	jena_fuller	Donor	5	07/11/2014	I was in a sad place when I first learned of One Spirit. My parents had died and cleaning out their house, I had a great deal of extra sewing supplies. Then I read that One Spirit needed sewing supply donations for the Grandmothers on the reservation to make quilts.  It seemed like fate! I had studied the legendary Lakota because my degrees are in Anthropology and always loved our Native cultures, but One Spirit has shown me the living people. Since then I have donated several times to the Food program and I am always wondering how else I can help. One Spirit keeps us up to date with the activities of the Lakota and I love seeing the beauty and charm of the children, the activism of the women and the power of the Marathon Runners. The USA has sacrificed our First People in the name of progress but I see the Lakota taking charge of their own power and working hard to make things right for themselves. I  support One Spirit because through this organization, the Lakota give as much to me as I can to them, maybe more, because always they inspire me to strive to be a better person.   They're great Americans and we should all support them!   Thank you for this opportunity to review their excellent efforts. 
ONE Spirit	204393		/users/profile/266406	Lynda13	Donor	5	06/27/2014	My family works closely with jeri baker and Bamm brewer on the wood program to heat homes smd the crazy horse ride.  
ONE Spirit	204206	1	/users/profile/266230	Lisa358	Donor	5	06/27/2014	ONE Spirit is the most uplifting organization I've encountered.  The work they do is such a blessing to those they do it for and directly benefits those in need not just physically, but spiritually/emotionally/mentally.  ONE Spirit took the time to establish a relationship with our family and continues to take the time to maintain it.   ONE Spirit will always hold a special place in our hearts, as will the wonderful People they care for in so very many ways.   
ONE Spirit	204201	1	/users/profile/266225	Shannon69	Donor	5	06/27/2014	I am new to One Spirit but all the people have been wonderful.  I sponsor and I make monetary donations when able.  I have told many friends about the organization and many have begun to work with them as well.
ONE Spirit	197750	1	/users/profile/215024	Ed Chandler	Donor	5	04/15/2014	I'm a retired Mohawk Metis elder, that attends Powwows in the Northeast as a vendor to raise money for One Spirit. 100% of the money that I generate goes to One Spirit, to purchase food, for the families, at Pine Ridge Reservation, in South Dakota. This organization is very transparent about where the money is spent and is dedicated to making the Lakota self sufficient. 
ONE Spirit	170645	2	/users/profile/215024	Ed Chandler	Donor	5	09/19/2013	I've volunteered for One Spirit, for over 5 years. I'm a vendor at Native American Powwows, and donate the gross earnings from each powwow that I vend at, in southeastern New England. Not one person at One Spirit earns a salary. Each and everyone of us volunteer, because we believe in the organization.  We can see first hand the victories that we achieve, against the poverty on Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, in South Dakota. I too am Indian (Mohawk) and it feels mighty good to help my brothers and sisters of the Lakota Tribe.
ONE Spirit	162060	1	/users/profile/215024	Ed Chandler	Donor	5	07/04/2013	I do Native American Powwow's in Southeastern New England. As a vendor, 100% of the money I raise from my booth,  goes to One Spirit to assist them in meeting their goals, of feeding families, and supplying wood for the winter.  Do I need to do this? Heck no, but I need to do this. I'm a Haudenosaunee  (Mohawk) Metis Elder and I'm retired. While I'm not rich, I have all the essential things that I need in life.  One Spirit supplies me with some merchandise. People donate items for me to resell, and I supply many items to resell, and the proceeds go to One Spirit. This is my fifth year and I'm really gratefull that I still have my health to do this. I also get great enjoyment out of turning people on to One Spirit and the Oglala Lakota Sioux.   I couldn't think of a better cause to dedicate myself to.  One Spirit is the reason that I get out of bed in the morning.  It's certainly better than wasting away in a bar room!
ONE Spirit	197176	1	/users/profile/109612	Roger N.	Volunteer	5	04/06/2014	I have been donating to One Spirit for five years.  I have chose One Spirit as one of my primary donations, a monthly bank withdrawal contribution due to the value of the work and the reliability of the commitment. thank you, One Spirit.
ONE Spirit	94709	5	/users/profile/109612	Roger N.	Donor	5	07/30/2011	I learned about One Spirit froma group that does evaluations of non-profits serving Native Americans in South Dakota.  They give One Spirit a stamp of approval for the same reasons I support it: they are local,so they know who it is they are helping. They provide assistance in the form of food deliveries, wood for fuel, and sponsorship coordination for the most vulnerable individuals and families on the Pine Ridge rez,elders, diabetics, children.  They work with a lot of volunteers and their overhead is very low.  They provide some employment for Natives on Pine Ridge to cut and deliver wood, load and unload food. They work closely with others on the rez who are helping in other ways, a safe house and a youth program.  
ONE Spirit	162624		/users/profile/215833	Michele43	Volunteer	5	07/14/2013	This is the group that keeps the broken promises for the people of Pine Ridge. They make human connections between volunteers/donors and families in need. They live their beliefs every day in every way. Nutrition, heat, basic supplies, and caring are delivered from one to another.
ONE Spirit	162557		/users/profile/215779	Janice24	Volunteer	5	07/13/2013	They are on the front lines doing the hard work.  They are making changes that are sustainable and improving the quality of life (mentally, physically, geographically) for the people they help.  They truly reach across borders with compassion and kindness, and inspire me to be a better person.   
ONE Spirit	162481		/users/profile/215678	Patsie J.	Donor	5	07/12/2013	I have the absolutely highest regard for Jeri Baker and the One Spirit group.  They are making a huge difference in life on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.  They are currently providing fresh food to over 3000 needy people! Jeri Baker has provided the support for this fine organization, they survive on donations, donations of all sorts, food, shelter, furniture, clothes, wood for warmth and support of the culture just to name a few. 
ONE Spirit	162475	1	/users/profile/215670	Cesare F.	Donor	4	07/12/2013	As a proud Sponsor of the One Spirit program, I am pleased dot help out such a worthwhile organization.
ONE Spirit	162463	1	/users/profile/215638	dmcworks	Donor	5	07/11/2013	I have sponsored a few children through One Spirit.  I know where every dime I spend is sent because I send it directly to my sponsored child.  I know that she gets clothing, food, diapers, wipes, and toys because I pick them out for her.  The staff at One Spirit are so professional, understanding, and lovely.  I have never encountered a charity that allows you to personally do so much for the person or people you want to help.   I have had such a wonderful time helping out my sponsored kids and their families.  My children and I all pulled together to get them really nice things, even though they never ask for much.  Often times they only need clothing, some diapers, shampoo, a box of food, or hair ties.  I have never seen such humble requests before from a charity.  If you want to make a huge impact and know you are doing something for someone else, if you want to know your money is being used the way you would like it used for your sponsored child, One Spirit is the only child sponsorship program I would ever recommend.  
ONE Spirit	162462	3	/users/profile/215635	Susan217	Donor	5	07/11/2013	I have been a One Spirit sponsor for over 2 years now.  My partner and I sponsor a family which is headed by a woman who has taken in several grandchildren and foster grandchildren. There are between 12 to 13 people living together in a small house outside of Pine Ridge Reservation. I forgot - as of April there are 13 - 14 since a new granddaughter was added to the family. My partner and I participate in the food program each month and pay for fresh food to be delivered to our family through One Spirit. It feels wonderful to be able to make this small contribution. I only wish I were wealthy and could provide so much more. still it is such a great feeling to work through ONE SPIRIT and to give to people who have so little.  Through this group I actually KNOW where my donation is going. I talk with my family and have received notes and pictures and perhaps one day will be able to visit. My money is NOT put into a big pot of donations, it actually is used for MY family.
ONE Spirit	162419	2	/users/profile/215580	tracink	Donor	5	07/11/2013	Food, heat, school supplies...it's just the basics to most folks. Working with One Spirit makes me rethink my own priorities because those basics that so many take for granted are a blessing for some during hard times. For several years, I have sponsored a boy just younger than my own son; now, I also send food to a grandmother who is taking care of a household of youngsters. Right here, right now, in our own country, there is opportunity to help. One Spirit is a path to help me do that. This organization provides good, decent food to those who need it most. They feed children who haven't eaten for days. They feed families that have special dietary needs, such as diabetes. And the food isn't commodity junk. Today's list of food for the month of July that we send out include 9 different kinds of fruits and veg, along with fresh proteins.  Overhead is low to non-existent in this organization. There are no CEOs taking huge salaries to do admin work here. Much of the organizing come via long-distance. The on-the-ground delivery of food and wood is done by community members for community members. It is an organization that is based on integrity, honesty, hard work, and dedication to the ideas of strong community and honor. 
ONE Spirit	162405	1	/users/profile/215564	Mary1978	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	I became a sponsor about a year ago with One Spirit. And, I can tell you that the day I made contact with my sponsor family was a pivotal moment in my life. Everything about their nature, position, and ways displayed courage, beauty, and a presence that offers lesson. There is a stillness within their words that can teach us all regardless of race, gender, or status about the power of worth, belonging, and existence. It is the understanding of the past, the knowledge of the present, and the wisdom of the future that instructs us all to respect our surroundings, give to our brothers, and love unconditionally. One spirit offers the perfect environment to do exactly this. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this organization and the people who work for it. This organization not only provides support and care for the great Lakota people, but it offers the opportunity for people of all nations to give and learn while giving. Sponsorship for me has been one of the biggest blessings in my life. It has granted me a friendship with two beautiful girls and their family and has allowed me to grow as a person through the act of sharing, giving, and caring. I am now about to begin my 3rd sponsorship, an elder, whom I am eager to get to know and learn from. I may not drive the fanciest car or own a million dollar home, but what makes me human is my heart, my spirit, and my love for others. And, this is what I share with my sponsorees and in turn they share with me.  I believe our greatest acts as humans are in the moments we share our humanity with others. Thank you One Spirit for allowing me to share that with the beautiful Lakota people!  ~ Mary K. - Jacksonville, FL ~
ONE Spirit	162402	1	/users/profile/215558	gunneruda	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	I think One Spirit is an organization who can help people to get together and build a better future. I hope people can learn and understand with the people and work together as a teambuilder.  I hope it continues and that they are working for new ideas to help the people to see new oporturneties and always look for new ways to create jobs, youth camps, elders care and to build a good community. 
ONE Spirit	162322		/users/profile/215409	Graham Mc	Donor	5	07/09/2013	After some investigation I began donating to One Spirit in January 2013. They have lived up to all expectations and beyond. An excellent organization full of caring people that gets practical help to those in need swiftly and efficiently. I thank them for making it possible for me to confidently donate funds to a cause very near to my heart.  Graham M
ONE Spirit	162181		/users/profile/215238	Monarchs	Volunteer	5	07/07/2013	After a lot of research, and a big push in this direction, I'm happy to say I'm proud to be sponsoring folks through One Spirit. It does my heart good on many levels knowing I can be of service to people that truly need help and I know where my money is going.  I am not rich by any means, but have plenty for myself and know that helping when I can is the right thing to do.  Growing up, my family never did without food, but have done my share of living paycheck to paycheck.  It feels great to know someone can reach in their pantry with maybe a little more or something than they had before, because of me.  It seems small but my heart is filled with much thinking about what I can do.  I hope someday to meet some of these great folks....One Spirit in my opinion is doing an outstanding job putting it all together. Thanks -Debra
ONE Spirit	162132	1	/users/profile/215166	JeanneH	Donor	5	07/06/2013	I wanted to provide help with an organization that I could trust. After research, I concluded this was the one for me. After dealing with them for over a year, I found the volunteers to be wonderful and I truly feel my donations are helping people in need.
ONE Spirit	162123	2	/users/profile/215153	Conni E.	Donor	5	07/06/2013	I have been donating to One Spirit for years as they are a remarkable organization who do everything possible such as bringing food, wood and all sorts of help to the people who so desperately need it.  The people of this organization are always accessible and will answer any and all questions you  have regarding any subject.  The people who are being helped are so grateful and appreciative and it is just an overall amazing experience to know that you can actually change someone's life by giving them just a little help.  This organization helps a wide variety of people from young children to the very old.  All are treated with respect and kindness.  There are no words to tell you how much this organization has meant to me.
ONE Spirit	162098		/users/profile/186621	Lisa187	Volunteer	5	07/05/2013	ONE Spirit is the only service organization on the Pine Ridge Reservation, recognized and endorsed by the Oglala Lakota Tribal Council!!! If that doesn't say it all, then know that they feed the hungry, provide heat and home repair for elders, and support many youth programs for Lakota children. Service to the Lakota people is what they do and they do it well!
ONE Spirit	140442		/users/profile/186621	Lisa187	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	There are many truly great things about One Spirit and the diversity of programs for the Lakota people on the Pine Ridge Reservation. One of my favorite programs is the "Sponsorship" program for children, elders and families and the way it is implemented . The donors are in direct contact with the sponsored family, so instead of sending money to some place? and hope it goes where it's intended, the sponsors send the items that are needed directly to the family- clothes, food, school supplies...you name it! It is absolutely the best method I've seen of getting the needed goods to the people in need. One Spirit is an all volunteer organization so there are no big salaries being paid out of the donations made- it's really the most efficient organization for direct help that I've ever seen. There are numerous ways/programs that One Spirit has set up to help this "third world" economy in our heartland, so it's very easy to find a good "fit" for every donor: Okini program for families in immediate crisis, Sponsorships for elders, children and families, Manderson Safe House for children 18 and under, Crazy Horse Ride sponsorships, New Warrior Youth Camps sponsorships, the Allen Youth Center, Wood program for home heat, Food program that feeds about 1,500 monthly, and the Home Repair program to name a few. One Spirit also sponsored 5 runners from Pine Ridge to compete in the NYC marathon and the runners raised donations for the upcoming Allen Youth Center. Though the marathon was cancelled, the runners all stayed in New York to selflessly help with the hurricane clean up, and will get another chance to compete in the marathon next year! One Spirit has made enormous strides in raising the awareness of the desperate living conditions on Pine Ridge and I think that has been instrumental in raising funds for the many programs offered. I think most of us feel morally obligated to help  when we become aware of the circumstances and are able to- One Spirit is the best option for directly helping the Lakota people on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
ONE Spirit	162083		/users/profile/215105	grayhawk	Volunteer	5	07/05/2013	A few years ago I wanted to help Native Americans. After doing some research on the internet, I found One Spirit to have the best reputation as a trust-worthy organization for doing that. I became a donor and later a volunteer for them. I still hold this organization in highest regards. The organization is comprised of very caring people with an interest in serving.
ONE Spirit	162074		/users/profile/215092	wings4heart	Donor	5	07/05/2013	I was not gifted with the good fortune of growing up with a family. I worked very hard in my life to make my own. I am now retired and joined One Spirit seeking people that I could give to as I no longer have any people of my own to give to. I do not know my DNA but I know that the Standing Nation and the Rock Spirits saved my life as a child, giving me solace in the space of the real things on this earth walk. I was a Social Worker before retirement and did not want any thing to do with bureaucratic agencies, grant seeking, or not knowing where my money was actually going. Ed Chandler shared his experience of One Spirit with me at a Northeastern Powwow and gave me contact information and I reached a wonderful man from One Spirit who believed me when I said "I have no money to give but I do have the joy of giving ".  To me that is much more valuable. So I collected  money from 2008 until I was housebound in 2011 and sent packages to "my" One Spirit family. I am out and about again and my "family" still wants me and I am honored to be part of the One Spirit family. It is a great honor and I am grateful.

ONE Spirit	162063	4	/users/profile/186927	kimij12	Volunteer	5	07/04/2013	I have been with One Spirit since 2006, I started out sponsoring an elder and moved up to helping get the art supplies needed in the schools for the youth that have amazing art skills, once that was taken care of I moved into moderator of the yahoo group and helped new folks with questions and such, I am now an ASC for Oglala (area service coordinator) , and love everything about my job, I get to meet amazing people who think the world of One Spirit, and are telling me these things all the time, Jeri Baker is a go getter and has much love for the Lakota people, I have looked at other Non profits but by far One Spirit does so much more, than the others, we do the crazy horse ride, youth safe houses, food, wood, sponsorship program, okini, we help with a couple of the camps, by getting supplies, the Lakota 5 runners we sponsor them, and who know what else goes on behind the scenes for folks that call Jeri directly, she is always ready to help in anyway she can.  this by far has been the best decision I made with a non profit, our people are caring, loving people of the Lakota.  and it shows, we are there for them but don't overwhelm them, they make the decisions and we are there to support what they wish to do.   Getting to know the Lakota people has been the most wonderful experience of my life, and talk to and listen to the stories that so many elders are willing to share, once you get to know them.  and learn about the cultural ways, and heritage, its amazing, the stories that you can learn.  I am very proud to be apart of One Spirit.,  and will never leave this Org,  
ONE Spirit	140720	2	/users/profile/186927	kimij12	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	I have been with One Spirit since 2006 when I sponsored my first elder, I search and looked at several different non profits but found One Spirit to be one that the Lakota seem to get every thing that is offered, when they say they are doing something they do it, they are responsable for the youth rides, wood programs, food, a list that helps when those that don't have asponsor can still get help, and  they are helping to bring back the old ways that so many of the people want, this a vital issue for the lakota people, to be able to keep it alive, the lakota are such a loving people, and one spirit helps them help themselves.  just as they like.   I love being able to talk to my elder and knowing that what ever I send goes to her, and not someone else to give it to them like so many non profits I have checked into before One Spirit, getting to know the Lakota has been the best thing I have ever done, even my grandsons enjoy learning about the Lakota people and trying to speak their language, being part of One Spirit and the help that they give you to get started with your sponsoree is awesome.  I couldn't be happier with them and my experience I have had with them since I joined up with them.,  oh and I am sponsoring a second elder now too. Love it.  One Spirit and the folks that volunteer to help are top notch and care about all the folks the help they strive to help all they can,  they are donation only and all money raised goes to pay for food, wood, and the youth centers they are trying to raise the money to build.,
ONE Spirit	161984	1	/users/profile/214876	Clark P.	Donor	5	07/03/2013	I trust One Spirit to carry out their mission to feed the hungry, and help with heating supplies.
ONE Spirit	151556	1	/users/profile/202352	Acorn H.	Donor	5	03/24/2013	We send money to them.  That should say it all.  I know many people who are on or are from Pine Ridge and I know for a fact that not only is One Spirit helping but they are highly thought of by the local people.  If they get my money it means I trust them to do what is right.
ONE Spirit	145873	3	/users/profile/192468	Rex H.	Volunteer	5	12/04/2012	The 5000 mi. area South Dakota that contains the Pine Ridge Reservation and a Lakota population of about 40,000 represents a largely forgotten and unseen shame in our country in this, the 21st century. The poverty and substandard living conditions on this reservation are unbelievable except to those who have been there and seen it for themselves. ONE Spirit is a nonprofit charitable organization offering humanitarian and compassionate help for the Lakota people by supporting Lakota initiatives rather than a we have the solution approach. There is a SHARE food program to fight chronic malnutrition, sponsorships for children and elders, firewood for heat in the winter, and a program to address the particular urgent needs of individuals and families. ONE Spirit especially focuses on helping the Lakota youth. Last year they built and furnished a safe house for young Lakota children in need. This year they are working toward building a youth center for the Lakota youth. 100% of all revenues in donations are used in direct programs, with no paid administrators. I know of no other organization that so effectively helps the Lakota people and that is so well accepted by the Lakota people. Truly, ONE Spirit is an organization that deserves much support.
ONE Spirit	145577	3	/users/profile/192076	dipper	Volunteer	5	12/01/2012	I visited the PIne Ridge reservation many years ago on a road trip through the West.  I was instantly struck by both the warmth of the people and the obvious signs of extreme poverty, such as stores with half empty shelves. ONE Spirit is filling a unique and crucial role- helping to raise awareness of conditions on the reservation while simultaneously supporting the people in their mission of empowerment. We all need this organization.
ONE Spirit	143721	2	/users/profile/190198	ChristaD	Donor	5	11/28/2012	My family and I wanted to sponsor a child for a long time.  After doing some research, I found One Spirit and I was instantly amazed at how well their organization is managed and how many people they help.  Helping families who live in the U.S was very important to my family and I.  We are so happy that we found One Spirit and that we are able to sponsor three children.  One Spirit is an amazing organization and I am truly proud to be a part of their efforts to help those in need!!
ONE Spirit	142497	1	/users/profile/188972	Rayma S.	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I've been a sponsor to 2 families & an elder for ONE Spirit since October. Since then I have been able to provide food to those I sponsor through their food program. In addition, I've been able to speak directly with the people I am sponsoring and find out what the needs of their family are to ensure that what I send to them is what they need. The boxes sent are care packages filled with clothing, winter gear, blankets, personal hygiene products, household supplies like laundry detergent and other basic necessities. Sending these things helps to stretch what money they do make and helps to lift the financial burden many of these families face. The direct connection with my families and elder aren't just business though. We are forming friendships and I look forward to talking to them. What ONE spirit provides is an essential service for the Lakota people. They are dependable, prompt & friendly. Their dedication and service to the Lakota people on Pine Ridge is helping to promote self sufficiency through work opportunities for the people on the reservation, cultivating intercultural relationship through the bridges they build with people outside of Pine Ridge and preserving the culture, language and spirit of a people who are rich in ways that far surpass monetary means. It has been a true honor and privilege to be a part of a volunteer community that is doing amazing work and allowing me to learn more about the Lakota people who I greatly admire. If you want to get involved with an organization where you control when, where and how much of what you donates goes, ONE Spirit is for you! You can be a part of this ONE Spirit family and help make a difference in the lives of the people on Pine Ridge. 
ONE Spirit	142345	1	/users/profile/188808	vasfrye	General Member of the Public	5	11/24/2012	I learned about One Spirit through the Lutheran Women's Organization in Virginia.  One Spirit helps to provide the essentials of life to the Lakota People.  The Lakota people live in poor conditions in one of the coldest area of the country.  One Spirit is working to provide hope for a better life for the young people of the reservation.  I admire greatly those young people who trained to run in the New York Marathon only to have their high hopes for success thwarted by Sandy, the hurricane that devastated parts of New York and New Jersey.   They stayed and helped those who hadsuffered damage in the storm.   Donations I made to One Spirit go to help those in need.
ONE Spirit	141872	2	/users/profile/188274	ingrid.isaksen	Donor	5	11/21/2012	I've been supporting OneSpirit for 1,5 year, making a monthly donation to their Food program and Wood Program.  Since many on the rez heat their homes with wood, working on the wood program means that the men there have a job opportunity.   For the Food Program, OneSpirit buys fresh food pruduced in SD.  OneSpirit is a charity close to my heart, will continue to support as long as I can.
ONE Spirit	141854	5	/users/profile/188254	KatherineVt	Donor	5	11/21/2012	Thanks to the One Spirit volunteers I can directly help native American families who are desperate for living essentials and whose needs are not met by federal safety nets. I can send specific items right to the persons who need them - they get 100% of what I send, and the door is open to share a personal friendship as well. There are a number of different ways to make a very significant difference without loss to administrative siphons. This organization fosters community building, cultural enrichment and employment within the Lakota circle and meaningful relationships with the outside world. One Spirit is a fantastic way to directly help and give back to the great nation of people who are the original Americans, and to who have sacrificed so much for our sake. I am honored and grateful to be a part of this program.
ONE Spirit	141466	1	/users/profile/187793	baliers	Donor	5	11/20/2012	I came across this non-profit charity just a couple of months ago while browsing the internet. Being very interested in history and the First Nations, it was a natural thing for me to click on ONE Spirit's website. It is amazing how many projects ONE Spirit stands for; and all of them help the Lakota People in different ways. I had begun as a donor of food and clothes requested for by the OKINI program, with OKINI standing for sharing amongst people. All donations sent arrived at the requestor - also monetary donations made via the ONE Spirit website arrive in full, and not a dime is taken off the amount for admin or other costs. I can only recommend this non-profit charity to the max, their program really deserves cudos.  By now my family and I are sponsors of two elders of the Oglala Sioux, we keep in touch regularly, and they also are very satisfied on how ONE Spirit helps the tribe help themselves with introducing several youth programs such as the Crazy Horse Youth Ride and the Youth Center, or partaking in the New York City marathon which was canceled after Sandy - however, the Lakota runners did not just return home but helped moving the debris - now they are true warriors.  ONE Spirit simply rocks!!!
ONE Spirit	141307	2	/users/profile/187234	Linda160	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I came across One Spirit while browsing the internet - I was looking at organisations which offered to Sponsor a Child but was finding it difficult to find one where I would have been able to help someone directly.  When I found One Spirit and emailed to find out more my details were passed to a coordinator (Mavis) who asked me a few questions and after a few weeks and a few more emails I was  put in touch with an elder directly. I wrote a letter to the elder and family and explained who I was and what I hoped to do and for how long I thought I might be able to do it. That was around 18 months ago. I send a small package each month.  I know that every penny I spend goes directly to the elder and I like to be able to help someone directly.
ONE Spirit	141241	2	/users/profile/187508	Bernice F.	Donor	5	11/19/2012	I have been involved with One Spirit for a short time, particularly in providing clothing and household goods for individuals in the Okini program, and in the funds to purchase wood program. I have worked for non-profits and I can tell you that these programs are the most administratively lean that I have ever witnessed. The focus is on the recipients and the very real and often desperate need for basic necessities that we take for granted -- heat, food, clothing. I can think of no better place to invest your time, your heart and your energy than in this sort of 1:1 support that we can provide for another individual. The coordinators for One Spirit are big-hearted, organized and very caring. I firmly believe that if one person suffers, we all suffer. There is a great deal of good you can do in this program to alleviate the suffering and difficulties of the individuals on the Pine Ridge reservation.
ONE Spirit	141144	1	/users/profile/187392	tybrus	Donor	5	11/19/2012	Having worked with my Father; who has been working within IHS, and not for profit clinics for years, I must say it has been a pleasure working with ONE Spirit. Any groups that take collects for help, spend the donations on staff, and admin costs. When I donate to One Spirit I know that it is going to help those in need, and not line the pockets of those that have. One Spirit is a great group that helps keep families alive and together in a world that is trying in every way to tear them apart. I wish there were more groups like this, and that more donors might be found to match the needs of those One Spirit works so hard to help.
ONE Spirit	141114	1	/users/profile/187351	Yveline LACAVE	Donor	5	11/19/2012	My name is Yveline LACAVE, I'm a french lady, and I try to help children and elders of Pine Ridge. I know ONE SPIRIT since several years nows and it's a great organization which help realy as well the elders than young people. Lately ONE SPIRIT helped these 5 young runners  to participate to the marathon of NY and I know how it was important for this young people, they have also helped the victims of Sandy Hurricane. I support ONE SPIRIT. I like the work they do.
ONE Spirit	141113	2	/users/profile/187350	DawnBE	Donor	5	11/19/2012	This nonprofit provides food, wood and many other necessities for people in Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.  I am most excited about the the youth center in Allen, SD they are soliciting funds for.  It will be a model for other districts in Pine Ridge.   Allen SD is almost in the center of the Pine Ridge Reservation and is the poorest place in the United States.  Per the 2010 census, Allen has a per capita income of: $1,539 and a population of 420   What is really sad is that person is Allen has so many children depending on that $1,539 a year.  I investigated this nonprofit and almost 100% of the monies donated go to the cause and not salaries.  thank you
ONE Spirit	140999	4	/users/profile/187223	Leonard Melton	Volunteer	5	11/18/2012	My name is Leonard Melton and about five years ago I served as an administrative assistant and webmaster for the ONE Spirit organization and had direct knowledge of the daily operation of this charity. I had read so many stories in the news about how many charity organizations divert much if not most of the donation money to administrative overhead and salary for administrative personnel. This is not the case with ONE Spirit. Everyone is a volunteer and donates time, service, and material to the Lakota on Pine Ridge and frequently pay out of our own pocket to cover any shortfall in donation. I am still a volunteer and sponsor food for two families out on the reservation and donate a computer every so often at my own expense also. I know that the money and material I send go directly to the Lakota people and I highly recommend ONE Spirit for anyone seeking an excellent organization that actually and directly help people.
ONE Spirit	140895	2	/users/profile/187112	Ginger A.	Donor	5	11/17/2012	I think One Spirit is a great organization and I like the work that they do; helping Native elders in one of the poorest places in the United States.  They help supply foods and other needs to those who otherwise would be without.  They even sponsored a team of runners for the NYC marathon which was preempted by hurricane Sandy.  So these young people stayed and helped with the disaster efforts.  That show true character and the kind of people that One Spirit helps.  I am a sporadic donor, being on a fixed income, but I wish I could give much more.  They do so much with what they get.
ONE Spirit	140852	3	/users/profile/187075	bsimonsmith	Donor	5	11/17/2012	I have been associated with several families from Pine Ridge for about 15 years.  I can tell you from experience that there is a strong need for assistance with the basic necessities of life.  One Spirit's goal is to provide opportunities for people to live in dignity and to be self sufficient.  One Spirit is a friend to the people of Pine ridge-not a caretaker or patriarch.  Any way you think you can help-any gift you have to share, no matter the size, One Spirit will help connect you with someone who will use it.
ONE Spirit	140838	2	/users/profile/187060	MelissaCloudFish	Donor	5	11/17/2012	I have seen this non-profit grow over a relatively short number of years to be a crucial and inspirational movement for progress on the Pine Ridge reservation. Starting with a simple sponsor program for children and elders which linked sponsors with individuals in need on the Pine Ridge Native American reservation, One Spirit has grown to provide life saving services such as fuel and wood delivery for heat in the winter and distribution of fresh fruit and vegetables. An organization with ambition and with great integrity, it has recently begun raising money to build youth centers to help a population of which 50% are under 20 years old but who have little or no activities. Plagued by drugs, poverty, alcoholism, and many other threats teens and children are often lost and desperate. One Spirit is helping Native people help themselves by giving young people opportunities to succeed for themselves and their community through art exchanges and sports. Recently, 4 native youth were signed up to run in the New York City marathon and though it was cancelled their project touched many and Inspired people to contribute to the construction of a youth center on the reservation. What is most important is that One Spirit is free of any religious affiliation, allowing thus the Lakota people who are involved in its programs to feel free to follow their own beliefs. I have known this organization for many years and have volunteered for it at different times and I am very impressed by their honesty and the hard work of a 100% volunteer staff to bring about these amazingly successful programs. Working with the people they serve and involving them in decisions is a way that One Spirit treats the Native people with the honor and respect they deserve. 
ONE Spirit	140834	3	/users/profile/187057	wind-runner	Board Member	4	11/17/2012	i am now the editor of our non profit news letter tnais, our north london group was originally a part of the native american indian association back in 1992, we then went onto form tnais in 1994, and became affiliated with the umbrella group, friends of native nations, who attend the rally for leonard peltier every year in june outside the usa embassy in the uk, as well as holding a charity stall at our uk veterans' pow wow, raising funds for one spirit, after meeting with jeri baker at one of our meetings. we liked the sound of all their programmes to help the lakota oyate, we also send out free copies of our news letter to native american prisoners, and try to promote native artists where and when we can.  various members of our groups have had the privilege to get over to usa/canada and physically spend time with native communities.

ONE Spirit	140805	1	/users/profile/187023	Msv6	Donor	5	11/17/2012	We were made aware of the desperate conditions affecting the Lakota People of the Pine Ridge Reservation by Diane Sawyer's ABC Documentary "Children of the Plains" which aired in the fall of 2011.  After doing some on-line research to identify a worthy organization that assists the Lakota, we settled on One Spirit.  We became sponsors of a Lakota Elder in October of 2011 and have been deeply grateful for this opportunity.  One Spirit is an intimate, caring group of volunteers, donors and staff that literally spans the globe.  The very personal connection that is formed between sponsors and those being sponsored is unlike that of any other non-profit organization we have been involved with.  It is more than just making a monetary donation each month, although that option is also available.  Sponsorship means being able to talk with the family or individual being sponsored and learning about them and their lives.  It is the chance to connect with people whose lives are so different from most of ours, yet whose dreams are the same.  Without the basic necessities of food, shelter, warmth and clothing it is very difficult to dream.  One Spirit helps make reality a little better for people so they can have the luxury of dreaming and reaching their dreams.  We really can't say enough great things about One Spirit.  Please consider One Spirit if you are looking for a meaningful way to work with the Lakota People of Pine Ridge and the surrounding area.
ONE Spirit	140800	1	/users/profile/187017	Aslan	Donor	5	11/17/2012	When the One Spirit marathon team went to New York to raise funds for their cause, ended up helping those who suffered from hurricane Sandy, I was deeply moved by the generous spirit of the Lakota Souix people. I came across One Spirit through a Facebook page belonging to a local church we occasionally attend.  The church itself had made me aware of the challenges the Lakota people face out on Pine Ridge, but when I discovered One Spirit, read the webpage and saw all the excellent things that this organisation does to help their people, I was moved.  When donating the system is very efficient, but I always receive a thank you email afterwards too, not an automated one, a personal one.  That to me makes One Spirit an amazing nonprofit organisation.  I know where and who are benefiting from any donations.  
ONE Spirit	140797	1	/users/profile/187014	Christi W.	Donor	5	11/17/2012	It is my pleasure to be a donor to such a worthy group,many Elders are caring for Grand-children,with little or no resources. Proud to help where ever I can,knowing the money goes to feed & clothe & warm those most deserving.
ONE Spirit	140788	1	/users/profile/187005	Sally33	Donor	5	11/17/2012	We learned about Pineridge Indian Reservation while researching places to move. I had never even heard of it before. As we kept reading more and watching shows on it we were horrified by the condition of life for the Indians. We began to search for ways to help and came across One Spirit. We were matched with a family on the reservation and have since been able to give direct support to them. We have one on one contact with them which is great! The program has been very helpful in answering our questions and guiding us! They also have an amazing program called Okini to look at a list of people with specific needs. And a wood and food program. I love the programs they have and think they really meet needs specifically not just a place you donate money to and never know where it goes!
ONE Spirit	140765	1	/users/profile/186980	akf66	Volunteer	5	11/17/2012	My husband & I wanted to donate to a charity but I wanted our contributions to directly help someone in need. I researched on-line and found nativeprogress.org / One Spirit. We became sponsors and as such are allowed direct contact with our sponsored family. I know of no other organization that does this. I help them with food, clothing and household items to  make their lives better. We have come to care deeply for our family and have developed a friendship with them. This is a wonderful organization and it helps people in some of the poorest locations in this country.
ONE Spirit	140763		/users/profile/186977	guildfest	Donor	4	11/17/2012	I've donated to One Spirit because I believe in the work they do: helping to strengthen and support the underserved Lakota community.
ONE Spirit	140725	1	/users/profile/186932	Jodi G.	Donor	5	11/16/2012	One Spirit is perhaps the most well-run charity I've ever worked with. The Okini program is a fantastic way for donors to connect directly with those needing help with critical needs like winter clothing, hygiene items, coats, shoes, etc. With the Okini program, your donations go directly to those who need them the most; no warehouses for things to sit around in for weeks. One Spirit also provides monthly food deliveries and wood deliveries in the winter months, programs that employ people on the reservation to help them earn a living for themselves. I am very grateful to have found One Spirit, knowing that my contributions have a direct and immediate effect. 
ONE Spirit	140711		/users/profile/186919	Rosemaire	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	I have been involved with ONE Spirit in several ways: providing food to Lakota families, providing wood to heat the homes of Lakota families and jobs to people to harvest the wood and deliver it to people's homes, providing resources to build a youth center, and sponsoring a family through relationship building, cultural exchange and helping to ensure basic needs are met.  ONE Spirit is a wonderful organization that takes the time to match your abilities and interests with the needs of the community they serve, giving you opportunities to get involved or simply provide resources where they are critical. I have enjoyed being part of ONE Spirit and believe my time, resources and abilities have been put to good use.  In addition, ONE Spirit has made sure I have the help I need to be most effective in my volunteer work.  Contributing to ONE Spirit is an enriching experience.  Thank you.
ONE Spirit	140704		/users/profile/186912	Deborah46	Donor	5	11/16/2012	I have been delighted with the personal and effective ways that One Spirit works with donors,letting us know of needs, and also of how we're directly helping. I know that the money I send is used in ways that are culturally sensUribe, and support the dignity of the clients, while meeting needs. When I send money for food, I know the actual cost and contents of the food box I'm helping to provide ... and that the delivery process is overseen by Lakota , not outsiders. I know when I supposupport the firewood project, I M providing meaningful and dignified employment for the men, enhancing community connections in the delivery system. I feel connected to the real families who are receiving the help I send, and I look forward to the regular emails detailing progress, needs, etc. I will definitely continue to support this joyful and effective , community-building group.
ONE Spirit	140699	1	/users/profile/186908	mmcguire52	Volunteer	5	11/16/2012	I have been following the Spirit of One Spirit for severals years. This Organization is doing for theSpirit of Pineridge what the Government doesn't do for its Nation. One Spirit is the Heart of the Lakota's. I havemet One Spirit through my friend Mr. Ed Chandler who has been working and living for the Pine Ridge Nation. The Great Spirit knows that One Spirit means as it is penned All Spirits of Volunteers and Members joined togetherare One Spirit in the eyes of the Great Spirit.  
ONE Spirit	140697		/users/profile/186906	Richard Stocker	Donor	5	11/16/2012	i LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO FIND NON PROFITS THAT MEAN SOMETHING SPECIAL TO ME.  ONE Spirit gives cloths, food, wood, shelter to Native people.  Keeping the Spirit alive with hope and compassion is a beautiful way.  I am warm and well fed all year long but my soul would be cold and sad if I did not do my part to support this Native Sioux community. I live in Michigan. I now give 100.00$. Richard

ONE Spirit	140571	1	/users/profile/186770	Heather75	Donor	5	11/16/2012	I have been working with One Spirit for about 4 to 5 months, now and have nothing but praise for this group. I am an author and I am donating a portion of every sale of my new novel-which is based on Pine Ridge reservation (one of the areas they serve in) and Jeri Baker was wonderful to work with and set up this new fund raising effort. I am also now working with them on sponsoring  2 children through their sponsorship program, my church where I am lead youth pastor will work with me on this new sponsorship. I have also worked with their Okini program, and our church has sent items needed by people One Spirit has on this list, in great need, I highly recommend this org, as they are hard working, honest and caring. I look forward to working with them on a continuous basis to aid the Lakota people.
ONE Spirit	140405		/users/profile/186581	Raybs	Donor	5	11/16/2012	ONE Spirit has allowed me hands-on experience with the Oglala Sioux Tribe of Pine Ridge Reservation by direct sponsorship of a Lakota elder and her extended family. The experience has been so moving that I am now engaged in grant writing and donation requests for ONE Spirit. 
ONE Spirit	140389		/users/profile/186562	Gabriel2	Donor	5	11/16/2012	I have been able to help an elderly man and his family directly by helping to meet their needs for warm clothing, food, and other items. Most charities want you to give them money and then you have no real idea how much of your money is skimmed, but I am able to send clothing, shoes, blankets, soap, and so forth, directly to them and the only money that I send to One Spirit is for the monthly food boxes, which they are not making a profit on. The boxes have vegetables, fruit, and meat -- no junk, no cheap unhealthy food. I enjoy being able to personally help someone, instead of blindly throwing money at cause. I've lived with poverty myself for a very long time and I know how much new shoes or a warm coat can mean.
ONE Spirit	120500	2	/users/profile/163891	Jim_25	Donor	5	08/12/2012	One Spirit does wonders for the day to day needs of the Lakota People. This is an organization of volunteers from one end to the other, every possible cent goes to the People, with very little used for operating the organization.  When people are fed, warm, housed and clothed , it is a lot easier to feel a sense  of self worth and pride.  This is the great work One Spirit is doing.
ONE Spirit	101137	4	/users/profile/128575	Donna234567891011	Volunteer	5	11/28/2011	One Spirit has been great about giving me a chance to share what I am able to share with my limited resources. There is so much need and everything you give goes straight to help those on the Reservation.  
ONE Spirit	100629	3	/users/profile/123663	darbyann	Volunteer	5	11/14/2011	I have done charitable work for many years but have never found such a great organization as One Spirit.  There is no middle man taking a large piece of the pie and all I do goes directly to a real person.  It has been wonderful!  Everything that is sent is so appreciated!  I like the idea of helping in "my own back yard" and One Spirit helps me do just that.
ONE Spirit	100448	2	/users/profile/122562	Kara23	Volunteer	5	11/09/2011	I decided I wanted to help the people at Pine Ridge but had no idea where to start. One Spirit does a great role of both helping there and organizing people who want to sponsor and/or help in some way. As well as getting the word out about the issues as much as possible. I would definately reccomend them.
ONE Spirit	100438	3	/users/profile/122420	shannona3733	General Member of the Public	5	11/08/2011	After learning my daughter was Native American on her father's side, I started searching the internet to find out more about them when I found info on the Pine Ridge reservation. These people now have a special place in my heart, and have made me decide I want to make their cause my cause. I ran across One Spirit on twitter, and although I don't have much, I'm going to be giving whatever I can and helping to spread the word about One Spirit and Pine Ridge. Hoping to make a better future for people who have suffered so much in the past and today.
ONE Spirit	99352	1	/users/profile/119023	coachdebslim	General Member of the Public	5	10/16/2011	Come across ONE Spirit a group that is working hard to help Native Americans. I believe every American should be posting this review & making one for theirselves.
ONE Spirit	96677	1	/users/profile/112898	lalo	Donor	5	08/26/2011	I came across Nativeprogress.com or One Spirit through some research on the internet on Native American Indian tribes; that's when I seen a variety of videos on Youtube on the Pine Ridge Reservation. I was able then to see that poverty is rampant in the PRS. My heart when out to the people and I seen that they were in desperate need of help. Thank God that I have the previlege to help Nativeprogress with the needs of the Lokota people. God Bless Nativeprogress in their works towards this great cause.
ONE Spirit	95728	3	/users/profile/111239	Sue A.	Donor	5	08/15/2011	I have been a donor, sponsor, and volunteer with ONE Spirit for many years.  In June of this year I had the honor and privilege of visiting the Pine Ridge Reservation in SD.  During my time there, I helped deliver food to folks that had been provided by kind and caring donors and sponsors. I saw first hand how important the food is to families, children and elders.  The Lakota are wonderful people who do not deserve to live in third world conditions...right here in the middle of the "land of plenty."  Please go to the ONE Spirit web site www.nativeprogress.org to see all the programs and opportunities for donors, sponsors, and volunteers.  Become a member of the ONE Spirit family.  Give a part of yourself, go without something in order to help.  You won't regret it.  It will do your heart good. 
ONE Spirit	95645	1	/users/profile/111101	Lisa O	Donor	5	08/13/2011	It's been rare in my experience of non-profits that you can give money for specific projects, specific areas, specific people even and get feed back on how your donation helps.  This is so very important to me.  I've become very disillusioned with organizations such as the Red Cross and United Way after learning about the yearly salaries of the top people in these organizations. (over a quarter of a million each) Donations are individually acknowledged by people you can actually communicate with if you have questions. Also the money goes to Americans, not some group overseas that you never really know how your money is being spent. . . .
ONE Spirit	94943	3	/users/profile/109954	gwen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/03/2011	If only the U.S. could understand what our own government has done to help destroy this proud people.  The poorest place in America!! That should tell you all you need to know.  Yes there is poverty in many other places, but this is our own doorstep.  One Spirit is the only organization that I know of that works with the entire spectrum of what these people need.  If you love your neighbor then there is no better place to show that love.  Pine Ridge Rez. needs One Spirit and the programs that they bring.  One Spirit needs all of our support to continue to provide this excellent care to our fellow human beings.
ONE Spirit	94749	2	/users/profile/109674	Hankh	Volunteer	5	07/31/2011	We have been a One-Spirit sponsor for about 9 months now. Our family is from Wounded Knee and our coordinator (Mavis) was excellent. We know we have made a difference in their lives - but the sponsor family has also changed our lives. The Native American family has given us a perspective we would have never had.  We have supplied food and clothing but the most rewarding gifts were beading supplies and silk-screening supplies which helped them to become more self seficient.  The programs One-Spirit offers and the guidance couldn't be better. I have had the pleasure to have conversations with some of the management in the organization and I can tell you straight-up -the organization is great. Great for those being helped; great for the sponsors. 
ONE Spirit	94721	2	/users/profile/109628	Linda C.	Donor	5	07/31/2011	One Spirit is the only organization that I know and trust with my donations. One Spirit operates with the utmost integrity. Unlike other organizations that make vague assertions about their accomplishments, One Spirit produces tangible results.  
ONE Spirit	94718	2	/users/profile/109623	PainterLady61	Volunteer	5	07/31/2011	I became aware of One Spirit when investigating the plight of the Lakota People on the Pine Ridge Reservation. One thing led to another and I suddenly found myself as a volunteer maintaining viral accounts on Facebook and Twitter. Twitter has by far been the most active account  as I direct people for services connecting them with service coordinators,  or I connect them with our director who can answer their questions. The organization of volunteers is a efficient group,  each person pulling their weight in order to make sure the services reach the people who really need them. The level of poverty that is experienced on the Reservation is something the average person cannot begin to fathom. Because of the work of ONE Spirit many of the these people have food  and heat where they would go without. The Okini program brings used clothing, appliances, wood stoves, etc to them for free. One Spirit is one of the oldest programs on the Reservation and constantly provides support for programming, as well as supplies. I am proud to be a part of this group as they work to make a difference.
ONE Spirit	94707	1	/users/profile/109609	jimkatz	Donor	5	07/30/2011	The wonderful personal, quick, and efficient communication that the One Spirit folks provide really lets me know that their work for the Pine Ridge Lakota people is the best possible.  A few dedicated staff volunteers do the work of a whole organization and when I write with questions I know who is answering me.  They love their work and do it way above and beyond the call.  Maybe the best thing is that I am sure my money is going to help the elders, children, families and community.  It is a small organization accomplishing a big job and I trust them.  One Spirit restores my faith in charitable organizations, and that is not an easy thing to maintain.
ONE Spirit	94705	2	/users/profile/109607	Kathy N.	Volunteer	5	07/30/2011	     Pine Ridge is one of the poorest reservations in the United States and they are in desperate need of help, not only with personal items, clothes, food and the necessities of life, but also their homes are in need of desperate repair, while you see commercials on tv asking for help for other countries, our people here in the United States are in need of help.      Elders live in homes that have no electricity or heat they have no money for medications that they need, children go without decent clothes or shoes in order to go to school, most are without food.      If there is one organization you vow to help with your donations, please consider One Spirit. No other non profit organization deserves it more.
ONE Spirit	94370	3	/users/profile/109096	4Lakota	Donor	5	07/26/2011	One Spirit delivers food to the elders and children of Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. In a location where diet related disease is epidemic, One Spirit offers a long-term solution by providing organic fresh/frozen produce to the families that they serve. One of the things that I found to be the most impressive was that One Spirit allows donors to select the specific food items that they would like to give, so you know exactly how your money is going to be used!
Windcross Conservancy	303480		/users/profile/394651	Andra3,	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I volunteered at Windcross conservancy for the last two summers. It was an amazing and open minding experience. Windcross conservancy taught me so much about Spanish mustangs and horses in general but also about keeping alive breeds that are in danger of extinction. An amazing family doing some amazing and great things. My stay with them was so nice, inspiring and interesting, because not only are they generous and welcoming they also teach you new things and are always ready for a new adventure. I had the best two summers of my life and I'll never thank life enough for meeting this family and their horses.
Windcross Conservancy	317956		/users/profile/187333	Grandma Rebecca	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2016	This ranch for the preservation of the Spanish Mustangs never ceases to amaze me in the dedication and love given these animals.  The time and money the Roda family sacrifice personally is beyond anything I have ever seen.  The family and volunteers give their own time to share the story of the horses and the everyday life on this ranch. Their hard work is commendable. I would recommend a visit to Buffalo Gap and this amazing ranch.
Windcross Conservancy	239113		/users/profile/187333	Grandma Rebecca	Volunteer	5	03/11/2015	My husband and I come to Windcross every May to help out. The knowledge and dedication of the family and the volunteers who come from all over the world is very impressive. You can see how happy the horses are at this place where they get such love and wonderful care. It is a place everyone should visit to appreciate. They cater to all ages.
Windcross Conservancy	206732		/users/profile/187333	Grandma Rebecca	Volunteer	5	07/20/2014	Another two week vacation spent at Windcross.  Can't say enough about this family and their dedication to these horses.  A beautiful place and a beautiful life for these horses.
Windcross Conservancy	155202		/users/profile/187333	Grandma Rebecca	General Member of the Public	5	04/17/2013	Windcross Conservancy does a wonderful job in its goal to preserve the Spanish Mustang horses. The opportunity Windcross gives interns from around the world to participate in this worthy cause is to be greatly admired. The informative tours they give the public give all who come to the ranch the opportunity to see first hand these amazing horses and how they are lovingly cared for as well as learn about their heritage.  I hope many more will take advantage of the opportunity to see these beautiful horses up close. 
Windcross Conservancy	141099		/users/profile/187333	Grandma Rebecca	Donor	5	11/18/2012	A very worthy NON-profit organization. Lucy and her family are lovingly dedicated to the preservation of these beautiful horses. They put in many long hours. I hope many people take the time to read all the reviews and get an idea just what Windcross is all about.
Windcross Conservancy	304341		/users/profile/395509	coeagle	Client Served	5	09/13/2016	My grandkids and I visited couple times, what a wonderful experience, the tour was very informative, the spanish mustangs are very well cared for, the family and volunteers are very friendly they are very passionate about their work, they went above and beyond during our visit 
Windcross Conservancy	304332		/users/profile/395500	Writer	Client Served	5	09/13/2016	I loved this place. Loved walking out into the herd and learning all about the Spanish Mustangs. The horses are so well cared for and the employees and volunteers are so nice. 
Windcross Conservancy	303984		/users/profile/395138	Cindy214	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2016	Not only do you get to see beautiful horses, you also get up-close & personal with them! Touch, smell (yes, I LOVE horse smell!), & learn about the Spanish Mustang. All in a beautiful & easily accessible, historic location.  SO thankful they are preserving the history of these magnificent animals.
Windcross Conservancy	288172		/users/profile/378386	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	05/03/2016	Awesome family, highly dedicated to the conservancy of the Spanish Mustang breed. The tours are informative and personal and really give you an idea about the history and the possible future of those horses. Definitly worth a short visit or even a long-term stay!
Windcross Conservancy	287061		/users/profile/377135	Penny27	Client Served	5	04/22/2016	What a wonderful organization!  The entire group gives their hearts and souls to the preservation of this great breed.  I am thankful for all the work they continue to do!
Windcross Conservancy	284468		/users/profile/184632	Jane48	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/03/2016	True dedication is often hard to find. But at Windcross Conservancy dedication and education are the motivating factors in this organization. Dedication to the foundation Spanish Mustang, a rare breed that must be preserved if there are to be any remaining for future generations, and education so people may understand and appreciate what makes the Spanish Mustang the rarity that it is in today's equine world. Tours among the horses, one on one with those who work daily with these unique horses, helps to not only educate, but to sometimes introduce people to a breed they didn't know existed. Windcross is the future for the little Spanish horse that help to settle our country, they should not be forgotten.
Windcross Conservancy	138563	1	/users/profile/184632	Jane48	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	My husband and I have been involved with preserving the rare breed of horse, the Spanish Mustang, since the early 90's. Windcross Conservancy is an amazing organization, created to help preserve the breed while at the same time educating interested individuals through hands on experience with the horses as well as insuring that horses in the herd are excellent representatives of the breed. Because these are the horses that helped settle America they have a unique history, unlike the mixed breed mustangs of other sanctuaries. Daily tours are offered to anyone who is interested in learning more about the horses and seeing them "up close and personal". We have been a part of a weekend where artists from all over the country spent a weekend with over 20 members of a Native American family who set up a village on the rolling hills of the Conservancy so the artists could take pictures and later paint realistic, accurate  representations of Indian life on the prairie. The Roda family, who are the guardians of the herd, all worked practically 24/7 to insure that everyone was well taken care of, the horses were front and center, and at the same time managed to make everyone feel at home and welcomed. Windcross was also the host to several people, from all over the world, who apprenticed at the ranch, learning what it takes to manage a 400 acre preserve.  Whether you are interested in horses, just want a great experience on a working ranch or hope to some day own your own living piece of history, Windcross Conservancy is the place to be! Both my husband and myself plan to return for the 3rd Annual Artists Shoot in 20013.
Windcross Conservancy	284411		/users/profile/374456	Writer	Client Served	5	04/02/2016	I had an amazing experience last month with Windcross. Took a tour among the herd and got to help get two of the younger horses used to human contact. Would definitely recommend to horse-y and non-horse-y people alike. 
Windcross Conservancy	281286		/users/profile/371322	Nillownal	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2016	I visited Windcross Conservancy several times, and really enjoyed it.

Windcross Conservancy	256448	3	/users/profile/161122	Ponygirl	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	I am a volunteer with Windcross Conservancy.  Over the years I have become very cynical and frankly skeptical.  It takes a lot to earn my trust.  I am appalled by the lack of value people seem to have for personal integrate.  Windcross Conservancy's president Lucia Roda is a breath of fresh air to this tired soul.  Her family comes first but after that she is totally devoted to the preservation of the Spanish Mustang. She has personally experience the pain and frustration dealing with unscrupulous people and organizations and is meticulous about absolute transparency.  I can also testify to the endless hours she devotes to the care of the horses, the promotion of the breed and the establishment of programs will assist in their preservation.  Her husband and children also contribute many hours towards the operation and sacrifice many things like family holidays in order to make funds available to fill in the shortfall of funding needed to operate the program.  Why is it important to preserve the Spanish Mustang and why the urgency?  The Spanish Mustang is a important part of American history.  They are the quintessential horse of the Old West.  They were the cattle working horses from California through to Texas and north. Much of the modern breed Quarter Horses' ancestry and Pony of America can be traced to Spanish Mustangs.  The Spanish Mustang originated in medieval times. They have both physical and character traits, that are passed on genetically,  that  have been lost in modern breeding programs; things such as extremely strong feet and legs and conformations which enable outstanding athletic ability.  There are less than 300 breeding mares left and the numbers are declining rapidly.  Once they are gone we cannot get them back.  Windcross Conservancy is racing against time.   I believe that Windcross is an Non Profit that is worthy of peoples' support.  It has is important cause and any contributions are used wisely and with the utmost integrate.
Windcross Conservancy	178252	2	/users/profile/161122	Ponygirl	Volunteer	5	10/16/2013	This past year has been a real struggle for Windcross Conservancy. The drought last summer inflated the price of hay astronomically high.  I know that the Roda family dug deeply into there own personal budget to ensure that the horses were well cared for.  It takes incredible dedication to a cause to do without yourself, to ensure that the work goes on.  These are people of real integrity and it is so difficult to know how hard they work and not be able to help more.  This non-profit works to preserve the gene pool of these amazing horses and a living piece of American and medieval European heritage.  If we lose this genetic treasure we will lose both physical and behavioural attributes that are rare in modern breeds.  Thank you to the Roda's for their endless work.
Windcross Conservancy	118463	2	/users/profile/161122	Ponygirl	Volunteer	5	07/15/2012	I met Lucy Roda and Windcross at a time when I had all but given up on finding an organization that I could trust and where I could feel like I could contribute without being a yes person. The board of directors have been so careful ;to maintain the integrate of the organization while moving forward to effectively reach its objectives. I am so impressed with the dedication to the horses and the wisdom used in their management. The horses' well being comes first and foremost.  I am also very aware of the hours and hours of work that Lucy and her family put into this organization with no expectation of return for their dedication and sacrifice. I can assure anyone that any time, effort or money that they contribute is deeply appreciated and used wisely.

This tour was fun,  personal and educational.  We highly recommend this tour and the important work of this conservancy.   Thank you for a great experience. 
Windcross Conservancy	250232	2	/users/profile/338065	wildwilliam	General Member of the Public	5	07/27/2015	Fantastic Visit! My wife and I visited the conservancy on the recommendation of the local KOA owner. We showed up on a Sunday at the end of the camping season with no advanced notice. We were greeted with a welcoming smile and a tour of the farm. We met all the horses and interacted with many of them. We learned quite a bit about the breed and we could see the love and dedication provided for them.  We cannot wait for a return visit.Bill and Deena
Windcross Conservancy	250127		/users/profile/337957	Kademansmom12	Client Served	5	07/26/2015	I took my son here last month and we both absolutely LOVED it! The staff was really friendly, their tours were very informative, and most of all my son was one happy little boy after our trip! I was a little worried about taking him around the animals at his age (3), but any reservations I had previously completely disappeared by the end of the tour. They ran a very safe, yet interactive tour. I was entirely pleased with my visit at windcross and will be returning!
Windcross Conservancy	250016		/users/profile/337837	Joyce55	General Member of the Public	5	07/25/2015	We stopped here on July 20, 2015 and learned more than we expected to.  The work being done here is inspirational.  We were able to walk among the herd and get a hands-on experience with those horses willing to allow it.  When our stables are renovated and we are ready to get horses, we would be pleased to be a part of the conservation of this original breed.
Windcross Conservancy	249429		/users/profile/337251	Caroline92	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	Last year I stayed three weeks at Windcross Conservancy helping out with the horses. The Roda's are a great family and everyday I saw and experienced their love and passion for their horses and their work. The horses themselves are great as well: I never met any horses that have such a great and different personality than those. They live in a really nice and big pasture where they can just be horses and they are so friendly to all the visitors. I hope you keep up doing what you're doing for a really long time!

Windcross Conservancy	303480		/users/profile/394651	Andra3,	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	I volunteered at Windcross conservancy for the last two summers. It was an amazing and open minding experience. Windcross conservancy taught me so much about Spanish mustangs and horses in general but also about keeping alive breeds that are in danger of extinction. An amazing family doing some amazing and great things. My stay with them was so nice, inspiring and interesting, because not only are they generous and welcoming they also teach you new things and are always ready for a new adventure. I had the best two summers of my life and I'll never thank life enough for meeting this family and their horses.

It was very informative and awesome to get hands on with these beautiful horses. I wish we could have spent more time there. They are a veteran friendly establishment also. We, ( my family), all agree that it was a highlight of our vacation.
Windcross Conservancy	233432		/users/profile/297227	horsefan84	General Member of the Public	5	11/11/2014	My best friend and I came with my service dog and they were willing to let us see the horses even though I had a service dog. This place is a stop above the rest and really showed that the Spanish Mustang is very much alive and well. I was very impressed with the staff and how knowledgable they were. If we are ever in Buffalo Gap again we will surely be checking this place out again. They have some great horses and they are eager as well to meet other people. The horses are used in therapy and education programs around South Dakota. It was a real treat coming to this non profit. We will be back!

Volunteer	5	08/11/2014	I have spent two summers volunteering at Windcross Conservancy, working with an incredible organization and the fantastic a Roda family, and my experiences have inspired and encouraged me with my passion for horses. Windcross caters for all of the family, and provides an informative, enjoyable experience, which will leave you with fantastic memories, and the want to support the aims Windcross strives to achieve, in protecting the Spanish Mustang, that is so often overlooked as a breed. 
Windcross Conservancy	163437	1	/users/profile/216985	Louise C.	Volunteer	5	07/24/2013	I found Windcross Conservancy on a volunteer site, and decided it was the place to see. I was nervous when I first arrived, not sure what to expect, but the family took me in and made me feel right at home. I learnt so much about the history of the Spanish Mustang, and fully intend to spread the word and gain support for Windcross. I had such a fantastic time, I decided to extend my trip and am already planning my next year summer there - it was truly difficult to leave! The people are wonderful, welcoming and amazing friends for life. I spent the whole time I was there laughing and learning - a true life experience. I would recommend Windcross to not only horse lovers but those with a taste for history and blissful scenery. I wish them all the best with their work.

The Roda family have taught me so many things over the last three years, they are an amazing family. What wind cross is doing for the spanish mustang as a breed isn't done anywhere else in the world to the quality it is done here. i would recommend windcross to anyone who wants an educational, fun and  personal experience with the spanish mustang.

Windcross Conservancy	156548		/users/profile/207650	Leigh Bob F.	Volunteer	5	04/28/2013	Windcross conservancy is a wonderful ranch filled with amazing people and horses, Lucy and her family work long hours and but a lot of hard work into windcross. The Spanish mustang breed is one that must be persevered and that is what windcross is doing their hardest to do. My time at windcross was amazing and I can't wait to get back their in July. :) 
Windcross Conservancy	208083		/users/profile/270765	pmsiml	General Member of the Public	5	07/31/2014	Lucia and the crew have been WONDERFUL in helping me learn everything I can about the Spanish Mustang.  I am very thankful for all the hard work everyone at Windcross Conservancy contributes to further the lineage and education of this fantastic breed.
Windcross Conservancy	207991	1	/users/profile/216526	mary zolnowsky	Donor	5	07/31/2014	We had a family reunion here this year. I arranged with Lucy for a tour. I was unable to attend myself, but the original group of 5 who expressed interest grew to 11. The photos I saw showed smiling faces as people interacted with the horses. Everyone had a great time. I have been to Windcross a few times this year at their new location in the historic Buffalo Gap schoolhouse. I am continually amazed at the amount of energy Lucy has for her family, Windcross, and the international group of volunteers who help keep the place going. I think that energy comes from pursuing a dream and seeing it become reality.
Windcross Conservancy	163115	1	/users/profile/216526	mary zolnowsky	Donor	5	07/19/2013	I've been a city dweller all my life. I've never been around horses. My husband grew up near here and retirement brings us to this area. I met Lucy and family through her parents, who are good friends. I donated a stove, some money, and some goldfish for the stock tanks. The day I dropped off the fish, I got to go on a tour and meet some of the horses, see the new foals, and hear stories about  life on the ranch.  My immediate impression was, this family really knows and loves these horses.  What a great place for Lucy and Matt's kids to grow up, what a great place for volunteers, and what a great place for the horses. 
Windcross Conservancy	206511	1	/users/profile/172939	nizzie	Volunteer	5	07/18/2014	Having spent a fortnight at Windcross I can honestly say it was the most amazing experience in my life. To see the hard work that is done day after day, witness the problems being overcome and the wonderful way that people can interact with the horses is something that can only be truly appreciated when you come up close with them. Lucia Roda is a very strong person who puts herself out continually and unrelentlessly for this wonderful cause which she supports 200%. I wish her well and she has my continual prayers for a successful future.
Windcross Conservancy	127831	1	/users/profile/172939	nizzie	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	This wonderful charity was set up to preserve the Spanish Mustang horses - endangered but some of the most beautiful horses in the world.  The organisation is expertly run and the horses are foremost in their thoughts using a lot of their own money to finance it. They raise awareness by holding open days and inviting people along to see their work and taking on internees to help out and in return this gives these people an insight into the hard work that it takes to run Windcross. A well deserved cause run with dedication and love for their work.
Windcross Conservancy	206417		/users/profile/268827	zenjane	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/17/2014	Wonderful place!! Truly knowledgeable folks passing that knowledge on the rare Foundation Spanish Mustang through internships and daily tours filled with information on these unique horses history. The horses are so well cared for and are beautiful. They also train their horses to show the versatility of the breed, and even take the horses to various places in town (the senior living center and the hospital) as "ambassadors" for the breed, to the delight of those that see them.
Windcross Conservancy	206378		/users/profile/184669	Loree S.	Board Member	5	07/16/2014	Fell in love with the horses and the people. Couldn't take the people home :( so................ we left with 4 beautiful mustangs as ambassadors for the Northern Black Hills. What a gift! Their beauty and grace is beyond words not to mention a photographers dream.
Windcross Conservancy	138597		/users/profile/184669	Loree S.	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	Feel the power of the herd. Capture their grace and beauty in a photograph and know that you have stood witness to one of the last genetically preserved Spanish Mustang herds in the world. Nothing shy of magic is felt here. Come.
Windcross Conservancy	206338		/users/profile/268735	CleoneEklypse	Volunteer	4	07/16/2014	I volunteered at the Conservancy for a month. Inside of that month I learned so much about horses and about myself. Working every day with these people and their animals taught me to be flexible, because in life, nothing ever quite goes to plan. It taught me that to be professional and personal is OK. It taught me self respect, because the horses rely on you for relationship just as much as they do from the other horses. To them I was important. It taught me life lessons I could walk away with a better human.The depth of knowledge and relationship at Windcross that can be explored is endless. The curators are professional without seeming aloof or distanced, and you can ask questions without feeling ignorant.  The animals are beautiful and intelligent. The Conservancy is one of those places you can visit and it feels like coming home.

Windcross Conservancy	206289		/users/profile/213177	AHHC Europe Spanish Mustangs	Volunteer	5	07/16/2014	We have supported Windcross Conservancy from its birth and continue to do so. Although previously based in Canada and now the UK with our Spanish Mustangs we pledge support via our Facebook page. Windcross is now THE definitive preserve for the Spanish Mustang by virtue of its modern approach to conservation along with ethical breeding. As the old timer range breeders become a practice of the past Windcross Conservancy forgers ahead in its modernity. Despite the dwindling numbers of this rare breed worldwide Windcross nevertheless erred on the side of caution in this uncertain global horse market and bred no mares for 2014. This is to be commended rather than breeding mares for the sake of numbers. This year they have concentrated on training and projects involving the horses being seen and accessed by the public. Some Windcross bred horses have been sold to excellent homes that will now promote the breed. This is a people-friendly, family focused outfit and we recommend it every time.Sarah FarmanAHHC (Europe) for the Spanish Mustangwww.americanheritagehorse.eu
Windcross Conservancy	160785		/users/profile/213177	AHHC Europe Spanish Mustangs	Volunteer	5	06/17/2013	Windcross Conservancy continues to build on its past successes including adding the best Spanish Mustang bloodlines to its herd thus conserving this critically threatened breed.  Yet it also sets a good example to us all by breeding less in 2013 to reflect the global downturn in the horse market. This year more interns and visitors and never a negative comment which has to be the best testimony to their success. I have been part of Windcross since it was launched and as volunteer Campaign Manager for the Spanish Mustang in the Arts am looking forward to our first project later this year - announcement soon! The internet enables such campaigns even although I now live i the UK with my Spanish Mustangs.This is where Windcross has been somewhat unique to other Spanish Mustang organisations in that it has pioneered the arts too by inviting in artists and photographers. The horses are well-cared for - never go short on hay or feed -  and people-friendly as many of the photographs demonstrate on their Facebook page. ......... and it is THEIR page as it is and always will be about the Spanish Mustang horses. As an artist and writer I am delighted to be a part of Windcross Conservancy.
Windcross Conservancy	183303		/users/profile/240216	rachel.gustafson	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	When we pulled onto the dusty dirt road to make our way towards Windcross, I had a car full of a skeptical husband and 3 tired and potentially grumpy little girls.  We had been on a road trip for 9 days and everyone was a starting to get a little on edge.  After our very special time there, I can't imagine having almost missed this gem of a place because I didn't see it on my TripAdvisor list of things to see in the area.   We drove in and were immediately greeted with such warmth and enthusiasm by Ms. Roda.  Our girls had seen the dog and were obviously nervous to get out of the van, but she quickly assessed the situation and did a number of things that helped them be relaxed and ready to learn and experience all that Windcross is.  Two of my girls have Sensory Processing issues and it can be difficult to know how they will react in certain circumstances where they can be over-stimulated.  Ms. Roda had a wonderful instinctual way of being keyed into them and before we knew it, she had loaded us up for a highly personalized, face-to-face experience with the horses.  It didn't take long before my girls were begging to touch and see the horses closer.   She and her daughter had such an obvious love and passion for what they were doing and highlighted the story and personality of so many of the horses, one by one.  Usually, with three small children I'm so busy trying to get everyone else to relax and enjoy themselves that I don't get to really be present in the moment myself.  Ms. Roda and her daughter had my girls at ease and actively engaged to such a degree that I was able to find a few moments to stand back, take in the amazing beauty of the horses, the golden expanse of the fields, the sun on my neck and my feet planted in the soil and take a deep breath and feel it all the way deep in my soul.  Even my sometimes curmudgeony husband said it was one of the best parts of our whole cross-country roadtrip. I believe it is very possible that Ms. Roda and her family made lifetime fans of the Conservancy and the horses.  I wish we could contribute more but were so blessed that this amazing  experience did not come with a hefty price tag that would have made it impossible for us to experience it as a family.
Windcross Conservancy	165771		/users/profile/220276	Toni22	Volunteer	5	08/22/2013	It was my first time in the US and with Spanish Mustangs. Before I came to Windcross, i've never seen a Spanish Mustang and I didn't know much about them, but Lucy and her family taught me a lot about their character, behaviour and their history. I fell in love with these powerful horses and that great project to work at a non profit organization, helping with the daily farm work and training horses. My job as a Volunteer was awesome and I enjoyed these two months I stayed at Windcross! I really hope that I can come back someday to see the Roda family, the two horses I worked with and all the other animals! Thank you for everything :)
Windcross Conservancy	165697		/users/profile/220201	Lacey3	General Member of the Public	5	08/21/2013	Absolutely wonderful experience. The staff is very cordial and their knowledge is beyond compare.

Windcross Conservancy	164372		/users/profile/218447	Vandurwen	Volunteer	5	08/07/2013	It was the first time for me in the USA and I was very nervous if everything will go well and if I would like it there. But after a few days I fell in love with the horses (especially two of them) and their history.I didn't know much about Spanish Mustangs but learned a lot about them from Lucy and their family, although I knew much about horses before I came there, they surprised me in their character and behavior.Now I can even imagine to get a horse from there to bring it to Germany, because they are so special.I will definitly come back!Sandra
Windcross Conservancy	163468	1	/users/profile/217021	patrick.endall	Volunteer	5	07/24/2013	I volunteered at Windcross during the summer of 2013, during which time I was well looked after and made very welcome. The Roda family have a great depth of understanding of the land and its history and are always willing to share their knowledge. They adapt their tours to the individual needs of the visitor and provide those visitors with a fantastic opportunity to interact with the Spanish mustangs in a way they may rarely otherwise do. Walking among a herd out on the prairie whilst learning about their individual characteristics is a very rewarding experience. Not knowing much about horses previously other than what I had read in books, being around them on a daily basis, grooming, feeding and learning the basics of working with them was really great. Whilst volunteering I learned a number of valuable new skills and was given every opportunity to back up my understanding of the way of life I was experiencing by visiting the many interesting sites in the Black Hills. Of those sites though, Windcross has to be one of the most unique, friendly and individually tailored experiences in the area.
Windcross Conservancy	162023		/users/profile/214951	TrudyDJara	Volunteer	5	07/03/2013	This is a wonderful experience for all ages.  The Spanish Mustangs are beautiful!  The Hosts are knowledgeable!  And the area is one of a kind: like the old rugged west.  There is a mobile cart that gets you up close and personal with the Mustangs.
Windcross Conservancy	161912		/users/profile/214788	Cadillac J.	Board Member	4	07/02/2013	 When my husband and I first got involved with these horses about 8 years ago the situation was not nearly so dire as it is now. So many Spanish Mustangs are being sent to kill buyers now  and there are so few to begin with.  So when we visit Windcross Conservancy and see so many new people meeting and learning about these ancient horses who have been with humans almost as long as dogs it makes all the sacrifices and hard work worthwhile and gives hope that these horses will be saved bythe Americans who truly owe them so much in history. The Spanish Mustang is important to European heritage as well as being one of the key elements that made the USA what it is today. All the legends of  the American past and it's exceptionalism would not have been possible wo this exceptional horse.
Windcross Conservancy	161199	4	/users/profile/213733	Michael176	General Member of the Public	5	06/21/2013	The knowledge base of the curators of the Conservancy is truly amazing. They have a real bond with the horses and an intense desire to preserve the integrity of the breed. They spend a lot of time with their visitors and help them interact with the horses. They are incredibly intuned to the subtle behaviors of the horses and their personalities and they bring you into this experience. The Conservancy is a great example of a working ranch also. They have geese, guinea hens, cows, chickens etc. and readily explain the workings of a ranch along with the maintenance of the horses. AMAZING. Highly Recommended.
Windcross Conservancy	160933		/users/profile/213357	Betsy M13	Donor	5	06/18/2013	Engaging, incredible and so much more than expected.  My families' visit to Windcross ranch preserve for the Spanish Mustang was the experience of a lifetime.   Lucia and her group of volunteers were friendly, knowledgable and passionate about these very special horses.  A visit that was well worth the drive.  We would definitely do it again.

Windcross Conservancy	127733	1	/users/profile/56691	Lucia R.	Board Member	5	10/22/2012	I  joined Windcross at it's inception.  I believed in the preservation effort on  behalf of the Spanish Mustang for which it was founded.  Since then the organization has given me the opportunity to host young people from around the world as volunteers and interns at the Windcross Preserve in Buffalo Gap, South Dakota.  In addition, I have been able to share them with visitors from across the country and the world.  My Windcross experience has been amongst the toughest and most rewarding in my life.  I wouldn't change a thing.

In doing so the organisation enlists help from volunteers and friends which gives these people, not normally associated with horses, an amazing insight into how Windcross works so hard to get the plight of these horses acknowledged and it is a privilege that my application for an internship for 2014 has been accepted as I welcome the chance to witness the work of this wonderful organisation first hand. 
Windcross Conservancy	145825	1	/users/profile/192403	Kelly70	General Member of the Public	5	12/04/2012	I was around when when Windcross Conservancy was only a dream, I have watched it grow and develop into a reality. I have witness the hardship, the losses. The uncertainty of the path chosen. I have witnessed great personal sacrifice, dedication, and hardship. But most of all I have witnessed unwavering LOVE for these magnificent animals. I have watched an ordinary woman go through extraordinary changes and challenges, to become an expert in the field. I have been witness to a dream being birthed into a reality through blood sweat and tears. It is an honor to witness and be a part of (even if all I do is (PET THE PRETTY PONIES LOL)   I applaud you! Congratulations on  your achievements and keep up the good works, Lives are changing because of what you do! One person can make a difference, You have brought education to the public about the Spanish Mustangs that may never have been heard. Perhaps helped to save these animals from extinction. Yes they are a very worthy NON PROFIT Organization! Blessings All! Much Love to Lucia and her Devoted Family!

Being able to have plenty of interaction with the mustangs feeding, petting, and talking to the horses has made my daughters very happy,  which makes some very happy parents,  and knowing Lucy and her family are watching over my girls is very comforting, no worrying!!  We recommend every family take a trip out to Windcross and let those Spanish Mustangs work their magic, it is such a beautiful environment, and a great family too!!!!

Windcross conservancy taught me so much about Spanish mustangs and horses in general but also about keeping alive breeds that are in danger of extinction. An amazing family doing some amazing and great things. My stay with them was so nice, inspiring and interesting, because not only are they generous and welcoming they also teach you new things and are always ready for a new adventure. I had the best two summers of my life and I'll never thank life enough for meeting this family and their horses.
Windcross Conservancy	139478	2	/users/profile/185596	Friendly Bandit	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2012	Wndcross Conservancy is dedicated to the preservation of the true Spanish Mustang. They are extremely knowledgeable in all and everything Spanish Mustang.  Lucia and her family put in long hours of care, teaching, training, welcoming guests, giving tours and trying to educate people about the beautiful Spanish Mustang.  I have had the pleasure of meeting Lucia, her family, her friends, and her wonderful horses thorough competetive trail rides that she has hosted.  This is the most welcoming, hospitable, loveable group of people that I have ever met. Their horses are so loveable too! Once you've visited Windcross Conservancy you will always return.

The Family we lived with took us in so lovingly, our time at the ranch were the most wonderful time I have had in the US! It was an incredible experience! Thank u so much!
Windcross Conservancy	138663		/users/profile/184740	Spanish Mustangs F.	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	The Windcross Conservancy for the Spanish Mustang in South Dakota is the most professional and organised project for the preservation of this rare and critically threatened breed of American horse today. They breed ethically - more for quality and preservation of the best bloodlines than for numbers. All horses are DNA tested to assist in the creating of the DNA database. Their programmes include internees coming from from Europe as well as the USA and along with summer tour visitors have brought the Spanish Mustang to a wider audience. Lucia Roda and all the BOD work tirelessly to make Windcross Conservancy the professional yet welcoming place it is with many horses now under saddle and used in the various programmes. This 501c is the voice for the future of the Spanish Mustang.
Windcross Conservancy	129784		/users/profile/175193	leigh-ann	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	Going to Windcross conservancy was one of the best experience of my life. i spent 7 weeks volunteering from July to September 2012 and  i am coming back in 2013 i loved it that much.  it was  my first experience with the rare Spanish mustang breed  i have fell in love with the horses and the people that are at windcross and will never forget my time there. anyone who has come to windcross falls in love with the breed so it is important that we all help to preserve this rare breed of horse. this is a very deserving and important organization and needs all the support it can get.
Windcross Conservancy	127856		/users/profile/172972	Liz_16	Donor	5	10/23/2012	I was introduced to the Spanish Mustang breed of horses because my son brought one into our lives.  Not a horse family previous to this.  I have fallen head over heels in love with this breed.  Part of my attraction is the part the Spanish Mustang has played in America's history.  This horse is America's first horse! Now endangered, we risk losing a huge and important piece of our history.  Windcross is preserving that piece of history so well in so many ways!!  I am impressed with the commitment of the board and the staff to this horse and it's history.  I especially love the 'photography weekend' where they invite professional photographers to come and work with the horses and authentic American Indians in full Indian dress and lifestyle.  The pictures are breathtaking.  The staff is offering more and more opportunities to see these horses up close and personal every year, whether by bringing the horses to people or by bringing the people to the horses.  It is on my list to visit the Conservancy soon.  This is a non profit that completely fulfills the roll and makes any donor feel as though they have done a good thing by supporting Windcross Conservancy!
St. Joseph's Indian School	306584	67	/users/profile/397852	baybarry	Donor	1	09/26/2016	My elderly father sent donations to St Joseph's Indian School for years. His dementia had deteriorated his natural perspicacity, but not, unfortunately, his ability to write checks and sign up for monthly donations.  When he died in 2014, I wrote this "charity" requesting they take him off their mailing list.  They did, but added mine. almost every month since then, I have received large envelopes full of lots of junk: tablets, note pads, post-it notes, stickers, address labels, dream catchers, greeting cards, postcards, calendars, etc., etc.  I have written back twice asking to be removed from their list, to no avail.  I do NOT give to charities who waste donations sending unsolicited crap to unlikely donors. I don't know what % of donations actually go to the kids but it must be pretty small. 
St. Joseph's Indian School	306382	24	/users/profile/397643	Barbara271	Donor	5	09/23/2016	I care  very much for the Lakota children at St. Joseph's Indian School.  Some of them were abandoned children, some had parents who had drug and alcohol issues,  some parents had no job, enough food to feed the children.  God bless the St. Joseph Indian School for all they do!   I help whenever possible through donations from time to time.  Children need to know they are not forgotten and are loved!

St. Joseph's Indian School	306362	15	/users/profile/397622	Bigh	Donor	5	09/23/2016	We orginally started donating to St Joseph's School in the 1970s and have on an off over the years. We have now started monthly donations. They have helped so many children over the years. There are so many good and honest places to donate to our there, but this is one of the best. Maybe you don't have the money to donate but St Joseph's can use box tops or labels from your cereal boxes  or soup cans etc., they can use new clothes or personal supplies for the kids.Please help.
St. Joseph's Indian School	306361	13	/users/profile/397620	tara5925	Donor	5	09/23/2016	These folks with negative comments should be ashamed.  I absolutely adore the gifts I receive, therefore, I donate.  I think it is wonderful what they do for the children.  Don't forget folks, we took the land from Indians.  Yes, some do have casinos and I am proud that they were able to do so. GOD Bless all of you for what you do for the children.  Wish I could donate more, however I am on a fixed income.  Miriam
St. Joseph's Indian School	304941	26	/users/profile/396147	MsUser	General Member of the Public	1	09/15/2016	Received a phone call from someone asking for myself and husband by name. He proceeded to thank us for our donation to the St Joseph Indian School.  We have never made this donation(he wanted to argue the fact) and he seemed to be asking for additional money. I hope that others aren't being preyed on and duped by this scam.  
St. Joseph's Indian School	303136	36	/users/profile/394289	Mickey22	General Member of the Public	1	09/09/2016	I have no problem donating to a charitable need, however when I looked St. Joseph's up I immediately saw that this organization either didn't respond to or outright declined a request from the Better Business Bureau. Why? I'm assuming it's because this charity has something to hide. Perhaps St. Joseph's is proud of the money brought in, but not exactly willing to allow an outside entity to analyze how it's being spent? This is a direct quote from the BBB. "BBB encourages charities to disclose accountability information beyond that typically included in financial statements and government filings in order to demonstrate transparency and strengthen public trust in the charitable sector." 
St. Joseph's Indian School	301547	54	/users/profile/392494	SCAMALERT	Volunteer	1	08/25/2016	THIS IS A CORRUPT ORGANIZATION THAT PREYS ON THE ELDERLY AND THOSE WITH A HEART TO HELP.  MY MOTHER IS CONSISTENTLY BOMBARDED WITH THEIR MAIL AND REQUEST FOR FUNDS AS WELL AS THEY HAVE SOLD HER NAME TO OTHER TRIBES SO THEY COULD GET IN ON THE FUND RAISING.  SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY, THIS ORGANIZATION RECEIVES SOMEWHERE AROUND $50 MILLION PLUS OR MORE SAPPING OFF YOUR FEELINGS TO HELP.  THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOW THEY HAVE AMASSED QUITE THE FORTUNE IN PROPERTY AND ASSETS YET THEY SHOW YOU PHOTOS OF POOR DESPERATE CHILDREN IN NEED.  IF THEY CAN RAISE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN ONE YEAR HOW MUCH DO YOU REALLY FEEL THERE FEW HUNDRED KIDS NEED TO OBTAIN AN EDUCATION.  THEIR ANNUAL INCOME SHOULD BE BUILDING AND DONATING TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WHAT FACILITIES WE COULD HAVE AND BUILD.  PLEASE ADVISE YOUR ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHERS ON THE SCAM THAT THIS IS.  YOU NEED YOUR MONEY MORE THAN THEY DO.  
St. Joseph's Indian School	299928	29	/users/profile/390745	Pascale M.	General Member of the Public	1	08/09/2016	I find it very offensive to name the school St. Joseph's Indian School. If you know your history, you would know why they are referred to as Indians not natives or their tribal names- story of Columbus. Also the fact that it's run by a priests?  This sounds like exploitation to me. Columbus and other settlers brought what they felt is the only true religion and forced it on the natives, then took their land, and disregarded their culture. That's a slap in the face of the natives. The catholic priest is exploiting these kids and gaining from their heritage. Please help the native children retain their culture and identity and let's stop giving to these opportunistic organizations. 
St. Joseph's Indian School	284901	54	/users/profile/374952	s.dove	Donor	3	04/06/2016	I am a recent donor to St. Joseph's Indian School, and plan to continue. www.stjo.org has the information I need to feel comfortable about financially supporting the charity. If you spend a few minutes on the website, you will find the Annual Report, Strategic Plan, Donor Bill of Rights and Communication Preferences, where you can adjust how often you are contacted. It's always a good idea to research a charity before giving, no matter how heart-tugging the appeal may be. As it stands now, St. Joseph's Indian School meets my qualifications.
St. Joseph's Indian School	282305	45	/users/profile/372444	Writer	Donor	1	03/14/2016	I visited the reservation's list of schools and couldn't find St. Joseph's Indian school.  I also noticed that like the reservation in Fort Hall, Idaho, the Indians on the reservation have built a $20 million dollar casino recently.  Because of the casino at Fort Hall, the Indians here have raised themselves out of poverty.They also have raised their self images and can't begin to say how much difference that has made in their self esteem.  They have also been able to build a great infrastructure on the reservation including new good schools.  More and more of the same Indians are now persuing college degrees and some have become lawyers.  The lawyers are now able to help the Indians at the reservation.They no longer need to send their children off the reservation to schools.  Therefore, I don't think we need to donate any money to St. Joseph's Indian School.  Also, not being able to find out exactly what St. Joseph's is doing with the money sends up a HUGE reda flag.
St. Joseph's Indian School	280153	14	/users/profile/369996	Writer	Donor	5	02/13/2016	I donate to this organization because these people so often get overlooked and they deserve every opportunity to succeed in life.
St. Joseph's Indian School	278140	90	/users/profile/368039	Writer	Donor	1	01/27/2016	I was giving to this charity for several years then looked up it's financials..  I was giving so they could heat the school of 200 kids in the cold winter.. Then I looked at the financial statement..  They raise $67M a year and have $145M in the bank for 200 kids..  And they have Catholic priests run the place.  God save them.    THe foodbank that feeds everyone in my state doesn't have as much money.  They are shameful.http://www.stjo.org/site/DocServer/Annual_Report.pdf?docID=1761Jon
St. Joseph's Indian School	273979	65	/users/profile/363298	Writer	Donor	1	12/08/2015	this place is a huge scam. they do not care one bit about the money you send. my mother in law used to send these people money until we got ahold of her finances. i told them to stop sending me their ridculous info after seeing the expose about their kickbacks from the company that makes the crap they send. they told me they will keep me in their system for 3 months, even though i will not send them a dime. they know this and will not even try to stop this stuff from coming to me. if they do, they do not get their kickbacka complete joke of a charitynow they sold my info to another scam of a charity and they are sending me stuff!!! like i said, they care nothing about the school or kids, only the kickbacks for the crap they send.
St. Joseph's Indian School	273830	71	/users/profile/363112	davehallmd	General Member of the Public	2	12/05/2015	Like perhaps most of you I'm a generous non-profit supporter who gets St Joseph's Indian School mailings. Check out the CNN report. It tells the complicated story of this school with happy-looking children,  generic student pleas for help, and a $30 million fundraising budget. I've chosen not to donate.http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/17/us/south-dakota-indian-school-fundraising-investigation/
St. Joseph's Indian School	273609	36	/users/profile/362866	Fenix	Donor	5	12/02/2015	I've donated here for many years and while never a visitor there, I have asked friends to stop in and check them out.  Universal praise for the children and persons they met there and the apparent good work they try to do.  A skeptic as well, I've looked into these many "gifts" and courtesy phone calls.  Apparently some organizations donate the gifts as their contribution in lieu of cash; other cover mailing and phone fees.  Clearly from the School's follow-up activities, this is a very well-managed organization...far better than most others I've donated to.  I wish they'd better conform to rated organizations (Charity Navigator's screens for example) but for my money, theirs is a worthwhile exempt charity to donate to.    
St. Joseph's Indian School	273131	37	/users/profile/362323	Steven55	Donor	3	11/30/2015	I also have been receiving the "free gifts" asking for a donation - I have donated for several years but an skeptical.  Seems as though I'm not the only one as I was thinking I was - not sure what to do - I don't need the gifts - save the money on printing all this stuff.
St. Joseph's Indian School	272237	65	/users/profile/361240	DukeCherokee	General Member of the Public	1	11/17/2015	I have donated many years to this organization.  They keep sending me 'junk' that I don't want/need...stickers, note pads, cards, address labels, dream catchers, etc...a lot of money could be saved if they would stop this practice and instead spend it on the children, etcUntil I see a full financial statement disclosed I am stopping my contributions.
St. Joseph's Indian School	271796	100	/users/profile/360691	K.E.	General Member of the Public	1	11/11/2015	Does this Catholic "non-profit" even need donations????  St. Joseph's has over $122 million in assets!  Yet it raises over $50 million per year in donations, but spends less than 60% of funds on services.   If 60% ($30 million) is actually spent to support the 200 Native American children at the school, each child's annual support is $150,000!!! St. Joseph's will not report to Give.org.  (Better Business Bureau).  I give to reputable charities who disclose their donations and expenses to the public at Give.org, Charity Navigator, or similar outside agencies and where over 80% of funds raised go to actual services.   St. Joseph's spends 30% on fundraising, mailing fat packets to potential donors.  Do donors really want $15 million per year (30% of $50 million) to support direct mail companies?!  The 2015 packet I received contains a Windcatcher (made in China), 3 Christmas cards, an Advent calendar, Christmas gift tags, Christmas stationery seals, 2016 calendar, personalized Certificate of Appreciation, personalized address labels,  large notepad and small notepad.  Personally, I'd rather see the money spent on books and educational supplies for the children. Also, even though 50% of the students are NOT Catholic, the administration acknowledges that " we do make our kids go to mass on Sunday."  OUTRAGE!  How is this different from the indoctrination of the 1920's, forcing Native American children to learn the "white man's religion?" Hope more people will investigate before giving.SEE:  http://www.give.org/charity-reviews/national/american-indian/st-josephs-indian-school-and-missions-in-chamberlain-sd-675SEE:  http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/17/us/south-dakota-indian-school-fundraising-investigation/SEE:  http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=1209  
St. Joseph's Indian School	270120	64	/users/profile/358844	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	10/30/2015	I have also done research and am VERY concerned about this organization.  I see reviews here that folks who donate say that the school is  doing a great job with the kids and to trust them.  Fine.  But why can they not be open about their finances?  What have they  to hide? The simple financial calculations are these:  They raise $50 million a year or more per year through their mass mailings.  They have 200 kids  in their school.  At the finest boarding schools in the country  tuition tops  out in the $40,000 range with all the perks.  That  means that that they should be able to run this school for $8million.  If they spend half  of what  they receive on mailing materials and postage that would be $25 million to the advertising companies.  That the still leaves 17  million per year unaccounted for. Bottom line:  This is clearly a scam.
St. Joseph's Indian School	259638	51	/users/profile/348154	JB_42	General Member of the Public	1	09/25/2015	I looked into this charity, saw that there are no ratings from multiple charity rating organizations that I hold in high esteem, so there is no breakdown of their financials (religious organization that doesn't need to disclose this) and how they spend their donations/fund raising.  Also found this : http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/17/us/south-dakota-indian-school-fundraising-investigation/ Make your own decision.  Based on all this information, I personally will not donate to them.
St. Joseph's Indian School	256916	62	/users/profile/345316	nibor	General Member of the Public	1	09/13/2015	I would simply like to ask this question:  How much did it cost this organization to send me a donation request that contained ALL of the following items:  a pen, notepad, calendar, 3 cellophane-wrapped greeting cards with envelopes, a dream catcher (presumably made in China or Taiwan) with a color-printed legend enclosed, gold embossed self-adhesive personalize address labels, personalized "checks" in specific donation amounts, and a beautifully embossed gold-trimmed certificate of appreciation for my financial support - which I have not yet given???   If that's how this organization  spends its public donation money, I'm appalled.
St. Joseph's Indian School	250723	67	/users/profile/338610	SlowTraveler	Donor	5	07/30/2015	I have been a donor to this organization for 15 years. It came to my attention when I visited the Akta Lakota Museum at the same location, passing through the school grounds on my way. I have made numerous visits since then. What I see on these visits are bright, healthy, happy children, learning in a safe and positive environment. It is clear to me that the school is doing a wonderful job. Regarding some of the criticisms I see here, I'd like to make these comments: 1) I agree that they send way too many mailings. I wish they'd cut back.2) Having said that, I think their overall expenditures are appropriate. I spent the largest part of my career (34 years) as a budget analyst and accountant for an educational institution. St. Joseph's expenses are well in line with what I'd expect to see.3) One person remarked on the "threatening" tone of one solicitation. Having grown up next to a Reservation (Onandaga) in upstate New York, and having seen the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations myself, I can attest to poverty which must indeed have led to difficult circumstances for some of these students. 4) One post suggested that positive reviews must be concocted by people associated with the charity. I have no association other than being a donor, and never have had any association other than being a donor and a visitor.  All in all, I'm delighted to continue to support this fine organization. 
St. Joseph's Indian School	247795	29	/users/profile/335422	mscatmar	Donor	5	07/08/2015	I have donated to this charity for years. Just yesterday, I received a very nice telephone call from the school thanking me for all the years I've supported them. I have never received and "gifts" or other such items from them. I believe they are an honest, worthwhile charity. They are helping children who would otherwise be left behind.
St. Joseph's Indian School	235374	51	/users/profile/318796	Wasaka	Donor	2	12/12/2014	Last year was the first year I received a letter with several 'free gifts" requesting a donation to the school. Having just been hospitalized, I was particularly cognizant of my resources. Our family gives alternate gifts: there a wheelchairs made from bicycles in India and Africa; students in this country in Youth Build getting a new start: completing a HS diploma or GED plus training apprenticeships in trades, nursing; Doctors Without Boarders and Heifer Project-each given in honor of a family member. I seriously considered St. Joseph's since I've been adopted into a Lakota Sioux family and am now Winyan Wasaka [strong woman], that is until a received a second letter from the chaplain which I sensedto be unusually threatening because I had not responded to the initial letter. Further research revealedwhat other persons about their accounting practices.  I've chosen to give me limited resources to another Native American project this year.

It seems the only money they are spending is on their own salaries. The children in the commercials are actors. They are another company who's primary purpose is to make more money and give themselves bigger salaries. I would not send them a dime.

After so many negative comments the positive ones just do not seem real.  I would imagine that it is the staff or Board of Directors person making the comments in hopes of defusing some of the negative aura of the whole place. I will not give to an organization that will not remove you after repeated attempts to be removed.

St. Joseph's Indian School	196308	81	/users/profile/256628	bikefan31	Donor	1	03/24/2014	I started donating a few years ago because I thought they were doing a good service to the Indian community.  I have since then received tons of unsolicitated junk...dream catcher, lousy blankets etc...  When I found out that they go all the way to solicitating donations from my family in Europe, I realized that very little of what I donated goes to the cause.  I stopped donating about 5 yrs ago but still regularly receive junk from them.  I suggest you look them up and.....send your money somewhere else!  This organization is definitely not worth receiving donations!
St. Joseph's Indian School	195663	65	/users/profile/255844	Janivon	General Member of the Public	2	03/14/2014	According to the BBB, this organization does not meets its Standards for Charity Accountability. http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/national/american-indian/st-josephs-indian-school-and-missions-in-chamberlain-sd-675/all I've given to them in the past, and figure they probably help some kids, but according to the its consolidated audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the organization spent $30,278,951 or 57% of its total expenses ($53,021,662) on program service activities.  So only about 30% of the income actually went to help the program/kids.
St. Joseph's Indian School	193039	62	/users/profile/252122	Sycamore	Donor	1	01/23/2014	We also have received numerous extravagant give packets from St. Joseph's Indian School. Although we made a small donation once long ago, we will not do so again. This last gift packet was the last straw. It included a  form "letter" from a  child at the school (obviously written by an adult) which blatantly says the child's home and family would not be a safe place to live. Here is the actual wording of the form letter: "Dear Ms.________, Things are so fun here at St. Joe's. I like the other girls, we giggle at each other all day. I asked my teacher if I could write you and tell you about the school. My name is Stacy. I'm 12.  Anyway, I've only been at St. Joe's for a couple of months. I's so warm and safe, not like my house on the reservation. School's awesome. I have lots of things to do and read. I really, really, like the science project I'm doing with Tasha and Tommy. The food is good here. What I enjoy most is the campus home I share with 11 other girls and my houseparents. My bed is so comfortable. I know I don't have anything to worry about when I go to sleep! "Well I have to go now but I'll pray for you when I pray for my mom, my sister and my uncle. And thanks a lot!  Love, Stacy"  I wonder if the children's families know what is being said about them. We find this unconscionable. That, and the lavish gifts intended to solicit by guilt. The money used for these mailings could benefit the Lakota people and their children and their families deserve more respect than this.

They are completely outside of some of the best practices for 'savvy donors':http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=419 According to 'The Non-Profit Times', "The average American believes that a charity should spend no more than 23 percent on overhead but that charities actually spend 36.9 cents on the dollar."http://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news-articles/survey-charities-should-spend-23-on-overhead/ If they don't report anything, how do we know how they use the donations??? I want to check out any charities, before I blindly donate to them.

I just want my donations to go where they are most effective......
St. Joseph's Indian School	109900	25	/users/profile/149687	ecochuck	Donor	4	04/15/2012	  I did some research and found that South Dakota has 7 of the 10 poorest counties in the US! ( http://www.onjinjinkta.com/native/reservationindex.html )       Note: Since they're  a religious organization (St Joseph's) they're not evaluated by 'Charity Navigator'  ( http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?keyword_list=st+joseph%27s+indian+school&Submit2=GO&bay=search.results )     I carefully select what organizations I donate to and feel that this one deserves my contribution. 
St. Joseph's Indian School	151179	38	/users/profile/201754	Eagle01	Donor	1	03/16/2013	REgardless of whether they are religious or not, if they want more donors they need to be more trnasparent with a 3rd party audit for how much money (percent) goes to the people they are helping.Old data suggests that they are very self serving with 34-55% going to the people they want  to help. This nobel group needs to make significant improvements.
St. Joseph's Indian School	150675	124	/users/profile/200929	Mac B.	Donor	1	03/07/2013	A few days ago, I received an extravagant packet from this organization, including return address stickers, notepads, a dreamcatcher keychain, and more. Never having heard of nor received an solicitations from this organization before, I considered making a donation until I started checking them out. The only info I could find was from the American Institute of Philanthropy (AIP) (http://www.charitywatch.org/articles/not-accountable-not-commandment.html), which had info only from audited statements of 2004. These showed that St. Joseph's Indian School used roughly 34% of its budget on programs that directly benefited those whom it purports to help. Based on this info, AIP awarded them an F rating, noting that the majority of the organization's donations are used for fund-raising.  Armed with this knowledge, my decision to donate or not became quite easy, because I refuse to contribute to any organization that uses such a paltry portion of its donations to actually help people.
St. Joseph's Indian School	147975	43	/users/profile/195833	richkenn	Donor	1	01/11/2013	Less than 55% of this charity's money is returned in services.  They do not regularly disclose their financial statements.  It is impossible to be removed from their mailing list (after 18 months of asking!). To me they are clearly a direct marketing machine that primarily feeds the administrative staff of the charity and not the children they contend to support.  Find another place to put your money.
St. Joseph's Indian School	118214	41	/users/profile/61853	summer storm	Donor	5	07/12/2012	We have been donating to St. Joe's for about 30 years.  The staff is extraordinary...really giving of themselves to make the kids there stronger.  We visit a minimum of once a year, most often twice and we feel priviledged to be able to see how well the kids are cared for.  They accept very little federal money, so they need all of us to help donate...it does take a village...every little bit helps.
St. Joseph's Indian School	110353	6	/users/profile/150228	rockin	General Member of the Public	5	04/20/2012	This charity rocks!! They deal with poor kids and that's great
St. Joseph's Indian School	57389	35	/users/profile/60606	Wildflower Seeds	Donor	5	11/19/2010	I have been a supporter of St. Joseph's Indian School for 3 years now; I always receive a thank you for my donation, along with updates on the children, and the community. I receive invitations to important functions in SD as well as MD and greetings throughout the year. They really make you feel as though you are truly making a difference for them. USPS has different sized shipping boxes for one price, I frequently send items to SD that are easily purchased at your local value store like individual hygiene items, blankets, sheets, clothes,  toys, etc. etc.. I am a thrifty shopper and many have been the times that I have found name brand clearance items; at high end stores to fill a box.  If you truly want to feel as though you are making a difference in a childs life or a community; St. Josephs Indian School is the place for you!  
Tipi Raisers	314086		/users/profile/405444	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/24/2016	Experiencing the Lakota Tribe with Tipi Raisers was a remarkable experience. Exceptional planning and execution, meaningful education, and personal interaction with tribe members made for an unforgettable and life-changing experience. This was a unique blend of humanitarian service with first-hand cultural exposure. Thank you to Tipi Raisers for an incredible week! 
Tipi Raisers	310481		/users/profile/401831	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2016	During my 10+ years working in international development, I have evaluated hundreds of development organizations regarding their financial and social impact and suitability for additional funding. I was thoroughly impressed with how Dave and his team approached working with the local Pine Ridge Lakota population. I felt a genuine desire from Tipi Raisers to help our group gain an appreciation for the challenging historical, cultural, economic, spiritual context the Lakota people are living in. I left the project with a strong desire to get to know the Lakota culture and traditions better and find ways to establish meaningful connections with them. Thanks Tipi Raisers for an amazing experience and I hope to join you again in the near future on other worthwhile projects.
Tipi Raisers	310291		/users/profile/401641	kmatosich	Volunteer	5	10/13/2016	We had a tremendously memorable and impactful week with Tipi Raisers -- and I am confident that the positive impacts accrued more to us than the people we came to help. Our activities spanned working closely with a specific family to address their acute needs, attending multiple cultural activities that exposed us and endeared us to the Lakota people and culture, as well as a lot of fun.I had the opportunity to bring my oldest son with me on the trip and he definitely feels that it is one of the more meaningful experiences he has had in his life. He wants to go back and as my children become old enough to meaningfully assist in the work that needs to be done, I would like to involve my entire family in repeated projects with Tipi Raisers. 
Tipi Raisers	310050		/users/profile/401399	seanathan	Volunteer	5	10/12/2016	The trip with the Tipi Raiser was truly an amazing experience and one that I will hold dear for a long time to come.  I went on the trip with the intent to provide service to an under-served community but left having gained so much more from spending time with the people, learning about their culture and soaking up the incredible landscape.  I got to say it's hard to beat a horse back ride on the open terrain overlooking the reservation.
Tipi Raisers	309743		/users/profile/346469	davasthi5	Volunteer	5	10/11/2016	Tipi Raisers has created a volunteer experience that enables participants to work with their minds and hands to experience a deep cultural exchange with the Lakota Native Americans. Tipi Raisers was very flexible and accommodating in working with our volunteer group to maximize our experience. We met a handful of community leaders both young and old, built a few significantly impactful things for a family, had some traditional Native food, and experienced several unique cultural experiences. When you leave this volunteer experience, you'll have built stronger relationships and created a lifetime memory. 
Tipi Raisers	294759	3	/users/profile/385509	mack.wb	Volunteer	5	07/05/2016	There are few times in life when a single place or group of people will positively change who you are in the short course of a week. Pine Ridge changed my perspective on the world, and Tipi Raisers provided the means to spend time at Pine Ridge, the space for meaningful reflection, and the opportunity for action. Society has a tendency to filter history into its most digestible and anecdotal form. Even within the progressive curriculum of my high school, my experience of American history was grossly dominated by the eurocentric white mans perspective. Huge historical events were often summarized into less shocking forms that made them seem like fairy tales, with each obstacle or tragedy portrayed as a hump in the road on the way to more power. Although I will never fully understand what the Lakota people have been through, and continue to go through, nor the strength it takes to overcome the adversity they face, I left Pine Ridge knowing that American history is not a determined narrative made to fit in the thousand pages of a text book. Our history is a web of stories and tragedies that come together to create the human experience, the Native American experience, the American experience. There is no one history. After hearing stories of the Lakota people first hand, it was easy to resort to an instinctual feeling of guilt for what the American government has done, and continues to do to Native American people. But as I continued to build relationships, listen to the elders, and hear stories from the Lakota youth, it became apparent that Lakotas are not sharing their history for the purposes of making white Americans feel ashamed. Lakota stories need to be told because they hold the inherent truth that all humans are related, and in that realization is the intangible power to create a humane world of compassion. From Inipi on the first night, to listening to Basil Braveheart speak, to shouting into the badlands desert, the amount of compassion and love on Pine Ridge and from the people there is incredible, and I think (at least in part) it rubbed off on me. Even now that I have left Pine Ridge, what I learned there and the idea that all humans are related, is constantly on my mind. Going on a trip to Pine Ridge should be a mandatory fee of being an American citizen. It fundamentally changed how I look at the world, how I look at other people, and how I handle the responsibility of being an American. Tipi Raisers gave great context to the power of our experiences, and I would not have had the takeaways I did without the support of Dave and the organization. I plan on returning to Pine Ridge many times in the future. 
Tipi Raisers	287441	1	/users/profile/377538	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/27/2016	Going on the trip with Tipi rasiers was one of the most helpful and educational experiences of my life. I met amazing people and had experiences that will change my life forever. I leared more about myself society and the Pine Ridge reservation then I could have ever dreamed. I also very much enjoyed the importance of my presence in Pine Ridge. Overall the best experience of my life and it was all thanks to Tipi Raisers. 
Tipi Raisers	285884		/users/profile/375921	Writer	Volunteer	4	04/14/2016	The leader of Tipi Raisers, is such a kind and thoughtful person. He puts so much into the non-profit. The leader has the audacity to knock on strangers' doors and ask if they need help. These are the kinds of things that are indicative of the kind of person the leader is. In addition, Tipi Raisers really showed our group such a diverse portrait of Pine Ridge. In terms of volunteer projects, I felt like I was really helping contributing particularly when our group painted a resident's walls which were extremely filthy. By far one of the greatest week's of my life! Tipi Raisers fell short of providing our group with a full and complete picture of the reservation becasue, for example, we did not see where the president of the reservation lives or see the casinos. 
Tipi Raisers	285719		/users/profile/375734	Menachem P.	Volunteer	5	04/12/2016	I had the most profound experience in South Dakota on a trip that was organized through the Tipi Raisers. Through their efforts we were able to meet with locals throughout the Pine Ridge Reservation to learn of the Lakota's history, culture, and present conditions. It would not have been possible if the Tipi Raisers (Dave!) were not there to help us in accessing the community. Thank you for an unforgettable experience!-Menachem
Tipi Raisers	285607		/users/profile/375608	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/11/2016	Incredible learning experience. I can honestly say that I have grown immensely because of Tipi Raisers and the program they ran. They were also incredibly flexible with our religious observances such as kosher, shabbat, etc. 
Tipi Raisers	285228		/users/profile/375208	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/07/2016	We thoroughly enjoyed working with The Tipi Raisers! We went to Pine Ridge to learn, work, and interact with the Lakota community. Dave was extremely accommodating, responsive, and help and arranged a number of educational and cultural opportunities. I'd recommend The Tipi Raisers to any college group looking for a meaningful and unique Alternative Break experience.
Tipi Raisers	270877		/users/profile/359623	jdreiman1	Volunteer	5	11/02/2015	This organization is amazing! Our trip went on without a hitch and we all saw the great work that Tipi Raisers is doing.
Tipi Raisers	269857	2	/users/profile/358593	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	Tipi Raisers is accomplishing what others have failed at; to realize a vision and a venue for homes, jobs and dignity on Pine Ridge through trust and hard work with the Lakota Sioux.  This non profit is generous and heartfelt and sincerely wishes to lift up and honor our Native American brothers and sisters.
Tipi Raisers	269535		/users/profile/358260	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	One of the best experiences of my entire life, and it would not have been possible without the Tipi Raisers.  Looking forward to working with them in the future! :)
Tipi Raisers	269140	1	/users/profile/357868	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	Awesome non profit. The weekend we spent with Tipi Raisers on the Pine Ridge reservation was transformative for all stakeholders. As a school counselor I am afforded many opportunities to work with different non-profit organizations. Tipi Raisers is hands down the best organization I have come across in my 18 years  is this field. Dave and his team know what they are doing. 
Tipi Raisers	268701		/users/profile/357431	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/28/2015	Thank you so much for everything that you are doing. The past weekend experience is something I will remember though out my life.  I'm happy to be part of this organization.

Through a variety of collaborative projects,  The Tipi Raisers strive to build alliances and strengthen communities for people both on and off the reservation.  
Tipi Raisers	261445		/users/profile/350055	Meghan T.	Volunteer	5	10/03/2015	Such a wondeful organization that works with the Lakota tribe on Pine Ridge and students from Colorado. From raising money for projects to building things the Lakota people need. 
Tipi Raisers	261441		/users/profile/350050	blancajoya1026	Volunteer	5	10/03/2015	I went with my church group to Pine Ridge in October, and we were there for a week. We were there to rebuild homes but, my experience was so much more than that. David,  the director along with Lakota elders made sure we learned about their culture. We were part of an Inipi ceremony, we went horseback riding, and we're lucky enough to experience The Badlands. I hope I get a chance to go back to Pine Ridge in the near future and see all the wonderful people I met.

Tipi Raisers	242062		/users/profile/328784	eagm	Volunteer	5	05/03/2015	I spent a week with the Tipi Raisers on the Pine Ridge Reservation.  Their connectedness to the Lakota, enabled them to expose us to their traditions & spirituality in insightful and reverent ways.  The information and interactions changed me.   It increased my admiration for the Lakota way of life and my respect for their fight to retain and pass it on to future generations.  It was definitely time well spent

Not only is the message 100% on point but nothing is so believeable nor so persuasive when it comes from a person with a developmental disability. "If I can do it, you can too!"
Break Through Inc.	54320		/users/profile/55569	beverly6	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2010	I enjoyed his workshop at an early childhood conference on special needs children. Very motivating for me and he gave me sense that I can now help my students.

Break Through Inc.	54176		/users/profile/54156	ben6	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2010	In 1978 I had a dream about helping people to knock down walls about their disability.  I am very pleased this day to be able to travel and sit down with folks on a one-to-one basis and talk to them about my disability. Many times I find out they have a hidden disability and they talk about being made fun of and being misunderstood. After we get done they realize that they are not alone in that everybody has a "disability" and we must educate others not to prejudge. It has been my honor to be able to serve in this capacity as an educator to help the general public to realize that people with disabilities have gifts and talents.  They are people first. My wife Dee and I thank all that read this and the many people that have supported us with Break Through Inc. for these past 32 years.
Break Through Inc.	54163		/users/profile/55361	tom123skidoo	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2010	I happened to attend a conference for parents of children who had disabilities in North Dakota.  I was impressed by the person who was talking about his experiences growing up in the 1960's when his disability was little understood by the educational system and general public.  His name is Ben Anderson and he is part of this Break Through non-profit.  I would love to hear him again. His story was very educating and it left me with a better understanding about disabilities and mostly about the people that are sometimes left by the wayside and not befriended because of misconceptions about their disability.
Break Through Inc.	54030		/users/profile/55207	padmacr	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2010	Ben was a guest lecturer in my graduate level SPED professional and family partnership class. His life story completely mesmerized my students. Many of my students later told me that Ben's story more than moved them - it changed them. Ben taught my graduate students something that classes filled with textbooks could not - how to walk in the shoes of a thriving individual who has spent a live time with a disability.
Break Through Inc.	53915		/users/profile/55074	maya1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/29/2010	I met Ben at a National Paraeducator Conference in Salt Lake City, UT.  He is just an amazing guy and with all of his struggles through his life he has created this great non profit and tool for others to learn.  But not only for other adults to learn but a tool to teach with.I might work with students who might not get what Ben is doing but we have helpers in the classroom that do.  I love using his story to help them understand you don't pity those in my classroom and you never under estimate them either.I think every teacher should read his book and hear him speak.  Being part of the Special Needs area I strongly feel it should be a requirement.
Break Through Inc.	53820		/users/profile/54961	judiben9	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2010	Ben has been a long family friend and educator for over 20 years.  Through the years we have worked closely with Ben sharing stories and experiances.  He has a wonderful way of educating children and adults through sharing his years of gathered information and knowledge.

Break Through Inc.	53795		/users/profile/54934	shaina1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2010	I met Ben about 30 years ago when I began teaching.  We had Special Education in common.  He with disabilities and I facing day to day teaching of regular 5th graders who needed more understanding for disabled children in our class, school and community.  Ben was gracious to come to my classroom each year and talk to my students about the struggles he had in school. He answered any question they had about disabilities and his disability.  He won them over with his wit and frank talk. He gave the students ideas for helping, connecting and seeing each other as equals.  I still hear from students who remember "Benny" and his message of Good Will.

Break Through Inc.	53706		/users/profile/54850	2nels	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2010	In my early work, as a counselor and program developer with the Regional Mental Health and Retardation Center in Grand Forks, N.D. I met Ben.  I found him to be a determined and energetic young man with a vision to overcome the limitations of his cerebral palsy, some at a physical everyday level and others dictated by public and professional impressions.  I soon realized that Ben had the intelligence and drive to make a real and positive impact in the field of developmental disabilities.  Very soon he was making contact with groups and individuals in churches, schools and other locations.  He provided encouragement to those with disabilities and their family members and provided education to professionals and to the general public.  His message was one that helped open doors to persons with disabilities, while breaking through the stereotypes that many people held on to.  One of the services he provided was his involvement in early ground work in setting up a drop-in center in Grand Forks, N.D. for people with disabilities.  In a recent contact a professional in Grand Forks I learned that the drop-in center is still operating and doing well.  After having contact with Ben and Dee, in recent years, I have seen the success that they have achieved.  I have witnessed the positive impact they are having, with Ben's fellow members on the Governor's Rehabilitation Council in Madison, Wi; with Dee's fine assistance in organizational aspects; and with the respect they have garnered in northern Wisconsin.  It is refreshing to see them respond to calls for their involvement in events throughout the country.  This program is an important one and Ben and Dee have grown with the times, through taking the initiative to obtain the training and education they need to carry this out.  They have worked as a team to provide a needed service.

Break Through Inc.	53550		/users/profile/54689	jennifer63	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2010	I hired this organizaton to come and speak to the community service providers and others about disability and what the impact really is for the individual and the family. The message delivered was clear, meaningful, and inspirational. Because they have actually walked in the shoes of disability they are able to speak in a strong and specific voice when talking about the needs, dreams and ambitions of individuals with disabilities.I have attended classes tought at other events by Ben and walked away with a deeper and more meaningful understandin of both my work and the child I am raising. (she also has a disability) The books written by Ben through Break Through Inc, have been a wonderful tool in the work in our community. Recently one of our schools adopted it as part of their curriculum!
Break Through Inc.	52718		/users/profile/53690	pinckney	Board Member	5	09/17/2010	I worked closely with Ben for the first ten years of Break Through Inc.  As co-presenter or observer, I have seen him present on many occasions.  He really "delivers the goods" in that he tells his story in a sometimes humorous, impactful, and spellbinding fashion, as other reviews will attest.  While his work is helpful to all ages, his presentations appear to have a particularly strong effect with younger adults who have not heard the story of a person with a disability told so personally and dramatically.  In addition, his insight-producing consulting and in-service presentations have helped adults learn how to work in more effective and respectful ways with persons with disabilities.  He's an effective and dynamic professional in the field of disabilities education and training.
Break Through Inc.	51642	2	/users/profile/52366	hollyrs	General Member of the Public	5	09/03/2010	I work for a company that is a website for persons with disabilities. Last year I had the opportunity to meet, through our website, Ben and Dee Anderson and our organization purchased a few copies of his book to give out at our holiday giveaway. I also bought one for myself, because I was intrigued with his story and wanted to learn more. I was very moved by the book that I read and the journey this wonderful person had undertaken. I loved the fact that the book was written in such a manner that you felt you were almost just having a conversation with Ben about his experiences. Because of his "no airs" approach I really feel it is a story that anyone could relate to. You can't help but want to cheer Ben on through the obstacles that he has faced. I have the utmost respect for individuals who rise above adversity with this determined spirit to want to reach out and help others, and I only hope I am fortunate enough to meet Ben and Dee in person some day.

You have simply taught me, that every human being plays a vital role in making this world a better place and that God uses all of us to bring His Kingdom to light in this world. Ben you have changed my family in a way that has given my four daughters a passion and heart for the physically challenged. One is in a full time profession with the physically/emotionally challenged because of your friendship. Keep up the fantastic work,David W.

Break Through Inc.	51573	5	/users/profile/52290	patrice3	General Member of the Public	5	09/02/2010	In June of 2008, our oldest daughter (then 12) came home from a week at Camp Lutherhaven in Coeur dAlene, Idaho.  She had learned a new word during her week away at camp: "disability." It's not that she was unfamiliar with the term, of course, but more that she'd never given it much thought.  We have a close friend confined to a wheelchair, but as is the nature of children, our daughter always just sort of "accepted" the fact that our friend can't walk, and never looked further. But then she heard Mr. Ben Anderson of Break Through, Inc. speak at camp, and was deeply impressed by what was said.  She talked about the presentation for weeks, and still mentions it to this day (two years later).  The topic was reinforced by her camp counselor that year who used a walker, despite her young age.  Our daughter came home with a much more mature understanding of human nature and the ability to see limitations as gifts and opportunities.I applaud Mr. Andersons efforts to increase awareness of the potential of those with disabilities by his campaign to teach those who may not have had much prior experience with disabilities.
Break Through Inc.	51563	3	/users/profile/52278	edtalk	Board Member	5	09/02/2010	It has been my pleasure to be associated with Break Through.  Director Ben Anderson is able to be particularly helpful to everyone needing to know more about disability awareness.  His presentations come from his own life experience as a person born with cerebral palsy.  Ben's courageous perserverence in education accomplished a BS in Vocational Rehabilition, which puts him in a unique position to help our culture with understanding and direction.
Break Through Inc.	51476	3	/users/profile/52170	dewl	Board Member	5	09/01/2010	Break Through Inc. is a non-profit organization providing educational workshops and media for and about people with disabilities.  It was founded in 1980 in Minnesota by Ben D. Anderson who was born with cerebral palsy. I have traveled with Ben D. Anderson and have heard him speak and give workshops and presentations to parents, educators, young students and the general public around the U.S.  The organization provides a positive and supportive educational forum for advocacy and inclusion for people with special needs. I was enthused the first time I heard him present a full day of workshops- so much so that a year after (when he proposed to me) I married him and we have been married for almost 5 years now.  He and his organization is the heart and soul of inclusion and education.

They have created an environment that ecourages and accepts all who participate in the many different programs they offer. Michelle, Rick, and all the teachers we have encountered give 110%. The small community the center serves has always struggled and the last year has been a tough one. The center is a warm,comfortable oasis that on any given day(or evening) will find an assortment of people of all ages learning, sharing,and enjoying the many services they provide.The center has improved the quality of our familys' life this past year by opening the door to the beauty of music for our daughters. They have experienced the fun and excitement of learning to play and perform musical instruments as well as giving back to the community in some small way. The atmosphere of the center is one that even an eleven year old boy wants to experience! The center is a vibrant part of the community and very much an example of why ART is the heART of a community.
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	9389	9	/users/profile/11195	Scottie and Beck	Client Served	5	08/20/2009	In my opinion, the Sturgis Center for the Arts fills a need in our community that no other organization has been able to do.  From the preschool art discovery classes that my son participated in to the painting classes that my mother participated in to Spanish lessons to tutoring to music lessons, the Center seems to have activities and events for every interest and every age group.  Michelle is very community-oriented, even offering to let me use their space for free to teach my yoga classes.  In this small town where most kids used to have the excuse of having nothing to do, the Sturgis Center for the Arts is turning things around, offering positive, creative, educational, and fun experiences for people of all ages.
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	9099	10	/users/profile/10893	Anne	General Member of the Public	5	08/13/2009	I've been involved with the Sturgis Center for the Arts since its opening as a student, as a performer, and as a member of the public.  As an older adult, it was wonderful for me to be in an art class together with young children and explore different ways of expressing ourselves.  I also participated in guitar and writing workshops with adults.  As a storyteller performing at the Center, I appreciate how well Michelle, Rick, and the volunteers set up the sound system, arrange the space, and attract the audience.  They go out of their way to decorate for special occasions.  As a member of the public I've come for art shows, book discussions, to hear Lakota speakers, to sit in on Friday night jams, and to just hang out.  I love seeing the latest projects on the walls and tables and always feel welcome.  Many of the other comments have mentioned how great a place this is for kids.  It's very comfortable for adults as well.
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	9096	9	/users/profile/10888	Music Lady	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/13/2009	I serve as one of the instructors at Sturgis Center for the Arts.  Never have I enjoyed such a musically and artistic atmosphere!  Michelle and Rick have done a wonderful job of setting up this center and promoting the enrichment of music.   They are so supportive of everyone, young or old.  The students enjoy taking lessons at SCA where there is every music book and instrument they can imagine right there at their fingertips.  There is plenty of opportunity to learn to play together or as a soloist.  It is a safe place to come and hang out, and jam like so many kids yearn for.
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	9074	12	/users/profile/10861	Erica Merchant	Former Volunteer	5	08/13/2009	Sturgis Center for the Arts is the only organization in the city of Sturgis that promotes integrity of its citizens for the sole purpose of enrichment.  Michelle, Rick and all the volunteers have provided opportunities that people of all ages would never have been given without their vision of an arts community.  What hatched the Sturgis Center for the Arts was when Michelle tried to enroll her daughter in a local music class, she was denied enrollment because the daughter was a child. This prompted Michelle to open an art facility that allowed anyone who wants to enrich their lives access to these resources.  This story stands  testament to the personal investment in community that Michelle felt was her responsibility when she suffered the rejection by a stagnant and selective 'community arts program.'  I have worked with numerous art centers offering workshops and classes, Sturgis Center for the Arts was the only one to offer such a wide variety of music classes.  Many at risk teens have found dedication in the music community built by this Center. Opportunities provided by the Center's open mic nights, battle of the bands, and Bike Art and Music (BAM) festivals provide confidence and a variety of mentors in a variety of genres.

Activities that I have enjoyed there include: a weekly preschool art class which I took my 4 year old grandson to, Halloween storytelling by the Black Hills Storytellers,introductory painting for adults, and, most recently, teaching Spanish for the summer enrichment program as well as tutoring reading. All who enter the Center feel warmly accepted and broaden their horizons.

Rick and Michele Grocek had a vision and they didn't give up until they reached their goal of establishing an Art Center in Sturgis.  Their leadership and dedication is an inspiration to me to keep working on a plan to see the Center grow.  So many lives have been enriched through the Center.  It is truly a blessing for our town.
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	8890	8	/users/profile/10663	cindy miller	Client Served	5	08/08/2009	The Sturgis Center for The Arts is an amazing place that brings such a diverse population together with a common denominator- an interest in the Arts.  All with a pleasant and welcoming aura.  What a wonderful place for people of all ages!!Our son utilized their guitar lessons, sold an amp and participated in many "open jam" sessions.  They also went out of their way to help them start a band, even going so far as to help with T-shirt sponsorship and so much more. I was able to take a group of teenagers to a community meeting, where they spoke about their passion for the Center for the Arts and discovered what advocating meant, and were so hopeful that a new building would be acquired.  They also volunteered during the rally to move all of the equipment, which instilled in them a sense of community.Recently the Board I serve on (Piedmont Park Board) was able to partner with them for their BAM (Bike and Music)festival providing a place for the bikes to unload.  Hopefully next year we can give them a greater send off!!
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	8875	8	/users/profile/10648	Nancy Vencill	General Member of the Public	5	08/08/2009	The Sturgis Center for the Arts has been a wonderful place for children of all ages.  At anytime during the day, one might see piano lessons, watercolor art lessons, ukelele group sessions, charcoal sketching, pottery, or  people gathered around sharing their lives with others. The teachers are caring and considerate of the children and adults that they teach. Tony Hill built a banjo and learned to play so he could teach my son to play. Michelle and Rick encourage good behavior in the children and young adults that like to "hang out" at the Art Center. They allow creative freedoms coupled with thoughtfulness of others. Keep up the great work--Sturgis Center for the Arts.  Your work and investment in the lives of the people of our community is priceless.  Nancy Vencill
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	8868	8	/users/profile/10641	hairdoerbren	Client Served	5	08/08/2009	We have been so thankful for the Sturgis Center for the Arts.  It has been a tremendous source for a variety of music lessons as well as a variety of art projects.  My oldest daughter loves going there after school. They have also provided her with opportunities to use her music skills in the community.  She's gotten the opportunity to play piano at various nursing homes in our community, as well as at a Holiday Open House that is held at our Community Center.  Those experiences have been wonderful confidence builders for her. Everyone is so kind and helpful and they really try to help her reach her full artistic potential.  They have been a great addition to our community! I cannot imagine our community without them!
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	8866	8	/users/profile/10640	AAA	General Member of the Public	5	08/08/2009	I am a previous elementary teacher and member of the community which the Center serves.  Our school has no art program, and the Center for the Arts has always opened its doors to help us!  Anytime we asked about a topic or needed supplies or ideas, the Center was always there to help, show, and teach the students about real art!  It is a wonderful resource in a smaller town which has limited art opportunities.  My students always loved walking down to the Center for an art lesson and to look at art.  The students also talked about the after-school and summer programs the Center offered.  I am very pleased that some place in our small community offers real-life art experiences for our children when our school district cannot afford to do so.  I also sing in a local church praise band and we were able to sing for the music festival B.A.M. that the Center hosts.  What a wonderful opportunity for people from across our community to come together and have a wonderful venue and opportunity to share our music.  The Center for the Arts has also sponsored and supported activites for our Chamber of Commerce's First Night event on New Year's.  The Center is always opening it's doors to the many activities in Sturgis and is always a consistent and reliable source of support.The building in which they are located is artistic in itself.  I can't wait to see what other opportunities and adventures they can continue to have and come up with.

This small community has its share of abused, neglected youth --and the always present problem of simple boredom. The Sturgis Center for the Arts creates a healthy family atmosphere for all youth.  There are music and art lessons for anyone expressing an interest and a positive, task-oriented atmosphere that teaches life lessons as well as the arts. Art and music are also used creatively to address education and moral issues.No child is turned away as long as they want to learn, want to network with positive role mocels or just need a place to be.
Sturgis Center For The Arts Inc	8830	7	/users/profile/10598	strongenergy	General Member of the Public	5	08/07/2009	5 Stars, Sturgis Center for the Arts is in a small community with lots of challenges. Everyday the Center reaches out to young people, with music, art, activities, community events, and many other things. My daughter took guitar lessons there and they lowered the membership fee to keep it affordable for kids-some of my daughter's friends hang out here. My family moved to Sturgis when my exhusband and I got divorced. When divorced parents or parents don't get along as my ex and I don't, it makes it so hard on the kids. Parents have to be on the same page, stay involved in the kid's activities, and put their kids in activities that build communities, character, fun, and that are organized. Sturgis Center for the Arts also had hot chocolate after the Christmas parade, my girlfriend had her 4 kids there for activities and fun--it was great for her--the holidays were sad for her. Sturgis Center of the Arts has jam sessions---there is not a whole lot to do in Sturgis and kids are at risk here.  It would be so awesome if Sturgis Center for the Arts could get their own permanent building as they have so much more to do in our community and are able to meet the challenge. Thank you for being in Sturgis and thank you for all that you do

In a short time they have developed into a remarkable community organization sharing music and art with the community.

They deliver truckloads of completely useless garbage like  outdated calendars, old outdated food, auto parts  that would not work for anything you would find on the reservations, outdoor patio cushions without the furniture that they go on,  I could go on and on. The person running nana is a criminal, she is only interested in fattening her bank account and sponsoring a extremely expensive cruise every year. I hope she runs naha into the ground.

Native American Heritage Association	255296	9	/users/profile/343681	Leedeadwyler	General Member of the Public	1	09/08/2015	I am absolutely appalled by the management of this organization. I received a mailpiece from the NAHA. I have never supported this organization and called to see which organization I have supported in the past sold my information to, or exchanged lists with the Native American Heritage Association. I spoke to two employees, including Pam, who refused to provide this information to me. I told Pam that I felt it was a poor organizational practice to refuse to provide this information (while claiming that they were unable to locate this information). Pam's response was to tell me that I, as a potential donor, should check the privacy policies of the organizations I support. I concede that I should have taken that step, but the NAHA should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of potential donors in that manner. I have never been treated so poorly by an organization before. I hope that someone at NAHA takes the time to reevaluate how potential donors are treated. They claim to value transparency and accountability, but displayed neither today. 
Native American Heritage Association	253111	9	/users/profile/341267	donor726	Donor	5	08/17/2015	There are some charities that once you know about them and the good things they are able to do for others they instantly become part of your donor list.  NAHA is one of those charities for me.  They have a four star rating with charity navigator for 11 years.  They send food, clothing and other necessities to reservations that are in need.  Their programs use the basics to help Native Americans take a step up.   If you watch their video you can see some of the great things they have done.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHD7S7I5j5k.

The mailbox is always full and no one answers the phone.  At this pooint they will discover that the monthly donation will be rejected. What  a way to run an orgamization.  This happened once before.  It took months before they realized the credit card was voided.

NAHA donations are brought to the reservation in semi trucks maybe once a month to all nine districts. The items brought range from Off retail AND returned or OUTDATED donated items from mainly WALMART , the items consist of toothpaste, creams ,lotions and soaps mostly personal care items many of which  are very useful and are necessities but either damaged or opened or have been returned to store . Old Clothes are brought sparingly and are scarcely new and most have a mildew smell to them. When food is brought it is mostly damaged canned food which is outdated also. Bread is brought maybe 3 times a year ,which is also never fresh. One of my major concerns is the fact that  items such as mouth wash and hairspray which have a high alcohol content are sent in abundance where there is a known problem of alcoholism and inhalant abuse among the peoples, young and old. The food boxes which are donated thru out the year have been known to be outdated also. If there is a record of millions of dollars being donated to NAHA on an annual basis why then are the items that are being donated in such bad shape or of less than adequate content. Its a shame that the very people this organization is requesting donations for are the very people who are getting cheated with less than adequate and poor contributions. What is being done with all the $$$$???? And why are the target population only getting used or outdated items?

PERHAPS IT WOULD BE WELL TO LOOK A BIT MORE DILIGENTLY BEFORE RUSHING TO JUDGEMENT   THAT ASSOCIATION (NAHA) SOLICITS A LAUNDRY LIST OF DONATIONS, INCLUDING  AND NOT LIMITED TO: FOOD, CLOTHING, PROPANE FUEL FOR RESERVATION "SHACKS" IN WHICH HUMAN BEINGS ARE CONSIGNED TO LIVE, COOKING STOVES, HEATING STOVES TOYS FOR  POVERTY-STRICKEN C\NATIVE CHILDREN, MEDICAL SUPPLIES, PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS, ETC., ETC.

Native American Heritage Association	164825	15	/users/profile/219088	BCAD	General Member of the Public	5	08/13/2013	am an 82 year old man living on Social Security based upon salaries of the 1940's, 1950, 1960's and 1970, a 'far cry' from what salaries have risen to in the following years.  As uou know, Social Security is based upon those salaries.  The same applies to pensions except in those early years, many if not most but the national companies paid pensions because of their unions and they were high.  But if one didn't work for one of these3 Corporations, pensions, if they were provided, were comparatively much less.   Every month, I and my wife separate out, IMMEDIATELY, 10% of our incone which consist solely of our Social Security and a small pension I receive from an employer in the '40's, 50's 60's and 70' before I retired following emergency open heart surgery.   THE VERY 1st Charity we send donation to is the NAHA.  I have spoken by phone to several of their workers, many of whom are volunteers.  I viewed their WEB-SITE in great detail and I viewed their Organization of CHARITY NAVIGATOR.  I have every confidence that by far, most of our scarce $$$$$$ given to NAHA, likely 97cents, goes to those Ethnic AQmericasns most in need.... in every kind of weather and every Season.  I would urge others to view the resources which we used and I am sure, you will arrive at the same conclusion.  I NEVER had a high-paying job and my wife remained home to care for our children so I have no 'pile' of mony sitting anywhere except enough to bury me. NAHA couldn't be a more worthy charity, in our opinion.

Native American Heritage Association	151872	7	/users/profile/202798	bkellogg49	Donor	3	03/30/2013	I just copied and pasted this from the BBB.org after reading the reviews here.  I get donation requests from them.  after seeing your sight I will do more research before considering donating to them.This charitable organization either has not responded to written BBB requests for information or has declined to be evaluated in relation to BBB Standards for Charity Accountability. Charity participation in BBB review is voluntary. However, without the requested information, it is not possible to determine whether this charity adheres to all of the BBB Standards for Charity Accountability. The BBB encourages charities to disclose accountability information beyond that typically included in financial statements and government filings, in order to demonstrate transparency and strengthen public trust in the charitable sector.  The BBB reports on charities and determines if they meet 20 voluntary standards on matters such as charity finances, appeals, and governance. The BBB does not evaluate the worthiness of the charitable program.
Native American Heritage Association	148830	15	/users/profile/198226	Mary158	Donor	1	02/01/2013	I would highly suggested taking the numbers you see in donation and adding up how much is going to administration.  They also are USING their trucks to move the food (that was donated), but not in purchasing food.  This is from oohayliam64's website investigation about Indian Scams in US:  here you go:  In 1993, when Browns AIRC scam was laid bare by the media, the charity discreetly downsized its South Dakota operations and shifted its focus to the American Southwest. Today the charity has been reborn under a different parent organization, National Relief Charities (NRC), which operates two new subsidiaries, Council of Indian Nations and Southwest Indian Relief, both in Apache Junction, AZ. "Despite its makeover, NRC is still distributing a pitiful portion of its revenues to the constituency it purports to serve. According to NRCs 1999 federal tax filings, it brought in over $8.3 million in donations last year but only 30 percent were spent on programs. In contrast, Browns salary has hovered at about $120,000 for the last two years. The National Charities Information Bureau, a Washington, DC-based watchdog group, suggests charities should spend at least 60 percent of donations on programs and services. Browns tactics are par for the course among a few other large charities like the Native American Heritage Association (NAHA), a sibling of AIRC. The couple at the helm of NAHA, Dave and Bernice Myers, were co-defendants in the Pennsylvania lawsuit against AIRC. Thats because the Myers actually created AIRC in 1990, then gave it to the board of directors who elected Brown as president. The sweetheart deal guaranteed the Myers a $10,000 bonus for past services and a $650,000 award for a contract to deliver future services to Native Americans. No services were ever rendered with that money. Both charities have consistently received failing marks from watchdog groups. One, the American Institute of Philanthropy, gave NRC an F grade and NAHA a D for its fundraising and service delivery performance."   You might find a more direct way to HELP if you want to give to Natives than this association, that literally is using the plight for sympathy and while theadmin in according to your own information:  $235,286.00/ president in 2011, VP  $85,774.00, director $76,156.00.  This does not count bonuses just straight salary. I,  like oohayliam64, find the website not up to date nor questions answered.  Nor do they respond to various BBB inquiries either, making them highly suspicious in my view.  You must choose your charities as safely as you can.  As a disabled person, I know first handed about "off charities" that prey on using folks like us for bait to make you want to give. I figure I got asked to donate because of being a member of "Feeding America", which I will willingly donate again to.

Their efforts have helped improve many lives by eliminating the suffering felt by these Native Americans.

International Society For The Protection Of Mustangs & Burros	321249		/users/profile/414533	Bajbs	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/14/2017	The horses this charity alleges to care for were impounded by the South Dakota state attorney due to long-term starvation and neglect (over 800 horses at the time of impoundment) in the fall of 2016.  On January 27, 2017, a hearing is scheduled wherein a judge will decide the disposition of the horses.  Three legitimate horse rescue groups have petitioned the court to transfer ownership to them so that they can provide the extensive care these horses require and then place them for adoption.  The president of International Society for the Protection of Mustangs and Burros continues to solicit donations as a 503(c)(3) charity when neither she nor the ISPMB have control over the horses and are the ones responsible for the long-term neglect and starvation. A search of the Internet will substantiate what is written above.  (Note the overgrown hooves on the young horse in the attached photo.  This is one of hundreds with neglected hooves.)
International Society For The Protection Of Mustangs & Burros	310230	1	/users/profile/401581	Deedoneit	General Member of the Public	4	10/12/2016	Going back over 5 years we have been telling this organization that it was out of control and they needed a massive contraception program plus adoption program to pull numbers down to levels that the organization could realistically care for.  The answer has always been "We are fine and are about to sign on a major donor".  Well this mythical donor has never appeared and the horses have paid dearly for the myopic view of the ISPMB Board of Directors and the manager Karen Sussman.  There is no adequate excuses for allowing things to get this far out of control.

The most recent events are of such a horrible nature that it is time for the horses to be rescued from this so called rescue. They need to be investigated for animal cruelty and fraud!

The judge has placed the horses in the care of law enforcement. Here is what the veterinarian who examined the 600-plus horses reported: Ownership [ISPMB] does not appear to have the means, money, labor, and facilities to support and manage a population of animals this size, the report said, and does not appear to have adequate plans to assure the future of this herd. Based on my findings as outlined in this report, it is my determination that animal neglect is present at this facility." Do not give ISPMB, led by Karen Sussman, any money - they are killing the horses. = = = = = =As of Oct 2016 local law enforcement is seizing hundreds of starving and dying horses belonging to this organization. It is a travesty that has been going on for years. It has to stop. Uncontrolled breeding, no vet care. Stop these romantic notions of preserving wild horses -- all they do is starve and die inch by inch.  For what??? This is the very definition of inhumane.

An example of rehoming is with the Camargue Horses in South France where a similar organization with love and dedication (and tons of hard work) with also limited space Until the French Government released them in the south of France.

That's a long, tortuous death and you did what? Watched them die? This is absolutely disgraceful and should be fully investigated. Those poor souls deserve justice. Shame. 
International Society For The Protection Of Mustangs & Burros	309085	8	/users/profile/400445	dhickma4	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/08/2016	You are clearly in over your head and waited until it was too late to ask for help. For you to allow constant breeding, insufficient care, and allow these majestic horses to starve is criminal in every sense of the word. The letter you wrote is appalling to myself and every other advocate fighting for the American Icons. To attempt blame on the public for not financially supporting something you took responsibility for is outrageous at best. It was you who envisioned this task and something you should clearly know is that you cannot and never should rely on donations alone. You have no business attempting to tackle something so large as there was no plan in place, nothing, nil, zero, and only the horses have suffered. It is time that you step down and your board to step up to the plate. Not one person owes you a dime, not one person owes you anything. You had an opportunity to speak out and ask for help months ago, but you chose to wait until these beloved animals suffered and perished, from starvation, grotesque hoof issues and and you even allowed the starvation of babies. How dare you!!! The numbers you stated in your letter do not even make sense, let alone and yet you even bring up the fact that you will launch an even larger campaign for more property. Dear God, please stop!!!  Who is responsible for all of your accounting, planning and future demand of care? I pray that people are smart enough to not give another dime to you, but instead donate hay directly. I also pray that law enforcement charges you to the fullest extent of the law. Due to your horrible decision making and misuse of funds, the horses have suffered. You need to be asking for people to step up and take in horses instead of putting money into your incompetent hands. You can no longer be trusted to make the best decisions on behalf of those who you were supposed to be a voice for.

We have colabareted on many others such as  Child's Voice and the Compass Center. It is heart warming to be able to look back at all the wonderful things this organization does for it's members with leadership skills and meeting the needs of the community through projects. As a bonus, I have had the privilege to meet so many wonderful, fun, talented and gifted women. Women that I will have as friends the rest of my life.

The organization has taught me leadership skills I use in my career and in other volunteer areas within the community.  It is also so energizing and refreshing to spend time with such great women. 
Junior League of Sioux Falls Inc	82119		/users/profile/90127	anne jackson	Board Member	5	03/13/2011	I joined JLSF in 2006 just after relocating to Sioux Falls.   I found a wonderful group of women, of all ages, who were serving our community in a variety of ways.   The unique part of JLSF is that you learn leadership skills that can be applied to your career, to civic opportunities to lead or to service in other non-profits.  Learning leadership while serving others is a powerful way to meet people that become lasting friends.  For me, it was a great way to not just meet new people but also to learn about the needs in Sioux Falls and the great organizations that served those needs, or better yet, how JLSF could serve an unmet need in the community.  It's been a blessing to watch women with a variety of skill sets and talents come together to serve others and achieve great things!

We take a mixed group of adults and youth .  We help the residences with home repairs and work in the soup kitchen and resale shops. The experience our group has had makes a profound impression on them. Especially the youth. It's hard work but extremely rewarding.  
Tree Of Life Ministry	163372		/users/profile/216885	FUMCHolland	Volunteer	5	07/23/2013	Tree of Life is a wonderful relief ministry to the Lakota Sioux people on the Rosebud Reservation.  They offer a soup kitchen, food pantry and thrift store each weekday, as well as a summer home repair program and a holiday gift donation program.  I have taken groups of youth to Tree of Life twice and find that it is one of the best-run and most impactful experiences that my youth have.  From the sensitivity and respect with which the ministry is run to the nightly cultural experiences that help us connect with the Lakota people, Tree of Life is a great place to serve!

Tree Of Life Ministry	160534		/users/profile/212843	Slogo	Volunteer	5	06/13/2013	Tree of Life Mission serves those living on the Rosebud Indian Reservation and others in the town/area of Mission, S.D.  Volunteers provide assistance by repairing houses, serving food in a soup kitchen, and operating a thrift store, among other services.  There many opportunities to serve in the community and you do not need special skills to do so.   Also during your visit there is an opportunity to learn about the Lakota culture and its problems.  Local speakers are provided every day during the week and they are very interesting and fun.  This mission is located near the Black Hills, Mt. Rushmore and several National Parks. This mission does an excellent job. 
Tree Of Life Ministry	160430		/users/profile/212717	davida77	Volunteer	5	06/12/2013	I work at a high school and have helped lead a group of student volunteers to Tree of Life Ministry on four different occasions.  We have student volunteer groups travel outside of the country, but I tell the students that the Rosebud Reservation is the most impoverished place that we send volunteers.  The need is great on the reservation.  But aside from the work that is done to help alleviate the poverty on the reservation, I think the best part of this experience is the cultural activities that Tree of Life organizes for volunteer groups.  My life has been enriched by learning more about Lakota culture and participating in ceremonies like the sweat lodge.  The students are also enriched by learning about Lakota spirituality and culture.  This is a great cross cultural experience for participants and a chance to work "with" instead of "for" the people living on the reservation.   Volunteers have the opportunity to participate in home repair projects.  If volunteers have experience with home repair, that is very helpful.  If not, there are opportunities to work in their food pantry or thrift store.  These are good experiences for people who may not have a lot of construction skills.  The group receives a day off on Wednesday, which provides a good break in the week.  And each evening, there is a cultural activity which is a huge part of the program.    
Tree Of Life Ministry	160353		/users/profile/212628	Edward F. Johnson	Volunteer	5	06/11/2013	Tree of Life Ministry in Mission, South Dakota is a MOST valuable relief agency for the Lakota people. For the past 9 years I have coordinated our Volunteers in Missions team from Catonsville, Maryland as we worked closely with Russell and Donna Masartis to address the various needs of the Lakota people. They have worked TIRELESSLY year-round to help with repairing sub-standard housing, supplying food and clothing, helping with child care and abused women, and a variety of emergency services in the winter months. They bring the Christian message to the people through their caring actions to build a bridge of trust and genuine friendship and collaboration among the two cultures. They  provide jobs for Lakota people and do so much to enhance the families of their employees as they continue to expand the influence of Tree of Life. HOPE is projected to people who have little of it. They have been HONORED by the Lakota people at the annual Indian Victory Day powwow (June 25th) by being recognized as such a valuable entity in the reservation community. T.O.L. was honored to lead the first dance! T.O.L. has helped ALL of us on our missions teams to be closer to Christ in our personal  relationship with our Savior.  We need a 100 more T. O.L.'s!!!

The compassion and dedication of the staff seems virtually unending and it is clear that everybody truly believes in the mission of the organization and will do all they can to carry that mission out.

I first became aware of the agency in 1994 while working for a health and human service agency.  What amazed me about the agency was it's willingness to give to those in need with nothing expected in return.  The agency has wonderful staff and volunteers that were always willing to take an extra step and make something positive happen.  It has been a pleasure working with the agency over the past 18 years.  You won't find a more devoted agency, staff, or volunteer base anywhere.

I have visited Guatemala several times and have seen firsthand how this organization effects the lives of so many families in that country.  I like that this organization is about equitable relationships where both peoples learn from each other.  The ultimate goal in this partnership is sustainability for the Guatemalan families.
Friends Of Sharing The Dream In Guatemala	239447	1	/users/profile/325257	jlringlaben	Volunteer	5	03/19/2015	The mission statement of Friends of Sharing the Dream in Guatemala states that it is a volunteer-based fair trade organization that reduces poverty in Guatemala through collaborative partnerships with Guatemalans." I have had the honor and privilege of seeing this mission in action firsthand during two visits to the Elder Center in Santiago Atitlan. After my first trip to the Elder Center in November 2013, I began volunteering by selling Elder Bead Shop jewelry in the United States. The jewelry is beautiful, and people love it! Not only does the sale of the jewelry provide fair trade wages to local ladies in Santiago Atitlan, it also provides financial support for the Center itself.
Friends Of Sharing The Dream In Guatemala	201367	1	/users/profile/262844	JerryWilson	Board Member	5	05/30/2014	In the four years I have served on the board of Sharing the Dream in Guatemala, I have seen the organization's operation from every angle. Last year I took a delegation to Guatemala to visit the cooperatives that produce the high-quality products Sharing the Dream sells--traditional Maya weavings, functional and decorative wood carvings, ceramics, blown glass and more. I start every morning with coffee from Sharing the Dream. Everything STDG sells is top quality, and everything is Fair Trade. But STDG goes well beyond merely marketing crafts that help indigenous people survive; All profits from sales are returned to projects we support in Guatemala--meals and health care for impoverished elders, scholarships for deserving students, design and business training for crafts cooperatives and more. Because our slim overhead expenses are paid by sales, every penny donated to STDG goes directly to fund projects that help people improve their lives and their communities. Best of all, STDG empowers people to achieve self-sufficiency. Our goal is to help individuals, cooperatives and communities create products for the world market, and where possible, market their work themselves. When our friends in Guatemala no longer need Sharing the Dream, our mission will be complete.  Jerry Wilson

Everyone is responsible to each other and the outcomes are agreed upon in the beginning.  Diane continues to keep volunteers and supporters of her program updated on what is happening here and in Guatemala.  There is no hidden agenda, transparancy is the valuable tool so that all can participate at their own comfort level. With Sharing the Dream you can be sure your money is well spent.  This the best nonprofit, all monies go to the program and not the directors.  Elaine
Friends Of Sharing The Dream In Guatemala	146373	3	/users/profile/193163	Gerald I.	Volunteer	5	12/10/2012	We have been been doing display/sales for several years now. People are so grateful to see and share the handmade items. They tell us how high quality they are and that they're reasonably priced. Having visited Guatemala and met many of the artisans, we can tell their stories honestly. We have many items of Sharing the Dream art in our own home. Sharing the Dream helps mothers -- many of them widows from the recent protracted civil war -- feed their children and send them to school. Sharing the Dream also helps orphans and senior citizens.
Ronald Mcdonald House Charities of South Dakota Inc	91526		/users/profile/104742	RMHCHelper	General Member of the Public	5	06/21/2011	This is a great place!  The staff and volunteers go out of their way to make each family feel welcome.  They are also appreciative of the people who come through the doors to donate time, pop-tabs, food, blankets, etc.  The houses truly want their guests to feel like they are at home.  There are few places that operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 a year, but the RMHC do.  Hopefully, as a parent, your child never experiences a hospital visit, but if it does happen, know that there is somewhere to go.
Ronald Mcdonald House Charities of South Dakota Inc	91515		/users/profile/104717	mjflanigan	Volunteer	5	06/21/2011	The RMHC-SD is a warm and homey environment to be a part of. The staff are kind and extremely dedicated to what this organization is all about.  They help out in all activities, and make each person feel welcome, that comes through the door.  I feel very honored to be part of such a great organization, and to be able to work next to such a great staff.

Whenever I go there to help out they are always so warm and welcoming the second I step foot in the door. They are always willing to answer any questions that I might have while I am there and give direction when I am unsure about what I am doing. The house is always so clean too! Big kudos to all of the employees, donors and other volunteers who help make The RHMC-SD house so nice!
South Dakota State Poetry Society	193077		/users/profile/252186	Kathleen60	Board Member	5	01/24/2014	The South Dakota State Poetry Society literally saved my life. As a transplanted New Yorker in the Black Hills I was adrift without a forum in which to express my ideas or a conduit for my work. Our group changed all that for me. South Dakota is a large state with cantankerous weather and I am a real homebody. Through the state poets I can get support and feedback without leaving my home and can look forward to facetime with others in my group whenever I can make it to live events. Don't wait. If you feel that a large part of your life is missing and it just might be filled by doing a bit of writing and networking, check us out!
South Dakota State Poetry Society	193070	1	/users/profile/240312	DeborahG	Board Member	5	01/24/2014	South Dakota is a wide, wide state, with our relatively small population spread out across the miles. The South Dakota Poetry Society works to bring people together through the celebration of poetry, and in the celebration of the human spirit and all we share as people. This group works to make sure  that South Dakota voices will be heard and remembered, and that the South Dakota experience may be added to the human record.  Every voice is important, and everyone's voice is welcome here. We publish poetry from South Dakotans, in chap books and Pasque Petals, we sponsor poetry readings and gatherings, and we advocate for poetry across the state. 
South Dakota State Poetry Society	193064		/users/profile/252165	vinniepoet	Board Member	5	01/24/2014	This is really a fun group of people to work and play with. Not as quirky as some poets but plenty quirky to have fun with.  The aim of this group is to help people get their poems written read and heard. The group publish "Pasque Petals" and "4 Quarters to a Section". They also hold poetry contests and put on workshops.  If you have any interest in poetry at all, you should join this group.

Mammoth Site of Hot Springs South Dakota Inc	163363	1	/users/profile/216870	treedr	Client Served	4	07/23/2013	The Mammoth site does an excellent job of interepting the developmental and archaelogical history of their site. Our children, ages 4-10, have made this a "must see" stop along our vacation route to Yellowstone every other year. The staff members are very helpful, the tours are well planned, and the up close and personal feel of the site makes for a great learning opportunity. I think most anyone would be pleased with their experience at the site.
Mammoth Site of Hot Springs South Dakota Inc	163304		/users/profile/216782	amstroup27	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/22/2013	As a fellow museum professional, the Mammoth Site is quite a wonderful place to visit.  The site itself is very interesting, and the exhibits are of high quality.  The archaeological component was nicely displayed and the interpretation through labels was also well done.  Well presented for a general audience
Mammoth Site of Hot Springs South Dakota Inc	163303		/users/profile/216780	ShelleyD	Client Served	5	07/22/2013	We are from WA state. My family toured the Mammoth Site while on vacation.  We came back a  few years later with our granddaughter who was from Portland,  OR.  The children, all girls learned a lot and we enjoyed our experience. We will be making a point of returning multiple times over the coming years to see what is new. I have encouraged a college student who is majoring in archeology,  to sign up  to work on the Mammoth Site in  the summer.  A  couple of days spent in Hot Springs should include a dip in Evans Plunge heated from warm water springs.  A visit of Angustora Reservoir south of town with fishing, picnics, boating and sandy beaches to enjoy. To the north of town is Wind Cave Natl Park.  A visit to the Mammoth Site will just add to the fun and educational opportunities in the southern Black Hills.   The Hot Springs community is a great supporter of  this nonprofit, and we all must help keep it viable with our financial support for others to enjoy and be awed by it. The Mammoth Site is like none other for education.
Christian Life Ministries	218068		/users/profile/209290	Judson U.	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2014	It's been more than 2 years since participating in CLM. I am happy to report the mountain is removed from my shoulders and the boulders from my heart. What I failed to do, Christ did for me!  CLM has been a great messenger in my life. Because of the CLM message, I get to rely on Christ for all things that concern me and for all things that concern the people I love. Which is something I never had or knew existed.  : )
Christian Life Ministries	129534		/users/profile/174901	CLMchange	Client Served	1	10/26/2012	If you are struggling with issues of faith, CLM is a wonderful place to find help. However, CLM claims to offer counsel in areas of depression, anxiety, compulsive disorders, and substance abuse. But their carefully crafted leaglese obsolves them from any of the rules and responsibilities certified counselors have to subscribe to. They report to no "best practices" standards; they counsel based on a very conservative understanding of Biblical principles under the state law excemption that "clergy" can offer counsel without training. Yet, very few of the CLM staff has attended a seminary school and received a theology degree. You too can get ordained for a $30 fee online!  Well meaning, good people who are totally untrained. If you have a problem that's more than a spiritual hangnail, go elsewhere.

Many people have benefited from this spay-neuter program.   Most important, there are thousands fewer unwanted animals suffering because of human stupidity, thoughtlessness and irresponsibility.

HorsePower	189552		/users/profile/247437	Elaine26	Client Served	5	11/29/2013	At age 3, our son Mark was diagnosed with autism and nonverbal.  His therapists said we should have him learn sign language so we could communicate better with him.  Mark didn't care for signing and continued with gestures and pointing.  At age 5, Horsepower came into his life and after his first lesson, Mark talked - actually talked about when he would come back and ride Star.  That event is one of the most my joyous moments in my life.  Mark is now 23 and has been in the program for 18 years.  Today, Mark talks about his Fred (the horse he rides at Horsepower) on a daily basis and I'm always happy to listen to him talk about his Fred.

Southeastern Behavioral Healthcare	147868	5	/users/profile/195650	SFNative	Donor	1	01/09/2013	This non-profit has very lofty goals but is very badly mismanaged at the highest level. The CEO and Board of Directors have taken this once fine organization down a road of fiscal mismanagement and cover-ups. The company has done its best to hide individuals who have stolen from clients, including one who was prosecuted for embezzlement, but took more than 2 1/2 years to catch her, despite numerous safe-guards. Most of this due to the fact the highest management has no desire to understand the entire organization and is focused solely on projects that give her a name about Sioux Falls and that she can throw on her resume.
Red Cloud Indian School	275208	8	/users/profile/68171	Fran L	Donor	5	12/30/2015	I am a long time donor to this K-12 school and have found it to be an excellent resource for the Pine Ridge Reservation, where there is 89% unemployment and 6 in 10 live in poverty.    Not only do students receive an outstanding education (has the highest number of Gates scholars per capita in the nation) but it offers healthy meal programs, and community outreach for those hoping to start businesses .  Over 90 % of Red Cloud students graduate from high school and of that number 90% go on to post secondary education.  Residents of the reservation recognize the value of Red Cloud's Lakota culture curriculum as well as after school activities such as basketball.  The teachers really care about the  kids.  I know several Pine Ridge families with children who have attended or are still in the school.  While visiting these families I have toured the school and the cultural museum.   A Red Cloud education has been a life changing process for the graduates, with many now in professions such as teaching, social work or in medicine.

Red Cloud Indian School	145224	34	/users/profile/191765	TechieTwo	Donor	5	11/30/2012	My wife and I spent a few days this summer at the school.  The purpose of our visit was to see first hand the school to which we have contributed for many years and to better understand their needs.  We volunteered in several classes teaching science lessons and interacting with the students.    The school provides many services and meals to the students besides providing them with a quality education.  The teachers are very competent and caring.  The students are motivated and perform at a high level academically.  The community the school serves has an unemployment rate around 80%.  Without the school, these students would not have adequate nutrition and hope for a good future that a quality education can provide.  We were most impressed with the work being performed at the school and have increased our level of support accordingly.  In addition to cash contributions, we provide extra resources to the teachers and library in the form of books, magazines, and science kits.  We also just sent a shipment of new sweat shirts for the students in response to the need of warm clothing to deal with South Dakota winters.

It is a great way to connect inmates with churches on the outside.  It is also a wonderful way for people on the outside to learn more about the prison system.  There are 19 congregations of main line denominations in the prison system.  It works with people, not doing for people.  What a great model for many charities.

Sioux Empire United Way Inc	286766		/users/profile/376836	Olivia_E	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	When I was in college, I got an opportunity to intern at United Way in my town. At first I had no idea what the organization was, and I hadn't done much with nonprofits in the past. My first thought was, 'Great. An unpaid internship. I need to keep looking.' But after I did my interview and met some of the employees, I thought I might as well give it a go. One of my main jobs was to interview people in the community who benefited from organizations or programs that the United Way had helped. That's how I met Chloe. Chloe was a young girl that had been born with a heart disease that made her very fragile. She was unable to participate in a lot of activities because of the fear of her getting hurt or sick. Her only athletic outlet was brought to her by a local YMCA, a partner of the United Way, that offered swimming lessons for her. Because of the swimming lessons that were made possible by a United Way partner, she was able to not only grow athletically, but through her confidence and personality. I met many deserving people like Chloe, and went on to intern at a nonprofit health center later that year. After graduation, I ended up getting a job in marketing at a for profit business in town. After working for nonprofits for almost a year and a half, I was shocked at how out of the loop I was. I enjoyed my job, but knew it wasn't my long term goals. I then saw an add listed for United Way in a close city and saw it as a sign. I finally realized that what I was missing in my job was the ability to give back to people and my community. I currently work for Sioux Empire United Way and am looking to volunteer more now that I am in a new city. Now more than ever, I see the needs of individuals that live so close to me. Needs that I do not, and hopefully never will have unmet. I support Sioux Empire United Way because they focus on Income, Education and Health and restore dollars to other nonprofits who may otherwise go unnoticed.

Sustainable Harvest Alliance	169717	1	/users/profile/224939	grma	General Member of the Public	5	09/14/2013	I saw a story on NPR about processing of bison meat on location in the field where animals roam.  I was impressed with the humane killing and the fact that without stress to the animal the meat that results is a much higher quality.  In addition it is done by Native Americans who were so proud of their work.  Seems to me to be a win-win for those who want to buy bison meat and for the the Native Americans to build a money making, earth friendly enterprise.  Native Americans are the original earth respectful culture and I hope their business can increase.

MCLAUGHLIN COMMUNITY YOUTH ORGANIZATION	275093	4	/users/profile/364655	Dustin T.	General Member of the Public	5	12/29/2015	The volunteers that run the McLaughlin Youth Organization come from all backgrounds in a combined effort to pull together a safe and fun place for the community and especially our youth. The theater plays movies at a very affordable ticket rates and with the driving distances to theaters outside of the area, it can save a family on gas to utilize the local theater. The theater is a less expensive night out for fun.When there is no movie playing, volunteers will allow the youth to take advantage of the various arcade machines and pool table.Without such safe havens within our communities our children will do what they can to try to occupy their time certain decisions that they make are not for the best. Sometimes a child needs to get away from their home environment. Sometimes a child needs to have a place where they can meet up with their friends and family. There are multiple reasons as to why any community could use their own youth organizations in their area.Without volunteers and the efforts of many other organizations, the theater would not exist. I would like to ask everyone who reads this and who can either donate time, maybe resources such as candy, popcorn, cleaning supplies, or any other items that would bring much needed help to the theater to please do so. It is appreciated immensely as there are many times over that the theater gives  back to the communities through feeds and other acts of kindness and generosity.Please keep up the good work and never forget that this is all for the benefit of children in need of a positive place with role models to look up towards.

Re-Member	293531	7	/users/profile/63965	Laura G.	Volunteer	2	06/21/2016	Re-member is a charity that helps the Lakota people primarily by bringing them beds, skirting (to reduce heating costs), creating wheelchair ramps, outhouse installation, and minor home repairs. It costs $546 to volunteer there for a week. That pays for housing (bunkhouse with 8+ in a room), food (it's all cheap, processed food), touring the Badlands, and Pine Ridge, and lectures by Lakota people.  I was hoping for personal interaction with the Lakota, but this was not really part of it. Our days were scheduled from 7:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. They say to slow down and listen, but there was no time. They also use "Rez time" as a one way excuse to be late (waste time), but hold you accountable if you are slow, late, or not on their schedule. Volunteering entails a lot of not well organized work so it felt unproductive. The week I was there, we delivered about 11 beds and skirted 2 homes. A Native came looking for someone in the office because he said he'd been waiting for a bed for a year. Another told me that he's been waiting for roof repairs for 4 years. The total income produced by the 50+ volunteers was in the neighborhood of $23,000 for the week. That doesn't seem like a great return on investment. There were so many volunteers and so little work that the volunteers were loaned out to Red Cloud Renewable Energy. We pulled weeds to get them ready for a visit by potential investors. They ask for your money while condemning you for being privileged even though I know that some people there scraped together their pennies to be there. The staff was brusque, bossy, and rude and treated the volunteers like children. We had to clean the bunkhouse, vehicles, kitchen, and laundry room as part of our service because, as one paid staff put it, "We'll have to do it if you don't." The worst part was the proselytizing. If you want a healthy dose of white guilt, go here. They are liberal with it. You will know (if you are white) that you are a total piece of trash. We were even told by one speaker that Republicans can see themselves out. For the record, I am not a Republican or an Anglo, but I am a human being and I don't like seeing people treated like that. Here I learned that there is only one race, the human race - but if you are white, you are a devil. I learned "Do not feed the animals. It only makes them dependent" while they were giving bunk beds to people who (some) didn't ask to help bring in the pieces or help with assembly.  I am happy that I came to Pine Ridge. I actually learned a lot. I dug deep and asked myself a lot of questions. I left with more than I brought, but it was hard won. Re-member's vision of the Red Road is not my vision. "Hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can do that." ~Martin Luther King. That means love for all people, not just the ones with the politics that agree with yours or those with the right skin color.

Thank you Global Aid Direct.
La Leche League Of Mn-Dakotas	322258	1	/users/profile/415979	dawncy	Client Served	5	01/27/2017	I  Love breastmilk I know that sounds weird, but breast-feeding has changed my life and my outlook upon motherhood. Also, my husband has got a prosthetic breast and is able to breast-feed our daughter as well.  My nipples are not able to produce enough for my beautiful daughter and now with a prosthetic nipple my husband is able to breast-feed as well.  None of this would've been possible without the help of lactating mothers who donated the breastmilk for my husband and I to drink.  I am forever indebted to the la leche of Rapid City, you will have a you have a place in my heart forever. Sincerely mom  meyers
Gentle Spirit Horses Rescue & Sanctuary	310054	1	/users/profile/401403	bmatul	Donor	5	10/12/2016	The directors and volunteers of Gentle Spirit truly care about the horse industry.  Not only are they a sanctuary for horses which are hard to place, or a rescue for neglected animals, but they are also helping horse owners who are at risk, as well as educating the community on what horse ownership is really about.  Their community programs and outreach are awesome.    Gentle Spirit is a worthy organization and I strongly recommend supporting them!
Wicahpi Koyaka Tiospaye	172483	1	/users/profile/228398	MelodyF	Volunteer	5	09/30/2013	Volunteering for Wicahpi Koyaka Tiospaye has developed my understanding of the impact of programs from events, community, and curriculum to a more wholesome place of creating and fostering a new Way of Life...one that serves others, spiritually, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Through my time working with WKT, I have become a more grateful, inspired, and compassionate person. I have met my greatest mentors, my best friends, grown in my capacity to appreciate life, and I feel more a part of community. The impact and strengthening of the WKT family that I have seen over the last 5-6 years has been absolutely life-changing.

I thought this would give me some answers, a name  or phone number or a Jaycee monitored and updated website or something........  Is this the type of service offered here? Good Group, but this site does not do it justice.
