Lake Champlain International (LCI)	304867	1	/users/profile/396062	Lynn110	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2016	LCI works very hard to clean up Lake Champlain for the environment's sake and for the sake of all who live near, work near or on, and use our lake for recreational purposes.  It supplies drinking water to thousands of people who live near it.  Lake Champlain supports a variety of wildlife in and near it.  It is vital that we support LCI in helping them to clean up areas of the lake and get legislation passed so that polluters will stop and would-be polluters will think before dumping toxins into our precious and fragile water.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	304735		/users/profile/395915	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2016	No one works harder at ensuring that we focus on clean water.  Lake Champlain is our most important asset, and it seems that Lake Champlain International is the only organization that is fighting to keep it clean!  Thanks for all that you do!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	287204		/users/profile/259651	2707	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/25/2016	I have been a Let's Go Fishing Instructor for many years now and have recently started working with James and his staff at LCI with The Boys and Girls Club of Burlington, The King Street Center and Spectrum Youth and Family Services. We had an event this past summer where the kids visited a fish hatchery and fished for several hours and then learned how to clean and prepare their catch followed by a picnic where the some of the kids had fresh fish for the first time. The second event, The Lake Supper, was just a few weeks ago where the kids helped me prepare several different dishes all consisting of fish from Lake Champlain.  The dinner was well attended and the kids worked hard showing a genuine interest in the food itself and the fact that it all came from Lake Champlain. I work with volunteer groups all over the country and these events are two of the most special and rewarding things I have ever done as a volunteer, angler or chef.  I look forward to continuing this relationship with The LCI and helping to educate the kids of these groups and others on the waters and fish of Lake Champlain.Jimmy Kennedy
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	198844		/users/profile/259651	2707	Volunteer	5	04/24/2014	I have been an instructor with The Let's Go Fishing Program for many, many years now and it's one of the most rewarding programs I've ever been associated with.  The educational efforts by this program and the LCI in general are second to none.  As an angler and Vermont resident, I feel very fortunate to have the LCI as a teacher, protector and advocate for Lake Champlain and I look forward being involved with them for a long time. Jimmy Kennedy
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	285567		/users/profile/375570	Writer	Client Served	5	04/11/2016	Our school recently hosted a visit by James E.  He was speaking to a group of fifth and sixth graders about water safety and quality. He was engaging, informative and well prepared for his presentation. James made a nice connection with our students.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	285551		/users/profile/375551	Writer	Board Member	5	04/11/2016	I am a sponsor, volunteer and board member of Lake Champlain International.Three years ago I found out how much more than a fishing tournament, LCI  is.After meeting James Ehlers, the executive director, I immediately knew that getting involved with this non profit was part of my calling.  Funded entirely by donations and grants, LCI does incredible advocacy for a swimmable, drinkable and fishable Lake Champlain. Tireless efforts at public education and legislative reforms are what LCI does to promote and insure the improved health of our beloved lake and it's tributaries.  I have personally seen this progress, especially at the statehouse, with many legislative reforms all designed to insure better water quality for Vermont.When I think about it, there is no one single effort that benefits everyone that clean water.Keep up the good work!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	285545		/users/profile/375546	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2016	James Ehlers from Lake Champlain International was a guest speaker at our 2016 Global Issues Network Conference at Rutland High School.  Students who attended his presentation called it "interesting" and "informative".  One student said, "I like the way he connected it to local issues.  Like if we do something in Rutland, it can affect the water quality someplace else."  Others liked the fact that he emphasized how students as individuals can help improve water quality.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	285420		/users/profile/375407	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/09/2016	I have been volunteering at LCI for the past few months, and I am impressed by the work of this organization. I recently volunteered at a supper for youth  in Burlington, and I was touched by the joy these children and youth experienced. I work in education and one of my beliefs is that the best way to learn is to do, and that is precisely what the children did. Many of them worked with the chef, Jimmy, to prepare the food which was mainly local fish. Not only is this organization dedicated to the welfare of the lake but also to that of the community. A homeless youth was offered a job by one of the attendees of the event because of his ability to follow direction, confidence, willingness to learn, confidence, and attitude in general. I thought that was wonderful. I'm glad to be a part of this organization. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	285299		/users/profile/375279	trevien	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/08/2016	My name is Trevien Stanger, and I am writing today to enthusiastically report on my classs experience have James Elhers of Lake Champlain International speak for us on a recent Thursday morning.  I teach an Introduction to Environmental Science course at the Community College of Vermont (CCV) here in Winooski, and weve been spending the last couple of weeks wading through the science, policy, and ethics associated with clean water here in the Champlain Basin.  Weve done water testing in the river, read over the State of the Lake Report, examined case studies from other impaired watersheds, and have taken the time to closely look at our own water foot-prints.  However, I could tell that an element was missing in our studies namely a sense of true, impassioned engagement, and Im happy to say that James provided us with this and much more.Over the course of our hour together, James provided students with a strong, coherent, entertaining narrative of why Lake Champlain is impaired he walked us through the science of algae blooms, the interconnectivity of watersheds, and the chemistry of human waste systems.  However, it was in pivoting to the policy problems and opportunities that James started to bristle with passion and fire, and you could see the students respond.  By revealing the economic and personal impacts these water issues are having on real people in the Basin, James helped transform this at-times abstract information into the ongoing, real-time problem that it is.  In discussing how much of the policy around food, development, and urban infrastructure impacts our watershed, James demonstrated that each of these issues can be worked on at various levels, and that with greater public participation, we could potentially start seeing real progress in the years to come.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	284823		/users/profile/374880	Fishin_Magicians	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2016	LCI is a wonderful family organization that is very passionate about keeping Lake Champlain and surrounding waters clean, drinkable, and fishable.  They go above and beyond to promote positive outcomes for Vermont and its waterways.  They keep people informed about how to help keep these waters healthy for the future.  I can't say enough!!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	284544	1	/users/profile/374598	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/04/2016	Lake Champlain International is a terrific non-profit run by driven, motivated, and hard-working individuals that are tirelessly devoted to their cause of ensuring that Lake Champlain's waters are swimable, drinkable, and fishable for generations to come. They do excellent work engaging a large portion of the community around the Lake, from rural anglers to youth and urban minority communities. They've also accomplished impactful victories with the Vermont legislature and state agencies to improve the water quality of the Lake. They have a long legacy of being one of the strongest and most active voices for Lake Champlain, and I've greatly enjoyed my time spent volunteering with them and am looking forward to supporting their work for years to come.

Lake Champlain International (LCI)	284333	1	/users/profile/374370	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	04/01/2016	As the owner of a brewery, water quality is very important to me. Over 90% of my product is water, and that water comes from Lake Champlain. LCI does a great job educating and engaging the community and reminding us just how important the lake is to our everyday lives. My business supports them because of their focus on science and community and their tireless work to ensure a swimmable, fishable, drinkable lake.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	284059	1	/users/profile/374089	RossInVermont	General Member of the Public	5	03/30/2016	LCI addresses water pollution and fisheries issues in an aggressive and effective way that no other organization is willing. I'm afraid the status quo of widespread water pollution would continue as usual if LCI was not pushing for smarter and more responsible behaviors from municipalities, farms,  and individuals.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	284047	1	/users/profile/325614	Honest_John	Volunteer	5	03/30/2016	I plan events at a local venue. We work with LCI every year to put on memorable events that promote the message that  Lake Champlain is a valuable resource that is in danger; LCI works diligently to make sure everyone knows that, and to promote paths forward to secure 'Swimable, Drinkable, Fishable Waters!'
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239719	1	/users/profile/325614	Honest_John	General Member of the Public	5	03/24/2015	As an event professional in the Burlington area, I have worked on numerous events with the folks at LCI. They are bar none the most passionate protectors of one of our state's greatest assets. They are a pleasure to work with and often donate their free time to community outreach. James and Eric even took me fishing! My kudos to them!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	284001		/users/profile/374021	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/29/2016	I teach Global Social Problems at CCV in St Albans, VT.  James Ehlers did a wonderful presentation to the class on issues of cyanobacteria impingement in Lake Champlain, including St Albans and Mississquoi bays. The students had been required to watch the documentary "Bloom" prior to James presentation. James was energetic and passionate in his presentation. The information resonated with the students, all of whom live in Franklin County, many in and around the bay. For many the presentation was eye opening and tied directly into our course module on global environmental issues - its not just a problem in 3rd world areas, but right at our doorstep.  Thank you James, and thank you LCI for enriching our knowledge on this issue, and for stimulating activism.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	280533	2	/users/profile/370432	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2016	 It is good to believe that the system is gaining strength to do the right thing for the environment and citizens. James Ehlers, of Lake Champlain International has been instrumental in this. My husband and I live centrally in the residential Village of Lunenburg,  RT 2, Main Street. Five years ago, a direct neighbor began a "farming" operation on his half acre property. He had livestock (of all sorts) and did not follow Accepted, Agricultural Practices. The manure and garbage were never removed from pens on his property. After four years of attempting to have this issue enforced, it had begun to feel hopeless. Seven Flags found our file and reported our story.  James contacted me immediately after reading the article. He compassionately and graciously offered support, guidance and direction. Yesterday, months later, I attended an enforcement hearing in the Guildhall courthouse. By July, the said property must be excavated, and reseeded. The "farmer" has lost his right to raise any livestock there. THANK-YOU James for all you do!!!!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	274359	1	/users/profile/363751	3-4teacher	Volunteer	5	12/14/2015	As part of my schools Geography Awareness Week, I asked James Ehlers to speak to students at the Thaddeus Stevens School. He not only agreed to make the very long drive to the NEK but to give two different presentation: one for K-3 and one for 4-8. Both presentations were engaging and informative for the students. Students asked many questions of Mr. Ehlers and were still talking about the presentation the following day. As we are located on the eastern side of the state, it was valuable for them to learn some of the issues facing Lake Champlain. Responsible environmental stewardship is often taught on a global scale, and it was refreshing to examine a local area. Teachers also found the presentation quite compelling and had many questions to ask themselves. I cant wait to invite Mr. Ehlers back to our school. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	273565	1	/users/profile/362810	Jack57	General Member of the Public	5	12/02/2015	James Ehlers leads the charge in Vermont to try save our waterways for future generations. No one is more intelligent about the facts of the matter. He is the only voice we have that is not afraid to stand up against the politicans and polluters in Vermont.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	245118	2	/users/profile/332217	Mad R.	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2015	This past spring, I reached out to James Ehlers to speak to my 8th grade science class at Harwood Union Middle School. I was planning a water quality unit and wanted to introduce the phosphorus issues that are impacting our local watersheds. James was recommended as a dynamic speaker, knowledgeable about all aspects of water quality and conservation. James did not disappoint and delivered an informative, relevant and passionate interactive presentation that both inspired and informed students beyond my expectations. Not many humans  (nor superheroes) can hold the attention of sixty middle school students for 90 minutes! James' presentation was so engaging and impactful that students couldn't wait for him to come back! When James returned at the end of our unit, students were eager to see him again, full of questions and ideas they had been waiting to explore with him.  Several other teachers were so impressed by James' presentation, they are currently planning to invite him to return to Harwood next year, hoping that he will be willing to share his knowledge with their students as well. As a teacher, I'm very grateful for James' generosity and graciousness, as I indeed learned a great deal myself and have been inspired by his passion and commitment. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	241129	2	/users/profile/327606	Rutland	General Member of the Public	4	04/14/2015	As a teacher at Rutland High School, I reached out to James Ehlers to lead two workshops at our school's Global Studies Fair.  James was extremely gracious to drive to this part of the state to talk with my students about the importance of protecting our water supply in Vermont.  He was a very dynamic speaker who understood how to connect with young people who had varying backgrounds on the subject.  James did an excellent job of meeting the needs of his audience, while getting his main points across.  We hope to have James return to Rutland High School to lead more advanced initiatives.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	240037	5	/users/profile/326056	Lake_Carmi	Client Served	5	03/27/2015	When our small organization became a vocal water quality advocate in the State of Vermont, the only organization we found that provided excellent information-and indeed the truth, was Lake Champlain International.   LCI is unbiased, and they provide information unfettered by political rhetoric.  Without a doubt, LCI stands behind their motto "Clean Water, Healthy Fish, Happy People."  Yet, unlike many non-profits, LCI does more than just stand behind their motto...they stand out front to lead the way in a decades-long fight for a clean and healthy Lake Champlain Basin.  LCI provides valuable guidance to our local grassroots organizations, working endlessly to help us in the fight for clean water.   LCI assists our local organizations in understanding the issues, provides us talking points for our local legislators, and conducts endless research to our benefit.  LCI is an organization that passes on the responsibility to maintain clean, healthy waters to the next generation, teaching our youth to care for our watersheds, all the while maintaining a healthy connection to them.  In our collective mind, nothing could be more important.   Without LCI, we do believe our local grassroots organization would flounder in our own fight to save our small lake in the Lake Champlain Basin.  To us, LCI is more than just a great non-profit, they are a priceless non-profit, and our organization is quite proud to be connected with them.    
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	240007	2	/users/profile/326021	pchurch17	Volunteer	5	03/27/2015	Worked with exec. director and as a volunteer for kids fishing derby. Great orginization.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239786	2	/users/profile/325718	lakelover1234	General Member of the Public	5	03/24/2015	I grew up visiting Lake Champlain every summer and am so grateful for the tireless work being done by LCI to ensure that future generations can do the same. I strongly encourage others to get involved and support their efforts. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239752	1	/users/profile/325675	larrygaudette	Volunteer	5	03/24/2015	Having grown up on the shores of Lake Champlain, I'm 68 yrs old, I have seen it all, the last sturgeon net off the mouth of the Winooski River, the last 20 lb fish limit of walleyes caught in Lake Champlain, the rise and fall and rise again of the sea lamprey, the algae blooms in the northern bays and lately we are being plagued by virtually thousands of cormorants that are devastating the lake islands and dissimating the fishery by consuming thousands of pounds of fish daily while they are here. I've witnessed flocks of these birds that reached from several hundred to maybe as high as 1-2 thousand birds feeding on our fish and it's time that they be brought under control so our wonderful lake can be the Queen it was years ago. Please find it in your conscience to direct some money to the clean up and once again control of Lake Champlain. Thank you!Larry GaudetteConcerned CitizenSportspersonTaxpayerGrandfather
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239747	1	/users/profile/325668	jebvt52	Volunteer	5	03/24/2015	For almost a year I have become aware of the real mission behind LCI. Their commitment to the preservation of Lake Champlain, its tributaries and the region as a whole, make for a strong advocate for the communities in understanding the real issues. Their only special interest is Lake Champlain.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239742		/users/profile/325659	imbassn	Volunteer	5	03/24/2015	My first experience with LCI was several years ago for their Fathers Day Derby. I was initially impressed by how family oriented the event was, bringing generations together in support of a great cause.  Including the community in their efforts to work towards important conservation goals. I am proud to have such an organization here in Vermont. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239741	1	/users/profile/325654	Rick57	General Member of the Public	5	03/24/2015	Great organization! Without them I fear our beautiful Lake Champlain would be lost! The next generations thank you for your tireless work! Rick Jean
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239728		/users/profile/325641	Pam_94	General Member of the Public	5	03/24/2015	I have been an Addison County resident for over 30 years and am proud of the statewide concern for our environment. We are facing a water contamination crisis and I am glad to have LCI  leading the way to clear thinking and determined action.  This is a  complex problem which will take time (to educate) and much work to solve and fund..
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239727		/users/profile/325638	AnthonyIarrapino	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/24/2015	Lake Champlain International 's value to the cause of clean water and water-based recreation cannot be overstated. Through its events, it helps connect residents to the precious natural resources around them in a manner that is family-friendly and intergenerational. With its constituency built and educated, it then helps activate that constituency to ensure that the voices of anglers are heard in the public policy arena where decisions that affect their interests in clean water and fishing are made. LCI's innovative Blue certification program also helps property owners to play a role in keeping our water clean. LCI is also creative in building partnerships with leading businesses and hard-hitting environmental public interest groups alike.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239725		/users/profile/325639	flipinsf	General Member of the Public	5	03/24/2015	This organization is wonderful in their efforts to save Lake Champlain.  It is imperative that they continue their work.  Lake Champlain is in serious trouble and and I have seen the effects since I was a teenager in the early 70's.  I applaud the vital work of Lake Champlain International.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239721		/users/profile/325628	mover22	General Member of the Public	5	03/24/2015	Lake Champlain International is Lake Champlain's best advocate. They work tirelessly to protect the source of our drinking water. Great group.  Very dedicated.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239702	1	/users/profile/325616	_Mary_	Volunteer	5	03/24/2015	I had taken my concerns to another group that advocates for Lake Champlain and never felt that I was heard. LCI not only listens they engage you and make you reach outside of your comfort zone to help yourself and them., which ultimately and directly positively impacts the lake. James Ehlers is a dynamic personality and he is way ahead of the others in his thinking and actions.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	239700	1	/users/profile/325613	chefdpaine	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/24/2015	I am a chef who Lake Champlain International has helped to connect me with local fisherman.

Lake Champlain International (LCI)	204902		/users/profile/266970	PIFDON	General Member of the Public	5	07/01/2014	My husband and I live on Lake Champlain in the summer at Long Point in N. Ferrisburgh where I held a Board position 14 years and served as President of the Board for 8 yrs.  Lake Champlain and agriculture define Long Point.  The health of the Lake is critical to all of us who live beside, recreate in, and, drink waters from (as with the Champlain Water District) Lake Champlain.  It defines our ecosystem on the west coast of Vermont!  We have donated to some of, and listened to all of the major organizations in Vermont working toward the health of Lake Champlain.  I believe that LCI has moved beyond studies and rhetoric to public education and outreach.  I have seen LCI get into the hearts and heads of Vermonters, as no other single organization has, to help each one of us understand what we can each do to make a difference in the long term health of Lake Champlain and it's tributaries.  BRAVO, LCI!  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	203103		/users/profile/264913	Sears82	General Member of the Public	5	06/17/2014	After not fishing for 32 years I got hooked on Lake Champlain  fishing last year. Ever since then I bought my boat last July after the LCI tournament. My goal this year was to fish the LCI for the first time. What a huge success , we caught a lot of Lake Trout and one beautiful Brown Trout. The quality of the fish was excellent with all the fish very fat and obviously well fed from all the baitfish in the lake.we also had very few lamprey marks on the fish we caught. Great organization doing an outstanding job to help preserve the fishery and environment of Lake Champlain. Submitted by Dale S.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	202343		/users/profile/264007	Mary Catherine J.	Volunteer	5	06/09/2014	I am writing this note from the perspective of a volunteer because that is how I came to be involved with this organization. I've been working with their Executive Director, James Ehlers, in collaboration with another non-profit and in the process I have found myself rapidly engaged with the mission and action of LCI. The staff at LCI are tireless in their advocacy of Swimmable, Fishable, Drinkable water and are incredibly creative in reaching out to "non-traditional stake holders" (that would be me).  Any organization that can convince this non-fishing mom to volunteer for 10 hours at their Father's Day Derby has got to be pretty darn dynamic!  Hats off to LCI - I look forward to working with you for many years to come.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	199067		/users/profile/259912	brentnjr	Volunteer	5	04/27/2014	A few months ago I became an LCI volunteer. I can say that everyone I have worked with so far has been fantastic. They are an enthusiastic and passionate at what they do. Every time I get a chance to help out they make sure I know my time spent helping is appreciated. I truly enjoy my time volunteering.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	198870		/users/profile/259684	ceepaul	Volunteer	5	04/24/2014	I have been an LGF instructor for several years and since the LCI took the lead on the program it has become a very energetic and richly rewarding program.  The LCI support and organization is second to none.  Setting up clinics have become much simpler, comprehensive and more organized.  I now have a network of contacts as well as numerous opportunities to jump in and help at other events.  I find myself truly able to reach out to families and introduce them to the outdoors and fishing ensuring opportunities for future generations. Keep up the good work, LCI. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	198837		/users/profile/259635	xxoo	Volunteer	4	04/24/2014	I became a LCI volunteer last year.  I decided to become a LCI volunteer because my parents both fished and showed me the thrill and joy of fishing at a very young age.  They have both passed away, however, I wanted to pass on the knowledge and joy of fishing to our younger generation.   It is a way to teach others how our natural resources can be and should be preserved and protected for future generations.   Let's Go Fishing does this and then some.  It teaches those who participate about the ecology,habitat, ethics and all methods of legal fishing.  And most importantly it  encourages families to get into the outdoors and enjoy the sport of fishing together. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	198836		/users/profile/259634	Nate L.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/24/2014	As a professional fisherman, The Lake Champlain Basin is critical to my career and success. LCI has been the most influential and the best advocate to promote clean water and our environment. I am a huge fan and support their endeavors to improve this great resource. The LCI has also partnered with the "Let's Go Fishing" program. The "Let's Go Fishing" program is instrumental  in educating  our next generation to appreciate our fishing resources. I work closely with the "Let's go Fishing" program because I firmly believe in their mission.

Lake Champlain International (LCI)	196639		/users/profile/257019	greengarden	General Member of the Public	5	03/28/2014	 I was a member of The Burlington Board of Health for two terms, and during that time we worked on trying to educate the general public on the use of non pesticide products for their lawns and gardens, the P.O.P.E   project. Last year my property was certified by LCI and I installed there logo sign on my front lawn..As a result many new family neighbors have inquired about the plaque and have initiated prevention of storm water runoff in their own yards.  How cool is that.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	165944		/users/profile/220462	GWS43	Volunteer	5	08/23/2013	I have been an avid stream fisherman for most of my life. A couple of years ago I was fishing the Willoughby River in the spring and looked up and down the river and there was only 7 or 8 people fishing. Even more disturbing to me was that I was the youngest person on the river that day @ 66 years old. When I had an opportunity to work with 'LETS GO FISHING" - which teaches young kids the aspects and joys of fishing, I jumped at it. It's so rewarding to see the smiles on children's faces when you teach them how to properly tie knots or casting and catching with the back yard bass program. I am so glad that I am having an opportunity to give back.

It makes me happy to be able to teach kids, why we have law's, and what it takes to keep our water's clean, and usable for year's to come, is so viatal to our life's . This program help's me to teach kids what a great place the outdoor's can be and how important it is to be an Ethical person, and respect the law's that are put in place, for the purpose of preserving the right to fish for the next generations. This program is vital for our children, and should be kept alive. LCI does a great job with the watershed's and continued support should be given.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	165512		/users/profile/219992	fernluv	Volunteer	5	08/20/2013	I have been volunteering with LCI's Let's Go Fishing! program for 2 years now.  I took their training program because of my love of fishing and because I believe that our beautiful natural resources should be preserved and protected for future generations.   This program does so much more than that.  Let's Go Fishing ! encourages families to get into the outdoors and enjoy the sport of fishing together.  It also teaches about ecology,habitat, ethics and all methods of legal fishing and the different types of gear.    All of the volunteers I have been fortunate to work with were knowledgeable and enthusiastic.       The Lake Champlain watershed is a special place and this program promotes the use and care and protection of it , while promoting the idea of families doing things together.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	165081		/users/profile/219447	VT Fisherman	General Member of the Public	5	08/15/2013	I have witnessed the support that the LCI has provided to the Lake Champlain watershed for the past 20 years.   I have been a participant in their derbies and have witnessed their outreach and and education efforts.    It is truly remarkable the time and effort they put into developing and sustaining our region.    We are very luck to have such a dedicated non-profit group looking out for our environment.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	163313		/users/profile/216791	MandyB	Volunteer	5	07/22/2013	We recently moved to Vermont and I was lucky enough to get connected with LCI very quickly.  They work tirelessly on the various & complex issues which impact the health of Lake Champlain.  Lake health affects everyone in the Champlain basin but so many people remain uneducated about the impacts of their actions on the lake.  LCI does a great job both in education and advocacy.  I have been impressed with the frequency of their media coverage to help keep lake health in the forefront of everyone's minds.  Keep up the good work!  There's still much to do but you're making progress.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	162797		/users/profile/216094	t karl	Volunteer	5	07/17/2013	I have been volunteering with the LCI for the last 10 years. Over this time I have filled many roles from being a runner from station to station to organizing the Little anglers derby. I also volunteer as an instructor for The Lets Go Fishing kids program.It is through organizations like LCI that make a difference in bringing people and the environment together. I found over the years the the one organization to go to is the LCI. It has the organization to promote enviornmental issues and help solve the problems.  T. Karl Hubbard
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	162409		/users/profile/215567	Jen Kimmich	Donor	5	07/11/2013	The Alchemist Brewery has relied on Lake Champlain International for technical advice in regards to water usage and wastewater treatment.  The highly professional and competent group of people who work at LCI have always shared accurate and up to date information with us.  LCI has been an incredible resource for our business as we grow.  With water being the main ingredient in our beer, it is critical that we understand how to best protect our water sources.  Moreover, it is important for us to understand how our water sources and our wastewater are interconnected.  James and his crew have done an incredible job educating us and helping to move us in the right direction as we work to minimize our impact on the environment.In addition to helping our business, LCI has been a great resource for us personally as we navigate the issues surrounding Class A and B sludge application.  Our home town recently applied for a permit to produce and spread Class B sludge which will be spread on recreation fields adjacent to the Little River.  Although sadly the permit has been granted, Russ and other staff from LCI attended many public hearings in our town.  Russ asked all of the pertinent questions and supported opposing citizens 100%.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	162350		/users/profile/215476	housedanc	Donor	5	07/10/2013	I have known of the Lake Champlain International (LCI) Fishing Derby for some time now.  However, I was unaware of what LCI was really all about until earlier this year when I had the opportunity to speak with Eric LaMontagne, Outreach Coordinator.  After several meetings, we decided that the Vermont Beef Industry Council (VBIC) and LCI should partner up to grow a new marketing and promotional opportunity to leverage limited financial resources while promoting two great proteins...fish and beef, a surf and turf theme.  The VBIC jumped on board to sponsor the LCI Fishing Derby that occurs on Fathers Day weekend.  I am glad that we did!The three-day event was organized, fueled by volunteers, great family fun, and I believe, successful.   As executive director, I challenged our board of directors to invest producer Check-Off dollars in the LCI Fishing Derby for the great exposure to an audience who already were hearty beef consumers.  There was another reason to leverage Check-Off dollars.  With time and education, we are able to demonstrate cause and effect.  The VT Cattle Industry has, for well over a decade, made huge gains in collaborating with other industry partners like LCI to change management practices in an effort to restore our largest body of water, Lake Champlain to a pristine and livable lake for all to enjoy. Vermont farmers are excellent stewards of the land and are working very hard to be responsible stewards of Lake Champlain and other lakes, ponds and streams because they recognize that water is non-renewable.  We know today that there are many other sources of pollution to our water systems including towns, municipalities, the private sector and industries.    
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	162289		/users/profile/215376	trduclos	Volunteer	5	07/09/2013	I have volunteered many times with LCI, weighing and recording fish as well as running fish back to the water.  The work of LCI is very important both in supporting the conservation of Lake Champlain as well as engaging the citizens as stewards of the lake.  We need more organizations like LCI that work both with the people as well as scientists, government, and partners in order to collectively manage, conserve, and protect our clean and healthy waters and all the ecosystems that such support.  Thanks you LCI!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	162194		/users/profile/215269	lmcVT	Volunteer	5	07/08/2013	Let's Go Fishing! is a wonderful program to not only teach Vermont youth the joys of fishing, but also environmental ethics and responsibly, basic ecology, and works to foster a connection and respect for the great outdoors. As an environmental educator, it is great to see programs like this available to youth and families across the state. In a age of increasing disconnect from our the natural world, Let's Go Fishing works to restore that connection and respect for a life long connection to our local environments and natural worlds around us. Having lead a Let's Go Fishing workshop, I have seem first hand how the experience of exploring the world around us can influence a child, along with the whole family. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	161990		/users/profile/214908	nancy.rehm	General Member of the Public	5	07/03/2013	Lake Champlain International was instrumental in thwarting an effort by some townhouse community members to reinstate the use of herbicides on the lawns.  Ross Saxton, Director of Conservation and Education,  responded to my request to speak at a board meeting to outline the negative a effects of pesticide use and to suggest alternatives as our community borders on a tributary to Lake Champlain.  Mr. Saxton spoke knowledgeably and professionally with a calm demeanor which helped to defuse a contentious meeting.   Mr. Saxton's presentation helped to persuade a few fence sitters to vote to abandon the use of pesticides.  Thanks to Lake Champlain International for your efforts to improve the quality of Lake Champlain.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	161529		/users/profile/214241	philsoltau	Volunteer	5	06/26/2013	I have volunteered for LCI on a number of occasions,  As they say in their literature, they work hard for a "fishable, swimable, drinkable lake".  All of their efforts are directed toward that end.  They not only sponsor the enormously popular Lace Champlain International Fishing Derby every Fathers' Day Weekend, but they use the funds generated to increase their outreach into the entire lake watershed.  I have helped with getting the word out about the "Blue" program, designed to help homeowners upgrade their properties to prevent runoff into the lake.  I have also assisted with children's outreach and education.  LCI is an organization focused on its goals.   I am proud to be associated with it.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	147840		/users/profile/195614	CRK6	General Member of the Public	5	01/08/2013	LCI is a powerhouse of an organization working tirelessly for clean water, happy fish, and happy people. Their policy and advocacy work reaches out locally, regionally, and nationally with an articulate, thoughtful, timely, and unwavering voice.  Vermonters are lucky to have LCI speaking on their behalf.

I find the LCI people to be dedicated, hard-working, and great folks to work with. Lake Champlain is one of Vermont's best natural resources, and they work tirelessly to keep its beauty and use available to all.

I have always been treated with the utmost respect by organizers and fellow volunteers. Whenever I've confirmed to a volunteer opportunity I was always met with strong guidance regarding my role at the event. I have found a clear understanding of their mission and sense of purpose in the community, to be quite powerful among event attendees. I look forward to many summer evenings on a swimmable, fishable, drinkable lake and I owe that in part to LCI.

Lake Champlain International (LCI)	131210		/users/profile/176767	MichaelD.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2012	My relationship with LCI started with entering my son and I in the LCI Father's day fishing derby.  It has continued as a relationship for my guide and charter service.  The staff at LCI do an amazing job of both promoting and conserving the Lake Champlain watershed.  Their staff write pertinent and informed articles in their monthly newsletter.  They do a fantastic job of balancing recreational and business promotion of the Lake while putting conservation of this national treasure into every decision.  This is certainly a winning combination for all involved.  The staff has also invited my son to their office and brought him onboard as a monthly columnist.  It is rare that such a big organization can take the time to see the value of an 11 year old's opinion and knowledge.  All around a fantastic organization. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	131205		/users/profile/62958	rvqua83	Board Member	5	10/30/2012	LCI has become the leading advocacy group , in the public or private sector, for Lake Champlain. As a board member I'm extremely pleased to see LCI's public perception evolve from a fishing derby promoter to a leader in the restoration and preservation of Lake Champlain. Hopefully, more people will become to understand the value of the lake and the need for more people to become stewards of this wonderful gem of nature. Thanks to those of you who have made the decision to assume a role of stewardship in this cause. It is apparent that many of you have chosen to support LCI with your time and your money. A great way to express your stewardship.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58833		/users/profile/62958	rvqua83	Volunteer	5	12/15/2010	I have been both fiscally and physically involved with LCI for the past several years. They are the sole environmental group to which I donate my time and money. Simply because they are far and away the most influential and productive organization involved in restoring and protecting Lake Champlain.I must admit to a love affair with this grand lake. It was that love that caused me to become a resident of Vermont, after many years vacationing here. At no time am I happier and at peace than when I'm on the lake.In addition to what it means to me personally, I also recognize the enormous economic engine that the lake is for the state of Vermont. Fishing people , like myself, contribute over $200,000,000 to the economy each year. In 2009 professional bass tournaments run out of Plattsburgh, N.Y. generated an estimated $8,400,000 to the PLattsburgh economy.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	130984		/users/profile/176513	jmaroney	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2012	Lake Champlain International stands for swimmable, drinkable, fishable water. Which of us does not agree that Vermont's signature lake should be all of these and more?  Vermont is the Green State and yet the state could do more to help the lake live up to its reputation. LCI is the best advocate in Montpelier for a clean lake.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	130687		/users/profile/176180	GaryM	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2012	The LCI is "The" group for Lake Champlain advocacy. Tireless advocates for the use and protection of the lake, they treat all issues with equal regard, and they are not afraid to ruffle a few feathers in the process. Keep up the good work LCI.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	130288		/users/profile/175759	MarkRedmond	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2012	I cannot say enough good about LCI.  I am executive director of another nonprofit in VT caring for homeless and at-risk teenagers.  Last year LCI provided a way for our teens to be out on Lake Champlain, which is a goal we had had for years.  We run a series of homes for kids, all near the Lake, yet none of our kids had ever been out on the Lake, fishing or anything else.  LCI finally made that possible, and for that I will always be grateful.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	129808		/users/profile/62752	Digitroll	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	The LCI is a dedicated group of people that help educate our community and stick up for a cleaner Lake Champlain.  They represent not only anglers of the fishing community, but the public's best interest.  It goes way beyond a fishing derby!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58718		/users/profile/62752	Digitroll	General Member of the Public	5	12/12/2010	This organization is top notch from top to bottom.  They reach out to everyone and promote family participation.   LCI at the ballpark is one of my favorites for my young children and myself as a parent proud to be associated with LCI and Bobber Bob.    They have great programs that reach out to kids that are less fortunate and provide them with fishing rods and tackle and mentoring them to spark there interest in fishing.  It's thru an activity like fishing that bonds family and kids that lasts a lifetime.   The folks that run this organization are some of the hardest working individuals and are very dedicated to it's success.   What LCI means to me is way beyond the stereo typical fishing derbies that are for profit.  They lobby for sportsman and give everyone a common voice in the sportsman's best interest.  Things like lamprey control are high on the list of projects that have improved Lake Champlain salmon / trout fishing to a world class fishery like the Great Lakes.  James is a true steward and advocate for our lake.  With his help and his LCI team future generations will look back at this golden age of our lake (2010 and beyond) and say he did all the right things to turn this ship around off course from years of neglect. Thank you James and the LCI! Ronald Winter

Lake Champlain International (LCI)	129523		/users/profile/174888	forrestd	Volunteer	5	10/26/2012	My wife and I volunteer for the yearly LCI - Fathers Day Derby.  I am a weigh captain at one of the weigh-in stations and my wife does the paperwork as the anglers come in to report their fish.  We have volunteers at this event for 8 years.  The LCI does an awesome job for promoting this event which is a catch and release.  This event has been going on for 31 years.   The profits made gone towards education of environment and water ways.  They also  help in keeping  Lake Champlain clean.          This event usually attracts approx 5-6,000 anglers each year.  With this event, there are many volunteers who have a great time doing so along with making friends and new friends every year.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	129165		/users/profile/174523	Dean.RUstc	Donor	5	10/25/2012	The Lake Champlain International is a unique Non-Profit in that its strength comes from the determination of the dedicated volunteers and the thousands of donors who join forces every year to promote the LCI through various events and Fishing Derbies.    It is through these events that the good work of the LCI is spread via word of mouth across the map.  Many of these events provide friends and families opportunities to partake in the beauty of Lake Champlain and feel the resolve to support the LCI in their work to protect this national resource. My brother introduced me to the LCI 20 years ago and I have been Fishing the LCI Fathers Day Derby ever since.  What was just a few of us is now a large group of people, husbands, wives, sons & daughters traveling to spend time together.  This creates memories that we cherish and a bonding with the need to protect Lake Champlain for future generations. The net of Fishing an LCI event is just this - Everyone Wins!  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	128873		/users/profile/174146	Weston D.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	Lake Champlain International puts on a series of high-profile fishing-related events on Lake Champlain every year, bringing together stakeholders from fishing, conservation and policy points of view to raise awareness and raise funds to improve the overall health of Lake Champlain and the surrounding watershed. This organization makes big splash each year with their Father's Day fishing derby, in which over 5,000 participants take to Lake Champlain to participate in a 3-day event that emphasizes sportsmanship, conservation, and appreciation of the great resource that Lake Champlain is for its diverse fishery and for the impact that a healthy lake has on the local community. I highly recommend and fully endorse the efforts that Lake Champlain International brings to the Lake Champlain basin. Their results speak for themselves.

As a member, a friend and a fellow colleague I applaud LCIs constant efforts and dedication in providing solutions and protecting the Lake from the pollution. In particular, their achievements in educating and spreading public awareness about the Lake water quality and challenging the current water policies that ought to be changed. Aleksandra
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	109558		/users/profile/149274	Unkee	General Member of the Public	5	04/10/2012	They've got the best fishing tournament because they invest in lake and promote taking care of the surrounding environment.  When I started fishing in the LCI Derby I never thought that I would care for much more than the fishing itself, but this organization while making the fishing better has opened my eyes to much more.  The fishing gets better every year AND so does Lake Champlain itself.  LCI has responded to my suggestions for the Derby over the years and now I also go to them with questions about the fish and their recovery programs.  Thank you to a great organization keep it up!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	109050		/users/profile/148386	bgdaddyrb	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2012	I have been fishing the LCI for so many years I've lost track.  I had never taken the time to write to the organization with my suggestions for changes, but this year I decided to.  Not only did i hear back immediately - from two people, including James Ehlers - but they really wanted to talk and explore my ideas.   This reinforced my belief that the LCI is all about excellence and integrity.  It's clear that they want to do what is best for the lake, the anglers, and of course the fish too.   My hat is off to James and the rest of the LCI team.  Keep up the great work, and we'll see you at the derby!
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	88974		/users/profile/100700	TDUB	General Member of the Public	5	05/20/2011	As a native Vermonter who regularly participates in the sport-fishing community, I have witnessed firsthand the outstanding work that the Lake Champlain International has done to help promote conservation, water quality, and family values. I spend close to 100 days a year chasing after the numerous sport-fish that swim in Lake Champlain, so I have a vested interest when it comes to preserving this great resource.  The work that the LCI has done over the years to support this fishery has been invaluable.  Initiatives promoting things like catch and release, invasive species control, and parasite removal have all helped to make this one of the top fishing destinations in the country.  In addition, the LCI's underlying focus on improving overall water quality is a task that must be pursued to maintain this resource for future generations.   
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	88792		/users/profile/100259	catchandrelease	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2011	As a professional environmental consultant and an avid fisherman, I can't say enough about Lake Champlain International (LCI). This organization is vital to the health of Lake Champlain, which in turn is vital to the economic health, especially in the summer months for Vermont and New York.  The LCI Father's Day Derby is a highlight of our summers. It's a great way to start the summer once school has ended. My son and I fish the derby with another friend and his boys. This annual event is so much more than just catching fish, it's about teaching our sons lessons in fishing and in life. Time spend on the water without today's distractions is priceless. Thank you LCI for all that you do, keep up the great work.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	88496		/users/profile/99685	Karen	Professional with expertise in this field	4	05/09/2011	The  organization provides its members with suggestions for improving the health of Lake Champlain as well as a good overview of Lake Champlain's health and sources of problems. They have been very willing to include volunteer opportunities to improve and protect water quality to the organizations' website and newsletters. In addition, they have passed on information about lake friendly lawn care to derby participants. Our education dollars are limited and they have helped to spread the message further then we could on our own. 
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	84748		/users/profile/94094	WildFisherWoman	General Member of the Public	5	04/04/2011	LCI is a great organization that cares about the greater good of Lake Champlain and its resources.

LCI is a best friend to Lake Champlain and her tributaries. This is because they raise public awareness to the issues threatening our waterways. i have great memories of the LCI Derby. some of the best times of my life were spent with my father, friends and family on this beautiful lake. The next generation needs to be involved with the preservation of this treasure as well. Water quality will be an ongoing issue. We need to educate the public to make them aware of all that Lake Champlain International does for us and for our lake. Imagine the unimaginable - Vermont and New York without a Lake Champlain! Let's keep it our most treasured resource.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58773		/users/profile/62845	SmadaEvad	Board Member	4	12/14/2010	Simply put, LCI is one of the best advocates for clean water and great fishing on Lake Champlain.  The Fathers Day Derby is the LCI signature event and brings awareness to this great resource that both Vermont and New York share.  The slogan of this event "Family, friends, and fishing" captures the true essence of this organization, and now as we move in to our 30th year of the derby, we have gone "generations deep" and provided millions of memories to be shared by generations over and over again.  Being part of these family memories and helping to create a weekend that some will never forget, makes LCI a top notch organization that has the best interest of the lake in mind.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58689		/users/profile/62698	Craig	Donor	5	12/11/2010	Lake Champlain International is dedicated to improving the Lake so that all whom fish, swim and boat can do so throughout their lifetime. As a private donor,  I have enjoyed our Lake Champlain for 40 years and wish to see our children understand the complexities and challenges of sustaining this Lake's water quality. Under the leadership of James Ehlers, the LCI  Board and a dedicated staff, many citizens are coming to learn our responsibilities as stewards of Lake Champlain. It does take many concerned and educated villagers to raise a trout.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58505		/users/profile/62332	Mike Brigham	Board Member	5	12/06/2010	I started volunteering with Lake Champlain International about 10 years ago, helping out with weigh station operations during the annual Father's Day Derby which is the organization's primary revenue generating mechanism.  I was very impressed with James, Keith, Danielle, Frank, Gray, and the small team running the operation that when I was asked to become a Board member I readily accepted the invitation. The mission of the organization is something I very strongly support and was also a big draw for me to become a Board member.  In the time I've been involved with Lake Champlain International, we have grown from a plucky group working our hardest to simply survive to a thriving organization that has an ability to really focus on it's mission. It has been an impressive transition in that time, and I anticipate even better things to come as we continue to grow and diversify our organization.

As a new board member I am delighted to dedicate some time to increasing awareness of LCI, to educate Vermonters on the issues our beautiful resource faces, and ways others can get involved to help make a difference too.  
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58485		/users/profile/62291	bobshannon	Board Member	4	12/05/2010	In my professional life I own a shop that is geared toward fishing & hunting and teaching people how to be good stewards of the environment. For over 20 years my staff and I have taken thousands of individuals out on fishing adventures and becoming a Board Member with LCI was to make sure I help maintain our lakes, rivers, streams and ponds for future generations.
Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58434		/users/profile/62196	pappyperkinson	Board Member	5	12/03/2010	I serve on the board of LCI because the health of Lake Champlain affects me in almost every aspect of my life as a resident of the Champlain Valley.  I want a clean lake so my kids can swim in the water without fear of getting sick.  I want a healthy lake so that  we can all enjoy the recreation opportunities and beauty provided by clean water.  I want a lake that attracts tourists to visit and compels residents to stay because both are essential to maintaining the Champlain Valley as a viable economic player not only in the region, but world-wide.  I have worked for LCI for many years and dedicated hundreds of hours to advancing its mission.  I do this because of all the reasons mentioned above and because LCI has demonstrated not only a commitment to enhancing and protecting Lake Champlain, but a real ability to accomplish positive changes.

Lake Champlain International (LCI)	58095		/users/profile/61697	fstanley	Board Member	5	11/29/2010	Having grown up on Lake Champlain, I understand how important the lake is to so many people like myself.  The memories of swimming out to the raft with friends , fishing with dad and boating with the entire family will always be a part of me.  Getting involved with an organization that watches out for the health of Lake Champlain and the rivers and streams that feed it, was an easy one.  The time and energy I volunteer goes directly back into preserving what I have cherished throughout the years and will help ensure my children and others do not have the opportunities that clean water provides, taken away.   Our Father's Day Fishing Derby brings together thousands of families and  friends to celebrate our Lake Champlain heritage and I cannot think of a better, more exciting and cultural event I would rather be a part of.  Seeing a youngster beside his family, holding that big fish, with a smile from ear to ear is what makes it a thrill for me.  Our Lake is counting on everyone to pitch in and in  many ways, big and small.Lake Champlain International, Inc is working diligently and tirelessly to get that word out and supplying solutions to our pollution problems.

Unlike some other Guatemalan NGOs, Wuqu' Kawoq is widely respected in the communities they serve, and for good reason: they offer high quality medical services in a linguistically and culturally responsible way.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	311528		/users/profile/402885	Rosa8	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	The most enriching experience so far!. I have around 6 years of work experience for profit organizations and I have never seen employees that passionate as I saw in MYH. They simply enjoy what they do, no matter what sort of adversities of challenge they might face. They know that their work is changing the life of many indigenous people. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	309695	1	/users/profile/401044	ssrikanth	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2016	I personally know employees at Wuqu' Kowaq and have seen first hand seen their commitment to improving healthcare access to Maya communities in Guatemala. I had the pleasure of serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in Panama with an employee of Wuqu' Kowaq and saw his drive and desire to help impoverished individuals not only in his community but throughout the country. Having an employee like my colleague from Panama speaks volumes of Wuqu' Kowaq. I know for a fact that he brings this same commitment to his work in Guatemala and will continue in the future.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	309367		/users/profile/400734	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/10/2016	Wow. Where to start. I can say from my experience working at Wuqu' Kawoq and then speaking with other volunteers at NGOs around Guatemala that WK sets itself apart. Through the populations they are focusing on, their high standard of care, their collaboration and integration with communities, their commitment to their staff... todos! Their staff is 95% Guatemalan and well-trained, they commit to their patients for life, and they do not shy away from complex cases (diabetes, cancers, malnutrition, etc.). The work environment is organized and supportive. They focus on research as well and publish their findings so that others can benefit from their knowledge and expertise.  Can't say enough good things about this organization. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	308833		/users/profile/400211	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	I am a volunteer with Wuqu' Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance and I could not speak more highly of this organization. I have been able to see first hand, through working in the office and going out in the field with their doctors and community health workers, the amazing work they are doing to reach the most marginalized populations in Guatemala. Wuqu' Kawoq health workers always speak to patients in their native language, whether that is Spanish or one of the Mayan languages, and treat their patients with a great deal of compassion and respect. They travel hours into rural areas to provide patients with life saving medical care. I have seen children lifted out of malnutrition through Wuqu' Kawoq's intensive nutrition program, and diabetes patients spared a life with disability through the organization's provision of expensive medications at no cost to the patient. Additionally, Wuqu' Kawoq is continuously conducting research in women's health, nutrition, diabetes, and many other areas to improve their programs and further contribute to global health knowledge and program development.

From the experience first hand, I have now become a regular donor and enjoy following the phenomenal work that this organization is doing for the poorest of the poor in Guatemala.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	290921		/users/profile/381260	Stephen63	Volunteer	5	05/24/2016	A lot of great work by this group on the ground in Guatemala.  They are dedicated to providing healthcare in the native language of many indigenous peoples in the mountains and rural areas of the country.  I went with a group of physicians and students from Cincinnati, and we had great support from the administrative staff and wonderful interpreters.  Great people working to fight the lack of adequate healthcare for indigenous peoples in Guatemala.Family Medicine Physician from Cincinnati

I have extensive experience in global health around the world, including long-term work, and am thankful for the model and work of Wuqu' Kawoq.  
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	285231		/users/profile/375210	Student876	Volunteer	5	04/07/2016	This past winter I observed at Wuqu' Kawoq for college credit. I was blown away by the organization's commitment to their mission. They serve an unbelievable amount of patients with a wide range of effective, quality care. They treat patients as unique individuals, and so their treatments, too, are uniquely individualized. The large majority of the staff at Wuqu' Kawoq is Guatemalan and they continue to hire more locals to help in their mission. Everyone either speaks Kaqchikel or is taking classes, which is one way they promote the revitalization of indigenous culture. Their dedication to transparency is unmatched by any NGO I have experienced. If there were any one NGO that could create true, long-lasting social change,  this is it! 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	284939		/users/profile/374990	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	It has been a pleasure to work with Wuku' Kawoq through my university. The organization is incredibly well-run, and it is obvious that the staff are deeply invested in and committed to the success of the mission. I saw firsthand some of the work they are doing in rural communities, and patients and families were so grateful, sometimes to the point of tears, for the care they were receiving.

They have been able to successfully negotiate many barriers to health care and operations in Guatemala and provide exceptional service to their clients.  The staff knows and reflects those they serve and they are organizationally sound, avoiding the chaotic operations that plague many similar nonprofits.  From top to bottom, their staff is dedicated and the families they serve really do benefit and appreciate their service.  I hope to continue to work with WK in the future and do what I can to further their efforts.  
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	275015	1	/users/profile/364560	tmelvin2	Board Member	5	12/27/2015	Wuqu' Kawoq is an organization truly focused on improving the lives of the patients it serves and the communities it operates within. As a board member, I can say from personal experience, that members of the organization consistently think long and hard about how to utilize time and resources to make the most important impacts. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	270524	1	/users/profile/359244	Brittany A.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	Wuqu' Kawoq is an authentic, dedicated and ethical organization.  They are a passionate and driven group people whose roles range from physicians, nurses, and nutritionists to anthropologists, teachers and community health workers who are all working together towards a common goal.  I had the privilege of spending nearly two weeks in Tecpan, Guatemala, working closely with Wuqu' Kawoq as a member of their first large group of medical professionals.  Immediately upon arrival, I knew that this was the organization we had been looking for in a partner.  It was clear that this organization was different from others I had worked with in the past, in so many ways.    The leadership was clear from the start about their values and intentions: first, to provide high quality health care to those who need it most.  Second, to provide care that is culturally relevant and provided in each patient's own native language.  Finally, to create sustainable change that meets the needs of the whole person and whole community.  These values were upheld throughout our entire trip.  Throughout our stay we went out to  each day to different communities in which Wuqu' Kawoq is already trusted and well respected.  The fact that patients we had never met were willing to open to us and share very  personal information spoke to the trust that is already established in these communities.  We went with community health workers who live and thrive in the very communities in which they serve- which reinforced the importance of autonomy and independence that are so often lacking in the field of global health.  We were not pressured to focus on the numbers and see as many patients as possible, but rather to provide the highest quality of care possible.  Each patient was provided care in their preferred language, as we worked alongside some very passionate and dedicated interpreters.  Not only did we feel that we were providing care for the short term, we truly felt these patients would be well-cared for in the long-term.  Wuqu' Kawoq  has a system in place for follow-up care, specialty referrals, and well-rounded health education and nutrition programs- and I cannot stress enough how significant this is.   I was truly blown away by the quality of our experience and by how well cared for we were during our stay.  We were kept safe, and our hosts worked extremely hard to work alongside us for long hours each day to provide our patients with excellent care.  They taught me so much about Guatemalan culture, and about the provision of ethical, culturally relative health care in an under-resourced setting.  I hope that we can maintain a strong relationship and partnership with Wuqu' Kawoq for years to come! 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	270090	1	/users/profile/358815	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	My students and I recently were involved on a trip with this organization.  They could not have been more open and sincere about their mission to help indigenous people gain access to quality healthcare.  The community health workers affiliated with Wuqu Kawoq were amazing in their compassion and eagerness to learn.  Everyone we encountered could not have been more helpful in the information, education and insight they provided. I've been on similar trips for the past 13 years with different NGOs in various countries.  This is one of my best experiences in terms of mission, organization and safety.  It is the overall best in the desire to provide quality continuity of care to those who are often hesitant to seek healthcare due to difficult but understandable reasons.  This was striking to me in contrast to some groups who focus on quantity of people seen over either quality or continuity.   Anne's expertise in evaluating NGOs in the past is a huge asset, as is her passion and dedication.  It was a pleasure.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	269692		/users/profile/358416	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	I had the opportunity to work with Wuqu' Kawoq through my university.  I traveled to their different village clinic sites and worked with their Community Healthcare Workers to provide medical/pharmacy care.  They are caring, informative, and genuinely invested in the well-being of the Indigenous Mayan people.  They have a solid, sustainable plan that focuses on building trust and bringing quality healthcare to people who would not receive care otherwise.  It was a privilege to work with them.  I hope I have the opportunity to go back and work with them again.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	268992	1	/users/profile/357723	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I am a pharmacy student who recently worked with Wuqu'Kawoq in Guatemala for 12 days with a group of medical residents and pharmacy students. During our time there, we worked with the doctors, nurses, translators, and other members of the NGO on the ground to provide medical care to about 250 patients in different villages around the country. We also identified difficult or complex cases for the organization to  follow up with after our visit was over. I was extremely impressed with how much trust and respect the native Guatemalans had for the members of Wuqu'Kawoq; this is a relationship they have built over almost 10 years of working with members of the community towards sustainable and comprehensive healthcare. I feel that, in combination with this organization's efforts, during our trip we were able to make a real difference in the lives of the Guatemalan people.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	268988		/users/profile/357718	Beth157	Volunteer	5	10/29/2015	I volunteered with a medical brigade from the University of Cincinnati. Wuku Kawoq is a genuine organization that does what it says. Furthermore, they took great care of us while we there. Most of the meals were delicious, and we were always escorted to where we were going. Kate even had our laundry done while we there. This org definitely goes above and beyond for their community and those that help them serve it! 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	268592	1	/users/profile/357324	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/28/2015	Wuqu' Kawoq has created a service like no other to the Mayan community within Guatemala. I experienced this first hand when I volunteered as a RN/Nurse Practitioner Student this past October (2015). I was part of their first medical brigade not by lack of coordination or ability of this 8 year old organization but because they have waited until it was a thoughtful gesture. It seemed as though they wanted to establish a repoire (of which they were very successful) before they plopped American healthcare into the mix of things.  Their work with the "prometoras", or community workers, is outstanding. They have truly committed time and effort into training people of the community to care and manage for their own. While I was there, I had the opportunity to work with many of these heart warming people and educate them on health promotion topics. It is apparent how well this shows the worth and value that Wuku' Kawoq instills into the people it wants to help.  The greatest work of this organization comes in the form of language. They have incredibly skilled translators that speak the indigenous Mayan languages as well as Spanish and English. This delivers the care in the most appropriate and compassionate way possible. Those who only speak the indigenous languages now have access to a form of healthcare that was before unattainable due to a language barrier.  Another impressive feature of Wuqu' Kawoq is there persistence with having an electronic medical record for their patients. This means that the patient has documented care, a history of visits that can be refereed to by providers, and creates efficiency for the patient. Again, their dedication to long term care for this community resounds within their actions.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	268448		/users/profile/357179	ChrisSD	Volunteer	5	10/28/2015	I had the great opportunity to work with Wuqu' Kawoq for two weeks in Tecpan, Guatemala. I spent that time working in rural villages with Wuqu' Kawoq's "Saving Brains" program, which provides nutritional assistance to impoverished children in order to support their proper mental and physical development. I also worked to improve Wuqu' Kawoq's internal tech systems, to better support the organization's growing operational demands. Every day, I was newly impressed with the dedication and passion of the team there, who manage to bring much-needed medical support to so many people in a rural setting and that is quite operationally complex. I have worked with or observed a number of international NGOs in my life, but have not seen one as effective in bringing medical support to those most in need as  Wuqu' Kawoq.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	261656		/users/profile/350277	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/05/2015	I committed to work as the Complex Care Coordinator for 1 year with Maya Health Alliance | Wuqu' Kawoq starting in April 2015 . Before beginning with MHA | WK, I thought I understood the limits of what medical organizations are capable of achieving in a rural setting in Guatemala. I had worked with several NGOs within Guatemala previously, and believed that some barriers to accessing healthcare are too extensive to overcome. How wrong I was. Nothing could have prepared me for how impressed I am and how proud I feel to be a part of the MHA | WK team. This organization goes above and beyond in terms of patient care. They GO to their patients - via (a combo of) car, bus, boat, on foot - sometimes taking hours just to arrive at one patient's house. Why? Because they understand that the hardest patients to get to, are those most in need of care. Why else? Because in these communities there is no way to understand the fundamental reasons behind a patient's condition and be able to effectively treat that condition, without seeing where and how the patient lives. MHA strives to deliver quality care that exceeds not just Guatemalan standards, but US standards. They work within and alongside the government healthcare system to fill the holes that usually block the indigenous population from receiving care. To this NGO, patient care is more than just a consult and follow-up at a clinic. It is about facilitating trust and partnership with the patients. Cultural sensitivity is an integrated peice of their model, and all employees - both local and extranjero - learn to speak the indigenous Mayan language of the patients. MHA strives to build capacity and empower the local communities to take control of their health and of their lives.  Furthermore, they publish! MHA | WK has run many empirical investigations and has shared their results with the global health community. Even though their focus is in Guatemala, they understand that conditions and diseases present here are examples of larger global health issues. There has never been a dull moment in my 6 months of working for this NGO. I recommend anyone and everyone to take a look at this organization, because they are truly the most cutting-edge NGO offering healthcare services in Guatemala.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	261100		/users/profile/349695	kedouglas	Volunteer	5	10/02/2015	Wuqu' Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance is truly unique in the NGO field. The focus on patient rights and patient dignity, especially with respect to culture, is second-to-none. I have never seen a team so dedicated to working within local indigenous languages and bringing healthcare to those that truly need it most. In my time as a volunteer, I have gotten to see how hardworking all the staff at WK is. The on-the-ground team comes to work with passion and enthusiasm every day, traveling to remote communities--and often walking hours in the mountains--to bring health care directly to our patients.  What is truly amazing is the accompaniment that WK emphasizes. We stay with our patients from beginning to end, helping them navigate confusing hospitals and long trips to receive care, always having an open phone line for communication, and taking those extra minutes to understand a patient's life. Working with Wuqu' Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance is an incredible opportunity to see global health work at its best!
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	253834	1	/users/profile/342088	PeterCoochMD	Volunteer	5	08/24/2015	I am a pediatrician from San Francisco that spent 7 weeks with WK this summer--two weeks studying Kaqchikel and 5 weeks working with their malnutrition and complex pediatric patient care coordination. I have never been more impressed with an organization--especially the dedication, skill, and diversity of their staff. WK is carrying out some of the most innovative, culturally progressive, and comprehensive healthcare outreach that I believe exists in global health today. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	252595	2	/users/profile/340678	grfletcher	Volunteer	5	08/11/2015	As you can see with all the other glowing reviews, WK does terrific medical and public health work in some of the neediest areas of Guatemala by placing a high value on linguistic competence and respect for the patients they serve. These reviews also show one of their other great strengths-- building a coalition of smart people who care deeply about providing quality care to poor, indigenous, and marginalized Guatemalans. The staff, volunteers, and interns work tirelessly at tasks that can seem Sisyphean in this context, whether that be reversing the effects of chronic malnutrition, managing complex diabetes, or accompanying cancer patients through a sea of red tape. And they're able to achieve amazing results. I am constantly impressed and inspired by WK's work and plan to continue to support them forever. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	252394	1	/users/profile/340434	cl7eh	Volunteer	5	08/10/2015	I am continually humbled and inspired by the work of Wuqu' Kawoq, an organization that places high value on respect and compassion for everyone involved. They speak the language of their patients and they treat them as humans who deserve the best care. I had the pleasure of interning with WK for close to a year, and during my experience, there was always something new that impressed me, whether it was the amazing dedication each staff member exhibited in their mission to providing the best health care to their communities, or the gratitude and sincerity each patient demonstrated for the concept of care - a concept that is so simple, yet is often more of a privilege than it is a priority. I watched as a staff member would get up at 4 AM so that she could help her patients arrive at the public hospital in Guatemala City for complicated surgeries, waiting with them in the lobby, and accompanying them as she could, so that she could act as a mediator and translator between the patients and the doctors, whom often don't speak the same language. I watched as another staff member would visit her patients in their homes to check up on them, to educate them, and overall to just care for them as human beings. I watched as she spent time understanding the needs of her patients, often spending hours at a time with each one. I walked with her for an hour to get from one house visit to the next, in a rural community where people have to walk two hours just to reach the nearest grocery store. I listened as patients would tell me the difficulties they have navigating their own health care system, the ways in which they face discrimination, and their simple wishes to be able to live happy and healthy. Often, these patients are indigenous and come from rural communities, where they are not able to access health care resources easily. More than that, they are not able to access these resources in their own native language. They feel uncared for and unheard in their own country. The sad matter of fact is that the word "indigenous" could be the difference between receiving health care and not. On behalf of the patients, I'd like to say thank you to WK. Thank you for caring for them, and thank you for making their voices heard. There aren't enough people in the world who understand how important that really is.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	248207	1	/users/profile/335905	carlson.lauren	Volunteer	5	07/13/2015	As an intern with Wuqu' Kawoq over the past few weeks, I am left most impressed by the level of dedication and compassion that the team members have for their patients. With high expectations for every role, whether someone was responsible for leading group classes, providing services for patients, or following up with patient home visits, I saw competence in both the services provided, as well as the approach that they were done. At the same time, this organization establishes relationships with other organizations and community leaders in every place they put their roots. As a medical student, I have learned so much on how to not allow yourself to compromise on the quality of services provided in a low-resource area. Neither heart nor skills were sacrificed.

From start to finish, Wuqu' Kawoq was extremely organized and every single staff member touched my heart. They are an extremely dedicated, compassionate group of people. I admire the work that they do in Guatemala and would recommend this organization to anyone.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	223122	1	/users/profile/286867	harambee78	Board Member	5	10/15/2014	I have been a Board member for Wuqu'Kawoq for several years and wish to say how incredibly and continually impressed I am with this organization, its leadership, and the work it does. There are literally thousands of NGOs in Guatemala, many of them focusing on health, but only a small handful address important health issues in ways that are sustainable and sensitive to the culture and language of the people they serve. Wuqu'Kawoq is one of these. It take anthropology and linguistics as serious as it does medicine. Let me give you just one example. One big problem in rural Guatemala is diabetes. A bigger problem than access to meds, however, is education: most people do not really understand the disease, what it is or how medication and diet can help them combat its effects. These things can be explained in Spanish, sure, but most rural Guatemalans do not speak Spanish, they speak a Mayan language. Wuqu'Kawoq staff speak these languages; moreover, to address the problem, they consulted with local Mayan linguists. In the end, they actually created a new word for 'diabetes' in the Kaqchikel language to replace the Spanish borrowing that was in use. The word they used translates directly to 'sweet blood.' This word has now allowed them to explain clearly to diabetics what is wrong with them (they have 'sweet blood') and how to make their blood 'less sweet!' People who have had the disease for years are finally understanding it! And that is allowing them to address their own illness! There are dozens of other examples of WK's amazing and unique effectiveness in addressing such issues (including many women's health issues, child malnutrition, complex surgical procedures, etc.). It is why I have given thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of my time over the years to this organization and will continue to do so as long as I am able. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	222237	1	/users/profile/285935	Haley Rhodes	Volunteer	5	10/13/2014	I am a current research intern with Wuqu' Kawoq in Tecpan, Guatemala where I am completing my thesis research. The longer I work for WK, the more proud I become of this organization. In fact, I am always so glad when someone asks me about WK because it gives me the opportunity to share about their wonderful work, dedication to ethical practices, and heart to reach those who often slip through the cracks. Reasons why I am impressed with WK: 1. Dedication to understanding the communities in which we work: Interns are asked to study history, literature, and a Mayan language. In my experience, this context has allowed me to understand the why the communities face the problems that they face and by learning Kaqchikel, I have shown the community that I am here to learn, not to bulldoze my way into the community. We also are able to communicate with patients who may speak "trade Spanish" but may not be able to communicate about a complex health issue. As I have talked with other NGOs in Guatemala, I have learned that this type of in-depth preparation is rare and I have seen that it limits the effectiveness of their intervention programs.  2. Exceptional staff: I am proud that the vast majority of WK staff are Guatemalans who speak indigenous languages and that all staff members are exceptional teachers and team-players. I have been warmly welcomed into the WK family where I continue to learn every day from my co-workers. My experience with WK has allowed me to be independent, but also well supported by the staff. 3. Collaboration with communities and other NGOs: WK actively engages community leaders and women's groups as well as seeks partnerships with other NGOs so that we can be the most effective as possible and not duplicate services. In a country with over 15,000 NGOs (and unfortunately many are poor managed), WK  takes the most challenging cases that other NGOs are not equipped to provide services.   I am thrilled that I was referred to WK by a professor and I plan to continue to work with WK. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	222111	2	/users/profile/285798	BorieKenny	Volunteer	5	10/12/2014	I am a family physician practicing in rural Vermont.  After 30 plus years, I wanted to give my time to a third world country that needed help.  My wife, who is a neonatal resuscitation instructor as part of her job as an Obstetrical nurse, accompanied me for a week with Peter Rohloff, MD, PhD and his fabulous team in Guatemala.  We worked hard giving instruction to the midwives and seeing patients in Diabetic, Pediatric and general Medical care clinics.  After the week was over and we had a chance to breath, we both could not believe how wonderful Wuqu Kawoq is with it's group of caring and dedicated professionals.  What separated them from many NGO's is continuity.  I was warned that some NGO's will just see patients and leave for 6 months.  Wuqu Kawoq had the organization on the ground to be there on a daily basis for the folks that used them for their medical care.  In addition, they were involved with nutrition and clean water.  The Noble peace prizes were just announced and the two recipients deserved it.  But, I would not be surprised if Wuqu Kawoq gets it some day.

Over the past few years I have seen first-hand how effective their programs are. Unlike some other Guatemalan NGOs, Wuqu' Kawoq is widely respected in the communities they serve, and for good reason: they offer high quality medical services in a linguistically and culturally responsible way.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	222072		/users/profile/285763	Joanne40	Volunteer	5	10/12/2014	I interned with Wuqu Kawoq over this past summer of 2014. I cannot speak more highly of this wonderful organisation. I was thoroughly impressed by the work Wuqu Kawoq is doing in the communities. As this was my first time volunteering in Guatemala, I was especially impressed by the hard working, knowledgeable and caring staff, who literally work around the clock, to ensure their communities are getting the health care services they need in a respectful and culturally-sensitive manner. I was also highly impressed by how hard Wuqu Kawoq is working at supporting and creating relationships between communities, other organisations, local and state government to ensure the needs of the communities they serve. As someone who wants to work on global health care issues in the future I have to say this was an amazing introduction to the field!  I hope to work again with this wonderful organisation!
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	221799		/users/profile/285491	PatrickJennings	Board Member	5	10/10/2014	As a Board Member for the past 2 years, I continue to be extremely impressed with Wuqu' Kawoq ,the dedication & skill of our entire team in Guatemala and their ability to make an extraordinarily positive impact on both individuals and the entire communities within which we're fortunate to work.  My wife and I have prioritized our own giving by making a significant multi-year financial commitment to Wuqu' Kawoq.  We believe deeply in the organization and its ability to make a sustainable positive contribution to the well-being of so many Guatemalan women, children and men.  We're most touched by the respect with which our staff treat community members to ensure that they receive the excellent care that they deserve, delivered in their maternal language (Maya languages).  I'm looking forward to accomplishing even more in the years ahead, especially with the help of our committed Donors.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	220522		/users/profile/284179	pegrdh	Volunteer	5	10/07/2014	I volunteered with Wuqu' Kawoq as a dental hygienist in January of 2014. A local pediatrician asked me to get involved offering oral health education, applying fluoride varnish and cleanings for children. I was thoroughly impressed with WK and I am eager to be involved in the future. This organization has an amazing variety of health care and nutritional services they offer for free. They care about the people they are serving as evidenced by their relationships. Their record-keeping and continued re-care is very important. Six months after we were there the midwives were applying fluoride varnish for the second time. I was delighted to see the level of commitment to oral health and their determination to see improvements. It was an honor to be involved with such a great organization. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	218011		/users/profile/281563	JorgeLB	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/28/2014	I work as advisor at Patzun Municipality, a local government in Guatemala. We started working together with Wuqu' Kawoq' on 2011 when they decided to organize the event "Encuentro Futuros Colectivos: creando redes en Guatemala" in the Municipality.The event was great because the number of presenters, the quality of then, the logistic and so on.But another thing I was to enfasize is the profesionalism how they work and then compromise with the community.After that event we organized also a Mayan Languajes Meeting two years ago and now we are preparing the next Encuentro Futuros Colectivos for this year.So, thank you very much to all the people involve on Wuqu' Kawoq' projects!!! 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	217112	1	/users/profile/280629	MDykstra	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	Volunteering with Wuqu' Kawoq was my second international health-related experience, and it exceeded my expectations in every way.  I witnessed their commitment to improving patient lives through community capacity building and services in the first language of their patients.  The importance of their holistic cultural and linguistic approach to health cannot be understated.  My summer spent in rural Guatemala inspired me to make global health a central pillar of my career and I aspire to do so while working with the committed and brilliant staff of Wuqu' Kawoq.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	215731		/users/profile/279175	KirstenA	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	 I am one of the doctors that works with Wuqu' Kawoq Since medical school I have worked with many different health NGOs in developing countries including Ghana, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Chile and was been repeatedly disillusioned by global health work until I found Wuqu' Kawoq.   The time I spend working with the organization has been so rewarding because there are the resources and infrastructure to provide high-quality care to my patients (not just "better than the medical care they would have received').   The term "community driven" is often used in global health but the work of Wuqu' Kawoq is truly determined by needs expressed by the communities with which we partner.  I have also never encountered a group of people as dedicated and hard working as the staff of Wuqu' Kawoq.  
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	215712		/users/profile/279151	PGarHur	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	As a Guatemalan with healthcare experience in rural settings, I could say there is no other NGO in Guatemala that provides high quality health care in Maya languages. Outstanding organization!
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	215659		/users/profile/279095	dflood011	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	Initially, I wanted to volunteer with Wuqu Kawoq  Maya Health Alliance because I desired more experience working in global health, and I had heard great things about the organization at my medical school. Before collaborating with Wuqu Kawoq, Id been working on various health projects in Latin America for about 5 years. However, I hadnt made a long-term commitment. My amazing volunteer experience -- especially the forging of bonds with staff, patients, and community members -- has compelled me to work with Wuqu Kawoq beyond my original year-long commitment, and I plan to continue collaborating with WK on nutrition and chronic disease projects over the coming years.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	160640	1	/users/profile/106655	bairdc	Volunteer	5	06/14/2013	I've had the privilege of volunteering for Wuku' Kawoq: Maya Health Alliance for the past four years, and I keep coming back for a reason...they know what they're doing. WK's unique blend of in-depth, mixed-methods ethnographic research and their policy of providing excellent health care free of charge to those who need it most has made, and continues to make, huge differences in the lives of people who are still recovering from the structural effects of a decades-long genocide and centuries of structural racism. Their approach is unique in the area, and uniquely effective.  I've seen the data myself (I'm a PhD student in applied anthropology); their success in ameliorating childhood malnutrition alone is well worth a five-star rating, and they do so much more than that.  In my time with them, I have seen them successfully treat diabetics, amputees, ophthalmology cases, cleft palates, congenital heart defects, various cancers...the list goes on and on.  In addition to arranging and providing free health care to those who truly can't afford it, WK acts as patient advocates in a world where the non-Spanish speaking indigenous individual is all too often swept aside.   I can't say enough about the beauty of their politics, their ethnography, their nutritional interventions, their hands-on care, and their research.  As far as I've seen in the past four years, they've excelled in everything they've attempted.   If you're truly interested in making a difference, if you want assurance that your money goes directly toward changing someone's life for the better, in the most efficient way possible, without being re-routed through administrative chains and lost somewhere in the process (which is the case with so many NGOs in the area) you could not choose a better NGO than WK.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	119157		/users/profile/106655	bairdc	Volunteer	5	07/23/2012	Wuqu' Kawoq, in my experience, stands alone among Guatemalan NGOs in its commitment to both linguistic and cultural competence in every single one of its endeavors.   Every project that I have seen them take on, and every individual within the organization, is consistently striving for excellence...a rarity in a world where the catchphrase of many non-profits is "most anything is better than nothing".  Spanish is not the first language for many Guatemalans-- this, combined with a pluralistic medical system and often extreme structural constraints can make decent health care an impossibility for a large part of the population.  WK's commitment to providing excellent care in Spanish, Kaqchikel, and Quiche, as well as their long-term ties to many communities, and their commitment to solid ethnographic research can-- and has-- meant the difference between life and death for many individuals, and given the organization's trajectory, will mean life and better health for many more.  I am currently training as a medical anthropologist, and my first introduction to WK was three years ago, during preliminary dissertation fieldwork and language training.  Since then, I have only grown more impressed with the organization and with the individuals involved, and I plan on continuing to work with WK throughout my graduate studies.  Wuqu' Kawoq is a blend of pragmatic healthcare and applied anthropology that I had only once hoped existed...and I feel privileged to be a volunteer for such an excellent and unparalleled institution.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	92908		/users/profile/106655	bairdc	General Member of the Public	5	06/29/2011	I was lucky enough to be able to work with Dr. Rohloff and the clinic staff for a short time last summer, and I came away very impressed with WK's personnel, staff, and mission.  Not only are they providing a much needed service, but they are doing it in ways that are culturally and linguistically competent- something that adds relevance to their work, and with it, efficacy.  The will to create change is not unique among NPOs, but their ability to do so can often be hampered by their ignorance of the cultural, structural, and material constraints that surround their area of interest.  This is not the case with Wuqu' Kawoq, and I doubt it ever will be, given its current trajectory.  Two thumbs way up.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	160627	1	/users/profile/55296	ClaireM	Volunteer	5	06/14/2013	I have volunteered and worked with Wuqu' Kawoq since 2009 and the work they do is truly amazing.  The dedication of their staff to the communities they serve is unmatched, and their commitment to collaboration and cooperation with other NGOs and Guatemalan entities is the key to building a more efficient, comprehensive service network in Guatemala. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54091		/users/profile/55296	ClaireM	Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	I first started working with Wuqu' Kawoq in February of 2009.  At that time I volunteered in two of their clinics.  The first in San Juan Comalapa at a clinic partnered with ACOTCHI a group of local midwives, and the second in Tecpn.  In both clinics I shadowed Dr. Peter Rohloff and Dr. Malcolm Hill to observe the logistics and process of providing health care in a persons first/indigenous language. In addition I maintained the pharmacy, and provided other additional services as needed.  I was very impressed at the level of trust Wuqu' Kawoq has been able to build within the communities they work.  There is a clear and obvious difference in the reactions of patients when they are able to express themselves in their native language. I am currently working as a field intern in Guatemala and will be here for a full year aiding in many of the current projects.  The majority of my time will be spent helping to create a clientele base of local women for a women's sexual and reproductive health service and education program we hope to have implemented in 2011.  This will include point-of-care testing for STI's, HIV, and cervical cancer, as well as sexual/reproductive health education classes, and access to contraceptives for no cost to the patient.

The language training I received from Wuqu' Kawoq has allowed me to complete research in Kaqchikel communities.  I was so impressed with the breadth of their work that I expanded my role to include volunteer in both their language and nutrition programs.  WK genuinely serves the communities in which it work.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	90464		/users/profile/103187	ixkawoq	Donor	5	06/11/2011	I have participated in Wuqu' Kawoq's language school which focuses on not only language learning, but also cultural competency. As part of the school i was able to witness the excellent work that WK does, especially with children and midwives.  Providing medical care in a person's first language is essential for positive health outcomes.  WK does this, but with a level of care and compassion that is unsurpassed.  The enthusiasm of volunteers and project participants speaks to the importance of their work.  Wuqu' Kawoq is truly a great nonprofit.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	160532	1	/users/profile/103199	Jillian M.	Volunteer	5	06/13/2013	I have been affiliated with Wuqu' Kawoq for the past two years and have participated in two language schools, nutrition research in two small communities, and pilot health research on Lake Atitln. Based on my observations and experiences, I believe the NGO to be exceptional for four main reasons. First, they take the time to learn about the places where they work by talking to community leaders and residents. Second, they collaborate with community members to develop sustainable projects that will not deteriorate once US staff leaves the country. Rather, Wuqu' Kawoq helps the communities to run these programs themselves. Third, they actively seek to collaborate with other NGOs and government entities in Guatemala. Rather than offer services already available, Wuqu' Kawoq finds its role and plays that role extremely well, for instance, in providing accompaniment to extremely ill patients that other NGOs meet in medical missions throughout the highlands. Finally, and most importantly, they provide all services in the languages spoken by these communities so that patients may communicate directly with their healthcare providers. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	90477		/users/profile/103199	Jillian M.	Volunteer	5	06/11/2011	Wuqu' Kawoq is a non-profit organization that works to strengthen the health and language of Kaqchikel Maya communities in Guatemala. They are dedicated to serving the people of these communities in their native language, Kaqchikel, and to address public health problems identified by community members. They have trained indigenous midwives, started child nutrition programs, installed water purification systems, and writing diabetes education materials in Kaqchikel. This organization has helped so many people and, with more funds, has the potential to change many more lives.

Even though I don't speak a second language, it was obvious the difference the doctors and staff were making. To see the time and care given to each patient was amazing. Although I haven't seen them in action since then, I've been a recurring donor since. I believe strongly that my donation is used thoughtfully and effectively.

The Wuqu Kawoq staff in Guatemala I have met through volunteering have been a great pleasure to work with and were very focused on community involvement.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	122751	1	/users/profile/167193	Goodtracks	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2012	I have been coming to Guatemala and taking note of Guatemalan affairs for 30 thirty years now since 1980.  There are many excellent NGO (non-government organizations) in the country that are doing fine work for and with the most impoverished and disenfranchised of the population, which frequently are the Indigenous Maya who make up more than half the total population of the country.  500 years of colonization, has kept and continues to keep the people impoverished.  The work of Wuqu Kawoq is truly unique in its mission and approach to meet the needs of the People on their own cultural and language level.  How novel and caring to find such people.  My granddaughter (indigenous from Okla/ Kans) had hoped to assist as a volunteer during our current time here (July~Oct.5, 2012), but it did not materialize.  
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	122737		/users/profile/167163	tbar	Volunteer	5	09/21/2012	Such a great organization doing incredible work. I have not helped in Guatemala, but I have assisted in some administrative, resource development and fundraisng work (I have spent nearly 2 years living and working in Guatemala since 2002/18 months consecutive in 05-06). I'm mostly interested in working with people with disabilities, general health and clean water projects. All are things that WUQU KAWOQ is involved in. I am planning a trip to Guatemala next year and won't leave the country without visiting WK projects in-country. This organization is vital to the people it serves! I've recommened this group to several people who are traveling to Guate.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	122146	1	/users/profile/55346	juneau	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2012	I observed first hand, women and children in Guatemala patiently waiting in line for their turn to see the doctor.  He had great patience himself; he saw each woman, each child.  Most complaints were stomach aches due intestinal parasites.  Vitamins were given to the children.  The women were so stoic - all wanted their children to be seen with little thought for themselves.  Lists were kept; complete documentation of who was seen and when and what complaints.  Referrals were made which the non profit would see to it that appointments were kept.  The women and children had trust in the medical team - it was a hot day, a long line and all were seen. The clinic was held in a small cinder block home; the non profit is raising money to build a clinic with weekly supportive care,
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54139		/users/profile/55346	juneau	Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	I have witnessed first hand the caring and compassionate work of Wuku Kawoq as evidenced by a small medical clinic in an impoverished village of Socorro.  Long lines of women with children waited patiently to be seen by the volunteer doctor and aide - the day was hot; each client was seen; vitamins and iron pills were dispensed as needed after blood tests were done; cases of worms and lice were seen. The doctor and his aide knew the native language and were able to fluently discuss symptoms with the women and children.  This was just one of several clinics administered by Wuku Kawoq.  The NGO believes in the people learning to help themselves. Examples:  Constructing water filters after introduction and information by Wuku Kawoq to help eliminate diarrhea and intestinal diseases; young Maya women studying maternal and infant health; instruction and education for Maya midwifery, demonstration farms for indigenous to learn better productivity for cacao, bananas and coffee.  Wuku Kuwoq is able to retain the loyalty and continued help of all who have volunteered and interned with the NGO. Grants and donations are invaluable to keep up ongoing projects - the board and staff immediately got to work with supplies, water, food, medicines and physical help when the recent hurricane devastated Guatemala - their help and aid knows no bounds.  A very important endeavor is the continued study of all volunteers to learn the native dialects to better connect with people.  Wuku Kawoq is truly a NGO to be proud of.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	121350		/users/profile/165116	Joann S.	General Member of the Public	5	08/24/2012	I had the experience of visiting Guatemala & touring this beautiful, but ravaged country, whose history of military unrest has devastated its people.  WUKU KAWOQ is a non-profit organization which seeks to bring medical aid, nutrition, improved sanitation, and humanitarian aid to an indigenous group of Guatemalans.  The updates on programs ( like the provision of Plumpy-Doz nutritional supplement to children) & pictures of the results in improved growth & health of children are inspiring.  Being able to provide this in their native language has the advantage of increasing compliance with programs & improving their quality of life from infancy.  WUKU KAWOQ is deserving of financial assistance for the benefits it brings to the people it serves.

Over the past few years I have seen first-hand how effective their programs are. Unlike some other Guatemalan NGOs, Wuqu' Kawoq is widely respected in the communities they serve, and for good reason: they offer high quality medical services in a linguistically and culturally responsible way.

I know my money goes directly to where it can be used, with no middleman. I am kept always kept in the loop with reports and newsletters. I enjoy the correspondence, the pictures of the children, and the outstanding efforts of Wuqu Kawoq to provide quality medical care to these precious children. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	119519	1	/users/profile/162513	Peter M.	Volunteer	5	07/30/2012	Wuqu Kawoq has been the fulcrum for achieving greater health in their community, spreading that knowledge base into communities outside of their scope, and allowing college students to learn how to make a real impact in a respectful and viable manner. My name is Peter Maraccini, and I worked as a project director for a group of young students from the University of Illinois who brought biosand filters, a water treatment technology, to a few of the communities in which Wuqu Kawoq worked. Wuqu Kawoq's main priority was and has always been to serve the needs of their partner communities without compromising their current situation to invest in potential solutions. Instead, Wuqu Kawoq was very open and communicative in what we could and couldn't do, was with us from the beginning when we first discussed then implemented the biosand filters in the communities, and has continued to be present during assessments of their improved water quality and health. As a result, there are a couple hundred biosand filters in the Wuqu Kawoq's partner communities that are reducing gastro-intestinal and diarrhea-related diseases and improving the communities' overall quality of life. Additionally, the positive experiences of working with Wuqu Kawoq is shaping our group's future direction and has lead to a very positive impact in the education of numerous students. Thank you Wuqu Kawoq. Working with you has given me (and many more) and better understanding and capacity for making a real impact in the world. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	118712	1	/users/profile/105902	Russell R.	Board Member	5	07/17/2012	I have been involved in this work since its inception in 2007.  As the treasurer since we started I can vouch that currently around 95% of every dollar collected in fundraising goes directly to patient care and community development projects.  Our programs in water development have been amazing as we have used technology that has been around a long time and through the efforts of our volunteers improved its efficiency.  Health care needs continue to outstrip resources, but each day holds opportunity to do real good in the lives of our patients.  This is a work I personally support as a Sustaining Donor and am proud to have my name associated with this organization.  2012 and 2013 are years of consolidation as we continue to try to become better and more efficient at what we do and continue to forge Guatemalan network connections both with other organizations and with the government.  I cannot speak more highly of this work.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	92304		/users/profile/105902	Russell R.	Board Member	5	06/27/2011	I have been working with Wuqu' Kawoq since nearly its inception, walked it through its incorporation and certification as a not-for-profit, and have watched it grow over the past few years.  I have first hand knowledge that over 95% of the money donated goes directly to client services.   There are always corporate costs, but these are kept to a minimum since all Board members and volunteers fund their own trips and service to the organization.  Child nutritions, basic health care services, ongoing diabetic care, community water projects, emergency relief services, I've seen them all completed efficiently and in a context that fosters personal and community self-reliance and integrity.  I donate each month to the cause and strongly recommend this to anyone seeking to invest in people's lives in a meaningful way.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	99463	1	/users/profile/119630	Rachel234567	Donor	5	10/19/2011	As a donor, I had the chance to visit Wuqu' Kawoq this summer (2011) to see the child nutrition programs - community-based screening of child growth, micronutrient and nutrition supplementation, and deworming treatments. What I saw was an organization that knows the in-depth issues facing each community and is mastering the techniques of working in child health. I was impressed with the commitment and thoroughness of the local staff, community health workers, and Dr. Rohloff.  One of my favorite parts was talking to the moms about changes in their children since starting the nutrition program. Consistently mothers said, "They play more, they eat more, they have more energy."  During the visit, I was particularly interested in seeing the results of the program. Which I did. The results of Wuqu' Kawoq's work are not only shown in the documented increase of height, weight, and health of children but also in the eyes of their mothers. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	92398	1	/users/profile/106015	karent	Donor	5	06/27/2011	First learning about Wuku'Kawoq in its infancy, I have watched it grow from a tiny grassroots organization with minimal infrastructure, into a thriving force for  the delivery of healthcare to the rural poor of Guatemala. One of the main reasons for its continuing growth, I believe, was the realization that, although Guaemala is considered a Hispanic country, many of their patients spoke very little Spanish.  Its physicians and field workers therefore undertook the astounding feat of learning several Maya languages, in order to more effectively deliver their services.   The positive impact it has had  in just a few short years,  is underscored by Wuqu' Kawoq's efforts to treat severe malnutrition there being featured as part of a special broadcast of "20/20" that kicked off ABC's year-long global health care campaign called "Be the Change: Save a Life.

General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2011	I visited a rural town in Guatemala a few years ago and got to know many of the people there. This organization is great because it works with members of local communities to establish solutions to problems such as health and nutrition, and clean water. Some of their projects include diabetes care and education, child nutrition, water filters and midwife training. I really like the fact that the local community is strongly involved because that will help to create long term solutions for these problems, rather than just a band-aid.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	92224		/users/profile/105707	Byron	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2011	I had the opportunity to visit a remote Mayan village in Guatemala, several years ago, and observed first hand, the care provided, on a specific occassion, to 48 poor children, 1-5 years old, by medical examination and measurements of their growth against norms, and by interviewing their mother, on their medical history and diet. On that day, 12 children were determined to be mal-noursished, and I could see their orange hair and unhealthy faces. I was deeply moved and have been a supporter of Wuqu' Kawoq ever since!!!
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	92204		/users/profile/105680	mark	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2011	I encountered the work of Wuqu' Kawoq last year and was deeply impressed by the vision behind the organisation. As a professional linguist working in developing countries, I was greatly relieved to find an organisation taking a well-argued, positive stance towards indigenous languages. Wuqu' Kawoq embraces local linguistic and cultural heritage by bringing primary health care to the people in their own language.  It is one thing to make primary health care physically available; it is another thing to make it culturally intelligible. Many ambitious projects fail to take into account this second, crucial step. As a result, they often contribute to language loss; but not only that, their results are also less than optimal because of linguistic and cultural barriers. In a time when so many non-profits operate with Western monoglot ideologies and simply use the major Western languages (which in developing countries often happen to be languages of former colonial oppressors), it is refreshing to see a non-profit realising the importance of local cultural heritage and language diversity. This choice is one of the keys to WKs remarkably successful work.

Improvements are made daily in the lives of malnourished children and ailing adults with uncontrolled chronic diseases. Patients are cared for through their native language in a very competent and compassionate manner. I highly recommend this organization for its capacity to elevate quality of life for a large number of people without wasting resources or time. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	56250		/users/profile/58644	Ixqojom	Donor	5	11/02/2010	I have both donated to and volunteered with Wuqu Kawoq. I have close ties to some of the communities that they work in, and I can honestly say their work is some of the best I have ever seen. They have great community contacts that help get dollars (in the form of aid) right to the people that need them the most. Because they focus on providing services in native languages, they are able to access and work with people on a level never even imaginable to most NGOs. The feedback I get from town members is often disbelief that there is an organization and people like those in Wuqu Kawoq out there working to help indigenous peoples. Wuqu Kawoq's work truly is invaluable. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	55057		/users/profile/57044	melinda	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2010	I have had the privilege of working for Wuqu Kawoq in Guatemala providing medical care to indiginous patients via our wonderful interpreters as well as providing education to an organized midwifery group creating a foundation  to improve healthcare in many of the rural areas.  Most of these midwives are the epitome of the 'carry it forward' attitude that hopefully will advance education and share this information to improve healthcare for others in their communities.  Education for these women then should  improve the standard of living and basic healthcare for many in their communities.  It is gratifying for us to help in any way!
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54676		/users/profile/56378	Brad N.	Volunteer	5	10/11/2010	Wuqu Kawoq is a wonderful NGO!  Their mission is unique and serves a community in a holistic manner - working to preserve language, culture and to provide medical care to an underserved community.  I love working with the group and its members are all excellent individuals.  I recommend donating/getting involved with the group in any way possible! 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54659		/users/profile/56325	YSONG	Volunteer	5	10/09/2010	I am a first-year medical student, and I volunteered for WuquKawoq during the summer of 2010.  In my opinion, WuquKawoq is an amazing organization that really tries to help Guatemalan communities through forging personal relationships with community members; finding innovative, practical, and sustainable solutions for public health problems; training local Guatemalans in social work and healthcare to build an internal infrastructure for community sustainability and viability; financial support for childrens tuition in the communities; and addressing medical needs of the community on a continual basis among many others.   One aspect of WuquKawoq that impressed me the most was the level of passion and love that the staff members had for the Guatemalan people.  There are board members in WuquKawoq who catch over-night flights during their days off from work in the United States to personally connect and address the growing needs of Guatemalan communities.  Moreover, most staff members in WuquKawoq have full-time jobs or are full-time students and yet still make a commitment to work on WuquKawoq projects out of their zeal to serve Guatemalan people.  Thus, it may not be surprising that much of the financial support dedicated to childrens tuition actually come directly out of the pockets of some WuquKawoq staff membersagain, not out of obligation but because they want to.  I truly believe that the communities WuquKawoq works with could not be in better hands.  During my time with WuquKawoq, I was primarily assigned along with another student to conduct surveys for three communities near Chocola, Guatemala.  The surveys were in regards to biofilm water filters that WuquKawoq, a group of US engineers, and local Guatemalan day laborers had collaborated to build for nearly a hundred Guatemalan families.  My job was to help collect information about whether the water filters were working properly for the family, and whether they had other concerns.  From this experience, I sensed that WuquKawoq really tries to do their very best out of their interests for the communities.  I would imagine that many other organizations working on a project like this would have considered the project to be completed after building the water filtersnot so with WuquKawoq.  WuquKawoq is extremely thorough and always makes sure to ask for feedback from community members by conducting survey after survey.  One mother I surveyed during my time with WuquKawoq told me: No one would help us if it wasnt for WuquKawoq.  I am grateful for having them in our community.  And I, likewise, am grateful for having been able to work with WuquKawoq, and plan to continue to work with them in the near future. 
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54657		/users/profile/56317	Frances	Volunteer	5	10/09/2010	 My relationship with WUQU KAWOQ has been very enriching.  From my very first  meeting  with Peter I knew good things would start to happen.  Our first assignment was connecting WUQU KAWOC with the Pharmaceutical companies in Guatemala to get medicine in bulk, at a reasonable price.  This gave me a chance to hear about his projects  and I became very interested and impressed by his work and have become an advocate of his work to other organizations whom | I consider might partner with him and multiply his efforts. Interesting things are coming together but are yet in the initial stages. What I personally find so helpfull is the clarity and focus he has in the programs he is developing and how open he is to share his experience with  others; the capacity to hear others in their projects and give them very punctual criticism and advise (so needed so people learn from others experience); the prompt response and help when he is contacted with a need ; the committment to sharing the strengths of WUQU KAWOQ of measurement and analisis and helping others in the development of their programs so that their proyects are  meaningfull and usefull .I look forward to strengthening  our networking in the future.  All the people I have met At WUKU Kawok are involved in the communities with respect for the culture and the individual, ( to the point of learning their langauge Kachiquel ) and this is an example for all of us that are working in the rural communites of Guatemala.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54468		/users/profile/55928	grahamhall	Volunteer	5	10/05/2010	Throughout my time with Wuqu Kawoq they have shown undeniable character, direction, and effectiveness.  The field staff in Guatemala supported by Wuqu Kawoq are locals trained by the organization and employed to provide the essential care required by their communities.  Wuqu Kawoq's field staff are among the most intelligent and reliable in the community ensuring that their mission is carried out daily while the large portion of staff and volunteers are in the U.S.  Their volunteers and North American staff are some of the best in the nation at their specific vocations and they also implement themselves perfectly into these communities using indigenous language proficiency and cultural understand to provide competent compassionate care to our communities.  While small in size and resources their efficiency in distribution and organization of care ensures that a much larger community is cared for in a quality fashion than one would think for an organization of its size.  I believe that they are not only essential to Guatemala for continued care of these communities but essential as a model for other medical NGOs working in impoverished environments.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54351		/users/profile/55676	9485mkj	Volunteer	5	10/03/2010	For years I have wanted to volunteer my services as a pediatrician to an organization that provided medical care for children in areas of need. There are many organizations to choose from but I found only one that has long term goals for improving the lives as well as the health of children and their families. Wuqu'Kawoq is an NGO that provides medical care to Mayan Children and their families. What makes this group unique is that many of the members speak one or more of the Mayan dialects in addition to Spanish. This organization makes every effort to complement as well as improve the health care provided by the community midwives. One of the greatest needs of these communities is access to fresh water. Wuqu'Kawoq is working to fill this need by creating the means for community members to manufacture and then distribute water filters to each home. No long term progress in health care can be made without access to fresh water. I have donated time and money to this organization and will continue to do so because although I have seen the positive results already achieved by Wuqu'Kawoq, there is more work to be done.
Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54345		/users/profile/55662	caitlin2	Volunteer	5	10/02/2010	Wuqu' Kawoq is an excellent example of just how quickly culturally relevant and culturally competent medicine can make a real difference.  The volunteers, staff, and supervising physician (Dr. Peter Rohloff) are all dedicated, determined, and moving towards fluency- if not already fluent- in both Spanish and Kaqchikel, one of the principle Mayan dialects, which makes for both a quality and accessibility of medical care that is entirely unavailable to many Guatemalans.

This organization is dedicated to improving the lives of the indigenous Maya population in Guatemala. Wuqu has been able to gain the confidence and respect of the communities that they serve and has accomplished this by bringing together Maya culture and language with resources , healthcare and education. The ability to speak the language and to understand the culture is paramount if an organization is truely going to be successful.The work has been difficult but I have seen significant progress in many areas including providing water purification for villages, nutritional supplements for children and meeting basic healthcare needs . The diabetes program has been very successful.Wuqu has proven to the Maya community that they are there for the long haul and has formed a very tight bond with the communities that are served.

Wuqu' Kawoq - Maya Health Alliance	54090		/users/profile/55292	miranda2	Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	I was first introduced to Wuqu' Kawoq through my language studies in Kaqchikel Maya. After volunteering with the organization at a clinic in San Juan Comalapa, I valued greatly the approaches of the NGO. Medicine should be distributed to patients based upon their understandings and cultural background. Any socially-engaging health care worker must recognize the inseparability of culture and medical practice. After volunteering, I decided to commit as a long-term intern of Wuqu' Kawoq. I have now further observed the vital approaches to the missions of Wuqu' Kawoq. Many non-governmental organizations will work in under-served communities (whether that be in health or education)and not necessarily be a sustainable force in that community. Wuqu' Kawoq not only maintains a sustainable presence in the working communities, but we are expanding and creating various other programs assisting the communities--from child nutrition, purified water resources, women's health care, diabetes, and language revitalization. Wuqu' Kawoq is a unique NGO and many organizations could benefit in their collaboration.

Casting for Recovery	323022		/users/profile/417169	newtoflyfishing	Client Served	5	02/11/2017	In 2015 I attended a CfR weekend that exceeded my expectations. I originally applied as I have been a fisherman all my life, but never had tried fly fishing, and wasn't sure I even wanted to learn to fly fish or would gain a whole lot from this weekend adventure. I had a large group of supporters already and didn't think I would gain anything. I am so glad I went and found it far more than just another support group. It was like finding another branch of a family. Everyone was helpful and interested in what I had to say and how I was doing. The leaders also cared about the technic I was using as I learned to cast (totally different from the fishing I had done in the past).  I am still telling everyone and anyone that will listen about the "great" weekend I had at CfR and have found another discipline of fishing I enjoy.  I really believe that this program deserves the platinum nonprofit status it has and should continue to have to be able to benefit all and anyone that choses to participate in the adventure.

They all taught me so much about cancer, learning how to cope, and just knowing we all had something in common, well it meant more to me and I'll never forget that weekend. The fishing was pretty cool, it got all of us a chance to learn something, I would've never learned and got some laughs out of it, plus meeting great fishing teacher's who really cared about each and everyone of us.

Casting for Recovery	322992		/users/profile/417124	Judy184	Client Served	5	02/10/2017	I attended the CfR retreat last September and thought it was fantastic. It was not only learning to fly cast but also to reach down inside ourselves and heal with all the group sessions we had. It was much more than I had heard and was very impressed. I gained 13 new friends and have become close to one in particular. It helped all of us to know others who have been through the same journey, who are dealing with the same problems, and who are healing faster because of this retreat. I feel this is a great service to those of us who have had breast cancer and should be continued. I liked it so much that i am planning on volunteering wherever I can to help those like me who come to CfR retreats. The volunteers who led our retreat were so caring and helpful that I thought I would like to become one of them, too. By the way, the fly fishing bug bit me hard, and I am working on becoming a good fly fisherman! May you serve many, many women in the future by continuing CfR retreats!

I've made great lasting friendships through the program, with the women I have helped and with other volunteers. I've gotten so much positive feedback from the participants and I know CfR has given so many women a learning and supportive opportunity that is unique and priceless.  I joined CfR because I love to share my love of fly-fishing but also because my sister died of breast cancer. She would have been absolutely thrilled to have had the opportunity to learn to fish and to bond with other breast cancer survivors. Volunteering for CfR is a major part of my "giving back" to my community and I cherish my experience and friendships.

My diagnosis and treatments were during 2007. I was very ready to embark on the journey to find joy and learn that there can be a good life after being diagnosed.  When I arrived at Big K Ranch I was welcomed warmly and enthusiastically.  The coordinators helped me get settled and I was made to feel very comfortable. It was a few days of crying, laughing, learning, and having a wonderful time in nature. During the course of our time together, I made good friends which I still have today. And, because there are past participant events, I've made some truly deep connections. Since my attendance, I have continued to participate, as an active volunteer.  CfR remains an essential part of my life. I describe the CfR Retreat gathering as "the most memorable and impactful experience of my life".

When I went through treatment for breast cancer in 2008 I had pretty good support, but so many women don't get the kind of (non-medical) help that can be so valuable to survivors.  When I attended the Casting for Recovery program in 2012 it was such an amazing group, both staff/volunteers and participants!  Women in all stages of treatment, survivorship, and late stage in a relaxed setting supported by a caring, knowledgeable, and loving staff were able to open up our hearts and share what each of us needed at whatever place we were at the time.  The fly fishing activities provided enough structure to tie all that caring together, and we got to spend the weekend in a beautiful setting that I would otherwise never have been able to experience.

I am not a "group person" so did not expect it to be such a remarkable experience but it was. The sessions, the support, the honesty and the caring that were present in those 2 days helped me so much. Breast cancer (well probably any cancer) is a life changing experience. You never quite trust your body again but the support and caring and opportunities that I experienced that weekend 6 years ago still remains with me.

Each of us had been touched by breast cancer in some way and we all loved fly fishing.  We raised money and brought Casting for Recovery to Oregon for the very first time.  We had so much success and fun that our retreat has continued each year since then.  This fall we will hold our 14th retreat!I've have found every retreat to be as unique as the 14 women involved.  Each brings their own story to share and walks away with a support group that lasts a lifetime.  It is so much more than the fishing.  That is the catalyst that brings us all together.  The sisterhood and friendships that develop is what makes it extra special.  I've seen women 15+ years out from treatment engage in conversation with those newly diagnosed.  I've seen those in their senior years sharing fears and successes with those in their thirties.  Every woman has a special story and most haven't had the opportunity to share with another that has walked the same path.  Every single retreat...every one...the women highly recommended that others on this journey should attend their own retreat.  That is a powerful testament to the importance of Casting for Recovery.  Addressing the well-being of survivors can often be overlooked.  This amazing program puts them first.  I am proud to say I was on the team that brought CfR to Oregon.  I love how it has grown and that past participants now run most of our retreat and fundraising events.  It's a perfect example of paying it forward!
Casting for Recovery	322699	1	/users/profile/416693	Jill113	Client Served	5	02/05/2017	I started volunteering for this organization 7 years ago. I thought it would be good to be on the river with women who needed the therapy of a few days of fishing. Doctors agree that fly fishing also has certain physiological benefits to the upper body that can help breast cancer patients and survivors move more freely and break down scar tissue. Then, of course, there are the mental and spiritual benefits for those who have been affected by breast cancer, able to hear from experts and spend time with other women who have shared the trauma of the experience. I felt privileged to be in their presence at retreats, grateful that I hadn't been through the experience myself but happy I could be of service.Then it happened to me.I was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in 2011, and had a lumpectomy (including lymph node removal) and radiation. To say that I had a built-in team of trusted advisors in the staff and volunteers of Casting for Recovery would be understating the enormous impact this organization has on its community. I got advice, referrals, coaching, and support from women I'd volunteered with, and some I'd never met. I volunteer with other charities, but will always be impressed with CFR's capacity to create and sustain a community of women who educate, support, and help one another through (and after) one of life's most difficult ordeals. Oh, and they can cast a mean line, too!Jill  Dyche

Casting for Recovery	322696	1	/users/profile/416689	Writer	Client Served	5	02/05/2017	In 2012, having just been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer - and a broken foot - I was fortunate to be selected to attend CFR in September as an alternate. After a devastating diagnosis, the CFR experience addressed my physical, emotional and psychological needs. The all volunteer staff included Lori, who insisted on being my "Sherpa," schlepping my luggage to my assigned cottage. It seemed someone was always "right there" to handle any physical challenge. And then the fun began with a rollicking presentation of fly fishing gear. I've never been sure how they made it all so funny. There were quiet moments, engaging in related crafts [meditation or distraction?], spiritual [not religious] experiences and after much practice, one on one fly fishing on the gorgeous Umpqua River.  Meantime, we were sure to gain weight during the fabulous meals which usually began with a small "present" at each place setting. I felt understood, loved, cherished and included. It would be impossible to find a superlative sufficient to encourage others to attend.
Casting for Recovery	322691	1	/users/profile/416680	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/05/2017	I have been a river helper several times for the CFR event at the Big K Ranch in Douglas County, Oregon. Each time I have been struck by the deep connections between the women who participate, their obvious shared experiences, and the effort they expend to learn the craft and lore of fly fishing. The constant message seems to be "if we can conquer this we can do anything!"I have a vested interest in the effort to beat breast cancer. My grandmother, mother and sister have all contracted breast cancer, with grandma and mom succumbing to it. Now my good friend Carol La Branche has succumbed as well. Through CFR and its good works Carol showed the way as she struggled for years with the disease and yet sought and found joy and fulfillment through fly fishing. It's a great connection between physical treatment through muscle development, mental treatment through concentration and confidence and a hoped-for recovery.One need only attend one of their retreats to know the organization meets its goals.Bill Swift
Casting for Recovery	322660	1	/users/profile/416635	Writer	Client Served	5	02/04/2017	Before attending the Casting for Recovery retreat, I heard it could be "a life changing weekend". And, I thought that was a bit of an exaggeration - until I attended in 2007. I was a 27 year survivor by then and questioned what I could get out of the weekend.  A lot, I soon learned. In 2007, I attended along with 13 other women I did not know at 3PM on a Friday, and by Sunday afternoon friendships and support systems and support communities had been formed that would last well beyond the weekend. The retreat offered an opportunity for us to share our experiences and learn from one another; from women who were still in treatment, to participants like me whose treatments were but a memory. A special bond formed among the participants, sharing, laughing, crying and learning. Amazing how the love and support of the retreat program volunteers, and the beautiful location could actually help me take my mind off of being a breast cancer survivor even though we were there because we were breast cancer survivors. After the retreat, my support circle was larger, I was part of a new support system (not just for breast cancer issues, but life issues as well), and my friendship base grew. I was so changed by this weekend experience that when asked to volunteer I enthusiastically said yes. CfR says "to fish is to hope" and the retreat does give hope and does provide skills and tools to look at the future in a positive way.
Casting for Recovery	322309	2	/users/profile/416057	jeriobrien	Client Served	5	01/29/2017	It is hard for me to speak about my CfR retreat without smiling and crying. It meant so much to me to meet so many women with our disease in common (breast cancer) but little else and yet I felt as though I was understood. I am not really a "group" person, I usually feel like there is to much complaining. Fly fishing was something that I had always dreamed of doing but it always came in second to family and work. Being offered an opportunity to spend a weekend being "taken care of" and learning to fly fish was a much needed respite from the rigors of treatment and returning to work afterwards. Our retreat staff was wonderful, most were survivors themselves so could relate to the experiences we had while in treatment. We had the opportunity during the retreat to join evening discussions with an oncology nurse and a social worker, their insights into the effects of diagnosis and treatment were very illuminating. They understood the difficulty of balancing work and family while trying to adjust to the new you, the one with scars and thin hair and maybe a little less lightness of heart. They were kind and offered to be there for us not only at the retreat but afterward. I have seen their compassion and commitment in action, when one of our retreat members recently asked about depression in our private chat group our crew was quick to respond to her with encouragement and support and kind words. It did not end there but continued with follow up to make sure she was doing ok. This retreat changed my life in so many ways. Not all of the women on our retreat have become avid fisher women but all have become friends and supporters. I have the council of knowledgeable women with whom I feel free to discuss things that may be hard for my family and other friends to hear and understand. I have learned to be kinder to myself and not to put off trying new things, I am learning to tie flys and soon hope to be casting in the surf near my home and in waters far and wide. I love Casting for Recovery, I love their mission and believe that nature and  the sunlight shining on water can soothe the worried soul. I am forever grateful for the gifts that CfR has given me.
Casting for Recovery	321695	1	/users/profile/415190	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/20/2017	I have been privileged to work with Casting for Recovery in two different roles for 19 years. The supportive and healing environment, the renewal of nature, and the adventure of fly fishing for women who are breast cancer survivors of all ages and stages is a tranformational experience provided at no cost to participants. To watch the bonding, love, and support grow among the women from the beginning to the end of the retreat is nothing short of miraculous. Staff provide medical, psychosocial, fly fishing expertise and experience that creates a holistic setting embracing these deserving women for 48 hours in a beautiful setting that provides a respite from the challenges of managing day to day life. Casting for Recovery is a stellar non-profit organization and a treasure.

This organization provides an all expenses paid weekend wellness retreat, a built-in support group made up of survivors of all ages and all stages, and the participants do the most hopeful thing of all -- they learn a new skill: fly fishing. If you are still learning, you are still alive. To fish is indeed to hope.

Casting for Recovery	321422	2	/users/profile/414766	Tese S.	Volunteer	5	01/17/2017	I started with CfR Montana Trailhead Country in 2008 when I was asked to volunteer as one of the Fly Fishing Instructors for their very first retreat, and I have been with them ever since. I am able to share my knowledge and love of fly fishing with other women while they are on a difficult journey. It is my fondest hope that the introduction to fly fishing and the connections made with other women during the retreat will help the participants to live their lives with hope and strength. Since Montana is such a large state, there are not many opportunities for women with breast cancer to participate in support groups. By providing CfR retreats, these women are given the chance to share their experiences and to learn from others for possibly the first time. I believe that it is vital for the Montana women with breast cancer to have the opportunity to participate in a CfR retreat. I will continue to volunteer with CfR for many years to assist in the effort to reach more Montana women.

Casting for Recovery	288014	1	/users/profile/378218	Writer	Client Served	5	05/02/2016	Having cancer changes your life in a big way.  Breast cancer, and especially those who choose to not have reconstruction (or cannot), causes a woman to take a hard look at themselves and determine who they are.  As a baby boomer, my breasts defined me as a woman.  When my surgeon said that both breasts would need to go, I had to quickly take a hard look at who I really was.  Did my breasts define me as a woman?  So if I lost them, was I still a woman?  Oh so many questions and who could I talk to?  Casting for Recovery is an organization that meets that need.  A small group of women get together for one oh so wonderful weekend, hash out all the junk and in it's place learn how to relax and fly fish.  How can you be full of anger and frustration and sadness when you are out in the water and it's just you and the fish? Great conversations arise when the focus is no longer on the disease. Great leaders are there to help us stay on the course. " Work through it.  Watch how the fish take advantage of the opportunities that arise to find their favorite insect meal. Look how they work so hard to go up the stream.  Can we do that as women?" Can I face adversity and come out on the other side?  "Keep your eye on the prize.  Stay focused.  Breathe."Casting for Recovery helps women do just that.  I cannot sing their praises enough.  $1,300 sends one woman to a weekend that just might give her the hope she needs to keep going.  Fish on!

Casting for Recovery	287787	1	/users/profile/377921	Jennifer536	Client Served	5	04/30/2016	I could count on one hand the number of times I fished before going to the retreat. I didn't know if I would like it but wow the risk was worth it !  All the retreat staff, resort staff and River Helpers were kind and fun, It was a relief  being able to talk to others who "got it" and learning something new in life after the chemo and always feeling tired.   There are feelings I never shared with anyone that came out in the group cabin the first night and the validation from other women who felt the same was overwhelming.  It's a great mix of learning about fly fishing, talking with other survivors, and having time to yourself.   On the last day we did an activity and part of it was casting a stone into the river.  That stone was my cancer.  It has not weighed me down like it used to and I do owe my change in thinking and living to this weekend.  Even if you never fish again (I do all the time now) give yourself this gift and give it a shot.  This picture is me with my River Helper and one of my first fishes.   I still keep in touch with her and volunteer for CFR too.
Casting for Recovery	287724		/users/profile/377859	Writer	Client Served	5	04/30/2016	I participated in a Casting for Recovery weekend in Southern California in May 2015.  It was a life changing experience.  From the moment I arrived, to the moment I left, I was surrounded with enthusiastic and fun loving women.  Learning to fly fish was just part of the weekend's activities.  We also participated in a counseling session  and a medical session where we learned to mentally and physically face the challenges that breast cancer diagnosis and  treatment bring and how to help ourselves deal with those challenges.  Then Sunday, our on the water day, it was exciting and daunting as we put our lines in the water, encouraged by the experienced fly fishing water guide.  I continue to communicate with my water guide, the facilitators from the weekend and some of the women with whom I shared the weekend.  Participating in CfR has given me a new sense of well being and calmness about my disease.  Fly fishing has become my "muse", exercise, focus, meditation and excitement all in one package.  Casting for Recovery is the perfect retreat for women who have walked the breast cancer challenge.
Casting for Recovery	287670	1	/users/profile/377796	Writer	Client Served	5	04/29/2016	I was chosen to attend Casting for Recovery Nebraska in 2013. Our retreat was in Valentine. At the time, I was in remission from metastatic breast cancer. I can't properly express what this weekend meant to me. I have fished and enjoy the outdoors, but this was an entirely new experience for me: trout fishing in a part of Nebraska that looks nothing like where I was raised on a farm; with a group of strangers.  At first I was wary of the talking and sharing groups, as I'm not a touchy-feely person; but I never felt uncomfortable or pressured to open up. We did share a bond and really enjoyed everyone's company. Learning the very intricate art of fly fishing was also challenging, and a great way to "get out of your own head" and focus on something else for a change. 3 months later, I learned that my cancer had returned. I have been able to keep fighting with a good attitude, in no small part thanks to CFR. When I am stressed and scared, and need to go to a happy place, that place is on the Snake River.  Fly fishing taught me that sometimes you just need to stop trying so hard, and just let yourself get into a natural rhythm, and it will all work itself out.

Just as I walked in the door, my phone rang, no cancer. I didn't know anyone there but decided to share my good news with everyone & they all cheered & clapped & I felt like I was home.

My river helper was awesome & made me feel very comfortable & I could tell he really cared. The retreat had such a positive effect on me that I decided to become a volunteer so I could help other survivors feel the way I did.

However,  I became a fly fisher woman, and it has totally changed my life.  I fish every weekend now, and my husband  (also a beginner and CfR volunteer) has learned along with me.  He was my caregiver during my cancer treatment days, and is the best fishing partner ever.  THANK YOU to Casting for Recovery for instilling  hope, beauty, confidence, and love.

The total experience was much much more rewarding than I could have ever expected. The organizers and volunteers were totally welcoming, engaging, had great senses of humor, knew their stuff and were invitational without being pushy at all. What a terrific way for  women  ( and there were only women in my group) all differing ages and backgrounds, in different stage of recovery, to get together and learn something new, fun, beautiful--- something that takes one into nature  and away from  one's  normal , often health  centered  routine. To be with others with you can or ca not talk-- to have TIME to do, be , eat healthily and learn a new skill, to be outside, to be non-competitive-- to simply begin to learn  and enjoy. Not to mention--no cooking, cleaning -- no NORMAL responsibilities.The only responsibility was to make this watch you will. I LOVED every moment. I found myself relaxing into  learning, to laughing, to deeply listening to others, to watching others spirits shift. I was impressed by the thoughtfulness of the whole experience. The organizers were particularly careful in their teaming of roommates---as no one knew one another. The entry into getting to know one another was easy, fun and then... the the walking through learning about the fish, the streams, the insects and... then our  equipment. Each level brought us more  and more into the fishing experience. The practices of casting and one and one assistance. The support and  focus of our teachers and then... a magical time of one of one guidance on the river with  professional guides. I loved this.  And as I looked around at the intensity and the smiles of the participants I KNEW this experience had deeply touched all of us.( As and aside as we walked up from the stream a rainbow appeared --not a rainbow trout) I found  CfR to have  had a profound effect on me and was so moved by how truly helpful, healing and opening this experience was, I wanted to make sure others would be able to go in the future- so I organized a little fund raising  fly fishing workshop- to both share the  joy  and magic of FLY-FISHING--  and  also to raise a little money to assist  another group walking through the path of caner recovery-- to have this remarkable and magical experience.OH yes, I plan to continue to fish!

I can not express how grateful I am for the retreat I attended.  Not only was the retreat VERY organized and running smoothly, but all of the people who were creating the experience were welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable.  I felt at ease, heard, and comforted immediately upon arrival.  The volunteers are very giving and caring. 
Casting for Recovery	255853	5	/users/profile/344235	Ann Marie W.	Client Served	5	09/10/2015	Casting for Recovery was the best experiences I have had in my life and my cancer journey.  Everyone was so helpful and caring and we never lacked laughter!  We shared stories of our journey, life and it's struggles and our personal hopes and dreams.  I grew up fishing but never had the opportunity to learn fly fishing.  Fishing took your troubles away, gave you confidence, made you do something physical and gave you memories to take home and build on. Each and everyone of the volunteers were there for you.  You never lacked for a person to help you tie a knot, land a fish, cast correctly, have a laugh with or a good old fashioned cry. I felt the "medical and mental" staff  were outstanding.  I have had breast cancer twice and didn't realize I was still holding unto emotions about.  What a relief to release these.  Hats off to MaryAnn and Beth.  I could go on and on about the volunteers starting with Peggy but space limits me.  Each person touched my life in a positive life.  I can't say enough about our guides.  Nate was mine and we laughed and slipped on the moss covered rocks and never did fall in.  Thank goodness!  What a great teacher hewas. The ranch and staff made me feel like a Fly Fishing Princess.  No request was too small or large.  The cabins  were tasteful and comfortable, the food was so YUMMY and I never wanted to leave   LOL THANKS Casting for Recovery for a weekend of memories meant for a life time.\Ann Marie Herbert

I not only experienced a camaraderie with other survivors, but learned a new skill.  Fly fishing is zen... a beautiful escape from the stress of life and an opportunity to get back to nature.  This was a very healing experience for our entire group.  I pray that this organization continues its service for years to come.

I cared for her through her treatments, surgeries and recuperation. I found out about Casting for Recovery from a fellow angler and have been volunteering in different capacities since 2011.  By volunteering with Casting for Recovery I am gifted with the experience of welcoming breast cancer survivors at the beginning of a retreat and watching the transformation that occurs during and at the end of the retreat. Our participants enjoy a stress free weekend filled with education, healing and fellowship. They walk away with a lasting new lease on life. Lifelong friendships are established and many alumni say they are able to draw on the positive experience given to them by Casting for Recovery for many years after their retreat.  I am happy to say that my sister celebrated six years of being cancer free in August. Yep, we went on a fly fishing trip to celebrate!
Casting for Recovery	254926	2	/users/profile/343288	cmamafish	Volunteer	5	09/04/2015	Casting for Recovery has been an inspiration in my struggle with breast cancer. I attended a retreat in 2013 (in Helen, GA) and was blown away by the genuine concern and kindness exhibited by the staff. I will never forget how warmly I was greeted by the CfR staff. By the end of the retreat, a sisterhood had formed. One would never know that the group had started out unacquainted. The weekend was very healing and I had never realized that I needed to be healed. I thought that I was just going to learn how to fly fish-it was so much more. I became involved in the organization as a volunteer and staff member for the next years retreat. It has been a life changing experience for me in such a positive way. I have acquired many friends who have provided me support, particularly when my breast cancer recently advanced to a stage 4 terminal status. Although I am now unable to volunteer as a staff member, I continue to support this wonderful organization. I continue to fly fish when I am up to it-it brings me much joy!

June 12th - June 14th.  I went into the program thinking it was going to be fun, but never expected what I received.  This program was life changing for me.  Not only were the advisors and guides over the top accommodating in every sense of the word, but they were kind, helpful and understanding.  You can really tell that they love what they do.  The event was very organized and kept us busy with group sessions, fly fishing practice, and taught us just about anything and everything there is to know about fly fishing.  Instructors were all very knowledgeable and their instruction was very clear.  They demonstrated patience with all who participated.  I loved the fact that even though we the participants were breast cancer survivors, we didn't have to tell our story.  Everybody already knew it.  The group therapy Saturday night was great.  I learned that I am not alone, and there is always someone out there that has it worse then I do.  Keep my chin up and fight the fight!

Casting for Recovery	254014	3	/users/profile/342310	ReelTherapy	Volunteer	5	08/26/2015	I have been a volunteer and a donor to CFR for over 5 years.  The women who participate in the retreats, all leave so happy and empowered.   They meet people that really connect with them and what they have been going through.  They stay connected with f/u dinners, facebook, and nights out,   There have been women that have never really discussed their dx for years, that finally feel comfortable opening up.  The Fly fishing connection is a metaphorical connection for many of them, starting them thinking and opening up new discussions.  I as a volunteer walk away from the weekend with my heart overflowing.     The CFR organization is wonderful.  We all have the same goal.   The retreats are top notch, well organized,   balanced.   I feel as a donor that the money is definitely going towards running the retreats, directly helping the women as intended.  Would definitely give CFR 5 stars.

Our fly fish instructors were so knowledgeable and guided us so that we were well prepared for the big day of fishing!

Fishing was always one of my favorite ways of relaxing, although I had never been fly fishing.  So, I began checking out the CFR experience.  I was one of the lucky ones to participate in the very first CFR retreats in Missouri.  This was a weekend I will always treasure.  The ladies that I met were simply the best!!  Volunteers and participants alike!  As a client we were waited on hand and foot.  The food was fabulous, the "chat sessions were great and learning to fly fish was super!  I couldn't believe that a company, Orvis, was supplying everything we needed - waders, fly rods and reels, all the gear needed to have the complete, wonderful experience.  The friendships formed at this event lasted through the years as well.  I just can't say enough about CFR.  I loved it!
Casting for Recovery	214190		/users/profile/277437	Kgeb	Volunteer	5	09/09/2014	CfR is a "gift".  Many of the fourteen women who participate in this week-end retreat return home from diagnosis and treatment to a family routine.  Life moves on...but what about all the emotions that many women do not have the time to address or the fear to address them?  This to me is the best gift of CfR. The team of volunteers pamper them and allow them to be free to express what they may never have expressed before. They have valuable time as survivors to share experiences, learn ways of handing adversity, and all within the realm of fly-fishing.  A river continues on, sometimes slowing, sometimes speeding up, sometimes treacherous but moving on.  And this is just what these women do! CfR is a financially free platform for them to continue to heal themselves emotionally, do something adventurous, step out and leave with a grateful heart ready for their next adventure. Karen GebhardtCfR Texas
Casting for Recovery	214089		/users/profile/277323	BLTMD	Volunteer	5	09/08/2014	CFR provides a unique retreat for women who have had breast cancer, providing them an all expenses paid weekend to spend time with other survivors, to learn a new skill, and  to just be in the great outdoors enjoying nature.  It seemed an odd combination when I first heard about it, but it works!  Women come together as strangers Friday night, and leave tearfully, as good friends Sunday afternoon.  They have shared somethings they may never have shared before, discovered they indeed are not alone, and they have laughed and experienced the sheer joy of fly fishing--perhaps using the fly they tied themselves.  They have been pampered, and nurtured, and some have found a new passion in fishing. Others never fish again, but still remember fondly the bonds that were formed over this weekend.  I have definitely heard it said that the weekend was life changing for some.   The volunteers also, are buoyed up by spending time with survivors--strong, brave women who inspire us all.
Casting for Recovery	213982		/users/profile/277198	kayjacks	Volunteer	5	09/08/2014	I had been a fly fisher for several years before I heard about Casting for Recovery. I was intrigued how the program was developed by a breast surgeon and fly fishing guide to help breast cancer survivors. After being a river helper the first year, I was fortunate to be selected to be on the weekend team. I was excited to help women explore a new experience in a sport that have given me pleasure. However, I must say I get as much out of the weekend as the participants. Each year, we have an amazing group of survivors who, in turn, have taught me so much about life. They embrace each day, and take nothing for granted. They are excited to learn something new and experience nature in a new way. Fishing is just part of the magic of the weekend. The other part is the sisterhood. I see how they connect with one another and share their intimate journeys of cancer, and the relief on their faces when they find those who have experienced what they have and truly understand.  Casting for Recovery is the first organization to use fly fishing a restorative therapy. It obviously works as there are now similar programs for men with cancer and helping disabled veterans.

Texas now has two retreats annually; Joshua Creek and North Texas (Dallas Area). I have now been on the staff for both and LOVE the experience. The participant women are SOOOOOO strong, they inspire me every day!!!!! I LOVE to fly fish and my mother is a 25+ year breast cancer survivor. CFR was a natural fit for me to volunteer. Texas has a fantastic group of volunteers; both staff and river helpers. Unfortunately, we have so many river helper volunteers, we have to turn some away most retreats. Susan Gaetz, who got CFR started in Texas, is fantastic! She is now a paid CFR employee and is sometimes unable to make the Texas retreats because of her CFR job duties. We miss her GREATLY when she is unable to make a retreat. I wish every women with breast cancer could experience a CFR retreat!!!!!!

Ten years later, the retreat is still a highlight of my year.  The response that each retreat's 14 participants give us each year keeps me coming back for more.  CFR's participants speak of how they feel pampered, listened to, respected, and led to laugh and revel in the freedom of the river as a fly fisherwoman.   They speak of the surprise of deep connection is a short three days.  Half way into my journey as a volunteer, my mother became a breast cancer patient and survivor, and a few years after that, a participant at one of our retreats.  While I've often fished with my father and brothers, this weekend was the first that I ever fished with my mom, all in the company of extraordinary women.  Thank you, CFR!

As a breast cancer survivor, I felt this was the perfect match; an organization that understands the need to enhance your life after you receive your diagnosis.  The fly fishing skills that are taught at a weekend retreat,  can be taken away, shelved as a great memory or used to open up a whole new world.  The bonds that are formed with other survivors and staff members at a retreat, can be great "medicine" to  fall back on when  reality takes over.

Meeting other women that had been through a breast cancer diagnosis, and connecting with them on an emotional, physical and spiritual level was so healing.     Learning the sport of fly fishing , and embracing the healing and therapeutic properties of water while standing in a beautiful stream and letting go and being present in the moment ,stands unmatched in helping me move forward from my two cancer diagnosis.

The fishing retreats hosted by CFR bring together women of all walks of life who share in the battle of breast cancer. For many this is not only a first time fly fishing, but fishing in general.  The friendships formed on these retreats last long after they end, and is an important part of their healing process.  After hearing all the powerful stories of healing and camaraderie these retreats bring to the participants, I will continue to assist the program in any way I can. Keep up the great work!
Casting for Recovery	136020		/users/profile/181927	originalAmyK	Client Served	4	11/08/2012	I was lucky enough to participate in one of the Casting for Recovery weekends in Long Island, New York, a couple of years ago.  What a wonderful weekend it was, and all for free for me, because of donations from others!  Not only did I get to meet other sisters who had, or have, breast cancer, but I also got to see some beautiful fresh water rivers on Long Island that I was not even aware of.  We had a whole weekend of learning how to fly fish, sharing meals, having discussions, and fun.  The art of fly fishing, specifically the casting of the rod, is a very helpful exercise for strengthening your arm following breast cancer surgery, and can also help to alleviate lymphedema symptons that might develop in your arm following surgery.  I met some very nice women and made new friends that weekend.  I have since attended some fundraising events for CFR in an attempt to "pay it forward," or, pay it back.  I hope that any breast cancer survivor who wants the chance, will get to experience a CFR weekend.

It was an extremely spirtual journey for me and I will never forget it for as long as I live, which I hope will be to 100.

Casting for Recovery	33145	1	/users/profile/33970	krysti	Volunteer	5	03/13/2010	When I talk about the experience provided to breast cancer Survivors through Casting for Recovery (Indiana retreat), I barely have the words to explain what it has meant to me as well as to others I know. I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Inflammatory breast cancer in March of 2005. I found a brochure about this unique experience at the resource area of the hospital where I was treated. I had been fishing once before in my life, when I was a little girl, using a bamboo pole while attending a family church camp. Feeling the need to experience new things and step out of my comfort zone after diagnosis, I decided to apply for the fall retreat that year, never even knowing if I would live that long with the aggressive disease I was battling. When I found that I was an alternate that year, I sort of shrugged my shoulders and said, Oh well, maybe I wasnt meant to go and since I dont think I want to touch fish anyway, its no big deal! The next year in 2006, I received an application. Since I was through with my initial treatment, I decided it couldnt hurt to have a healing time with other Survivors, experiencing nature, but I still wasnt sure I was going to touch the fish! To my surprise, my name was chosen out of a very competitive lottery and I was given the chance to attend. I had just been told I had to continue my breast cancer treatment, and felt that maybe it was meant to be. As re treat time approached, I questioned myself as to whether I should even attend. Maybe I would be too tired, maybe Id have to touch fish! But, I put on my big girl panties and decided to go The experience of being on a Casting For Recovery retreat is almost indescribable. Some descriptions I have used when I try to find the words are healing, caring, bonding, lasting friendships, and fun. It was such an important weekend to me in my after breast cancer diagnosis life that I wish every woman who has experienced breast cancer could attend. The motto of CFR is to fish is to Hope and I do truly believe that. The women from my retreat who had only one thing in common, breast cancer, have continued to be friends all these years later. We have held each others hands, breathed sighs of relief at positive test results and cried with some as their battle continued. Sadly, weve lost two of our retreat members to this disease. They both expressed their feelings of having been blessed to have been a CFR participant right up until they slipped away -one even asking for a pink fishing pole from her husband for her last Christmas celebration. At their memorials, their friends and families also expressed their emotions about how important the experience was in their loved ones lives. With no reservation, I recommend applying for a CFR retreat to every Survivor I meet. In the years after I attended, I have had many members of organizations I participate in who have also felt blessed to have a chance to attend. As both a national and local employee of the Young Survival Coalition, I highly recommend that breast cancer Survivors apply to attend a CFR retreat. I truly believe in the CFR motto that To Fish is To Hope and wish that we could give that to more women. I also continue the healing and meditative activity of fly -fishing through our reunions and get-togethers, and someday, maybe Ill even touch a fish! Thank you to our donors for your support of such a unique and fulfilling experience. May we keep fishing and keep hoping for a cure!Krysti HughettResourceLink SpecialistYoung Survival Coalition

I've been aware of them since their inception, have watched with admiration as they grew and matured into what can only be called a great organization. They could be a case study about how a trio of young people with an idea worked tirelessly to achieve their clearly stated goals.Robert M.

Grassroot Soccer	255969		/users/profile/344355	quailhollow	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2015	Preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS is a top priority in world public health. Grassrootsoccer has, for over 12 years, used the game of soccer (football) as a vehicle to teach middle school- aged youth about what causes HIV/AIDS and how to protect themselves from getting it and how to tell their peers what they've learned. The success of Grassrootsoccer at reaching their audience has been overwhelming and their replicable model for teaching has been embraced by numerous other organizations to disseminate information. As a medical professional I believe Grassrootsoccer to be on the the truly "Great Non-profits."

Grassroot Soccer	313686		/users/profile/405042	Shoshana J.	Volunteer	5	10/24/2016	i love women empowerment . As a teenager i used to play ladies soccer in my country ( in Lesotho). Back in the days female players were never taken into consideration. Unfortunately never went far with my dream and talent. But this year when i heard of R.V United, ladies playing soccer!! I was thrilled and my dream got revived and these girls are awesome. I watched their game in Athlone Stadium in the past weeks( competing for the Coca Cola Cup), they really have a potential and deserve to be given a chance. I invited my friends to support them and brought with us posters to give them a moral support. 
Grassroot Soccer	312217		/users/profile/403574	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	I gave up a year of my life back in 2007/2008 to volunteer for Grassroot Soccer after a life changing event in my life. This was one of the most rewarding experience I had ever experienced and it has led me to where I am today.Since then, I consider GRS like family and I have been supporting them any chance I get. When you see the impact they have on the ground and the amazing job the entire team is doing, you really have no choice but to want to help.
Grassroot Soccer	312211		/users/profile/403569	Chris239	Volunteer	5	10/19/2016	Incredible organization. I was a field intern from 2009-2010 and working for GRS absolutely changed me to the core - introducing me to the idea that my "game" could absolutely change people's lives. That simple lesson has reverberated throughout the rest of my career and life. 
Grassroot Soccer	312192		/users/profile/403551	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/19/2016	Its hard to know where to start with the impact this organization has and the culture it fosters in the communities it serves. But I'll start by saying I find it hard to imagine working with more positive and inspiring group of people out to create genuine change in an industry that is usually more concerned with grant chasing while creating little real solutions. GRS's work often creates a cultural impact more  than concrete impacts, but from my first hand experience its abundantly clear that evidence of positive change is found in the individuals an environments they improve wherever they go. 
Grassroot Soccer	308708		/users/profile/400079	Julie280	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	I was an intern for GRS two years ago. Just today, I was speaking about GRS and my role in coach development in one of my classes (I am currently getting my masters of public and social work). The skills I learned working one on one with coaches to help them find employment and job opportunities was challenging and rewarding all at once. Working at GRS inspired me to go back to graduate school.  The foundation I gained at GRS, has helped me stand out in my classes and be able to make real world connections. The organization truly stands towards it mission. I am currently in a nonprofit management class, and as I learn about the best practices of a board/CEO, I see them reflected at GRS. I miss everyone both in Cape Town and Soweto, and working at GRS was a lifechanging experience. I will always be grateful for the opportunity to serve such an amazing NGO.

Grassroot Soccer	260099		/users/profile/348662	4tune	Former staff	5	09/29/2015	When I first started with Grassroot Soccer it was about helping young people know about HIV in Zimbabwe. However it became more about empowering myself. I realized that I was now a role model which meant a change also in my own behaviour.  GRS changed my life, I would not be the person I am today if it wasn't for GRS. It gave me purpose and opportunity to add value to young people and I am currently studying psychology just so I can continue having an impact to my society.  Thank you Grassroot soccer

I had never been exposed to GRS before that training, and I found it to be such an interactive, comprehensive way to teach children about HIV.  After returning to the school I worked at, I conducted two Grassroot Soccer interventions to provide HIV-prevention education for approximately 50 students.  My students improved their knowledge from pre-test to post-test by more than 70%, and they had a great time doing it.  It also helped to slightly de-stigmatize HIV within the school.

Using the power of sport to change lives is proven to make a lasting impact and GRS is an organization leading the way in sport for development. I am proud to support this organization and I hope others will too.

From the moment of her first inquiry I have been so astounded by the character and organization of this group.  The staff are dedicated to helping the youth of South Africa and have found such an unbelievable method to reach out and educate.  Everything about Grassroot Soccer is SO positive.  They seem to be able to accomplish whatever they can dream up with an attitude that is so inspiring.  They not only  enable but they also ennoble, working hard to motivate people to help themselves.  This is a group that works not only in the present but also looks to the future.  Community support is a powerful thing and Grassroot Soccer has tapped that.
Grassroot Soccer	256442		/users/profile/344840	eah62090	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	GRS is an Amazon organizatio. Promoting healthy living past just sexuak education. GRS teachings so many valuable lessons in a way that is fun for kids of all ages as well as the coaches that hold practices. Its easy to implement and requries no outside materials which is great for schools or orgs that have limited resources. The staff at GRS is easy to get in touch with and are really supportive. I LOVE GRS!

Grassroot Soccer	256269		/users/profile/344666	SanjayIyer	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Grassroots Soccer's innovative strategy of using soccer as a tool for education is what drew me to implementing their SKILLZ program while serving as a Youth Development Volunteer with the Peace Corps in rural Morocco.  The GRS team has created a health education methodology that is both engaging and easily understandable, and working with the GRS team and teaching the SKILLZ program was one of the most successful and personally rewarding projects of my Peace Corps service.  More importantly, the program helped empower young men and women in my community to take charge of their personal health, and the curriculum and related activities created avenues for discussing community health issues which were previously taboo and ignored.   I have also found the team at Grassroots Soccer to be very dedicated to their work, and it has been inspiring to volunteer with them over the last couple years. This is a fantastic organization with some great minds and passionate hearts striving to make the world a safer and better place. Five stars!  
Grassroot Soccer	256054		/users/profile/183832	kelseyg	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Grassroot Soccer turns small investments into big impact. I got to know GRS while I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in South Africa. They gave me basic free resources and guidance to implement their HIV education programs in my rural village, and it was one of the most impactful parts of my service. My students learned a great deal about a critical issue in their lives, and it was a very rewarding experience for my co-coach, a local sports coach who'd always wanted to get involved in helping his community but had never been given the right opportunity to shine. Later I volunteered at GRS headquarters in Cape Town to help with their Peace Corps partnership and it cemented to me what a powerful program it is and how dedicated the staff are. I'm proud to continue to support Grassroot Soccer to this day.
Grassroot Soccer	256049		/users/profile/344438	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ethiopia, I initiated the Grassroot Soccer SKILLZ program in my town with nearly 300 youth. The GRS staff are highly supportive and responsive, and the GRS SKILLZ curriculum is fact based and an excellent resource for adolescents. The kids I worked with gained tons of knowledge about HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Gender-based violence. They formed friendships with other kids participating in the program and had lots of laughs making their own KILOS. The GRS SKILLZ program really enhanced my Peace Corps experience and made a lasting impact in my community. They are a great nonprofit!
Grassroot Soccer	256046		/users/profile/344435	Writer	Donor	5	09/10/2015	The genius of Grassroot Soccer is reaching those it serves -- middle school and adolescent girls and boys in Africa and beyond -- with the sport that is their passion.  Education and prevention are not easy, but the curriculum of this organization combines fun with learning in a way that makes sense and encourages young people and their families to take responsibility for combating HIV-AIDS before it begins.  Watching the program in action, I can attest to the fact that it works. The system of recruiting staff and spreading the program to other organizational partners also has worked very well. Also, the members of the Board of Directors have done a great job!
Grassroot Soccer	256021		/users/profile/344410	DaveMack	Donor	5	09/10/2015	I recognize the positive impact GRS can have on a community. I grew up in South Africa and know how important sport is in the lives of people young and old there. Unfortunately, young people in our country face a ton of challenges, and have seen first-hand the terrible results of HIV, TB, and other massive health issues. GRS is one of the most accomplished organizations working to end the HIV epidemic by using soccer to engage youth. Their dedication as individuals and an organization is an inspiration to my community.

My favorite GRS curriculum was called "Skillz Street", a girl-focused initiative centered on reducing HIV infection rates and building self-efficacy. Watching young women graduate from the program with a light in their eyes that said, I have control over my future, has been one of the most powerful moments of my life. GRS is an amazing organization.

Grassroot Soccer	228526		/users/profile/292214	toddburns90	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	If you've spent any time in the developing world, you know that soccer rules all.  If you've worked in preventative health education in the developing world, you know that it's extremely difficult to get people to show up to, listen to, and learn from health education events.   Grassroot Soccer's health education programs use the language of soccer to convey important preventative health messages.  Not only do their programs encourage teamwork, participation, and sportsmanship, they force youth to critically think about what motivates people to behave in unsafe ways and they teach youth how to avoid risky situations through role play. I implemented both their SKILLZ Malaria and SKILLZ HIV/AIDS program during my service as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Burkina Faso, and it was hands down the most effective health education program that I used.  What was most impressive was the emphasis the organization places on monitoring and evaluation, a practice that is severely lacking in development work.  Their M&E practices were so good that the Peace Corps actually asked the organization to present at an M&E conference held for Directors of Training and Programs in Africa. Preventative health education is an extremely difficult field to be successful in, but Grassroot Soccer programs actually reach youth and make a meaningful impact.  Their programs should be considered a best practice in the field of preventative health education.

GRS is dedicated to a worthy cause that brings HIV/AIDS prevention education to the forefront of the international community.

The energy and enthusiasm in the programs on the ground is contagious, and these programs perfectly exemplify how effective a sport for development NGO can be.  I grew a tremendous amount during my year at GRS, I formed life-long friendships that I value as much as I do those with whom I grew up, and I developed an understanding of what I see as the most effective way to combat the enormous challenge of the spread of HIV: through the world's love of soccer. 
Grassroot Soccer	224362		/users/profile/288118	Kbhauti	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2014	I worked for GRS for 2 years as a Grants Manager in Zimbabwe. GRS is the best sport for development organisation that uses evidence based approach to youths' behaviour change education. I have witnessed local soccer stars working with youths in schools and the youths are inspired to change behaviour as directed by their role models. I liked the use of soccer to communicate youths daily challenges and solutions. GRS maximizes learning with fun. All high density schools in Bulawayo want to work with GRS because their kids have less HIV related challenges to deal with. The coaches who work with the youths are amazing in their level of energy, articulation of the issues and engaging conversations. I watched one session called risk field, it explains the daily challenges youths face and have to make decisions. Really the world is missing an approach that could solve halve of the youths problems. I enjoyed my stay at GRS until a more challenging position came about but still my heart is not far away from GRS. I would take an opportunity to work with the family given a chance and would encourage all to go and watch an activity if possible after reading this post.

Everyone that is involved with GRS is so passionate and energetic about the organization and it is no surprise since their mission and work is fabulous. I absolutely love everything about GRS and I support them 100% especially after working in the office and seeing how the organization works from inside out. 
Grassroot Soccer	189303		/users/profile/247044	dlarocca	Volunteer	5	11/25/2013	I was a field intern in Kimberley, South Africa for Grassroot Soccer, where I had an extremely valuable experience. The project coordination experience I gained was excellent, and the Grassroot Soccer staff and volunteers are all helpful, thoughtful, and always happy to help you with whatever you need.
Grassroot Soccer	187369		/users/profile/244369	Akhila13	Donor	5	11/01/2013	I interacted with Grassroot Soccer in early 2013. I was amazed and inspired by the organizations ability to combine a universal language of football and a sound Public Health, Human Rights and Gender Responsive approach to bring to the forefront the issue of HIV and GBV prevention. I am super proud of GRS's ability to produce such high impact results and reach such high numbers. I know you will continue to soar to new heights. I know this is the start of even greater things. 
Grassroot Soccer	184293		/users/profile/241229	katiehadley	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I was a short term Operations intern for the GRS Partners division for a summer in Cape Town.  I had been working on a master's of public policy degree and the amazing staff at GRS took me on to help out. They made sure I had a positive, rewarding experience while helping the mission of the organization.  More than anywhere I worked, GRS truly felt like a family.  I was welcomed instantly and I was extremely sad to leave when my internship ended.  GRS is the best non-profit I have ever had the privilege to work for.  They have a family type environment while being able to run things with efficiency of a fortune 500 company.  The perfect mix of seriousness and fun while having a passion for their work. 
Grassroot Soccer	183199		/users/profile/240104	hasmin.sherwin	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I volunteered through GRS for one year, 2011-2012.  I was placed at an implementing partner, Kick4Life, who was using the GRS HIV education curriculum. I found the GRS mentor driven, small group model to be an extremely effective way of teaching for youth in Lesotho. I have nothing but respect for all of the GRS staff in South Africa who I had the pleasure of working with.
Grassroot Soccer	183015		/users/profile/239913	esaito	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I spent an amazing year volunteering with GRS in Kimberley, South Africa. I met so many talented, driven, and passionate people who inspired me and continue to inspire me to this day. As an intern in a small, remote site, I immersed myself in the local culture. I played with a local soccer team, at meals at our coaches houses, watched soccer at the township taverns, and built relationship with our staff and coaches. My time with GRS helped remind me that the HIV/AIDS crisis isn't about statistics and percentages, but about the people who are affected by the disease everyday. 
Grassroot Soccer	182963	1	/users/profile/239855	bhughesmanda	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2013	GRS rocks! As Director of Programming and Training for the U.S. Peace Corps in South Africa, I have had the priveledge to work with the wonderful and committed staff of GRS for the past two years.  Our partnerships have supported numerous Volunteers in the field, as well as their community counterparts, and thousands of youth beneficiaries throughout South Africa.  GRS's PC Skillz package is an off-the-shelf evidence based intervention that can be implemented by Volunteers and Counterparts with minimal training and support, and with fantastic results.  I don't know anyone who leaves an interaction with GRS who doesn't want to shout out a kilo in support of GRS.  Thanks for all that you do!
Grassroot Soccer	182948	1	/users/profile/239839	Molly Hamm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2013	I've had the pleasure to work with Grassroot Soccer through one of their partner programs in the Dominican Republic. The interactive methodology used in the curriculum is one of the greatest factors for the program's success. I have extensive experience working with children and youth in educational setting, and Grassroot Soccer curriculum is one of the best ways to both engage students and help them learn how to prevent HIV/AIDS. I've watched many of our young students grow from being participants, to being leaders and coaches in the program, teaching others the same lessons that helped transform their lives. The Grassroot Soccer team is a joy to work with. They are efficient, visionary, creative, evidence-based and, although they've seen significant growth, they still maintain that grassroots feel.
Grassroot Soccer	182942		/users/profile/239832	Jeremy16	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Grassroot Soccer has been an amazing experience and continues to be an important part of my life. I have worked for them for more than a year and I got to see pretty much all of the aspects of the organization as it was till a startup back then. What is really exciting nowadays is the way that the team has put in place processes and uses technology to improve the overall organization's efficiency. Finally, one of the aspects that makes it even more impressive is the amount of money that actually got towards projects. The organization put most of its resources on the ground where it matters most.  
Grassroot Soccer	182904		/users/profile/239786	jdevbu12	Volunteer	5	10/27/2013	Spent an amazing year in there intern program based out of South Africa.

The organization has amazing energy and that energy shows in the programs it runs. 
Grassroot Soccer	182889	1	/users/profile/239771	Sarah147	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2013	Grassroot Soccer (GRS)  has worked as a partner with the organizaiton I work with for the last two years.  The entire partnership has been hugley successful. In all of our work together, they continuously put the beneficiaries first and put a high emphasis on quality. This results in projects that are succesful because there is local support, excitement by beneficiaries, and tangible outcomes for participants. GRS is an organization that prides itself as evidence-based, with a strong culture of monitoring and evaluation that guarantees top-tier programming and training. The people who work at GRS are extremely responsive and supportive of our two organizations' mutual goals and understanding of the differences between them.  I would readily suggest working with this organization (as a partner, beneficiary, or donor) to anyone that is interested in HIV/AIDS, sports for development, and internationl devleopment issues.
Grassroot Soccer	182805		/users/profile/239682	jeffreygrover	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2013	Though not professionally involved with non-profits myself, over the last 3 years I have had significant social interaction with 10+ Grassroots volunteers.  They are all exceedingly caring, thoughtful and intelligent humans, and I can echo Arvind's sentiment below that GRS is in good hands if it is continually attracting such people to work for them.
Grassroot Soccer	182666	1	/users/profile/239538	Liverpool15	Volunteer	5	10/26/2013	Grassroot Soccer is an incredible organization that works at the interface of community health and epidemiology.  Leveraging their position within various communities of sub-Saharan Africa, GRS works at a grassroots level (no pun intended) to affect a positive change in the lives of young people.  The organization itself is a dynamic, fast-paced and inspirational community - driven by an interdisciplinary team of passionate and hardworking individuals. It was a pleasure to volunteer for GRS and I continue to glean new insights from my experience even now, years later.  
Grassroot Soccer	182451		/users/profile/239266	gattobauer	Donor	5	10/25/2013	GRS is a well designed, well organized and very well staffed organization that educates young people about HIV/Aids through the sport of soccer.  Brilliant!
Grassroot Soccer	182396		/users/profile/239213	James Louter	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2013	I had , what turned out to be a special privilege of being a guest, thanks to Kristin Kennedy of Grassroots Soccer SA, at a Skillz Street women's training session in Soweto.   Walking into the impressive Nike Football centre I had no idea what to except and good thing too!  I was the only male amongst 40 odd girls in what was a  very open and vocal group.  As a white male from South Africa growing up in the 80's & 90's I enjoyed a privileged up bringing and access to the best education.   But despite that I still did not get exposed to the kind of life skills information I  learnt in the 90mins class.My country is still growing, building and finding itself.  And in doing so still needs to meet the everyday challenges.  The content , method and passion of all involved is what makes GRS crucial to the development of my country. Thank you. 
Grassroot Soccer	182366	1	/users/profile/239181	dbaker76	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2013	What impresses most about GrassRoot Soccer is the organization's seamless integration of the most important aspects of education, behavior change, capacity-building and project management into one memorable and effective methodology and package. Every detail of their work is considered, piloted and reviewed with stakeholders through a participative and evidence-based approach. Behind the solid methodology lies a team of individuals who make things happen - I have been nothing short of impressed in each and every interaction with this crackerjack team. They have fun, and they can demonstrate their impact. One big Ethiopian "kee-low" for this fantastic organization.
Grassroot Soccer	182362		/users/profile/239176	trevor.w.prophet	Volunteer	5	10/25/2013	I volunteered for GRS from August 2011-December 2012 and had a blast. GRS is an incredibly unique organization due to it's intimate involvement in various communities while using a wealth of resources to tackle the way too common epidemic of HIV. GRS brings an organized, energetic, and highly personal approach to prevention that is making a difference every day. I highly recommend volunteering for GRS and it was an experience I will never forget. Much respect to everyone helping GRS take down HIV!
Grassroot Soccer	182348		/users/profile/239160	Nini Meyer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/25/2013	Positive Tracks works with Grassroot Soccer as a partner who helps to support youth fundraising efforts of GRS youth 3v3 Soccer Tournaments across the USA. On top of their global work with AIDS/HIV Prevention, GRS is a highly respected leader in the field of Sports-Based Youth Development. Their entire staff is amazingly collaborative, forward thinking, and very willing to share excellent GRS models/systems with other charities like Positive Tracks and its partners. GRS has developed and launched very successful (and global) peer-to-peer engagement strategies and mentoring programs over several years time to continually inspire tremendous passion and commitment from volunteers, partners, and staff.  They are a savvy, capable, particularly generous organization, and bring a contagious spirit of fun to helping the world. Positive Tracks is also deeply impressed with GRS tracking systems, growth strategies, and measurement of tangible outcomes. Positive Tracks is beyond thrilled to be working with GRS, and have learned a great deal from this organization. 
Grassroot Soccer	182240		/users/profile/239008	bsassanpour	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2013	Quite possibly the most epic NGO around!  GRS has a good mission accompanied with strong staff and volunteer group.
Grassroot Soccer	182237		/users/profile/239005	gliddent	Donor	5	10/24/2013	My brother works for GRS and was introduced to the program by Tommy Clark, its founder.  This nonprofit is a very well organized, compassionate group who harness sport's educational powers for the greater good.  I have seen this program work, in person, in Kimberley, South Africa during the World Cup and was impressed by what it had achieved there in a relatively short amount of time.  Their HIV/AIDS education curriculum for young people works and will work where ever it is implemented simply because they have designed it to educate through the powerful lessons found in sports, specifically soccer.
Grassroot Soccer	182232		/users/profile/239000	BardoS	Donor	5	10/24/2013	We were introduced to GRS through several of their dedicated workers and supporters and were quickly convinced that it is a non profit organization that puts their mission into action. By using the power of soccer they have been able to educate, inspire, and mobilize communities to help stop the spread of HIV. 
Grassroot Soccer	182132		/users/profile/238897	Arvind	Donor	5	10/24/2013	We have not seen GRS programs directly but we do know a number of people who have worked and who now work for GRS. And they are oustanding as people and volunteers: committed, thoughtful, giving, and selfless. If GRS can continue to attract and retain such volunteers it will remain a highly effective NGO to which we would happily continue contributing.
Grassroot Soccer	182129		/users/profile/238894	mspiak	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	Every once in a while you stumble across a group of people, a cause, an organization, that you know is doing it right. That's Grassroot Soccer. Working with GRS in Zambia, I saw first hand how effectively and powerfully Grassroot Soccer mobilized entire communities. GRS provides locals, both youth and adults, with the skills, tools and joy necessary to overcome the HIV epidemic. And it's working!
Grassroot Soccer	182126		/users/profile/238891	lazyastor	Donor	5	10/24/2013	GRS continues to impress with their passionate staff and dedication to a great cause.  The team works well together because they are all passionate about the cause and the sport of soccer.

I can say with great confidence that GRS is one of the best ones out there!  I was so impressed with it's staff, that I encouraged my brother to be an intern in 2012/13.  A truly cutting edge organization, with excellent staff!
Grassroot Soccer	145903		/users/profile/192504	jnathans	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/04/2012	GRS' programs provide kids with a chance to think for themselves and to engage with each other in meaningful dialogue about the massive pressures they face... all in a supported environment. Beyond the initial success of the program, GRS has truly been results-driven and open to criticism and adaptation since day one--they're really doing things the right way.
Grassroot Soccer	143852		/users/profile/190339	tahlgren	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/28/2012	Since its inception, Grassroot Soccer has pushed the envelop in results-based health education. This is evident now by their 2012-2013 randomized control trial with health outcomes.  On the execution level, Grassroot Soccer has people and processes to provide education tools to make a tremendous impact. They are leading by example amongst international non-profit organizations.
Grassroot Soccer	142051		/users/profile/188474	Bupe	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/22/2012	A truly cutting edge and innovative organization, GRS focuses on results. They apply a refreshing approach to public health and HIV prevention, using the powerful game of soccer to catalyze youth as community changemakers. The dynamic and driven GRS team views their work through a critical lens at all levels -- Coaches educating youth are continually evaluating their impact in the field while senior leadership ensures the programming is based on the latest research developments in HIV prevention. For these reasons alone, GRS is truly a leader in the HIV prevention field!

Vermont Mozart Festival	32703	11	/users/profile/33524	caroline2	General Member of the Public	5	03/08/2010	I love the VT Mozart Fest!  No matter who you are, but especially if you are visiting VT, you should attend a VT Mozart Fest concert during the summer.  VT at its best!  I have attended about 5 Mozart concerts.  My favorite venue is Shelburne Farms; down by the lake on the gorgeous property of the Vanderbilt's farm.  Bring your picnic basket full of yummy foods; wine, beer, cheese, bread, fruit, salad, etc even put in a pair of candlesticks for your picnic blanket.  What could be more romantic and enjoyable?  And I haven't even mentioned the beautiful music.  Somehow the music is even more wonderful (if that's possible) under the evening sky.  I go to the Mozart Festival for the whole experience; the music, the amazing surroundings, the food, and the drink.  You must go...you don't know what you are missing!
Vermont Mozart Festival	32487	8	/users/profile/33299	enchanted	Client Served	5	03/04/2010	My husband Ted and I have attended Mozart Festival concerts for many years and have loved them -- especially those at the Shelburne Inn, where we sit on the glorious Inn lawns, looking out to the sun setting over Lake Champlain, having enjoyed a luscious picnic, and listen closely to the beauty of these well-chosen programs and excellent performers. Also much-loved are their concerts in the Trapp Family Lodge meadows.Deborah Alexander, Calgary, Canada, who summers in Johnson VT.

Hearing and watching these world-class musicians perform in a variety of spectacular outdoor sites is always a magical experience. Picnicing before the performances, and then sitting in the stillness with the beauty of the surrounding music as night falls is always a special and memorable occasion.
Vermont Mozart Festival	32042	8	/users/profile/32849	venda2009	Donor	5	03/01/2010	My husband and I have been attending Vermont Mozart Festival (VMF) events for over 20 years.  The VMF is a Vermont treasure.  It captures the essence of what is special about summer in Vermont.  These include world-class  musicians performing in spectacular settings.  We especially enjoy the outdoor concerts and look forward each year to picnicking with friends before the concert begins.  It is a quintessential Vermont experience that we are so thankful the VMF nurtures and produces year after year.

Vermont Mozart Festival	30194	11	/users/profile/31197	limboshire	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2010	As an audience member, I can attest to the profound enjoyment of the musical offerings provided by the Vermont Mozart Festival, consistently, each year.  As a classically trained musician, I can attest to the high quality and professionalism of the musicians, sound technicians, musical directors, and other professionals who are involved with this festival--many of whom have long and distinguished careers.  As a native Vermonter, I can attest to the strong cultural contributions that the Festival makes by combining the arts with the profound natural beauty and historical venues in which this music takes place.  The Vermont Mozart Festival is a "jewel in the Vermont crown" that I hope will continue to endure and improve.

So please join us in experiencing the festival in person!  Plan a vacation during the festival, explore the state and then relax with a picnic at a concert watching the sun set and listening to a sonorous evening of music.
Vermont Mozart Festival	29946	6	/users/profile/30937	cappy1	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2010	We are relative newcomers to summers in Stowe.  When we first arrived friends invited us to picnic with them and enjoy the concert.  We were bowled over and now consider the concerts the highlight of our summer. In fact we have started arriving earlier so we can hear as many as possible - and our invitation to houseguests is based on the music.
Vermont Mozart Festival	29870	6	/users/profile/30858	hien	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2010	I attended a concert as part of the Festival in the summer of 2007. Our experience at the Vermont Mozart Festival concert in the 2007 summer was truly amazing and unforgetable. This festival is a great example of the kind of artistic, community activities that bring people together and promote culture and the arts. I highly reccommend to those who consider checking the festival out or donating to support the festival going forward.

The Winter Concerts in Stowe and Burlington, the ever popular Gilbert and Sullivan performances and the Summer Concert Series are all gems. We are so fortunate to have Bill Metcalf conducting. It is an wonderful organization staffed with truly dedicated volunteers. I can't imagine a summer or winter without the VMF.

Vermont Mozart Festival	29310	4	/users/profile/30337	martha1	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	I have been attending Mozart Festival concerts for 20 years, almost my whole adult life. It provides top quality performances in beautiful settings. The real strength of the Festival, though, is the community that springs up around it. Over the years I've gone with friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, etc. And when I go I know I might see just about anyone I've ever met in Vermont.  You can volunteer and go for free, you can pay and sit up front, you can get tickets from friends at the last minute, but no matter how you get there you'll see people from all parts of your life sitting together, enjoying the outdoors and talking. There's really nothing else like it in Vermont. We all get to take a deep breath and remember how nice it is to live here together.

Vermont Mozart Festival	29306	10	/users/profile/30333	amyktillotson	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	We as Vermonters are truly blessed that organizations such as the Vermont Mozart Festival are committed to bringing the arts to what would otherwise be considered a rural, agricultural state.  It is because of them, and others like them, that Vermont is known as culturally rich and beautiful place to visit and to live.  As a birthday gift last year my husband bought us tickets and we enjoyed an unforgettable evening in the Coach Barn Courtyard at Shelburne Farms.  We had dinner by the lake and then sat in the courtyard and enjoyed the warm breezes, watched birds fly around the courtyard and listened to virtuoso performances of artists who would otherwise not have come to our corner of the world.  It was a truly unforgettable evening and one of the best birthday gifts I have, or will ever, receive.  We are truly blessed to have this organization in Vermont.

We often attend concerts in our nation's capitol and can favorably compare the Vermont Mozart Festival to other concerts we have attended.  Our young children also have thoroughly enjoyed the children's concerts and the venues are fabulous.  We consider attending the Vermont Mozart Festival one of the our favorite summertime activities.
Vermont Mozart Festival	29279	4	/users/profile/30309	a-bergeron	Client Served	5	02/19/2010	I was born and raised in Vermont, educated, for the most part, in Vermont, and have chosen to put my roots down in one of our loveliest, and most remote, rural communities. That I can live close to the land and at the same time enjoy live access to first-rate classical musicians, vocalists, and conductors, is one of the true joys of my life in these hills, and is, I believe, a uniquely "Vermont" experience. I am sincerely grateful, year-round, for the love, hard work, and dedication of the Vermont Mozart Festival staff and volunteers who work tirelessly to bring us the highest quality classical music in a variety of diverse and gorgeous venues. Each venue enhances and supports the experience of the music by featuring the shorelines that extend alongside the vast waters of Lake Champlain, the green alpine meadows encircled by dark ridge lines, and the distinct architectural achievements of our churches, meeting halls, and antique barns. I have heard works such as Handel's "Messiah" and Mozart's "Requiem" in full, as well as Bach masterpieces, Vivaldi concertos, and Mozart symphonies for the past twenty-five years. I was twenty-four when my then-born-and raised-in-Vermont boyfriend took me to my first festival performance - opening night at Shelburne Farms, complete with an elegant dressage demonstration. I have rarely missed a summer concert since then, and often, I attend two, sometimes three. Not only have I been able to watch my former, beloved U.V.M. history professor conduct, and hear now-former colleagues sing and play, but I have been exposed to some of the finest musicians, vocalists, and conductors from outside of our state who are attracted to the festival each year. Perhaps best of all, the festival is committed to educating people of all ages about the beauty, relevance, and artistry of classical music, a component of their work that is of vital importance. The Vermont Mozart Festival is a pearl, a wonder, a marvel. I am so thankful for its presence in a place that I know well and love deeply.

Vermont Mozart Festival	29266	3	/users/profile/30298	scarlett1	Donor	5	02/19/2010	My husband and I have attended many Vermont Mozart Festival Concerts.  We usually go to The Grand Opening which also includes the Dressage at The Inn at Shelburne Farms.  The Grand Opening concert usually falls on the weekend we celebrate our wedding anniversary; this year it will be 38 years!! We have been coming to the concerts for at least 18 years with family and friends.  We love the concert being outside and we usually stay right at the Inn so we don't have to contend with driving home. We live just outside Plattsburgh, NY.  The conductors do a wonderful job of explaining the period the music comes from and a little about the composers.  The performers are just great and the music filling the warm summer air is delightful.It is the highlight of our summer and something we look forward to all year.
Vermont Mozart Festival	29265	4	/users/profile/30297	stowe	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	I love the Vt Mozart Festival and try to support them in every way I can.  I have gone to concerts in Stowe, outdoors at Trapp Family Lodge but when the concerts were rained out from being held outside, I was really glad that we had indoor tickets. The music was so mezmerizing that one forgets where they are! I live in the NY/Phl area and have attended many concerts. I was so happy to find that the concerts in VT were just as excellent as in the big cities. I am looking forward to another great season!
Vermont Mozart Festival	29250	4	/users/profile/30280	amadeus-vermont	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	I attended two different nights of the Vermont Mozart Festival last year - one with my parents, who were visiting from out of town, and one with friends. On both occasions, we set up blanets and low chairs and enjoyed a picnic dinner as we listened to fantastic music and enjoyed a wonderful summer evening outdoors at Shelburne Farm. This festival is a great way to connect with family and share music, nature, and one of Vermont's finest music traditions.
Vermont Mozart Festival	29242	4	/users/profile/30272	nance	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	My husband and I and many of our friends have shared in the enjoyment of the Mozart Festival for over 20 years!  Our favorite location was the Trapp Family Meadow.  Many, many nights, we sat and listened to the music and watched the moon rise over Nebraska Valley!  Oh, what memories.  Unfortunately, my husband passed away almost two years ago.  I didn't go to the Festival that year but did go this year with my 3 year old granddaughter to the Children's programs at the Vermont Teddy Bear series.  She and I loved it!  This year, we will try Stowe again.  No matter if it is too advanced for a 4 year old this summer; she still will have gained a further love of music.  Her Grampie would have been so pleased!
Vermont Mozart Festival	29239	4	/users/profile/30270	sports-mom21hotmailcom	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	I've experienced the VT Mozart Festival as a 'concert-goer'--with my 2 daughters--for many years. We have loved all of our experiences with this organization; enough so that I  now volunteer to support and enjoy being 'a part' of this great organization. This shows the organizers and performers--as well as the audience-- of my support for the VT Mozart Festival performances.My favorite of course is the opening with the dressage performances since I am an equestrien and dressage rider. Many thanks to everyone who contribute so much with their time and talents to give so much back to the people of Vermont and surrounding communities.
Vermont Mozart Festival	29224	11	/users/profile/30256	vtlovertoo	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	I really enjoyed the concerts at the Trapp Family location - it's a beautiful setting, purple mountains in the near distance, everyone so polite with their chairs in the back area while those with just blankets were in front - oh and the cows expressed their love of the music with perfectly timed "moooo's!" I shared the event with friends from NYC (I'm from Boston) - we planned our trip to Stowe around the event - highly recommend it!!! Looking forward to going this summer!

Now that I live here I'm not only happy to go to the Mozart Festival Concerts every summer, I'm proud of all of us who support such a excellent music festival and proud of the organization that provides us with the talent that makes the Vermont Mozart Festival such a joy.

I build my summer around the schedule of the Festival, and have come to recognize certain concert as critical benchmarks in my year. My life is so much richer because of VMF.

I participated in production of Gilbert & Sullivan plays in High School.  I am so happy that the Mozart Festival keeps G&S alive in the Green Mountain State.  Of all the concerts it is the G&S series which I go to.  The high quality of the vocal performances under Mr. Metcalf's superb direction have brought much enjoyment to myself and other members of my family.  A great cultural wonder for the state.

The artistry is consistently first-rate, featuring a combination of old favorites and more challenging programming. The ambience is delightful, with friendly and respectful audiences. The venues, beginning with the lakeside concerts at Shelburne Farms  are nothing short of spectacularly beautiful. The Festival is the highpoint of a Vermont summer.

Why?  No matter which venue we choose, we are always assured of a superb musical experience.  The efficient management and the beautiful and diverse venues are added advantages for visitors from afar.  Thank you for these memorable highlights of our summers in Vermont.

Vermont Mozart Festival	29164	4	/users/profile/30204	allan-nicholls	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	Nancy and I spent our last two anniversaries picnic-ing at the Mozart Festival Performance held in August at the Shelburne Inn. The first of these, a rain-out, had all the potential of a disaster  but turned out to be a most beautifully unique evening of music, food and wine in a brick building at the Essex Fairgrounds (their cover set). Last year's event, with the opera company along, was a perfect evening, with a perfect sunset and lush music on the lawn of the Shelburne Inn and could not have been better. We will be spending every anniversary from here on in with the Vermont Mozart Festival as we have created a tradition with only two visits. Thanks so much to the organizers of this wonderful musical event!
Vermont Mozart Festival	29162	3	/users/profile/30199	woolgatherer	Client Served	5	02/19/2010	We loved the Vermont Mozart Festival last year (2009), which was our first time.  The organization involved in parking all the cars, guiding the people to the site of the concert, and then (toughest of all) moving the concentrated clump of people leaving in an orderly fashion out was impressive.  Beyond that, of course, the concert was fine and the setting superb.  We'll be back.

My wife and I always ensure at least one of our summer trips coincides with an concert with the Vermont Mozart Festival, preferably up on Luce Hill in that natural outdoor ampitheater.  We take in the music, the air, and regenerate and repower.

Vermont Mozart Festival	29106	3	/users/profile/30147	lburns	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2010	I began attending the Vermont Mozart Festival when I was a child and was mesmerized by the entire experience back then.  It built a foundation of musical appreciation that has lasted throughout my life.  I have traveled a lot of the world and there is still nothing so special as attending a concert at Shelburne Farms, listening to world class musicians while watching the sun set over Lake Champlain.  I took my father to opening night last summer and you could see how the music transported him to almost a magical place.  It was a wonderful evening, surrounded by friends and the sounds of the Mozart.  A truly great evening.

Attending one of their concerts is an amazing opportunity to hear world class musicians playing world class music...while sitting on a picnic blanket, drinking a glass of wine.  Add to this a celebration of the historic and scenic venues of Vermont, and you can truly say there is really no other musical experience like this.  The festival is the highlight of my summer, and preparing a picnic feast to attend the Grand Opening with a group of friends has become an annual event.
The BOMA Project	229824	4	/users/profile/293472	wwambrose	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	My wife and I just returned from two weeks in the field with Kathleen and Kura to visit BOMA's important work in the drylands of Northern Kenya - one of the poorest regions of the world, and one of the most vulnerable to climate change.  BOMA provides a combination of small monetary grants and basic business training and mentorship to help women establish new sources of income.  As these new businesses take hold - small shops, butcheries, fish and livestock traders - BOMA also helps support the establishment of savings associations among participants to create a hedge against the perils of drought.  The impact we witnessed was astounding. We heard story after story of economic empowerment, of self-reliance, of successful savings strategies.  The savings groups established by BOMA's women have helped to strengthen communities and save lives by providing small loans to pay for emergency transport to hospital, for school fees, or for helping the neediest.  We were overwhelmed by the gratitude expressed by the women we met for the tools, the support, and the awareness that BOMA has provided them.  These women deserve all the credit for the success of the program.  Thank you BOMA for giving them that opportunity!
The BOMA Project	226403	2	/users/profile/290132	sue_mccann4	Donor	5	10/24/2014	I have been discouraged by our past history of "aiding those poor people" and then I had the opportunity to travel with a group of women on a trip to Kenya that was led by Kathleen Colson, founder of BOMA. This was such a different approach - one that took time to establish because it rested on the solid foundation of building relationships and honoring and respecting the skills and desires of those who live in northern Kenya by incorporating them in the process. It also succeeded because BOMA provides support through training, follow up and mentors. The mentors are citizens in their villages who are chosen for their skills and leadership qualities.I witnessed such compassion and passion in the BOMA leadership and such hope from the women who are now able to get better food, provide medicine and education and even participate in a savings program. Now I am more encouraged that this model exists and succeeds.
The BOMA Project	226305	2	/users/profile/290039	nbtruluck	Donor	5	10/24/2014	I have seen BOMA in action.  Hearing women in this program in one of the poorest, most resource starved regions of Africa talk about how their participation in BOMA has made the difference between needing regular food aid, and being able to earn enough money to feed their families and pay school fees for their children was an inspiring and heart-warming experience.  BOMA is a model for ngo's in the developing world.  It works directly with women who most need help by giving them know-how and a start in their small businesses.
The BOMA Project	226255	2	/users/profile/289992	Jerry37	Donor	5	10/24/2014	My wife and I visited Kenya several years ago.  We became acquainted with Kathleen Colson and the work that BOMA was doing in Kenya.  We saw first-hand the need for assistance by many people living in small villages and in rural communities.  As BOMA developed its program of helping women through loans and training in developing their on businesses so that they might feed their families we were hopeful.  We decided to become a regular donor.  With each passing year we are impressed by the stories--but particularly by the statistics that show that the program is working and that nearly 100% of the women assisted through BOMA are still reaping the success of their hard work and of BOMA's training and support year after year.  Thank you, BOMA, for the impact that you are having upon thousands of people--particularly, kids--in Kenya.
The BOMA Project	226253	1	/users/profile/205337	kateh123	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2014	I think the Boma Fund is the most impressive non-profit out there. It is the essence of what an aid organization should be: teaching woman how to fish instead of giving them a fish (metaphorically speaking). The results are not only compelling they are exciting! My only wish is that I had more money to give to this organization.

The organization's deep and nuanced understanding of local dynamics on the ground, its commitment to its beneficiaries, and its insistence on conducting all of its operations with the highest standards of transparency and integrity combine to make BOMA a truly first-rate organization. The demonstrated positive impact that BOMA has in the areas that it works in is a reflection of all of the years of hard work that the organization's staff in Kenya and the US have put in to bring the organization to where it is today.
The BOMA Project	207220	1	/users/profile/269819	ClareMcLaughlin	Volunteer	5	07/25/2014	I interned with The BOMA Project during Summer 2014 after studying in Kenya during the Fall of 2013. I've learned so much about international development, economics, people, nonprofits, and so much more. What has struck me the most has been the careful attention to detail, data, and studies. BOMA does not dive into development with "expert" bias, but does hold itself accountable to the standards and monitoring  of an "expert." The amount of passion and willingness to grow at BOMA is infectious and encourages me to delve deeper into development, but of course with the meticulous, conscious eye of the BOMA family. 
The BOMA Project	207149	1	/users/profile/269721	kcbrown15	Volunteer	5	07/24/2014	I am currently working as a research intern for the BOMA project. I studied abroad in Kenya from January-May of 2014. Though I returned to the United States, my time abroad fostered a life-long love for Kenya. Although my semester had to come to an end, I knew that I had to remain involved, thus I began working for BOMA.As a political science major, I have done my fair share of research about what makes an effective nonprofit, and have seen many examples of unsuccessful organizations. BOMA on the other hand, is undeniably effective. Whether looking at the statistics of how we have impacted women in Northern Kenya, or reading quotes from the women themselves, it is clear that BOMA is changing lives.I am so proud to be a part of this organization, and am excited to watch its influence grow. 
The BOMA Project	185551		/users/profile/242522	Brownhardt	Donor	5	10/30/2013	BOMA consistently strives to improve the execution of its mission and to expand its reach to those in need.  BOMA focuses on providing the tools necessary to teach self sufficiency and to end the cycle of poverty in an underserved area of Kenya.  Through its website and mailings, BOMA does an excellent job of explaining its initiatives and of keeping its supporters informed.   BOMA also generously supports student interns (including many Kenyans) who are interested in international development.  BOMA thereby provides critical exposure and valuable experience to those who are motivated to work on the many problems that vex the underdeveloped world.

I was interested in working there because I studied abroad in Kenya after my Freshman year and wanted to give back to the country I loved.  The work that the BOMA Project does is not only great, but it actually works.  The micro-financing techniques that they use to start businesses from the ground-up for communities is exceptional, successful and sustainable.  The work that they were able to do was very encouraging, and I am very happy to work with such an exceptional group of people.  Thanks, BOMA!
The BOMA Project	181163	1	/users/profile/237872	alexsvmc	Donor	5	10/22/2013	BOMA does an amazing job at giving women the tools they need to change their own lives and "graduate" from extreme poverty. When I give $150, I know that is the amount of the cash grant that starts one business. One business empowers 3 women so they can earn an income and build up savings. Three women can then pay for food, school and medical care for more than 15 children. Where else can you donate $150 and know that you've been able to affect so much change?
The BOMA Project	181052		/users/profile/237763	Stanzi M.	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	I interned with The BOMA Project in 2010. After studying abroad in Kenya during school, I was looking to return to Africa - when I heard about BOMA's internship, I knew it would be a great stepping stone to do so. My experience at BOMA was not only a great learning experience, but opened my eyes to the fundamentals of how a transparent non profit organization should do things. Kathleen and the entire staff are extremely dedicated to the ultimate mission of their organization and it's been a pleasure watching them grow, transform and expand into one of East Africa's leaders in the non profit/NGO world. After leaving BOMA, I entered the Peace Corps for a brief period of time, returning to Africa, and was confident in applying the knowledge and tools that I gained through my experience at BOMA to my new role as a volunteer. BOMA is a wonderful cause and one that I will continue to support in the future.

The BOMA Project	178321		/users/profile/234931	keorme.1	Volunteer	4	10/16/2013	I had the privilege  of interning at The BOMA Project in early 2013. I evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted the effectiveness of loan-based and grand-based microlending schemes. I specifically looked at how each method is implemented in populations of extreme rural poverty--such as the populations BOMA works with in rural northern Kenya.  I felt both supported and challenged during my internship experience. Witnessing the daily operations of this dynamic and ambitious nonprofit solidified my confidence in BOMA's ability to truly effect change. By focusing on an specific population in a particular region, BOMA works tirelessly to change lives and take strides forward. From the director to the interns to the technological assistance, The BOMA Project is well-led, well-staffed and well-funded. BOMA is firmly committed to its cause and this shows throughout the organization. I strongly support the BOMA Project.

We have found Boma to be one of the most effective initiatives we have witnessed in our travels as Funders. The Boma approach to uplifting women and children is a community based, realistic  and accountable model. You can be assured that every donation is carefully expended to benefit those  who are most in need.

The BOMA Project	144983		/users/profile/191544	Lisa201	Donor	5	11/30/2012	I can't speak highly enough of The BOMA project!  They are an exceptionally dedicated long-serving group of individuals, both in the US and in Kenya, that strive for a 100% success rate in businesses that they assist.  They are extremely thoughtful in how they achieve their successes, manage with impeccable honesty and design programs that foster their desire for "prosperity with dignity". There is not a BOMA beneficiary out there who is not grateful for their efforts.
The BOMA Project	143755		/users/profile/190231	Chris102	Donor	5	11/28/2012	Our world has a plethora of needs and the challenge for contributors is to identify those organizations that provide real solutions that produce sustainable positive outcomes.  BOMA's quest to "Help Women Graduate From Poverty" in Northern Kenya is so compelling it inspires action.  BOMA serves the neediest of the needy and they do it with passion and drive.   They produce measurable results by providing grants, tools and actionable strategies to empower women as entrepreneurs creating an economy that serves the community.  This is not an aids based organization - this organization is all about action and producing sustainable success!

Our firm has substantial experience with NGOs and developing world issues. We find BOMA to have an extraordinarily disciplined, effective, and original strategy. They are tightly focused on their target area and target clients -- some of the poorest people in some of the most difficult terrain in the Horn of Africa -- and they produce extraordinary results, including a 97 percent success rate for business start-ups after three years. These guys are the real deal, putting everything they can into developing self-sustaining businesses, developed and mentored by locals, with a model that far outperforms typical microfinance.

We've worked with BOMA for about a year now -- and learned their programs inside and out -- and not only is their work truly different in the world of rural economic development but their success rate is astounding and measured in terms that unapologetically put the impact in communities they serve ahead of all other measures. 
The BOMA Project	139710		/users/profile/185838	Nahela Hadi	Advisor	5	11/15/2012	As an advisor to BOMA, I am always impressed with the high level of commitment, efficiency and positive impact demonstrated by the organization.  They partner with the communities they serve, basing programs on actual needs of the people on the ground, and employing and training local Kenyans to implement the projects.  They smartly use monitoring and evaluation tools to constantly measure their impact and tweak programs as necessary.  With this effective and successful model of international development, BOMA is on a trajectory to expand rapidly in the coming months and years.  
The BOMA Project	139662		/users/profile/185783	zamberu	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/15/2012	I am a native of the BOMA project's areas of intervention and I'm fortunate in that on several ocassions, I have been able to personally interact with employees and beneficiaries of the BOMA Project in the course of implementing their activities. I must say that BOMA's business set-up model in upper-eastern Kenya is continuing to have a stong and lasting impact in the lives of the pastoralist and semi-pastoralist comminuties they target. There are many success stories where families' living standards have been improved as a result of the BOMA project's intervention thereby enabling them afford not only basic needs as food and clothing, but also medical and educational needs for their families. With increased financial resources available to the BOMA Project, I am confident that the lives of more and more pastoralist communities of upper-eastern Kenya will continue to be transformed.
The BOMA Project	138907	1	/users/profile/181716	hlthomas	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	The BOMA Project is a innovation leader in rural economic development internationally. By providing grants to women to start businesses in Northern Kenya through their Rural Entrepreneur Access Project (REAP), BOMA is helping to shake the ground of poverty.  BOMA provides the resources for women to start businesses, provides training, and feedback through their mentor relationships.  The success stories are incredible, and their impact earth shattering -- they're helping to alleviate poverty one woman, one family at a time.  More than 3,700 have graduated from or are participating in their two-year program!
The BOMA Project	136529		/users/profile/182456	Kipepeo	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I have been a volunteer with the BOMA Project since August. When I first learned about BOMA, I was really captivated by their grants based micro enterprise program (REAP ), a tool for fighting poverty in the drought prone region of Northern Kenyan. I am a Kenyan, but I have never been to the North. Everything I know of this region derives from the media - which almost always is something negative: drought, hunger, cattle raids... That someone was taking the chance to make a difference in a region that even my own government ignores was commendable if not inspiring.  Over the last two months I have spent numerous hours working with the data this organization diligently collects from all its beneficiaries. My favorite moment in the whole process was moving from working with baseline data to working with endline data. There is nothing more touching than seeing women who only several months back sent their children to bed hungry, women who could not afford to send their children to school and had not a single penny in savings, not only report that they can now feed their children and send them to school, but also that they now for the first time feel they have a purpose in life.  BOMA is a small organization but the magnitude of their impact definitely struck me. A deep passion for making a difference drives this organization and it is certainly infectious. I could not be prouder to be associated with this organization.
The BOMA Project	119511		/users/profile/162503	Jane Long	Board Member	5	07/30/2012	I have been a Board member for three years but supported BOMA even before that.  BOMA's work is direct, sustainable and measurable, and the results are life-changing.  The poorest of the poor are resourced and empowered with the tools to enable them to change their own lives, gaining dignity and respect in their communities and creating micro and fledgling economies.  Perhaps most impressive is the strong commitment of the organization to locally-led and transparent leadership, mentoring and programs.
The BOMA Project	119444		/users/profile/162409	Jim Young	Board Member	5	07/28/2012	The BOMA Fund is an organization which is committed to helping people who are in desperate conditions, to extract themselves from poverty, and do that in a sustainable way.  Their micro financing model has evolved and improved and the success rates are close to 100%.  Permanent solutions to poverty in neglected parts of the world merit our support!

As I spent time there, I began to learn that BOMA is really making a positive impact on womens lives in the most marginalized part of Kenya. As a young person trying to find my way in life, I am grateful to have volunteered at BOMA, and hope to achieve even a fraction of what BOMA has achieved and will achieve in the future.If you are interested in helping out development work, this is a great organization to give your support to!

It empowers people - particularly women - in one of the harshest environments on earth to become economically self sufficient. The program has had a measurable impact on so many aspects of human well being, from improved health and education, to better nutrition, to increased confidence and a stronger sense of community. There are very few programs that are truly innovative in the way Boma is. It surely deserves your support.

Poodle Rescue of Vermont Inc.	290077	1	/users/profile/380349	Writer	Client Served	5	05/16/2016	Finding a dog to join our family was a big decision for us.  Our dog of 16 years left a hole in our hearts that we thought would be hard to fill.  I knew from the moment that my communication with the Poodle Rescue of Vermont (PRofV) started that this was going to be a perfect experience for us.  PRofV performs a very thorough vetting process and for good reason.  Matching a poodle and a family is a two-way street - it's for life.  I was told to be patient in that dogs are available often with short notice.  Well, we did not have to wait long at all.  From the moment we met Milo we knew he was the one.  All of the volunteers we met and spoke with at PRofVT are top notch.  They love what they are doing - it comes across in everything they do.  PRofV ensures that all dogs are healthy, up to date on their vaccinations, and groomed before arriving in your home, and they also provide a very detailed profile of the dog which has been extremely helpful for us in getting to know our little guy.  An owner surrender is not an easy thing, but those at PRofV are sensitive and respectful throughout in finding the right fit for whatever the reason the dog needs a new home.  We love our precious Milo and each day we are grateful how we found each other.

The volunteers we worked with have become social media friends.  It's nice to be able to ask a question about one our fur babies when something comes up.  They take the time to check in to see if things are going smoothly after the adoption.  We have adopted on two separate occasions from the Poodle Recue of Vermont and couldn't be happier about the whole experience.

I needed to find a home for my toy poodle several months ago. It was an emotional choice to make after having this dog for 14 years. She was an older dog with glaucoma in one eye. My chances of finding a loving home for her were slight until I happened to find the Poodle Rescue Of Vermont website. After writing to them they immediately responded. They offered foster care and assistance with medical evaluation  and surgery concerning my dog's eye. The emotional support they provided during this period was also upstanding. I was never made to feel badly about giving my dog up for adoption. They sent me photos and videos of my dog after her eye surgery and I could see how much better she felt. Though I still feel very sad about giving up my dog I know she is in a better place now.  I continue to be amazed at how lucky I was to have found them.

It isn't enough to just give dogs that have had difficult life experiences to anyone who wants a dog. Not everyone is able to provide the type of home that a rescue dog needs and each dog has a different set of needs. Poodle Rescue of Vermont has excellent foster parents to assess a dog's needs and the adoption process is one of the most thorough.  I use to joke and say it was harder work to adopt a dog than my children!!!  (Not really)  The group is really good at what they do.  That makes all the difference.  A lot of homeless, abused, neglected dogs are getting the health care they need and a permanent home placement in a safe and nurturing family.  Everyone should care that much about the work they do.

After the death of our beloved poodle two years ago, we were feeling a great void in our home. Our daughter in particular really missed having a dog at home that she could take for walks and snuggle with in her bed. After getting recommendations from others, we applied for adoption through the PRV web site. They were very thorough in interviewing us, our personal references, our vet and our groomer. They recommended a dog that they felt would fit our family, which was different from the one we had picked based on pictures, etc, then they sent a visitor to inspect our home. Finally, they approved our application and had a wonderful poodle named "ACE" flown in to an airport near our home. We could not be happier, Ace is healthy, happy and a great companion. We were impressed with how thorough they were with the adoption process and with the follow-up.

The reference/vet/groomer verifications were done quickly and did not hold up the adoption process at all.  Gizmo was given excellent vet care including dental work before being placed with us.  Terri followed up regularly to make sure Gizmo was integrating well into our home.  As a result of our wonderful experience we decided to become monthly recurring donors to PRVT.

They found us Kicsi (Hungarian for Little One). And, oh, he has added so much to our lives because he is such a delightful dog and a perfect fit.  When searching for a dog on the internet I was impressed with the statements of purpose and the procedures outlined in the adoption papers.  The contract showed me how much the agency cared about the welfare of the dog and our welfare too. After signing up for an adoption, all the steps were taken, every person I contacted was enthusiastic but realistic.  There were follow-up calls to make sure all was going well.  At the end of the process I felt I had made friends I could count on should there be any difficulties.  We couldn't be more pleased.

They provide them with excellent veterinary care as needed, and arrange for loving foster care from wonderful volunteers who take them into their homes and nurture the dogs in preparation for adoption.  I am really in awe of the strong network of people (and dogs) that are the heart of Poodle Rescue of Vermont!  We first took home our little poodle-mix Salty (aka Chacho), about a year ago from PRVT.  It was a good experience to interact with Terri Gerard and the other volunteers.  It had been years since our old dog had passed, and I was a little concerned about wether I would find a dog that would fit so happily in our life.  Interacting with PRVT I felt confident that they were careful and had come to know Saltys personality and had seen to his veterinary needs. With their broad experience in placing poodles in forever homes, I sensed that I could trust in the match they were making for Salty.  Salty needs a bit of special attention due to allergies and he came with thorough paperwork from the vet.  Beyond that, Terri Gerard has always been there if I had any questions.  When we adopted Salty from Poodle Rescue of Vermont, we felt welcomed into a special family.  And last but not least there is Salty, who amazes us everyday with his charming demeanor and has become our trusty little companion.  I am so, so happy that he is ours to love.  Thank you PRVT!

My husband and I have personally had the privilege to share in the lives of two rescues;  Jet, a ten year old Bichon, who has since passed and Dolly, another Bichon, who is now a five years old.  PRVT was very thorough with their interview process to ensure that they had found a suitable home which would serve Jet and Dolly well and make them not only lucky dogs,  but happy dogs.  We now have begun volunteering to conduct home visits in our area, as well as the occasional delivery if the need should arrive.Animal rescue can be exhausting and emotional, but our faith in the human spirit is restored with each interaction we have with PRVT.  We love seeing adopters sharing pictures on the PRVT website (www.poodlerescuevt.org ) of once shy dogs whom are now thriving and confident and living happily in their new homes.  We would have a hard time imagining life without our adopted family.  We are better people for having become involved with PRVT and our hearts have been touched by some of the best people and dogs.  Our hats are off to Terri and her volunteer crew who make such a difference.   Happy adoptive parents, Tom and Joan Auger.
Poodle Rescue of Vermont Inc.	241132	2	/users/profile/327610	Cheryl136	Volunteer	5	04/14/2015	My roommate and I decided to look for a second poodle to add to our little family (we already had one poodle and three indoor-only cats, all of which are rescues) so we started searching and found Poodle Rescue of Vermont, Inc.  While reading through their website, we found out about their "Seniors for Seniors" program which adopts senior poodles to senior citizens at no charge based on their reference checks with your veterinarian, personal references, and your home visit. My roommate is a retired pet groomer and she decided to fill out an application for a senior poodle named "Annie." We were impressed with how quickly Terri returned our call to discuss our application and interest in Annie. Both my roommate and I have worked in the veterinary industry and volunteered with animal rescue organizations, we were extremely impressed with the thoroughness and concern Terri had for finding Annie a perfect home.  After a two hour conversation, Terri told us that she thought we'd be a perfect match for Annie and said she'd be in touch when another volunteer finished checking our references. Three days later, we had a phone call telling us that they wanted to set-up a home visit for the up-coming Saturday (it was Tuesday) and that based on how this went, Annie would be ours. Saturday came, and Annie began her journey from Vermont to Southern Maine, riding first with her foster mom to meet up with another couple an hour and a half from our home where she transferred cars and rode the remainder of the trip with a second couple. Annie arrived here on January 10, 2015, and we fell in love with her instantly! The home visit went extremely well and Annie was able to stay with us. It  has been three months since Annie joined our family and we still periodically hear from Terri checking in to see how Annie is doing. We are thrilled with Annie and how well she has adapted to living with our family. We have also been very impressed with the thoroughness and concern the rescuers from Poodle Rescue of Vermont, Inc. have displayed throughout the adoption process and follow-up contacts with us.  We highly recommend adopting from Poodle Rescue of Vermont, Inc., they are a wonderful organization! Annie's momsBiddeford, Maine

I am partial to the "geriatric dogs" after losing one who was 15 years old about a year prior to adopting Max.  Anyway, the whole process of the adoption was quick, simple, very caring by all involved - the application process, an almost immediate call back to me, the involvement with Max's foster parent (who is wonderful), and everyone else.  I've had Max now in our household for six months, and can't imagine life without him.  He has fit in unbelievably with myself and my husband and our other poodle, Henry.

I am a financial donor, and new volunteer. I have followed the website and Facebook page which I discovered as I searched for my first rescue pup a couple of years ago. ** Here's the crux of the matter: It is clear from all communications at all levels that the rescued pups are central - the goal being a best-match foster and/or permanent home for each one. The complete transparency at all times over medical issues and behavior attributes of the dogs-in-need engenders earned trust among all members of the team. ** When I have room, I will foster or rescue another dog.

I had never gone the rescue route before so I didn't know what to expect. All the people I spoke with and dealt with at this organization were the nicest, most knowledgeable, people I ever dealt with. I have owned dogs most all my life and dealt with breeders from different parts of the country, but Poodle Recue of Vermont listened to what I was looking for and delivered to me the best dog I've ever owned in my life. Brady is a rescue Bichon from Virginia and he is the sweetest, most  intelligent and loving dog I could ever hope to have adopted. I've heard stories about how these dogs know they are getting a second chance and that they are grateful but I doubted that until Brady arrived and then I knew it was true. The people I dealt with were so professional and so dedicated to placing the dog in the right home that it made me feel very comfortable with the entire process. They asked the right questions, they asked for the right references and they never made me feel that I was under a microscope as other rescue agencies had, almost to the point of making you feel you were not good enough to provide a home to these dogs. My wife and I are so grateful for this most positive experience and are so happy with our Brady that he will have a forever loving home and be given all that we possibly can to make him a happy, healthy dog for the rest of his life.  Thanks Again to the Poodle Rescue of Vermont Arnold and Anita Sacco

He was 8 years old when I decided I needed to get a friend for him to learn how to be a fabulous dog too. I was not in a hurry and I knew I would pick out the right dog if it came along.  When I first saw Bamboo at Poodle Rescue of Vermont via Petfinder, his picture looked like a miniature Sterling. I was instantly on a mission to get this cutie pie into my life. I love poodles and poodle mixes. They are so smart and sweet. I had no reservations even though Bamboo should not go to a home with children. My grandson lives far away and I live alone with my two dogs in the town where I work. I contacted PRVT and went through all the steps to adopt Bamboo. The adoption fee was $500. At first I thought that was a little steep, howeverthey flew Bamboo up from Massachusetts to Vermont, put me and my sister (and my big dog) up in a hotel room for the night and also had me meet their trainer. They gave me an hour of training, training equipment and a pet carrier to bring my new baby home. I think I got the better deal! I only had to drive from Central NY to Vermont and back. Bamboo was a handful with his own set of problems, but I felt I was given the tools I needed to ease him into my little family. He is thriving now and a great little guy. Bamboo (Boo Boo) still has a few issues, but we are working on them constantly. Its been less than a year and I think he has made great strides. He loves his big brother and follows him around trying to do everything Sterling is doing.
Poodle Rescue of Vermont Inc.	240981		/users/profile/327397	destes151	Volunteer	5	04/11/2015	I first learned of Poodle Rescue of Vermont when I was looking to adopt a standard poodle when mine passed away. At the time PRVT was not seeing many standards come into rescue. So as I waited I said I would help in ways that I could. First it was picking up dogs and providing transportation to their foster homes. Time went by and still no standard. The president o PRVT, Terri contacted me and suggested that I get approved for fostering in the event a dog came in. I filled out the application, had my home site visit which included3d a thorough inspection of my house and yard to ensure a dog would have a safe environment. I passed and I waited. Then the call came from Terri that a poddle had just come into a shelter in the south and need to me moved asap north. He was not the size I was expecting but I told Terri we would hold him until they could find a suitable long term foster. I picked little Bernie The Brown from a very small airport in rural vermont on one of the coldest days of 2014. He was tiny (compared to my golden doodle) that I had at home. Well, Bernie moved in, Bailey (the doodle), fell in love and so did the rest of my family! We decided that Bernie should just live with us. He may not be the standard we were looking for but this little guy has the heart and spirit of a much larger poodle.All along the way when we were "just fostering", I received frequent phone calls from the PRVT foster coordinator who was always there will answers to any questions I might have. I always felt through this whole process that they have ony the very best interest for each and every dog that comes through their rescue. It is always really about finding the proper, perfect, and forever home for these animals that have had misfortune thrown at them. I continue to volunteer with PRVT, helping to move dogs, and doing some sewing for the new rescues needs. It is very rewarding and I am proud to help in my small way to see and know the very big difference this organization is making in the animals lives and the famlies they are creating.Bernie The Brown, recused me on February 14th, 2014 (3 years to the day that my standard poodle Rory crossed the rainbow)

The entire group of volunteers are supportive of one another. I also am a " foster failure " twice because I adopted two of my fosters. The dogs come completely vetted, micro-chipped, groomed , have harnesses and leashes. These dogs live in a home with a variety of other pets and people. It doesn't get any better than that! I hope I can continue to foster for many more years to come.

She is such an incredible advocate for the animals!  The transition to doggie parenthood was smooth thanks to the entire PRVT Team.
Poodle Rescue of Vermont Inc.	240921	1	/users/profile/327301	tiger0715	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/10/2015	Poodle Rescue of Vermont is a great rescue! They rescued a senior poodle from the rescue I work at in Philadelphia. The poodle named Brian required extensive medical care and Poodle Rescue of Vermont quickly jumped into action by not only providing thousands of dollars for medical care but they also providing transport up to Vermont in bad weather over the winter. They are truly a wonderful rescue and do great things for animals in need. Anthony
Poodle Rescue of Vermont Inc.	240920	1	/users/profile/327299	CDL10	Volunteer	5	04/10/2015	I have been involved in rescue for several years, but this is the first breed specific rescue I've worked with. I've always wanted to foster, and having two poodle mixes myself I was drawn to PRVT. I have been so impressed by this organization, the work they do and the care with which they do it. In my experience, PRVT does not turn away any poodles, and often takes in seniors and dogs with medical conditions that other rescues may shy away from. They do whatever it takes to get these dogs healthy and provide both  the poodles and foster parents with whatever they need (supplies, training, medical care, advice etc) to make them as happy and healthy as possible while they wait for their forever homes. When an application does come in, a very thorough screening process helps ensure that it is a wonderful match for both the poodle and the new family. I am honored to work with such caring and devoted people, and to play a small role in creating happy families.
Poodle Rescue of Vermont Inc.	240846	1	/users/profile/327190	Lattetnt	Client Served	5	04/08/2015	     I adopted Tia and Taz, two senior Toy Poodles, from Poodle Rescue of Vermont last year, and this experience led me to have the greatest admiration for the staff of volunteers and for Terri Gerard, President and founder of PRVT.  She sets the tone with her kind manner, her sensitivity to others, her utter dedication to the work, and her deep compassion for the dogs that come to her in need. She works tirelessly to find Poodlesand Poodle mixesin need and reaches beyond Vermont to rescue dogs.  Often Poodles arrive by plane, thanks to Pilots N Paws, and are flown to PRVT by volunteer pilots across the country.  They also arrive from small town shelters in other states and from New York Animal Care and Control (NYCACC) since PRVT became a New Hope Partner with the New York City shelters. Terri also leaves no stone unturned to save the lives of these dogs and to place them in new loving homes where they will continue to receive the care and love they deserve.      This experience led me to offer my time to help PRVT get the word out about the good work they do.  I am now the volunteer editor of The Poodle Press, Poodle Rescue for Vermonts quarterly newsletter.  As editor, I am usually first to learn about all the complementary remarks made in honor of this organization.  I am also in a position now to know how this organization operates behind the scenes, and simply stated, I could not be more impressed!       What I find to be most unique about PRVT is the way both adopters and those who must surrender a dog are encouraged to join and remain part of the PRVT family.  You can see this sense of loyalty to PRVT when you visit their Facebook page and read the many posts and heartwarming stories about how these once homeless and suffering animals are now adored by their new families.       The PRVT adoption process is carried out with respect and consideration for all concerned in the most professional manner.  An applicants references are carefully checked and home visits are included to ensure that both the dog and a new owner will be happy together. PRVT also encourages senior citizens who wish for the companionship of a dog to apply to their Senior-to-Senior Program.  Both Tia and Taz came to me through this program.  No fee was charged, and they arrived after being professionally groomed with enough food for many months, clothing, and medications needed.  They also had fully recovered from surgery and medical treatments paid for by PRVT and came with all their medical records and a letter from the attending veterinarian stating that they were up to date with all required immunizations.  This organization recently decided to waive adoption fees to include eligible individuals of any age who wished to adopt a senior dog.  Most assuring for me, was PRVT's request that the dogs be returned to their rescue organization  if I were no longer able to care for them for any reason.  In my view, PRVT is truly a 5-star non-profit organization.
Poodle Rescue of Vermont Inc.	240786	2	/users/profile/327094	JBlueVT	Volunteer	5	04/07/2015	I was compelled to begin volunteering for Poodle Rescue of Vermont after we adopted our dog from them just over a year ago.  I was impressed by the fact that the people involved with the organization value what's best for the dogs they rescue above all else.  One of the first things I did as a volunteer was foster a senior dog who was quite sick.  He had been on death row at a shelter in NYC, and PRVT rescued him.  Many rescue groups would have overlooked a dog like him.  He was not young, cute or happy.  He was old, sick and sad.  But because of the efforts made by PRVT on his behalf, he's living a happy, healthy life.  PRVT understands that every dog deserves a chance at life.  That's why I volunteer for them.

Catamount Film & Arts Co	261381		/users/profile/349982	Writer	Board Member	5	10/03/2015	Catamount Arts is a terrific non-profit in St. Johnsbury, Vermont.  The breadth of its programming is amazing with two attractive theaters for film, a Cabaret for live performances, a lovely art gallery, classrooms, and a separate building for arts education.  With a small paid staff and an enthusiastic group of board members and volunteers, so much is accomplished.  We host the Met HD Live as well as HD theater and ballet performances.  Monthly live bluegrass jams and folk music evenings are offered free of charge in our Cabaret.  Collaboration with other non-profits in our town allow for a rich experience.  For example this week an art opening was held in our gallery with the artist speaking about her paintings which have a theme related to old growth New England forests and ecology.  That same evening, Elizabeth Kolbert, correspondent for The New Yorker Magazine and author How fortunate we are to live in this beautiful area with these marvelous opportunities.

As a resident of the area who lived for a time in NYC before returning, I'm thrilled to have this as a resource so close to where I live.

World class artists. Inspiring arts. Manages to stay solvent and even thrives. Partners and collaborates readily with others. A model for how an arts organization - even a general non profit - should be.

The Arts build confidence in our kids, whether they have physical, emotional or learning challenges or not, that allows them to blossom and excel in school and at home. These days when schools are considering taking art education out of the curriculum, it is so important to have a place where they can go and experience creativity and innovation.Thank you Catamount and keep up the good work! 
Catamount Film & Arts Co	218260	1	/users/profile/281813	barbarahatch	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2014	In the ten years I have resided in St. Johnsbury, I have witnessed Catamount Arts evolve more fully into the role of "community" arts center. It has become a sanctuary for our children, our neighbors, ourselves. The classes teach and expose young and old to new experiences, skills, and passions from tango dancing to watercolor painting to claymation camp. The staff and Board at Catamount Arts are open-minded and receptive to the desires of the community they serve. My three children have all attended classes, camps, movies, gallery openings, and live performances through Catamount Arts.  The gallery exhibits and the programming excite and inspire them. I was fortunate to serve as the 27th and 28th benefit auction coordinator. It was a wonderful experience and I enjoyed introducing more people to Catamount Arts.

Catamount has gone far beyond that consistently.  They have a tremendous variety of amazing classes that they offer to everyone in the area.  They pull in local community members, teachers, students, artists, and more to nationally acclaimed professionals, all of whom provide a fun educational atmosphere with a very reasonable price.  Additionally, the music and movies that are booked at the Catamount never cease to impress us!!! 
Catamount Film & Arts Co	217827	1	/users/profile/281368	jennifer.mackenzie	General Member of the Public	5	09/26/2014	My husband and I, and now our children, enjoy the great benefits of Catamount Arts--   I am continually astounded by the diversity of arts opportunities that it brings to St. Johnsbury, which at 8,000 people is one of the largest communities in our part of the state.  We love going to see the arts films, the HD Opera series, and live music.  My children look forward to the Saturday morning arts programs.  As classically trained singers, we are very excited the center is now offering a singing ensemble program for children--  something we both enjoyed while growing up while living in far bigger communities, and a program which we know our children will love and will help lead them towards other musical opportunities in the future.

I'd heard about it from him and camp but never been to (camp brought him).  When late in the summer I brought him myself to the Claymation camp, I was happily surprised to realize what a fabulous arts home he'd developed at Catamount.  The staff all knew him by name and warmly welcomed him.  He showed me masks and robots he and his friends had made.  He knew his way around and felt completely safe to express himself, try new things, and make art!  The Claymation camp was totally awesome both in terms of learning and creativity and in the cool movies they made!!!!  Thank you Catamount!!!

I had great access to outstanding culture in NYC; I and my family have great access to outstanding culture in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom.  That is largely the result of Catamount Arts innovative work in this incredibly beautiful region of the world.  Not only do we have young people nurturing their artistic instincts and skills through Catamount Arts, but we have direct contact with world-class, world-wide performers of all sorts.  I have never seen anything like this organization anywhere, and I have been most everywhere in my life.
Catamount Film & Arts Co	216907		/users/profile/280433	skbid	Board Member	5	09/24/2014	Catamount Arts blends creative energy and hard work bringing the Arts to the community, especially exceptional independent films, Arts education for children, and a system of ticketing for most Arts organizations in Northeastern Vermont and New Hampshire.  Catamount places important issues at the forefront with its Courageous Conversation series that focuses on knotty community (and wider) problems for all of us to address in a calm comfortable atmosphere. it is a place that houses the best Gallery for Visual Arts in Northeastern Vermont with monthly exhibits, two theaters that offer Live Opera from the Met, special children's movies, vintage films on the big screen and the National Theater broadcasts from London. i came on to the Catamount Arts Board of Directors in the late 90s and i've never looked back. As an art teacher and artist, my excitement about Catamount seems to be growing exponentially.
Catamount Film & Arts Co	216842		/users/profile/280363	KingdomVegetarians	Client Served	5	09/24/2014	My wife and I started a non-profit vegetarian group in 2009. We offer a social and educational meeting each month, including a potluck dinner. We started meeting in our home but the size of the group quickly outgrew our ability to host it. Catamount Arts graciously allows us to use their meeting space, asking for only a free-will donation. If not for this arrangement, we would need to charge dues or a fee for each dinner, which would not be affordable for many of our attendees. As a result of Catamount Arts' mission-related generosity we have been able to improve the health of the people that attend, as well as enabling the environmental benefits that accrue from a plant based diet.   Thank you Catamount Arts!
Catamount Film & Arts Co	213802		/users/profile/277003	AMain	Volunteer	5	09/06/2014	Catamount Arts is a great nonprofit organization, truly bringing the Northeast Kingdom communities together.  They invite you to join them in attending events, volunteering, and spreading awareness about local businesses and events.  I personally had a great experience with them interning over the course of one year. I learned so much about what it means to be involved in the community. Between educating young children about the arts, to playing film reels, this organization knows how to make a great first impression. If you're looking to get involved or attend some awesome events, I suggest making a visit to Catamount Arts!
Catamount Film & Arts Co	163893		/users/profile/217692	lhtorres	General Member of the Public	5	07/30/2013	The Catamount Art Center is a gem in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. Its focus on independent film, arts education, and service as a regional box office is already adding energy and momentum to a growing arts renaissance in the region. Catamount has also played an important role in bringing the annual Green Mountain Film Festival to the area, giving a boost to our mudseason doldrums and exposing hundreds to the delights of international independent cinema. Thank you Catamount!
Catamount Film & Arts Co	163029		/users/profile/216415	arachnibane	Volunteer	5	07/18/2013	There is little fine art in this area; Catamount Arts helps fill that great need.   I've been using Catamount Arts as a resource for films (screenings and CDs) for many years.   I've bought things at their annual auction.  I have been to social and political forums at their hall.    I have participated in functions for various sectors of the population in the arts.   I enjoy the month-long gallery exhibits.   I've used their public computer and sat on the couch and read Opera News and Rolling Stone.I am always welcomed  by friends who sincerely appreciate any bit of work I can offer.Catamount Arts has a role in bringing a wide variety of art forms to the Northeast Kingdom.There is a fine little art house in this area.
Catamount Film & Arts Co	162999		/users/profile/216370	AliceSK	Board Member	5	07/18/2013	Being a board member of Catamount Arts is both a daunting and a rewarding experience. It is daunting because we are active and work hard - "hands on" each month. But we choose to do so because the goals of the Catamount Arts Organization are so meaningful. And that makes the effort rewarding. Catamount Arts strives to provide to a 60 to 100 mile radius area of a generally poor and rural region meaningful, affordable cultural and artistic experiences and presentations of all kinds for all ages including classes, gallery shows, concerts, movies, musical events and more.
Catamount Film & Arts Co	162988		/users/profile/216355	Mary184	Volunteer	5	07/18/2013	I was so excited to discover Catamount Arts when I moved to St. Johnsbury in 2005.  Immediately prior to my move to the Northeast Kingdom, I lived in Boston, where I took advantage of the various museums and frequented the Coolidge Corner Theater, a movie theater showing films similar to those of Catamount.  I was very hesitant to be moving to what many see as a remote and isolated corner of the state, but was excited to find out that in fact, there is a vibrant and thriving arts and culture community here.   I have enjoyed volunteering with Catamount, and attending many movies, performances and events.  The arts and culture provided by Catamount and other local organizations are a big piece of the puzzle that makes living in Northern Vermont so wonderful.
Catamount Film & Arts Co	162976		/users/profile/216343	Corsini	Board Member	5	07/18/2013	 Part of our mission at Catamount Arts is to reach out, to collaborate with organizations in our community, to be inclusive.  It is incredible how Catamount has been collaborating with and promoting other arts organizations: The Green Mountain Film Festival, Kingdom County Productions, Haskel Opera House in Derby, Northeast Kingdom Classical Series, Peacham Acoustic Music Festival, and Circus Smirkus---just to name a few.      Recently, we hired an Arts Coordinator and are expanding our mission of inclusiveness.  We are bringing children into Catamount with art classes this summer, looking ahead to expanding these offerings of art classes for children and adults into the fall, winter, and spring months.  We are coordinating these programs for children with the Saint Johnsbury Athenaeum and the Fairbanks Museum.  It is exciting. Children are being exposed to varied art classes with many different teachers.  At the same time, the children are becoming familiar and comfortable in the Catamount surroundings.  Hopefully, their involvement will help to encourage their families to come and get involved, too.  Catamount is an amazing resource.  It is reaching out and people are coming and discovering what a wonderful place we have right in our back yard!     Just this week (July 16th) I was coming out of one of the theaters after seeing a movie and a man and his wife were walking into the hall for the next showing, popcorn in hand.  He looked around and said,"This is our first time here.  This is beautiful."         Donna Marshall
Catamount Film & Arts Co	152474		/users/profile/203464	emmyhausman	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	The range and number of arts events sponsored by Catamount Arts is simply daunting. So much to see and do, and so little time is my constant refrain. But what I do attend is beyond belief for a large geographical area having low-population density.  Everyone has always acknowledged the physical beauty of the Northeast Kingdom with its mountains and lakes, its farms, and its small New England villages. So, too, the fantastic recreational possibilities the landscape offers. But few would imagine the vitality of the arts that brings such cultural richness to the area.  From dance, theater, music, opera, arts classes, films, exhibits, discussions of contemporary issues  truly something exciting and mind-expanding for everyone.

Pure Water for The World, Inc.	223761	1	/users/profile/287510	glenners1	Volunteer	5	10/17/2014	In 2011, I really never heard of Pure Water for the World until it was introduced to our Rotary Club of Wesley Chapel.  After hearing of the projects they were doing in both Haiti and Honduras, it was an easy decision that our club needed to create a partnership with Pure Water and get involved.  In 2012, our first group of 5 Rotarians known as the "Honduras Five" went on its first mission to Honduras to help install the water filters as well as latrines.  During the 2012/2013 year, I became President of our club and after seeing what the previous group went through and hearing about all of the great things that Pure Water was doing over there, a second group needed to go.  In 2013, myself along with I believe 9 others went to Honduras.   It was a very rewarding experience seeing not only what Pure Water for the World was doing on a corporate level, but also what the local personnel in that country were doing as well!!   The weekly visits that they were doing with needy families in very remote areas of the country is a challenge in itself, but yet they all maintained a very positive attitude and remained focused on the mission!  Great job to all of you at Pure Water for The World!!! Greg Lenners

I have worked with many non-profits before and PWW by far one of the best.  In all of my travels with them I have felt very safe and WELL taken care of.Their mission and goal is simple and they focus on SUSTAINABILITY.....which is huge.  Also they are putting nationals to work.Thousands of families now have clean water and understand that hygiene is very important.
Pure Water for The World, Inc.	218800		/users/profile/282391	Kathie4	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	There are so many people in so many towns and villages in Honduras and Haiti who are now waiting for PWW to be able to install water filters for them that every bit of support is virtually lifesaving. It's a privilege to work on an installation team and meet these families in their homes if you have the opportunity, but everyone can take the opportunity to support this PWW effort with dollars. Even from your armchair!
Pure Water for The World, Inc.	213914	1	/users/profile/277123	Nathalie P.	Volunteer	5	09/07/2014	Pure Water for the World is the real thing. They are quite literally changing lives of children and families in Haiti and Honduras. I got to be a part of this (and so can you!). PWW offers working trips to their locations; something I can't speak highly enough about! I travelled with PWW down to Haiti last year and got to participate in installing water filters in homes in Bouda Chita as well as going all over Haiti to talk with families who are working with PWW and hear their stories. The family members of these homes were so excited, so proud, so honored to be a part of this program. They beam when they talk about PWW. Prior to PWW, generation after generation of family members have never had clean water in their homes. They have suffered, and witnessed families in their communities suffer, from intestinal distress. All because they lacked access to uncontaminated water...a glass of clean water, something we take for granted many times every day. On my trip, I got to talk with families who received water systems just months before and they told me how it has literally changed their lives. The pride in their voices, their faces, their eyes, spoke volumes of how much gratitude they have for what PWW has given to them. PWW isn't just placing water systems into homes and wishing the families well as they head off. They are giving them extensive training on hygiene and they are continuing to support them to be sure they are using their systems correctly, supporting them along the way. PWW is changing lives. Get involved with Pure Water for the World!

He said, "well, the children have stopped dying".   Your support of the amazing work that Pure Water does saves children's  lives. What could be more meaningful? 
Pure Water for The World, Inc.	212614		/users/profile/275668	Katie103	Volunteer	5	08/28/2014	I first became involved with Pure Water for the World in 2010 when my husband was invited to go on a trip to visit the site in Haiti. He came back and we knew that our dream of living and volunteering in a foreign country was going to be made possible through Pure Water. We have had the pleasure of being volunteers for 5 months in the small rural town of Trojes, in southern Honduras. From an inside perspective I can articulate the passion Pure Water has for helping people. It is not only shown through the hard work of those who are raising funds and publicizing, but also through the Hondurans who work for Pure Water. These men and women have pride and loyalty that is rare and astounding. Their jobs are by no means easy. Many days they drive by truck or motorcycle on rough dirt roads for hours each way. Their days are long and sometimes grueling, but they know their job is important to make a difference in their country and a difference in the lives of their neighbors, friends, and family. By going out in the communities, I have seen the sheer appreciation of the locals; they offer whatever they have - eggs, mangoes, coffee - as gifts to the Pure Water employees just to show their gratitude. The people of the communities know that with the filters and latrines provided by Pure Water, their families are becoming healthier; ensuring their children can continue their education and slowly break the cycle of poverty. Pure Water is doing great work and making a difference in a country that is usually forgotten by others.
Pure Water for The World, Inc.	212604	1	/users/profile/275657	mfreed2	Volunteer	5	08/28/2014	I am a volunteer for Pure Water for the World in Trojes, Honduras.  My experience since beginning in April 2014 has been extremely positive.  Pure Water is an organization dedicated to helping families break the cycle of poverty by providing sustainable water and sanitation solutions.  This is something that I have seen everyday going into the field.  The communities served are extremely thankful for the work we have done and their lives have been visibly improved.  It is easy to see the difference between the communities we have already served and the new ones we go into.  These communities are some of the poorest in Honduras  in one of the poorest countries in the world.  Pure Water really is giving the poorest of the poor a chance for a better future for themselves and their children.  
Pure Water for The World, Inc.	212412	1	/users/profile/230052	Degaje	Client Served	5	08/27/2014	About 7 years ago, I was first exposed to Pure Water for the World (aka "PW"), while in Haiti.  I was impressed about their organization, and "tucked away" the info. received for future reference.  In late 2011, I was given the opportunity to develop a service project for my local Rotary club.  However, we needed a "host" club (in Haiti), and was having difficulty in linking up with one that was responsive.  The director at the Port-au-Prince office located a cooperating Rotary club, and literally drove to visit with this club on several occasions.  Because of this, we could proceed with a rather extensive project, encompassing 76 schools, 324 water filters, encompassing ~20,000 beneficiaries (primarily children).  If it weren't for PW being so passionate, professional, and the willingness to figuratively and literally go the extra mile, this project would not have happened.  They must know that their efforts have kept many school children in school and, no doubt, have SAVED LIVES  in the process!  I now consider the people of PW my personal friends, and sincerely hope that we can collaborate on a similar project again in the not-too-distant future.  PW is truly a wonderful organization that and, in my experience, embodies the Rotary "Service about Self" mindset.  They have and will continue to make a difference in the lives of many people when and wherever they are! Thank you, Pure Water for the World, for what you do, and who you are!!!

Pure Water for The World, Inc.	212340		/users/profile/275338	BuckeyeBill	Donor	5	08/26/2014	As a member of a supportive Church and Rotary Club, I have been a donor, volunteer and supporter of efforts to address health, hygiene and clean water issues in Haiti through Pure Water for the World. PWW has a strong local presence (largely Haitian staffed), a methodical approach to planning, implementation and followup which is uniquely exceptional.  Their efforts have demonstrated sustainable results in schools and communities throughout Haiti. Their efforts are accelerating as their solutions become more widespread and credible. The organization has strong leadership on Staff and it's Board. People should be extremely confident in supporting this organization to address the serous issues facing Haiti.

Having volunteered with Pure Water both in the US and in Honduras, I've been impressed by the staff's dedication to providing sustainable solutions to some of the most vulnerable populations in Honduras. Pure Water works with rather that for communities and trains local staff and volunteers to work directly with communities. My work as an intern with Pure Water was one of the most valuable learning experiences of my college career.

I have never met a more focused and passionate group of people both in the US and in Honduras.

Pure Water for The World, Inc.	143865		/users/profile/190351	nhenderson	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	Pure Water for the World is a fantastic non-profit that is making a huge difference in the lives of people around the world. This organization provides sand filters and latrines to families and villages to help support clean drinking water. I have been teaching fourth grade in Upstate New York for the past seven years. Each year, my students have participated in a local fundraiser called The Water Walk, which raises money for Pure Water for the World. This has provided an amazing experience for my students to learn the value of giving to those who are less fortunate. They absolutely LOVE this event and even come back the following years to participate! This past summer, I was fortunate enough to take a week long trip to Honduras to volunteer with Pure Water and get a closer look at what this organization does with the money that we have donated. It was definitely an eye-opening experience for me. The videos and pictures that are online just dont do justice the hard work and incredible difference that this organization makes! Their efforts are saving the lives of many children and adults. To learn more about what Pure Water does, visit purewaterfortheworld.org.

Pure Water for The World, Inc.	143760		/users/profile/190237	Pati Smith	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I have traveled to Haiti with Pure Water twice now.  Their devotion to providing clean water to a populace that suffers daily losses from contaminated water is extraordinary.  There are so many needs in Haiti but it all begins with access to clean water.  They are concentrating on the children and their schools by providing water filters.  Unlike many other NGOs, they continue to stay in touch with the schools, clinics, etc to ensure their goals are being met.  I have worked in Pure Waters' factory, handed out filters to the schools, and toured orphanages and villages that have been identifed as recipients of the filters in the near future.  Pure Water's approach is very methodical, professional and caring in a world of need and chaos.  They are my heroes!
Pure Water for The World, Inc.	143743		/users/profile/190217	JanSe	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I have volunteered for Pure Water for the World for several months. Since I was based in Trojes, Honduras for all the time I served the NGO, I could witness first-hand how important is the PWW contribution to the local families.  Imagine extremely little communities, usually made of 20 to 30 houses each, a church and a school all spread around a rough mountainous land. Imagine unpaved roads connecting such communities that are useless for the majority of the year due to torrential rain and non-existing maintenance. Imagine the closest pueblo being 1 to 3 hours away and the closest city (and paved road) being a whole travelling day away. Imagine houses that lack of running water, gas and latrines. Imagine the family wealth based only upon coffee harvest, which happens once a year and whose profits have to sustain a family (usually 6+ persons) for the remaining 11 months.  Imagine children and elders alike that get continuously sick due to the poor hygienic conditions and the lack of clean water. Imagine a population neglected by its own people, by its own government. Now imagine an NGO that serves these forgotten communities. Imagine a team of 6 workers going every day in the field, enduring long and risky trips to such places. Imagine motorbikes running on the edge of dangerous mountain ridges and 4x4 jeeps fighting against mud and unthinkable gradients. Imagine Biosand filters and latrines carried and installed both in houses and schools, under such circumstances.  Now think of a NGO that puts sustainability first, trying to have a long lasting impact on the territory by training respected members of each community on how to maintain the filters, educating children and elders on the importance of hygiene in each and every aspect, from personal matters to the household, to the environment. Imagine the same organization following up with a treatment program to rid community members of existing internal parasites. Imagine the same NGO running checks and always monitoring its results, constantly trying to improve and learn from its mistakes. Imagine an NGO that not only serves the forgotten with the most important source of life in the world against all odds and difficulties, but also makes them feel acknowledged and loved. Imagine Pure Water for the World.

Board Member	5	11/28/2012	i am a water conditioning professional and a Rotarian.  7 years ago i visited project sites in Honduras vetting Pure Water for a Rotary project and experienced life changing programs.  Pure Water was providing sustainable safe drinking water solutions for impoverished families, village by village.  with technology made with indigenous materials, requiring no on-going expense and education that created a change in understanding, peoples lives were transformed.  "the water is the medicine", "my children no longer get sick" were constant refrains heard from the beneficiaries.  i was heart hooked.  as much as it changed their lives, it also changed mine.  i was invited to join the board and have never looked back.  the work we do changes and saves lives and gives me self actualization.

Pure Water for The World, Inc.	143206		/users/profile/189639	rmoles	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	I have been associated with Pure Water since 2003, having served on their Board of Directors for several of those years.  I chose Pure Water because they are an independent organization whose sole purpose is to save lives and improve the health for children and their families in countries where the need for help is critical.  I have traveled to Honduras many times and have led five group trips there to witness and support Pure Water's efforts, so I can attest to the effectiveness of their work.  They do not impose anything on the people of Honduras, but rather equip Hondurans to help themselves.  It is the most impressive, impactful and unselfish philanthropic work I have witnessed in a developing country.  They could not be more deserving of recognition for their efforts.

That trip changed my whole outlook on volunteering. Since then I have returned to Honduras three times and have been to Haiti three times - all for Pure Water for the World. Pure Water's installation of filters and latrines and emphasis on hygiene education is just what these countries need to pull themselves out of poverty. Clean water allows their children to go to school healthy and well - a first step to avoid the scourge of poverty and disease.

It is dedicated in investing itself long-term into Haiti.  Their goal is to educate families and children and offer them clean water.  Their education program is comprehensive and efficient.  They are trully making a difference in Haiti.  They have been working with USAID/MSH  for over 4 years and they have introduced their programs in clinics and households now.  They have very little overhead and are very transparent with their use of funds.  Great place to work at if you really care.

VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE (national office)	169289		/users/profile/224367	Carolyn53	Board Member	5	09/12/2013	The Heart of Virginia began it's journey towards opening a free medical clinic back in 2009.  Our area  is one of the poorest and least served in all of Virginia. I found Volunteers in Medicine doing a Google search,  how to start a free clinic.  I called and the folks at VIM have done a fantastic job  helping us accomplish this mission.   We were given step by step instruction and all the resources needed at no cost to us.  Our clinic never would have been  without VIM.  We are the only VIM clinic is VA. HOVFC opened and began seeing patients in 2012.  It was a long and sometimes not too easy process but with VIM's expertise, it all became possible.
VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE (national office)	166475		/users/profile/221149	Thermophile	Client Served	5	08/29/2013	In 2008, we were exploring the possibilities of expanding a local free clinic, Christian Nursing Service, to better serve our community. We had no physician, a poor facility, and no apparent opportunities. We visited the Volunteers in Medicine Clinic of Bartholomew County and were impressed. We saw a path to developing a clinic for the uninsured in Montgomery County. We contacted Volunteers in Medicine and in 2010, Marjorie Hamrell became our advisor. She visited that fall and talked to the community about Volunteers in Medicine. Later, a group from the Columbus VIM clinic also came and talked to our local physicians and nurses about VIM and about their clinic. At the time, I was President of our Board, a real neophyte in healthcare. Marjorie became my guide and through weekly phone calls and several hundred email messages, she helped us formulate policies and plans for the future.In 2011, we received a $900,000 3:1 challenge grant from North Central Health Service (NCHS) in Lafayette, In. We raised the additional 300,000 from the community in less than 6 months and started construction of our new clinic in the fall of 2012. On Monday, August 26, we saw our first patients in the Dr. Mary Ludwig Free Clinic. Through our association with VIM, we also received a grant from American Academy of Family Physicians to purchase medical examination tables.In 2012, I stepped down as President of the Board and became the first Executive Director of Montgomery County Free Clinic, Inc. So I am writing this as the Executive Director, but, I continue to be the primary contact with Marjorie. VIM provided us a viable model for a free clinic that focused on the patient; provided the necessary organizational support to focus our work; and linked us with other VIM clinics whio provided help.

VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE (national office)	161945		/users/profile/214824	Scott Hauge	Board Member	5	07/02/2013	In 1998, I was watching the television show, Hardball with Chris Matthews and saw an interview with John Kasich. Kasich was talking about his book, Courage is Contagious. The book was about ordinary people doing extraordinary things in their community. One of these people was Dr. Jack McConnell, who created Volunteers in Medicine and formed a fabulous free clinic in Hilton Head. I was so impressed that I called Dr. McConnell and scheduled a trip to Hilton Head to see firsthand what he was doing.  I fell in love with this program. I saw with my own eyes people helping others who had no health insurance or funding streams to provide for their medical care. I was surprised that all services were free and these friends and neighbors were being treated with dignity and respect. I have subsequently joined the board of Volunteers in Medicine and serve as its Vice Chair. On November 2010, I used the Volunteers in Medicine model to open Clinic by the Bay in San Francisco. I currently serve on the board as Vice President.  I am actively involved in numerous boards and commissions, but there is none I am more proud of than Volunteers in Medicine and Clinic by the Bay.  Their credo below says it all. May we have eyes to see those who are rendered invisible and excluded; Open arms and hearts to reach out and include them; Healing hands to touch their lives with love; And in the process heal ourselves. Respectfully, Scott Hauge

Volunteers in Medicine was a great help to us when we were in the planning stages of our clinic and they continue to be a valuable resource that we count on daily.  I cant say enough about this organization, they were there for us every step of the way and when we hit road blocks they helped us see a way around.  Anyone looking to open a free clinic needs to talk with these folks and learn from their experience and take advantage of the resources they have put together to help clinics operate.

VIM was just the model we were looking for.  We affliated with VIM and they have been a valuable resource.  VIM has been onsite and has been avaialble with monthly conference calls.

We initially contacted Volunteers in Medicine a few months prior to that.  The expertise, knowledge, and resources provided by them to us were instrumental in our successful opening.  Any question I had (and there were a lot!) was promptly met with an informed, helpful response.  It was great to know that when something was brought up that we didn't have an answer for, we had a quick and easy place to turn.  Now, with several months under our belt, we continue to have new questions and the VIM forum has continued to be a fantastic resource.  Our site visit from Marge Hamrell was very instructive ; she has an extremely helpful, pleasant manner , and her years of experience were a wonderful advantage for us.  Volunteers in Medicine has truly guided us to a successful clinic opening this year.

VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE (national office)	158074		/users/profile/209661	JMMvim	Board Member	5	05/16/2013	At our VIM clinic, we regularly hear "without VIM, I don't know what I would do or where I would go". Free clinics such as VIM are so vital to the woprking poor. Health Care and Health Insurance is far out of reach for the good hard working people earning too much for Medicaid but not enough to survive. It is intolerable that families should have to choose between putting food on their table or paying for medications.

VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE (national office)	121419		/users/profile/165211	redcar	General Member of the Public	5	08/26/2012	I am lucky enough to live on Hilton Head Island, the place where Volunteers in Medicine was originally conceived of and implemented.  Dr. Jack McConnell retired to our community and saw a need for medical care for many in the local population who, while often employed, did not have basic medical care. In our community there is a wealth of expertise and knowledge in the medical field, derived from those who have retired here.  Dr. McConnell motivated these wonderful people to donate their time to those in need. Having been in this clinic and worked with Dr. McConnell and the volunteers there, I can attest that this is a special place where those who volunteer have no agendas, but simply a passion for service. It is no wonder that this idea has grown and expanded to serve so many communities across the country. Some clinics are supported by religious organizations, some by local hospitals and some by retired medical professionals.  This is a concept that bypasses political and religious agendas and simply seeks to fill a void - both for those served as well as those who volunteer to serve. The Volunteers in Medicine Institute and its staff are committed to replicating this model in as many communities that wish to embrace it. They are a highly motivated team compelled by an admirable cause that is based on a simple framework that successfully serves those who are truly in need.

VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE (national office)	121306		/users/profile/165045	SharonC	Volunteer	5	08/23/2012	Vim-Jax is a beehive of activity.  Its an exciting place to be.  I myself have watched from the inside as this amazingly efficient organization has evolved from a small clinic to a complex operation. When I walk in a little before 1:00 on a Tuesday (my usual time to work there), even though I am arriving at a non-peak time, there is nonetheless quite a bit of activity.  In a small room off the waiting area, a woman sits in front of a computer, a file open before her, the telephone receiver to her ear.  She is there every Tuesday making certain that upcoming patients still meet the clinics financial and employment requirements.  In the front office a volunteer is tidying up charts from the mornings patients; another is dealing with a patient who is picking up her prescriptions.  A nurse squeezes into the small office needing to print a copy of the afternoon patient schedule.   I walk past the pharmacy where a volunteer pharmacist, a pile of charts beside her, is filling prescriptions.  Tucked away upstairs, yet another volunteer sits at a piled desk pouring over the data she needs for the grant she is writing. Back downstairs, the phones begin to ring, the patients sign in, charts begin to move.  Across the hall, two young women begin readying the charts for the next days patients.  Volunteers leave, replaced by others, each with very specialized tasks.  Somehow, this medical  beehive functions, each individual performing his specific job and then moving on.   Who, I often wonder, would not want to be a part of such a dynamic force as this. -written by Sharon at VIM-JAX

There is no doubt about the "joy" expressed by John McConnel MD that both we and the patients experience. What is remarkable is how attractive the VIM concept is to all who volunteer and by those who are employed. Furthermore, as the original founder, I find I am no longer needed, as all involved have incor-porated the mission within themselves; except for fundraising, BVMI is self sustaining. Our goal should be one VIM in every county in every state.

The patients are appreciative and acknowledge the excellent level of free medical care they receive.  The Medical Community in Jacksonville have shown remarkable insight as they make major contributions to this worthy non-profit. This demonstrates their knowledge of the effectiveness of the VIM mission, and the follow through of the daily operations.

I am glad to be a part of this wonderful and well-managed community clinic. 
VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE (national office)	120672		/users/profile/164158	jimaker	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/14/2012	Our county in Washington State has no free medical clinic for the uninsured and under insured. Several providers had met to consider meeting the county needs, so we looked for experience from other free medical clinics. We were pleasantly surprised to find among the resources available was the national office of Volunteers in Medicine (VIM). This group was established in 1994 to provide assistance to start up free medical clinics, the success of which is indicated by the fact that now there are 84 VIM clinics across the US including two in Washington State. I visited one in Port Angeles, Washington that provides care to 1,400 individuals. The VIM national office has many resources with which to help at each stage of development and all free of charge except to pay for travel expenses for one of their advisers to make a site visit.

I love the job, you are able to have one on one contact with the clients.  We have a very well organized staff and things run very smoothly.  Being able to offer this kind of care is very important for the community.  I know what it is like not to have insurance.

NorthWoods Stewardship Center	188721		/users/profile/246287	sjcvt	Volunteer	5	11/16/2013	Serving as an Americorps Education Volunteer in 2007, I was so inspired by Northwoods Stewardship Center.  As a child, I had went to an outreach paddle when it was the Vermont Leadership Center. It made me want to get back and explore the Northeast Kingdom. The staff, board, and community are so invested in their landscape and lifestyle. In an area so rural, I was so happy to be surrounded by a community of people that are passionate learners and educators always trying to do their best and improve upon what they do, while keeping it creative and relative.
NorthWoods Stewardship Center	186543		/users/profile/243553	glenallingham	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	We encountered the NorthWoods Stewardship Center through a tourist publication and then found out about a book written by Luke O'Brien, who is the Trail Manager. The book introduced us to many detailed descriptions of hiking trails in the NorthEast Kingdom of Vermont. It made a huge difference to have this level of detail, and greatly enhanced our hiking experiences. We also learned about a Peak Challenge, and one summer completed it with the help and support of NorthWoods staff members. It turned out that we were the first to have completed it and as Canadians, we were quite proud of that. Last spring we met some young people who were staying at the NorthWoods Stewardship Center and they were canoeing up to Canada. Having met them there, we were able to make arrangements to meet them again in Canada. This is to say that NorthWoods is a meeting place and resource center for people who care about the environment and who seek to experience it in profound ways. We have also attended some educational event s at the center, and these also have enhanced our appreciation of the natural environment. The staff have always been extremely helpful to us, and have greatly enhanced our trips to Vermont. We have found a home away from home at the Center, and have told many of our friends about the wonderful work that is done there.  We are glad to know that they have a presence in local schools, and enable local young people to learn about the natural world that surrounds them. We met a young boy on one of our canoe trips and he told us that he learned to canoe at NorthWoods: a great endorsement!

NorthWoods Stewardship Center	184881		/users/profile/241813	Carolrnh	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2013	Northwoods Stewardship Center offers opportunities to the general public at minimal to no cost.  We have used their cross-country ski trails, learned about different animal pelts with the lodge itself, enjoy the local musicians who have performed and taken several classes there such as the solar energy classes.  The best things I feel they provide are programs to the youths in the area to experience nature in a respectful way while enjoying all of its beauty.  Our youngest son went on the weeklong canoeing trip while I older son enjoyed the youth camping trip.  This summer our oldest son worked on the Conservation Back Country Crew and describes it as an awesome experience.  They worked the trails during the day and camp on them at night.  Though it rain most of the time, he enjoy it immensely.   It is a true asset to the community offering families the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors and learn new things.

The landscape as well as the people are beautiful. The outreach programs, such as live music, full moon paddles, and hikes, are always super fun. The work that gets done by the trail crews is amazing (Especially the new cabin on Bald Mountain, open to the public for free!) The summer camps are top notch. I just love everything here. 
NorthWoods Stewardship Center	183909		/users/profile/240823	jcsimsarian	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	Our connection with Northwoods goes way back. Every winter we use their beautiful trails for cross country skiing. Always a wonderful way to get outdoors on a beautiful day when our kids were learning to ski. Now we go with kids and grandkids. During the summer, we are there weekly for yoga classes. Northwoods provides a wonderful spacious area for our class--really a perfect setting as we look out on magnificent views of the pond and mountains beyond. Our grandson has enjoyed summer camp experiences at Northwoods which teach nature study/appreciation. Our daughter and son-in-law have had foster children. One, in particular, a city kid, went on a camping/canoe trip. It was a truly wonderful experience for her. Something she couldn't imagine doing beforehand. She made friends with fellow campers. The canoe trip gave her a real sense of accomplishment. My husband has taken the course in "The Game of Logging". The skills and knowledge not only has made him a better woodsman, but probably has saved his life. On the light side, we have enjoyed many evenings of musical entertainment  at coffee houses which Northwoods provides to the community.
NorthWoods Stewardship Center	182709		/users/profile/239584	petere33	Client Served	5	10/26/2013	This organization serves the people of Northern Vermont in several ways:1.  The Land Management team helps home owners by providing planning  and site management of forest lots that need logging or conservation.  They perform this function for me, and are a real time- and money-saver.2.  The Conservation Corps team hires teenagers (ages 15 through 18) from the area, trains them to do forest conservation work and environmental conservation, and deploys teams of youth workers throughout New England.3.  The Education team provides summer camp education in the environment to children. I have experienced all three aspects of these teams through work they have done for me, and education they have provided for my grandchildren.

NorthWoods Stewardship Center	182548		/users/profile/239373	Beth89	Board Member	5	10/25/2013	NorthWoods Stewardship Center (NSC) fulfills many needs in this underserved area of Northeastern VT.  The Conservation Corps not only  provides jobs for local kids in the area, but teaches leadership, responsibility and a positive work ethic.  In addition,  there are a great variety of educational programs offered as well as the work of the Forest Stewardship Center.  In a world where "connection" usually means to an electronic device, the NorthWoods experience provides a deeper more meaningful connection to nature and each other.

General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2013	We were introduced to the original Leadership Center when our son's participated in hands-on learning opportunities with their primary schools...and being fans of Outward Bound and other such programs ourselves, we were very excited for them to experience similar outdoor experiences with such a wonderful program staff and setting here in the NEK...as our sons grew older, two of them were able to participate for several summers in the Kingdom Corp work experience and we believe this was life changing for both of them: climbing up local mountains daily carrying heavy hand tools to maintain and build trails, learning how to cooperate with and understand the variety of fellow group members, overnight camping out, preparing and presenting a conservation project at the end of the summer...it was awesome seeing our young sons develop their own self confidence and also appreciation for others and become aware of nature and their role in protecting it. Still today when we hike our area mountain trails our sons will point out "we built that" as we pass a still sturdy wooden or rock bridge, etc...We can't say enough about what a GREAT role North Woods Stewardship Center plays in the NEK of VT!!

The paths of mud were covered with well constructed, sturdy and lined up wooden planks, several newly planted rock stairs were formed to lead down to the water's edge. The trees along the lake are intricate and majestic  as you observe their twisting and artistic trunks winding around each other or stretch out over a rock or snag to reach out to the sun for survival.  I thank all of the workers on the trails for the care of the trails to purely enjoy.

The program is exceptional at an extremely low cost and provides a great service to the community.   My family members are also avid hikers and much appreciate the tremendous efforts Northwoods has made in improving and maintaining the hiking trails in the NEK.  When we first came to the NEK many of the trailheads were unmarked and trails were not well-maintained.  The difference since Northwoods began their efforts is amazing.  We are looking forward to hiking Bald Mountain to see the wonderful restoration on the fire lookout cabin, as well as the new history trail on the Northwoods site.  We have also participated in their community activities, such as the full moon paddle, and if we lived full time in the NEK we would attend many more.  I couldn't say enough wonderful things about this organization; they are an incredible service to a community that lacks few services of this caliber.   
NorthWoods Stewardship Center	172024		/users/profile/227724	caroline_	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	NorthWoods is one of the best non-profits I have worked with.  In the past few years I've worked with a handful of conservation non-profits up and down the east coast, and NorthWoods Stewardship Center has by far been my favorite place.  I worked with NorthWoods over the summer of 2012 for a few weeks doing canoe trips for kids in the NEK.  They we're so well organized, laid back, knowledgeable, and just overall some of the most friendly people around.  After each canoe trip I did with them, you could see the difference they made in the kids.  They absolutely love what they do and they do it well.  Anytime I wound up in the NEK, I would find myself pulling into NorthWoods just for a visit.  Everything NorthWoods does for the NEK is so valuable, and I just wish more people knew what a great organization they are.  A great place full of great people.

Especially its highly motivated and dedicated staff who conduct "hands-on" activities about land management practices and other environmental  issues for all ages living-in and visiting the NEK.  When my wife and I were loking for an organization worthy of placement of some of our money, they were the natural choice (no pun intended!).  We could not be more pleased with the way they are using the financial resource we provided to them.  We have received great satisfaction from knowing that we have been a part of sustaining their 20-year history of providing worthwhile and necessary, community-centered, work and education.

He and I rented a cabin on nearby Crystal Lake and I drove him to camp each morning, enjoyed hiking and biking in the Northeast Kingdom, then had the supreme fun of picking him up each afternoon.  The NorthWood staff were courteous, easygoing, and professional.  We live in suburb around Boston and I wanted my son to have a true, rural experience for one week in the summer.  In addition, he and I got to spend one week together traveling, eating meals together, and fishing.  It was a slice of heaven.
NorthWoods Stewardship Center	111016		/users/profile/151090	Oliver Smith	General Member of the Public	5	04/28/2012	Northwoods Stewardship Center is a hugely valuable resource in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. The staff and volunteers are smart, interesting, and always seem to be available on-site, or by phone and email. The Stewardship Center has always been there to remind me why I love northern Vermont, and gives me the experiences and information that deepen my relationship with this part of the world. As host of Game of Logging (GOL) series the Center gave me a solid education in safe and sustainable woods practices. As the host of outdoor events, the Center has given me backwoods experiences - in all seasons - I wouldn't have found myself. The Center's moonlight paddles on the Clyde made memories that my loved ones and I will cherish forever. Logging with horses - in winter - was an unforgettable experience, introducing me to great people and a new dimension to working outdoors. My dream is to manage woodland in VT with the best sustainable practices available. I know that the Stewardship Center will be an essential ally and partner in that journey.  Finally, I see the Stewardship Center as a vision-keeper for a sustainable, respectable and progressive approach to Vermont's natural resources.

For people who just want to take deep breaths and soak in the sounds and smells of nature, this is the place to be.  For adults who long for a camp experience that will teach their children about the real outdoors, while learning in a safe environment, this is the place to visit.  With talented outdoor educators and volunteer scientists, this non-profit is a state-of-the-art educational center when it comes to combining science-based activities  and fun community outreach programs.   Of course I am biased, but not just because I am an active board member and love the people who work here, it's because I grew up in this area, and after being away for 20 years, then coming back, I realized how important, and necessary an organization such as this is.  We need NWSC to help us learn again the lost arts of nature-living, and must pass on this knowledge of being a careful and educated land steward.    Hey, it also provided a summer job for my active, 6'3", 17 year old son!  He was a crew member of this organization's Youth Conservation Corp.  Fortunately, Northwoods was able to secure grants to pay local girls and boys for various types of outdoor work, including fixing VT trails to make them safe for all hikers.  Offering this kind of work to young people is invaluable in an area that has the highest unemployment #'s in the state.  However, keeping the funds coming to support Northwoods Stewardship Center is very difficult in an economically impoverished area where family farms are dying fast, and few kids stay to work the land.  NorthWoods Stewardship Center has a great impact on our local families, and on our local environment - come visit & experience the naturally wild nature of the Northeast Kingdom of VT.

I saw 11 films (and am eagerly awaiting retirement when I can see them all!!), volunteered on 2 days and hope to do more next year. The festival generates an excited downtown where conversations are sparked between strangers, friends, and people from greater Vermont who come to Montpelier for the GMFF.

I loved every one of them, and honestly would have seen everything the festival had to offer if it were humanly and financially feasible. (My work schedule dictated my choices, so I missed some of the films offered during weekdays.) The talks/Q-and-A with some of the filmmakers and film subjects was a wonderful bonus. I can't thank the festival organizers enough for all you do to screen, select, and schedule the films and then smoothly herd all of us through the venues. All three locations were great. I only wish we could bring food and drink into the Pavilion and City Hall. Sustenance is required if one is sitting through multiple movies in a row.

Focus on Film	27944	5	/users/profile/29012	sonia2	Volunteer	5	02/11/2010	The Green Mountain Film Festival is one of the best film festivals in the region and without a doubt the best in Vermont.  The quality of the programming is fantastic.  The festival has had a great line up of film makers and critics like Al Maysles, Les Blank, Christine Vachon, Robin Swicord, Kenny Turan, Godfrey Cheshire and David Thomson. It's just a great festival.

Whoever thought march in Vermont could be so much fun and so enlightening? The folks who run Focus on Film and the Green Mountain Film Festival put on 10 days of films and events that keep MOntpelier's downtown filled with lively discussion. The buzz is electric, the films range from hilarious to thought-provoking and the speakers add depth and sparkle to it all. Local nonprofits sponsor films so they get their messages out to a wide audience at the same time.

I've been one small part of the exciting growth of this festival from a local effort to a regional force in film. One of the perks for a film lover in this endeavor is seeing a lot of independent and documentary films one otherwise would not have access to. The educational aspect is very strong, for filmmakers and knowledgeable speakers often accompany the screenings. It's great fun for those of us engaged in the festival, and brings together an amazingly diverse group of workers behind the scenes, people with skills beyond normal expectations.

It was expensive and you had to attend a summer camp and audition to be accepted. She was just 14 years old. She had been in the hospital and talked with her Dr.'s about whether or not she would be able to handle the schedule with school and her treatments etc. They encouraged her to try. They also told her about a nonprofit Cystic Fibrosis Lifestyles Foundation whose mission was to support kids with CF in their journey towards a longer and healthier life, specifically encouraging physical activity. She wrote a grant application and low and behold she was granted the money to attend camp. Armed with the support of CFLF and the encouragement of her Dr's she began dancing with the team. She became an interacle part of the group winning awards, performing for the community, fundraising events and the list goes on. When she was in her Sr. year of High School the group made it on the TV show America's Got Talent, the show is based on getting America's vote for the success of the team on the show. CFLF mobilized the CF community they voted, they sent my daughter notes of encouragement, admiration and hope. The team came in second but my daughter came in first, first in her heart, she was humbled, encouraged, motivated by the CF community to continue to make a difference for all those living either with CF or anything that might appear an obstacle- as she said on national television "don't let lifes obstacles get in your way." We say thank you to CFLF and the amazing love, money and support they share with the CF community and beyond!

My sister applied for a grant from CFLF a couple of years ago and was awarded their 100th grant.  She shared her story with those at CFLF and also shared about her niece (my daughter) who is also living with this disease.  In honor of giving their 100th grant, they also gave a matching grant to my daughter so they could enjoy activities together that would help keep both of them active and improving lung function.  My daughter applied for the grant again this past year and was awarded the grant again, for which we are so grateful!  It has allowed her to participate in activities that we would not be able to be a part of otherwise.  CFLF does amazing work for those of us who are directly affected by CF.  CFLF deserves more than a 5 star rating!

We were not sure what to expect but from start to finish we had a wonderful experience.  The grant she received helped her further her love of horseback riding.   It allowed her to ride twice a week last winter.   For us, it was hearing her say that her lungs felt so good when she got off, that made it so wonderful.  The importance of what this foundation can not be stressed enough.  To keep children active with cystic fibrosis is so important to their overall development and future.    The staff at CFLF truly cares about those affected by cystic fibrosis and they work hard to ensure that each recipient feels special.

My daughter Breana was diagnosed with CF at age 6 and to say the least, it threw me and our familly for a loop.  But being that Breana who is now 11 years old and an already gifted Athlete, she is a swimmer, a gymnast, a surfer and now with help from CFLF, is on a Diving Team.  The CFLF Grant has helped me out tremendously, as I am a single mother of 3 beautiful girls.  Breana has won numerous medals and a plaque for 1st place in the last meet of this season and is heading to compete in the Junior Olympic level starting next season.  To see her so excited about this new adventure and have a smile on her face every day after practice makes everything we go thru so worth while.  We Love you and thank-you for this opportunity.

My doctors told me about the CFLF and I decided to apply, and what a wonderful foundation this is. This foundation gives reasons and not excuses for kids to maintain healthy. Thanks to this wonderful program I have been able to stay out of the hospital for 2 years and have kept my cepacia cf lungs to a wonderful 80%. Ever since I got to "re-unite" with the YMCA after years of not being able to attend because it is very costly, it has become a very found place for me to go to. I love to attend my classes such as zumba and yoga. I use the pool to exercise my lungs and use the fitness room/etc to do my other activities to maintain fit. This gym grant not only covered my membership for a year, but I was a well respected client for the next year to come. Erin who I have spoken to on numerous occasions was always so nice, and so respectful and patient. When mentioning how wonderfully lucky I am to be a healthy cf patient after years of struggle, I always mention the CFLF's gym grant and how my success to healthy lungs couldn't have been without them (as well as my meds of course). A great foundation and I hope it sticks around to benefit other cf patients as it did to me!

Cystic Fibrosis Lifestyle Foundation	117657		/users/profile/159949	Rinez	Client Served	5	07/03/2012	     One year ago, I was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis, which was a shocker as I was 65 years old at the time. I have two daughters who have Cystic Fibrosis and so I am very tuned in to this disease and all that goes with it.  One daughter passed away in October, 2008 at age 26 after two lung transplants and the other, age 33, continues to live pretty well in spite of being sick enough to be on the lung transplant list.  She is married and is the mother of two children, 7 and 3.  I have a mild case of CF, obviously and know the value of exercise in keeping my lungs clear and healthy. I have seen the encouragement given my girls over the years to exercise and be as active as possible.  The grant given to me has allowed me to have a gym membership where I can go anytime and exercise in spite of the heat outdoors and I can go alone, unlike walking out on the streets where my husband feels it's unsafe for a woman alone.  I strive to walk at least three miles a day, five days a week. It keeps me feeling well.  I am thankful for this grant and use it regularly because it came from others who donated to this cause. I will not waste it! I am very thankful to the CF Lifestyle Foundation for their support.

It's a terrific organization that provides resources to help those with CF stay healthy.  The staff memebers that I have encountered have been kind, patient, and helpful.  It's validating knowing that there is an organization that recognizes how hard we work to stay healthy and because of it, takes away the burden of paying for working out- a very necessary part of our overall health.

Cystic Fibrosis Lifestyle Foundation	117105		/users/profile/159298	b_k_king	Client Served	5	06/28/2012	        CFLF has been a great help. I was always the "poster child" for the CF center I went to every 3 months. I never had to be hospitalized and played aerobic sports all my life. My PFTs were in the 90s until I went to college. Once I left home I couldn't eat as healthy as I did nor as much as I did back in high school and I didn't have the resources to exercise as much as I did in high school. I was not as strict on my health as I should have been. My second semester of college I caught pneumonia in February and spoke to my doctor which was 2 hours away but did not catch it until July. By then it was too late, my PFTs dropped to 32, I lost 18 lbs, and I couldn't walk up a flight of stairs. From then on I was hospitalized almost every 2 months for the past 3 years for CF exacerbations. Luckily 2 years ago I found out about CFLF and decided to apply to help me get the funds to pay for a gym membership where I could start exercising again. After 2 years of going to the gym every week, lifting weights, doing cardio exercises, using my breathing treatments, eating as much as I can, and 2 sinus surgeries, I finally am starting to feel like I once use to. I am running on the treadmills daily, almost stronger than I have ever been, and only 5 lbs away from my weight when I was completely healthy. My PFTs are back up in the 60s and hopefully climbing. I finally feel great again and have the faith and determination I need to work hard and live a long healthy life. CFLF has given me the funds and resources that I need to reach this milestone in my life and I hope they are able to do the same for others.

We mailed the grant on March 19th and received confirmation of receipt from the organization in April.  Then, nothing until June 26th, which is when I received an email asking to review the charity.  I emailed the rep to explain again that we had not received any notice of grant approval.  She emailed back with a myriad of excuses and more 'work' for my daughter.  They failed to follow through from their end, so now they have decided to push their work her way?!  Seriously?  Unfortunately, it is too late for the summer swimming lessons she planned with her friend.  After watching my child work hard to perfect her essay, check our mailbox daily for 2+ months and make plans for lessons with her friend, I believe it is reasonable for the Director of the organization to explain to her personally, why they failed her.  I suspect this error was unintentional, but running a loose organization such as this hurts children.  I understand errors happen.  However, when we realize we've made a mistake, there are certain cardinal rules we should have learned in kindergarten:  Apologize.  Take responsibility and fix it immediately.  A reasonable priority of a foundation that provides services for chronically ill children should truly have their game together to avoid disappointments such as this.  Rule #1 "First, do no harm".  Most of us would agree that these children go through more than any one person should ever have to; they don't need these unnecessary hits.  I have asked the representative to request that the Director of the organization contact me; no response.

Circus Smirkus takes students to a whole new level of learning.  We find that our students are actually more focussed in their classes during a two week residency in which they practice for up to 50 minutes every day.  Teachers were at first worried about lost class time, but quickly discovered the time they had was more productive AND the opportunities for integrating circus arts into most areas of the curriculum were unlimited.  The thrill of watching a child persevere at a skill until they are able to perform it in front of an enthusiastic audience is unmatched.

In that short time he grew from being quiet, reticent, and a bit insecure to someone who radiated on stage with full confidence and strength of character, and his skills improved 300%. I had no ambitions for my son to be a performer, but I will say that I could not have chosen a better place for him in his teen years. He was surrounded by caring, creative and loving human beings in the troupe and the staff.He found a family that encouraged him and gave him numerous opportunities to grow, succeed and participate fully and responsibly in all areas- performing, creating, and all the behind-the-scenes work. He went from a single parent family to having numerous supportive "parents," mentors and peers. I never had any experience with the circus or any interest either, but that quickly changed as I became an eager, enthusiastic circus mom, thanks to the people who make up this organization and the excitement that was generated the minute I entered the scene.

I had no idea what to expect when I was accepted as a 2009 trouper, but I was amazed by the experience I had.

Circus has been my dream and passion since I was three years old, and Smirkus has not only provided me with the opportunity and resources to pursue circus as a career, but, as for so many others, gave me life skills applicable to anything I would want to achieve. Smirkus creates an adventure that is life changing and life enhancing, and is quite indescribable to those who haven't experienced it, but undeniable to those who have. I have gone on to work as a professional clown and continue to work with Circus Smirkus, in many roles, including counselor and production manager, mentoring the current troupe, supporting the artistic integrity of the show, and proudly helping to continue to provide magical entertainment for audiences of all ages.

The Circus Barn, Inc.	30548	7	/users/profile/31515	morti	Donor	5	02/24/2010	Circus Smirkus provides an environment for young people to become better at both team work and leadership, responsibility -for both oneself and others- creativity and self expression. It fosters empathy, passion, commitment and self discipline. This is done through the circus arts- from juggling to acrobatics, clowning to trapeze, aerials to tightrope walking. It is not difficult to understand how the lessons learned by working in a tight-knit group towards a common goal over a period of ten weeks stand the participants in good stead as they evolve through their teenage years and become young adults. As a parent I feel immensely proud of my child's achievements-both physical and developmental- thanks to Circus Smirkus, as well as grateful that he found this gem of an experience.  Don't be deceived by  the title 'youth' circus. It is incredibly professional and of an exceptionally high standard. Guests from all over the World have echoed this as well as numerous newspaper articles and television reports. Although running away to the circus is an affordable affair, running the circus is not. That the kids sleep in ancient, but clean trailers is part of the charm. That families can afford the ticket price is paramount. However transportation and putting on shows with the safety of both participants and the audience IS expensive.
The Circus Barn, Inc.	30540	7	/users/profile/31507	smirkobooster	Board Member	5	02/24/2010	I first experienced Circus Smirkus 11 years ago as a prent taking my young daughter to a Big Top tour show.  The whole family was blown away!  The kids who were performing showed such incredible energy and joy!  My daughter said then and there, "Dad, I want to do that!"  Soon after, she began attending Circus Smirkus summer camps. My wife and I were very pleased and impressed by the high standards for fitness and nutrition at the camps as well as the great pleasure and satisfaction our daughter derived from attending them.  A few years ago, she decided to try out to become a Big Top Tour Trouper.  Her experience on tour for the last two summers has been just plain wonderful and I have continued to be impressed by the fact that the joy and exuberance I noted 11 years ago is still a feature of each performance.  I volunteered at just about every show I could manage to attend.  I witnessed the wide-eyed wonder of the kids in the audience, the smiling parents, and the hard work by everyone associated with the show.  I was impressed to learn that, not only does the Tour act as a fund-raiser for a variety of local non-profit sponsors, but the Troupers even give short impromptu shows at various locations their route - for example Paul Newman's "Hole in the Wall Gang" camp for kids with cancer and other serious illnesses. Last summer, I was asked to join the Board of Directors, and although I realized it would be a serious time commitment on my part, I did not hesitate to say yes.  As a Board member, my view of the organization broadened and I could see the other ways Circus Smirkus touches people's lives.  One of the programs visits schools throughout the northeast for short "residencies," where the kids are taught some simple circus skills as a way of encouraging fitness.  The more I have seen of Circus Smirkus, the more imprssed I have become.  It is a jewel of an organization!
The Circus Barn, Inc.	29428	1	/users/profile/30447	trouper-mom	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	Circus Smirkus makes magic. It's that simple.  Each summer audiences fall in love with the wonder, joy, & artistry of the circus arts through Smirkus' award-winning Big Top Tour, performed primarily by talented children and teens.  In addition to its tour, Smirkus brings the circus arts to thousands of children annually through school residencies and summer camp programs. My son was first introduced to Circus Smirkus by attending annual performances of the Big Top Tour.  Years later, a Smirkus school residency resulted in his learning to diabolo and juggle - with a passion! As a ninth grader, he attended the Smirkus Advanced Camp, and one year later he was on tour as an official "trouper".  The Smirkus experience has been a remarkable journey of transformation. Whether through residency, camp, or tour, Smirkus teaches kids to extend the boundaries of what they thought possible, and to love the unique form of art that is circus.
The Circus Barn, Inc.	29292	1	/users/profile/30320	ben2	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	Circus Smirkus is absolutely amazing. Before seeing it, many people think it is just a kids' show. They are incredibly surprised withing minutes of the show starting. All the performers are professional caliber, but they have the enthusiasm and enjoyment that many professionals lack. If a performer does not have a smile on their face, it is because they are a clown who just got a pie in the face. Often after a show audience members will tell say "Oh, that was just as good as Cirque du Soleil" Many others say that Smirkus is better.
The Circus Barn, Inc.	29289	1	/users/profile/30318	lco91	Former Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	I grew up attending Circus Smirkus Camp (5 summers) and then performing on the Circus Smirkus Big Top Tour (4 summers).  It is impossible for me to describe the infinate number of ways in which Smirkus shaped my life- every summer with Smirkus taught with me new lessons, gave me new strength and confidence, and added to my ever-growing circus family.  Nothing compares to the pure joy and passion that young performers are able to share in the Smirkus ring and I know that the organization not only has a lasting impact on the kids who participate, but their families, the audiences that come to the shows, and so many others.  Smirkus is an incredible organization and I feel so lucky to have it in my life.
The Circus Barn, Inc.	29201	5	/users/profile/30202	ewstubbs	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	I am the parent of a child who went to Circus Smirkus summer camp for three years and then was encouraged to audition for the tour. She was accepted and what had been a fun pursuit for her turned into a passion. She toured for 2 years until she became too old. It happened that for her, this led to a professional circus career, though what she gained from the experience would be useful in any profession. What I saw as a parent was this: my child was stretched and challenged to work really hard to pursue her dream of making it to auditions and to be accepted to the tour. She developed a confidence I did not know she had. I witnessed her relating to the audience as a whole, interacting with individual fans young and old, and working hard with her fellow troupers, who became like family to her. I saw a sense of responsibility and teamwork in her and in the entire troupe that I did not think was possible in a group of young people. During the teenage years, human beings tend to be extremely self-centered and can be pretty inconsiderate of others. But I saw a group of young people who worked as hard on the show as a whole as they did to develop their own skills. It requires sometimes putting aside one's own desires for the good of the show. Those accepted to tour are all talented. They have incredible discipline in their individual training, but there are also many group acts and ensemble pieces, requiring endless rehearsal within the larger context of the troupe.  Every day they have to work together not only in the ring, but behind the scenes. This includes many daily chores such as meal clean-up, picking up trash in the bleachers, etc, and also working with the ring crew. They have to keep themselves and each other safe and they have to help each other. Sometimes they literally hold each other's lives in their hands. This requires a degree of trust and honesty that most people do not have to face in the workplace. The directors and coaches are extraordinary. Although they bring out the personal best in each young person's skills, they set a high standard for professionalism and maturity for the troupe as a whole. They demand the best in character, behavior and attitude from each trouper. They treat the troupers with respect and are respected in return. My child spent her summers in this wholesome, challenging environment learning important life lessons and growing confident and mature. Oh, and they put on a heck of a great show!
The Circus Barn, Inc.	29178	8	/users/profile/30214	heyjazzsinger	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	I am the parent of a "smirko", and I think that circus smirkus has provided an incredible growth opportunity for my daughter, who was a shy kid when she started with them, and after 2 touring summers, has become much more confident, outspoken, and community minded. The people behind the scenes are dedicated individuals, who bring the joy of circus to both the performers and audiences. I lthink smirkus is an outstanding organization!
The Circus Barn, Inc.	29165	5	/users/profile/30205	josh1	Former staff	5	02/19/2010	I've been involved with Circus Smirkus for the past 8 years. First as a camper, then a trouper, and now as an alumni. The organization has shaped me into person that I am today. Circus Smirkus is a close knit community of kind and passionate people who share a common goal of making the best show possible. Smirkus is more than any kid could ever ask for.
The Circus Barn, Inc.	29140	7	/users/profile/30179	seanemery	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2010	My daugher, Aerial, was involved with Circus Smirkus over a 5 year period including camps and the touring company. As a family this experience has been a HUGE part of our lives all year round. Even though camp was for a week or two at a time and Aerial's tour experience was a 10 week period over the summer for 3 seasons ... she lived Circus Smirkus all year. It positively affected her school work and her home life. She knew that if she was all good in school that we as her folks would let her live her dream in the summer. She did more chores around the house. We owe it to the Smirkus staff for giving the kids a voice in decisions and the fact that as a whole they all depended on one another on the road ... staff and trouper alike.Aerial is now in Circus College in Quebec Canada and is following her dream. She knows what is like to train hard ... do multiple shows in a day, meet and greet audiences, face the joy of a wonderful performance and learned to accept a not-so-good show with grace and dignity.  Respect ... a lot of respect on circus Smirkus amongst all.Although Aerial is off the show now as she aged out, We will continue to be involved and fly up for shows in the summer as our child gained SO MUCH from the experience. As did we!Truly,Sean EmeryMeg Emery
Bennington Project Independence Inc	318395		/users/profile/409563	svcoa	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/06/2016	Southwestern Vermont Council on Aging is a community partner with Bennington Project Independence (BPI) to provide services and supports to elders in Bennington County.  The Council is proud to rate BPI five "plus" stars for the outstanding service they provide as an adult day care facility.  In fact, BPI should be the model throughout the country as to what an adult day care facility should be. Their varied, engaging and participatory daily activities are amazing to see, and their facility is "state of the art" when it comes to providing adult day care services, nutritious meals and wellness activities.  Bennington County is extremely fortunate to have such a healthcare option for elders and younger disabled individuals living in the Bennington area.
Bennington Project Independence Inc	318228		/users/profile/409376	behanshan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/03/2016	I would recommend Bennington Project Independence Inc (BPI) to anyone.  I did an internship at BPI and was overwhelmed with the compassion and knowledge that the staff has to offer our loved ones.  While doing my internship I was able to witness first hand what this program has to offer.  In my current job I refer several of my clients to the agency.  The agency has so many different things to offer your loved one.  They have coffee time, they also do physical and cognitive activities.  They also have art classes and take day trips to local attractions such as the apple barn and this is just a few the things they offer our loved ones.  I am proud to say my grandmother attends BPI and has made so many new friends and the staff is amazing with her.  From the time your loved one arrives until the time they leave the staff treats them like family.

The staff were wonderful and communicated well with me, and the feedback I got from my clients was very positive.  They enjoyed the opportunity for increased social contacts and activities that were offered.  It is a blessing to have this organization in our small community - it is a much needed resource!

It consistently successfully supports people in maintaining their independence and health over time.  The services provided by BPI are high quality, customer focused and addressing the Triple Aim:  Improve the health of the population; improve the person experience and reduce medical care costs.  BPI is part of the community "Building a Healthy Bennington"
Bennington Project Independence Inc	315217	1	/users/profile/406545	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	3	10/27/2016	Bennington Project Independence is an amazing, caring, holistic and beautiful sanctuary.  From the care and thoughtfulness that has gone into its creation, the services and breath of their offerings, to the dedicated, kind and professional staff - It is a treasure Bennington is fortunate to have.  There are very few if any, adult day care centers like this.  For any adult living with a disability, for any senior isolated and alone, for caregivers needing a day or a few hours respite, for older adults wanting companionship, fun, and or an extra hand, it is a  refuge.  BPI and it's board are devoted to it's community and participants, and Bennington and it's surrounding areas are blessed to have this option few will ever know.
Bennington Project Independence Inc	314580		/users/profile/405933	lmazza	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2016	I work for VCIL, a disability rights and advocacy organization. BPI is an extremely valuable resource for me in that they are able to lend out durable medical equipment (walkers, canes, etc.) for people I work with who only need that equipment while they're recovering. This means that they do not have to purchase the equipment which they won't need long term, saving both the individual and the health care system as a whole money. This is extremely helpful to me in fulfilling my organization's mission of helping to foster independence. The membership coordinator goes above and beyond when working with people who are potentially interested in the program to make them comfortable about coming and seeing what it's all about. The whole staff practices person-centered approach that recognizes that each person has a specific set of needs, wants and comfort zone and works individually with folks to make sure their needs are met. I am very impressed with the quality of their engagement with their clients.

Bennington Project Independence Inc	310223		/users/profile/401573	Gloria41	Board Member	5	10/12/2016	Several years ago, I was trying to care for my disabled husband and keep my job, and I could not have done it without BPI.  They always tried to have activities that would be varied enough to appeal to different groups.  The nursing staff kept up with breathing difficulties, mobility problems, and diabetes.  The bus drivers were very helpful, even stopping the lift so his grandchild could give him a kiss goodbye.  I attended the caregiver support meetings, and it really helps to know that others are having the same feelings as you.  Now I am retired, and can no longer support BPI as I used to, I have become a member of the Board of Directors

BPI was a life-saver.  The wonderful care she received there made it possible for her to remain with us for three years.  Every participant is treated with dignity and warmth no matter what their disability is.  Its state-of-the-art facility is an added plus.

My grandmother went to BPI for many years. Through all the stages of her Alzheimer's disease,  BPI was wonderful, you could see the happiness in my nana's face when she would arrive at BPI with Pat greeting her every morning.  BPI is a big part of why my Nana could be at home with my Gramp until she passed. (Which is what Nana wanted) They not only helped my Nana but they were there for my family . I cannot say enough about Bennington Project Independence and the staff that works there.  They care about the people and their families.  You cannot find a better place than Bennington Project Independence!!
Bennington Project Independence Inc	309843		/users/profile/401194	dutchie	General Member of the Public	5	10/11/2016	My mother hd Alzheimer's Disease for 13 years. She lived home with my dad, and he was her primry caregiver. He also was very involved in our community through church, the rescue squad, and volunteering at a local elementary school. Mom attended BPI for eight years, where she lovingly received care. This allowed my dad to have his days free to maintain his active retirement, giving him the respite he needed and peace of mind that mom was well cared for. BPI played an integral roll in allowing my dad to be able to keep mom home, where she passed away eleven years ago. He would not have been able to do it without this wonderful agency.
Bennington Project Independence Inc	309829		/users/profile/401182	Suzanne85	Client Served	5	10/11/2016	Bennington Project Independence is not your typical adult day service.  It is a second home.  It became apparent that my 90yo ma needed supervision while my husband and I were at work.  The staff is wonderful and very attentive.  There is so much to do during the day.   They even take short trips to the park, ice cream or shopping.  When possible they have singers come in.  They also open certain days up for family and friends to join in such as Country Day (where my ma helped with the decorations) or Christmas Holiday party.  Then fun never ends with a great blend of the normal bingo (prizes inc.) to Wii along with exercise and brain games.  There is a salon where you can book a hairdresser or barber to come in.  This group of professionals could not be more loving or attentive.  I wish they were open on the weekend for times when my husband and I would love to take in a movie.  I feel very secure leaving my ma in their hands.

Bennington Project Independence Inc	309707		/users/profile/401057	Writer	Client Served	5	10/11/2016	BPI has a caregivers' group for those of us caring for seriously ill and dying family members. It meets once a month. It was my life line while my husband and I dealt with his emphysema . The group shared and laughed and cared and considered. The leader was our facilitator, letting us all talk, knowing about resources and how to navigate the system to help us give the care we wanted to give.  I would walk into a meeting despairing and come away with courage and understanding. Today, 3 years after my husband's death, I can go back to the group and share. If I see members around town we stop for meaningful conversation, supporting each other. The group also helped me process what was happening so that I could be useful to  others .

The executive director and staff are extremely capable and professional, and are responsive to the changing needs of their participants and their families. They recently renovated an old farmhouse and grounds into a state-of-the-art facility, and are a model for adult day services everywhere.

The dedicated staff is well trained and treats clients with dignity and sensitivity.  The facility is second to none; the activities are boundless; but the real value is that caregivers can get relief, while the clients get the benefit of socialization and activities.
Bennington Project Independence Inc	88664		/users/profile/100001	Jude	Board Member	5	05/12/2011	Bennington Project Independence is a state of the art adult day service/rehab facility.  Located in a converted historic barn just a mile out of downtown, we are a comfortable, bright, safe, caring place for loved ones whose family members need day services in order to work themselves.  I used to volunteer at BPI occasionally, and upon my partial retirement and when an opportunity came to serve on the Board of Directors, I jumped at the chance. I am so proud to be involved with this facility and its amazing staff.  A participant once told me that she loved coming to BPI and when I asked her why she told me that it was the first time in years that she felt safe.  We offer so much.  Of course things like medication, meals, exercise, and what you would normally expect, but at such a high and competent level. The view from the many windows and porch is truly amazing. There is always a group discussing current events or constructing a puzzle or cooking or doing crafts or talking to the two parakeets, and on and on. From the moment you step in the door and are greeted by someone at the front desk, you know you are someplace special and that is proven time and again by the smiles on the faces of everyone there.

As a former camper, who is now a volunteer staff member, I see how critical it is for Camp TaKumTa to be an outlet for children to escape and just be kids again.  Camp has shaped many of us into the people that we are today.  Camp gives children with cancer confidence, security, laughter and love.    Camp is a feeling and a bonding of very special people that 'come from different corners"  The spirit of Camp and of those that have touched our lives through Camp can only be described by one word: Magic.
Vermonts Camp Takumta	67125		/users/profile/73362	CarolK09	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	 2010 was my first year to volunteer at Camp Ta-Kum-Ta. I was welcomed with open arms and many, many hugs of friendship. These giving people didn't even know me, and they embraced me. The kids were so excited to be there. Just watching them have so much fun, especially after what they had all been through in their young lives, brought great joy to my heart.   These kids need this place of love, hope and friendship in their lives.

Vermonts Camp Takumta	66495		/users/profile/72678	goingnutw4	Client Served	5	02/10/2011	As a parent of a child who has gone through a bone marrow transplant I can not say enough about this haven! My 9 year old daughter had repeatedly asked me to find a camp that she could go to that had kids just like her. I found it and she went. She left home with limited self confidence and a feeling that she was alone, there was not anyone out there like her. She came back a confident, happy, nine year old without a care in the world. She had found kids just like her, and it was not only ok but normal to be just like her. TKT has been a god send. When I went to pick her up another mom stood up and made a comment that I will never forget. "Many people see the advertisements for TKT and think that this is a place of dying, I have always thought that this was a place about living!" I could not have said it better. A place where kids can be kids. My daughter says the best thing about TKT is "It's FUN, it's FUN, it's FUN!"
Vermonts Camp Takumta	66267		/users/profile/72436	kendravt	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	As a child I attended Camp Ta-Kum-Ta as a camper. I then became a counselor to help give back what was given to me. Camp Ta-Kum-Ta is truely a magical place for children that have experienced cancer. Everyone is like family. It gives you chance to share your experiences with others that may have gone through what you went through. I have a family of my own now and have not been able to get back to camp to be a counselor, but I still stay connected.  A year ago I was diagnosed with a second cancer and my camp family was very supportive to me. Once you have a connection with Camp Ta-Kum-Ta it never goes away.

Camp is a safe place for kids who have cancer to feel normal and accepted...it also doesn't hurt that every minute is packed with fun! Some of the things we have done include swimming, hot air balloon rides, ice skating, bowling, lots of singing, talent shows, a formal dance, a ferry boat cruise...and much more. I can't even keep track of all the activities we do.  What I most remember after every session is the love I felt from every person there.

Vermonts Camp Takumta	65892		/users/profile/72023	Sarah G.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/09/2011	Camp Ta-Kum-Ta is a wonderful opportunity for children whose lives are far from "normal" to have a "normal" summer camp experience. The kids swim, hike, and most importantly play. These days, many children are given less independent, unstructured time; for children dealing with a chronic illness, these opportunities are even more limited. During the week of Camp Ta-Kum-Ta, the children are in a safe and structured environment in which they are able to have the independent, unstructured time that promotes social/emotional growth and development. The week would be a great opportunity for any child; for a child dealing with a chronic illness, it is an amazing opportunity that can't be matched.
Vermonts Camp Takumta	65879		/users/profile/72010	nymom	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	I have been a volunteer and also the parent of a camper.  I see Camp Takumta as a powerful and magical tool that all children should experience.  Camp helps children who attend find their voice, strength, courage, love, inner peace, motivation, enthusiasm and energy whether they are battling cancer or in remission.

You might not guess that  a camp for children with cancer would be full of joy, laughter, pranks, and other silly stuff, but that is exactly what Camp TKT is!  TKT gives children who have or had cancer a chance to reclaim their childhood, live in the moment, and have the time of their lives!
Vermonts Camp Takumta	65791		/users/profile/71916	TKTrocks	Volunteer	5	02/09/2011	Vermont's Camp Ta-Kum-Ta is a very special place.  The actual camp lasts only one week (although there are more events all year now that we have our own home), but the memories and the strength and love you get from Camp lasts a lifetime.  Camp changes you.  As a volunteer, I go to give my time and expertise in areas I excel in.  I give up a week in an already short Vermont summer to make kids who have gone through ordeals no person should have to live through.  I go to Camp to make a difference, but I get so much in return.  Camp helps the kids forget all that they have been through and be with other kids who they can share, laugh and grow with. 
Vermonts Camp Takumta	65730		/users/profile/71849	sam5713	Client Served	5	02/09/2011	Camp Ta-Kum-Ta is a camp in South Hero Vermont that provides children between the ages of seven and seventeen who are battling cancer, as well as children who have already been treated for cancer with incredible, carefree, life experiences. Camp not only allows children to get away from the stress and constant hospital life involved with having cancer, but it also allows them to be a child again, to share an unbelievable week with more games, gags, activities, and daily themes than I can list. Camp provides life-changing bonds of friendship between both campers and staff members. There is something magical about the simple understanding of what everyone at camp has gone through or is currently going through in his or her life. The magic of camp lets everyone take down defensive walls. People are seen at their strongest and most vulnerable moments all in one week. Camp is an incredible healing power that gives children confidence and optimism needed in their lives and overcome any obstacles they may face.

Grounds for Health	188778		/users/profile/246379	Sylvia E.	Volunteer	5	11/18/2013	I've had the pleasure of volunteering for Grounds For Health in Nicaragua and just recently returned from Peru.  The concept of training in country health care providers to continue to provide services in a sustainable manner is what makes this nonprofit organization successful.  The training sessions have all been well organized.  The in country providers are very appreciative of the volunteers that come to help educate them from different parts of the U.S.  I have met and worked alongside great volunteers and will continue to volunteer in future trips.

Grounds for Health is focused on training medical professionals in coffee growing countries to screen and treat cervical cancer using effective techniques that are approriate to low resource settings.  I think their method is especially effective because they have cultivated strong relationships with local medical providers and have formed a partnership with them to train medical professionals to improve the care they offer their patients.
Grounds for Health	186834		/users/profile/243842	Showesouth	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2013	I have known and worked with Grounds For Health for 8 years (since 2005) first in Mexico and then in Nicaragua.  In that time I have seen them develop their model for community based cervical cancer prevention, and training local providers in a simple effective see and treat approach.    Although small, they are one of the more effective organizations I have worked with  mobilizing local organization through the coffee cooperatives, and training, equipping and supporting doctors and nurses at the local Ministry of Health centers.  Since they began in Nicaragua (2007), they have worked in 3 different health departments in Nicaragua -- first Jinotega, then Matagalpa, and now Madriz.  At each step they have improved their model and the local organization to support it. Other organizations could learn from studying their strengths. Susan Howe, MPH, EpidemiologyProviding clinical support and program evaluation to programs in Nicaragua since 2004.
Grounds for Health	186469		/users/profile/243477	morgas	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I first volunteered with Grounds for Health in 2008, as a clinical volunteer teaching and providing cervical cancer screenings to poor women in rural Nicaragua.  I was immediately impressed by the level of organization of the staff, and how they were able to use my time effectively to make a big difference in the health of the local population.  The staff of Grounds for Health are highly professional and competent, and also very fun to work with.  The work was based on sound evidence of best practices in developing countries, and was coordinated with the local ministry of health of our host country.  I felt my time and skills were used not only to help the women directly served by our campaign, but also to train local health care providers so that the technique would spread and have an ever-increasing impact on the health of the population.  I have been volunteering with this group every since, and have grown increasingly impressed with their work!

Working with often very poor coffee farmers across East Africa, we see that often a huge proportion of their income is spent on health related issues, and the work that Grounds for Health does both saves lives and improves farmers lives through health education. They have been wonderfully innovative in the way they raise money, and it is brilliant to find a group who link coffee consumers with the people who grow their coffee in such a direct and positive way.

There is no question, Grounds for Health is making a difference in women's lives every day.

She was the sweetest most loving dog and we had her as a member of our family for 14 years. All Breed has continued to grow over the years and now has a large facility for homeless dogs. All these years later I am now volunteering and working at the shelter and I am amazed at the dedication and love that the dogs waiting for their forever homes receive every day.  We have fostered and adopted four more dogs since Cleo and will always be grateful to All Breed Rescue for educating us about dogs in need. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone wanting to rescue.
All Breed Rescue Inc	312339		/users/profile/403692	Writer	Client Served	5	10/20/2016	In two weeks, it will have been one year that I walked into the front doors at All Breed.  I had the opportunity to walk around to meet all the dogs in their kennels.  I had looked at photos over and over, and kept skipping over this one dog.  I missed seeing him in person because he was so quiet and tucked away in a corner kennel.  One of the board members sat down with me and asked me a bunch of detailed questions about what I was looking for.  He stayed over an hour after closing time for me.  Everyone that was there was so friendly and accommodating that night.  This man brought me back to this photo that I had skipped over so many times and insisted I go back to meet him.  That was when I looked into Brick's eyes for the first time.  That was the exact moment my life changed forever.  I would never have picked him had it not been for this man realizing this dog was the one for me.  I went back the next day to meet him out of his kennel.  He took my breath away.  He still takes my breath away and is the exact reason why I do what I do today!  I thank All Breed Rescue and the people who work there for being the amazing people they are!

They were kind and informative and did their due diligence to make sure that we were a good fit for this special girl. She is a dog with special needs due to her epilepsy and sensitive stomach, and they gave us all of the information and resources that they had to support our transition to having this lovely pup. Four years later and we truly cannot imagine life without her! All Breed Rescue is compassionate and dedicated to this work!

All Breed Rescue Inc	280196		/users/profile/370038	Brodhis_new_family	Client Served	5	02/14/2016	I was not looking for a dog when I met Brodhi. In fact, our family had said goodbye to our beloved 12-year-old shepherd mix less than six months earlier and was still grieving the loss. I wandered into the midst of an All Breed Rescue adoption event on an unplanned visit to Petco and Brodhi melted my heart. (I still think he knew exactly what he was doing.) An ABR volunteer noticed and encouraged me to take Brodhi on a walk; and the handsome, well-mannered guy had me hooked. Two hours later, after meeting the entire family, Brodhi was on his way home in the back seat of my car, tightly curled in a ball and drooling in fear. Brodhi wasnt like the dogs Id had since they were puppies. He lacked confidence for reasons I can only imagine. It took time to learn what frightened him and to develop a trusting relationship. Brodhis high social drive made him want to do what he could to please us; we just had to learn how to show him what that was. Through several weeks of training Brodhi and our entire family gained confidence.  Brodhi taught us how important our own education was to his well being. Learning to be pack leaders was a new experience for all of us, but came more easily when we realized it made Brodhi feel more secure and set him up to be successful in new situations. We no longer had to worry about finding ourselves in a situation that triggered him to behave in unexpected ways. We learned he likes to race, jump, and snuggle. We learned hot dogs make him go a little crazy; and that he is afraid of people wearing ski masks, and seltzer-making machines.  Our reward for the time spent in training is a loving companion who continues to delight us with his personality: from his exuberant racing through the dog park to his compassionate snuggles on the lap of someone whos had a tough day. (Brodhi was the first of our dogs to be allowed on the couch;  he is the biggest snuggler on the planet.) His teen-aged, human pack members have this to add: If you want a dog you should consider rescuing, because youre saving a dog that doesnt have a happy life . . . Youll want to learn the dogs history, and My dog is awesome. All Breed Rescue saved Brodhis life; provided the medical care, training and socialization he needed; and  matched us with a well-mannered lovebug who has enriched the lives of our entire family, not to mention the lives of the many other people he encounters in a day.

All Breed Rescue Inc	279292		/users/profile/369366	Writer	Client Served	5	02/08/2016	We adopted our dog from All Breed Rescue about 4 years ago. I have so many great things to say about this organization, but I think that the experience that our dog had speaks more for ABR than anything else. Whenever we came back to visit ABR for doggy daycare or for training classes, our dog would get so excited and run up to the doors with her tail wagging! There she would meet the people who used to take care of her, and the reunion was always cheerful. For our otherwise timid dog to absolutely love visiting her old shelter speaks volumes of this organization! ABR volunteers know each dog and give them the love and care that, for many of the rescue dogs, is the first they have experienced in their lives. All Breed matched us with our sweet dog and our family is better for it.

All Breed Rescue Inc	243589	2	/users/profile/330382	Noemail	General Member of the Public	1	05/26/2015	I adopted Ranger from All Breed Rescue a little over 3 weeks ago. We drove all the way to Plattsburgh, NY from Manchester, NJ it was about a 5 hour drive one way. I picked him up at the trainer and then drove back the next day. Sarah told me my travel cost would count as my adoption fee since they insisted on me going up there instead of him being trasported to me. The adoption fee was $300 and my cost was $315 for just gas and the hotel alone. I let Sarah know and she said "We will count your adoption fee as paid." When I got home and looked at his paper work and vet records it said that he was a pit bull boxer mix. On their website and on petfinder.com it says he is a boxer Shepard mix. I was not informed of this. I had him for a week and he snapped at me twice, my boyfriend, my mom and my sister. There was no reason for him to snap. He was also showing his teeth and grawling. No one was doing anything to him to give him a reason to snap. I reached out the Sarah and the trainer for some help. The trainers fist sentences to me back was "Some of this behavior was displayed previously at fosters residence before his training and I hope was discussed with you prior to adoption." I was not informed of this. I had no idea that this was an issue. I have young family members that come over and I always have people over. I can not have a dog that has aggression issues and snaps at people. I can not risk it and take a chance because if he bites someone then I am at fault. If he bites someone then someone gets hurt and I will get sued. I was lied to about his true breed and about his behavioral issues. Had I been correctly informed I would have explained that he would not be a good fit for me and I would have adopted a different dog. Sarah claims that I was informed and now refuses to give me my money back. I am now out all the money that I spent to get him. It is also not fair for Ranger because his life was changed for no reason. I'm sure they will continue to adopt him out and not tell people of his issue and just hope for the best. I was lied to and mislead and taken advantage of. She refuses to acknowledge that they were wrong and they will continue to do it to other people. It's a real shame and not only for the adopters but for the dogs. They do not disclose all the information about the dog that they should. They are liars and frauds. I am not the only one this happened to. I read another review where the adopted dog actually bit someone and they almost lost their hand. All Breed Rescue is clearly okay with letting this happen and are willing to take a chance that dog will hurt someone or not. It is absolutely ridiculous. They put my home and at risk by not telling me all the info about Ranger. What if he didn't just snap and he actually bit someone? This rescue is a joke and has really shown what they are all about.

There is no other organization that has a bigger place in my heart than Outright.  It is a truly youth-driven, empowerment-focused, strengths-based, celebratory, educational, visionary, queer place.  This is not always the easiest path to take, or the one that garners the most funding.  Youth in our community sometimes want, need, and prioritize things that do not align with popular funding streams.  However, Outright is wholeheartedly committed to their values and to being a queer organization in many senses of the word.  The staff work their amazing butts off for this place.

As a staff member at UVM, I have seen non-LGBTQ college students build their understanding for themselves and for queer youth.  Outright strategically involves LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ college students to create allies for today and the future.
Outright Vermont	115680		/users/profile/157540	TessicaJ	Volunteer	5	06/19/2012	"The Mission of Outright is to build safe, healthy, and supportive environments for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning youth (ages 13-22)." In my experience volunteering and interning for Outright VT, I witnessed the mission of the organization being lived out among the staff, volunteers, and youth that are so very important to the agency. The network of love, support, and education is exactly what youth of all ages need to develop and step out in the world. I would absolutely recommend this nonprofit to anyone who is interested in supporting youth and having their life being changed in the process. Outright does an excellent job of using resources to benefit youth while taking the input and feedback of those teens. 
Outright Vermont	115678		/users/profile/157534	MandaLee	Client Served	5	06/19/2012	I went to the Youth Summit this year. and it was absolutely incredible.  It was nice to be in a place where I didn't feel judged for just being me.  Outright is an incredible thing to be part of, and to take part of summit was something definitely life changing for me. 
Outright Vermont	115226		/users/profile/156968	Yacubian	Volunteer	5	06/14/2012	Outright Vermont is truly queer, youth driven and empowerment focused. At Outright's  annual Queer and Ally Youth Summit this year, multiple youth proudly and loudly amplified how Outright Vermont has positively impacted their lives. I witnessed youth stand confidently and speak courageously. I saw empowerment, strength, and resilience. And, I heard Outright Vermont.  
Outright Vermont	114813		/users/profile/156440	AdamOutright	Volunteer	4	06/12/2012	After meeting two Outright staff members during one of their eye-opening  presentation, I was moved to volunteer with the organization as a Friday Night Group (FNG) facilitator. Helping to creating a safe and supportive environment for youth to share their experiences, make new friends and just be themselves reached something deep within me. I knew that this weekly opportunity was something truly special and I wanted to do what I could to ensure that queer and questioning youth had that outlet where they didn't need to worry about people misusing their gender pronouns or where they could get a hot meal each week. My experiences as a facilitator inspired me to take the next step and join the staff as the Youth Coordinator. I feel safe in saying that I can speak personally as to how the organization touches hearts and changes lives.   -  My score is actually representative of how a youth feels about the organization. I asked them to provide us with a rating of 0-5 stars. They said 4, because you're not perfect (and really who is) but you get a 5 for all of your effort. 
Outright Vermont	114534		/users/profile/156058	Don Eggert	Board Member	5	06/10/2012	I joined the board a few years ago, not because Outright was desperate for help, but because I wanted to be a part of a successful organization that was doing outstanding work in our community. Through their work in schools, Outright is educating the next generation of Vermonters on how to be compassionate citizens and not tolerate bullying in their schools and communities. The staff at Outright is 100% committed to the cause of ending homophobia and I know that when I volunteer my time and financial support, these resources are wisely used, sorely needed and always welcome. I encourage anyone to give of themselves  no matter how small the commitment to this indispensable organization. 
Outright Vermont	114362		/users/profile/155617	OutrightSaben	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/08/2012	Outright Vermont has been around since 1989 serving LGBTQQ youth in Vermont. While the story of Outright has changed and shifted with the every changing needs of youth, the mission has remained constant -- to provide safe, healthy, and supportive environments for queer youth in Vermont. The work that this organization is doing today is more expansive than what it was doing in 1989 -- but the core program, Friday Night Group, remains. This group runs every Friday night -- and has since 1989 [bad weather and holidays included] -- but the work has expanded to also include an education work in schools, sexual health and wellness programming for queer youth across the state, additional sites for Friday night group, a week-long residential summer camp for queer and allied youth, overseeing the Queer Straight Alliance [QSA] network for school groups, free and anonymous HIV testing, counseling, and referrals, and hosting an annual Summit for youth. This organization has served an important role is helping youth to feel valued, appreciated, and respected -- not only in their space, but in their communities. Since the start of 2011, Outright has done educational 237 presentations for nearly 7,000 youth and adults across the state.  There were 38 campers for the inaugural season of Camp Outright in August 2011, and there are currently over 60 youth registered for the 2nd season of Camp Outright. The youth are involved in all of the work that the organization does -- including being youth board members, setting the priorities for Outright each year and sitting on speaker's panels, planning programs and events, advocating for LGBTQQ rights, laws, or policies in the statehouse, and fundraising. The work that Outright is doing continues to move forward as the youth use their voices to step up, speak out, and be proud of being exactly who they are.

Outright Vermont	114242		/users/profile/155465	Alex Potter	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/07/2012	Outright Vermont provides vital services to this rural state.  Rural youth still struggle with isolation, and Outright actively battles this every day, bringing youth together to support each other. This is a youth organization that truly empowers youth as opposed to "reaching down" with services "for" youth.   They work hard to expand their reach throughout the state, moving their yearly conference/Queer Prom event around the state to allow more youth from different areas to attend.  Their visibility work alone is so valuable, and they provide so much more.  The Outright Vermont School Report Card that evaluates Vermont schools based on friendliness and support toward LGBTQ youth is another invaluable service they provide.  We are blessed to have this energetic and active organization in our state!
Outright Vermont	114221		/users/profile/155429	grgann	Board Member	5	06/07/2012	I have been a member of the Board of Directors for several years now, and am very proud of the work that Outright Vermont does all around the state.  Not only do our LGBTQ youth find a place that is safe, nurturing and respectful, but all students who are in our schools recieve the powerful messages about bullying and acceptance.  I know if I had and organization like this when I was a youth coming out my life would have been much happier.  I have heard more than one youth describe an experience with Outright as "the best day/event of my life"... it does not get much more powerful than that!
Outright Vermont	114207		/users/profile/155411	djllu	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/07/2012	I have worked, volunteered, donated, and generally been a huge fan of Outright Vermont for over a decade.  They really do make it better for queer youth in Vermont and I am proud to have an org of their caliber in my state.  They are actively creating space (physical and otherwise) for queer youth in communities and schools in every corner of Vermont - the results can be seen at any of their events, where happy, healthy, and vibrant queer youth are able to truly be themselves.  Go Outright VT!
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	220663		/users/profile/284335	Debbie145	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2014	DAR Awards Highest Honor to Vermont National Guard Officer Montpelier  At its 115th State Conference the Vermont Daughters of the American Revolution bestowed its organizations highest award, the National DAR Medal on Honor on Captain Zachariah Fike of Georgia, Vermont.  The award recognizes outstanding leadership, trustworthiness, service and patriotism.  Past recipients have included broadcaster Tom Brokaw, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Senator Bob Dole, and Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor.   Zachariah Fikes life and work is an inspiring example of the unusual and lasting contribution to American heritage required to earn this honor.  Over the last 15 years, Captain Fike has served as an enlisted man and Officer.  He is currently serving as an Active Guard Reserve (AGR) Officer and as the Operations Officer for Headquarters and Headquarters Troop, 1st Squadron, 172nd Cavalry Regiment (Mountain), which is a Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) unit in St. Albans, VT, which is part of the Vermont Army National Guard.  Captain Fike has served Combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  For his Service, Zachary has been awarded two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, eight Army Commendation Medals, seven Army Achievement Medals, Army Good Conduct Medal, five Army Reserve Component Achievement Medals, National Defense Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, Iraq Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, Global War on Terrorism Medal, Armed Forces Service Medal, Armed Forces Reserve Medal with 10 Year Device, Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon, NATO ISAF Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Combat Action Badge, Pathfinder Badge, and Military Mountaineer Badge. Zacharys service to country carried over into his private life when he started a nonprofit foundation called Purple Hearts Reunited, which locates lost or stolen U.S. Military Medals and returns them to the veteran who earned them or to their families in order to honor their sacrifice to the nation. Zachary donates a considerable amount of his personal time and finances to researching and locating the original recipient or family and conducts a Return Ceremony to reunite the veteran or family with the medal. To date, he has conducted over 65 returns and is currently working on over 200 medals that need a home.  He also takes time to enroll these heroes into the Purple Heart Hall of Honor and has personally enrolled over 600 recipients.   Since starting this project, Zachary has personally dedicated over 2000 hours and a significant amount of his personal finances toward this effort.  As an Active Duty Officer, Zachary works during the day and then returns home for family chores before dedicating 2-3 hours each night to researching each medal and searching for their owners or families.  On weekends, he scours local antique/flea markets and pawnshops in order to rescue lost or stolen medals.  He also sacrifices his weekends and often takes military leave to conduct the medal return ceremonies, which are conducted throughout America.  
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	213225		/users/profile/276383	kmulcahey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/03/2014	Purple Hearts Reunited is an incredible organization that is tightly managed and run by CPT Fike who has grown this organization from the ground up on passion and mission dedication alone. I served in Afghanistan with CPT Fike, his dedication to my men and their ability to remain equipped and ready to take the fight to the enemy was critical. He understands the brotherhood of Valor and sacrifice that is essential to having credibility in an organization such as this. I have been personally present for several of the returns, and the peace and pride it brings to the recipients - too often on behalf of the actual soldier - is immeasurable. His strategic vision, relationship building, and resourcefulness has allowed him to maximize the efficiency of his shoestring budget that started out of his own pocket. A great leader and a great cause that everyone should want to feel pride to be a part of.
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	212528		/users/profile/275548	Jason77	Donor	5	08/27/2014	I served with Zach during a combat deployment to Afghanistan.  It was my first time meeting him, but immediately, I knew that he was the epitome of an Army officer.  Throughout the deployment, I witnessed his courage and sacrifice.  Fortunately for our veterans, he started a wonderful non-profit.  I witnessed a PH return in Kansas City this past year, and the moment that I observed the impact that this foundation had on our veterans and families, I was hooked.  Zach understands personal courage.  It's not easy to face grieving families, but he embraces their pain to recognize our Nation's heroes.  Zach is a hero too.  Kelp up the great work!

Their laser focus on the mission and flawless execution make us proud to partner with them. CPT Fike does a great job of communicating with and engaging partners to keep us abreast of their latest activities and ways we can grow together. Happy to be a part of the effort and looking forward to many more years together.
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	212404		/users/profile/275403	327inf101abn	General Member of the Public	5	08/27/2014	I've known Fike for a decade now. I can honestly say that he was destined to perform this duty. His passion for the mission stems from personal experience. I've followed PHR before it was an NGO. So much effort has been placed into the efforts and deliverables of this fine organization. Veterans and their families are proud of the sacrifice and service of that individual and when that is literally lost to the four winds PHR takes on the duty to reunite those pieces that encompass more than the act that resulted in the award, but the emotions that come with that type of sacrifice. PHR embraces this mission with grace, responsibility, and the respect it demands. PHR truly supports it's beneficiaries by focusing on that eventual deliverable of reunification. Keep up the amazing work.

Being there to see the reactions of the service members widow and grown children was something I will remember for the rest of my life. The work, care, devotion and pride put into each return cannot be matched by any other organization. 
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	212370		/users/profile/275370	GodBlessUSA	General Member of the Public	5	08/26/2014	I have had the pleasure of attending several returns performed by Purpe Hearts Reunited.  Each return is heart warming and the closure brought to each family is life changing.  We should do more to not only support Captain Fike, but all Veterans of our Country.  
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	212344		/users/profile/275341	Saber-4	General Member of the Public	5	08/26/2014	I have served with CPT Fike for over two years and during that time I have seen first-hand his dedication to our men and women in uniform.  His tireless efforts to re-unite family members with their loved ones military honors is just an extension of his commitment to the men and women who serve this nation.  Purple Hearts Reunited is a top notch organization and the service they provide to the family members of our fallen veterans is exceptional.  I will continue to help and support CPT Fike and Purple Hearts Reunited and I encourage everyone who honors our military veterans to contribute what they can to this worthwhile organization. 
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	212343		/users/profile/275336	OPSNCO	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/26/2014	Captain Fikes organization epitomizes the core Army values of Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.  He has set the bar for contributions to his national community at a new level.  His returns are thoughtful, well orchestrated acts of incredible kindness and displays of respect and honor to both the family and the service member. Zachs personal connection to each return is validated by the vast amount of personal time and finances spent on verification of the medals he receives.  His returns and the presentations of the medals to the families have provided immeasurable pride and often well deserved multi-generational closure to families honoring the sacrifice of their fallen. Captain Fike and his organization are as heroic as the veterans they represent.  He truly honors their sacrifice with his service. 
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	212336		/users/profile/275332	cchape	General Member of the Public	5	08/26/2014	The Purple Heart Reunited is a very professional organization that reunites veterans and their families with lost purple hearts. You cannot find a more dedicated and passionate leader then Zachariah Fike.   Zach has spent a great deal of his own personal time away from his family to continue his goal of reuniting as many purple hearts to their rightful owners as he can.  The amount of joy this organization has brought to the families and veterans is overwhelming. 
Purple Hearts Reunited INC.	210849		/users/profile/273650	HannahHarwood	Volunteer	5	08/15/2014	Purple Hearts Reunited is an unbelievably productive organization, locating and serving the rightful owners of military medals. Captain Zachariah Fike has returned over 100 medals by himself, essentially in his spare time, over the course of only a few short years. The impact that these return ceremonies have on the families involved is staggering, and is an important piece of allowing military families to heal and gain the recognition of service that they deserve.

To see the joy and gratitude on the family members faces was worth the money I invested.  CPT Fike is dedicated to his cause and brings much to these families, some who have nothing left of their loved one, but this medal.  These medals belong with the families who have given so much to this country.  I will continue to support this cause in the future.

We distribute those donations to our food shelf clients.  We feel that many clients would go without food in order to feed their pets.   We are very blessed to have their support!!!!
Pawsitive Pantry	96381		/users/profile/112252	hellian	Volunteer	5	08/23/2011	Kudos to this organization. Pet owners are apt to feed their pets before they feed themselves so this is one burden that they don't have. This service also helps the owners keep their trusted pets rather than overload the Humane Society and most of all, the owners and pets have the companionship that feeds their souls...a win, win  for all in these hard times.
Pawsitive Pantry	96380		/users/profile/112251	jennevans	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/23/2011	Pawsitive Pantry provides a service which is greatly needed in the communities I serve. Many people would be unable to keep their animal companions without the food, treats and goodies the program distributes. On a daily basis, I have people coming in for pet food when they are in a bind. I don't know what I would do without the help we get from this organization.
Pawsitive Pantry	96031		/users/profile/111759	kristenedaigle	Volunteer	5	08/19/2011	Pawsitive Pantry is an amazing non profit organization!

Pawsitive Pantry	95999		/users/profile/111710	doggie	Volunteer	5	08/18/2011	The work the pantry does is incredible.  I volunteer and deliver to two different food shelters and the people there, both workers and users of the pantry, stop me every time and are so so grateful.  In these times that are so hard for individuals and families, to be forced to give up a valued member of the family like a pet or to not be able to provide well for them is a much too painful and unnecessary thing to occur.  And the group that runs the pantry are dedicated and seem to have their priorities straight.  Woofs to all . . .
Pawsitive Pantry	95806		/users/profile/111444	andri	General Member of the Public	5	08/16/2011	This group is made up of organized, dedicated animal lovers of all ages.  Their work has made it possible for many, many families to keep their beloved pets when otherwise, due to finances, they would have to give them up.  These volunteers often drive through miserable conditions (this is Vermont!) to get this food distributed to those in need.
Pawsitive Pantry	95782		/users/profile/111383	Bonnie Rosenberg	Donor	5	08/16/2011	Pawsitive Pantry - what a great concept and what an incredible need this organization fills!  Bottom line - it insures that animals can be fed and families already experiencing desperate issues with the recession, can keep their loving dogs and cats embraced within the family circle, where they are needed more than ever.  Hats off to its founder, Jen Bennett, and all of the volunteers who make this work on such a broad scale. It is a model that has been copied in other regions, because it works so well and makes so much sense!

Pawsitive Pantry	95778		/users/profile/111378	Barbara Mitchell	Volunteer	5	08/16/2011	My personal belief is that there is nothing more reassuring during times of duress than a loving pet.  This organization allows owners to keep their pets during financially stressful times.All profits for this organization go directly towards providing food for dogs and cats. The woman who started Pawsitive Pantry has created an organization comprised of very dedicated volunteers.......
Pawsitive Pantry	95776		/users/profile/111372	truckeejamee	Volunteer	5	08/16/2011	Pawsitive Pantry rocks.  The passion behind pets is one thing.  But really it's about hope.   Anyone who has ever loved a cat or dog, or even knows someone who has, knows how incredibly important that pet is to it's person in good times and especially bad.  The idea that someone would have to relinquish responsibility because of a temporary (hopefully) hard time is just heartbreaking for the person and the pet.  PP is there to make sure there are options.   The volunteers and founder are some of the most fun and big-hearted people around too. What's better than that?
Pawsitive Pantry	95775		/users/profile/111371	SCAL	Volunteer	5	08/16/2011	Pawsitive Pantry provides pet food to area food shelters so that people who are in need of assistance may get pet food at the same time they pick up food for themselves.  This enables people to be able to keep their pets and ensures that the pets get the food they need. The pantry is a well organized volunteer effort that I am happy to be involved with.
Population Media Center, Inc.	266771		/users/profile/355527	Writer	Donor	5	10/23/2015	Who am I?  A professional with experience in the field. I have been an admirer of Population Media Center for 17 years.  PMC is one of the most successful nonprofits focused on a human-rights approach to family planning, reproductive health and justice.   The staff thoroughly research each country where the soap operas are produced. They carefully craft the soap operas to achieve social change with stories that are compelling.  The result is that knowledge is acquired and actions are taken that save lives and prevent unwanted pregnancies.  The measured changes in behavior are cost-efficient and can be replicated.   The organization I work for, Population Communication, focuses activities in many of the same countries as PMC. My experience in each of these countries is that PMC provides a more effective approach is getting results than any other competing NGOs.  One of the PMC activities I most admire are the population/family planning stories Joe Bish culls from the news and reposts daily. Recently, the very impressive PMC book, "Overdevelopment, Overpopulation, Overshoot," has provided a focal point for creating visual awareness of the links between population, resources and the environment.  Bill Ryerson's introduction articulates an overview of the opportunities to address the exponential population growth, the current unsustainable development, the depletion of resources.  As Bill states in the book, "This is a wake-up call. The photographs are emotionally jarring and the reality of this moment calls for us to think, to care and to act." I have the great pleasure to acknowledge the outstanding service the Population Media Center provides for all of the countries where they focus their activities.
Population Media Center, Inc.	261367		/users/profile/349968	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2015	 I have been a supporter of PMC since its founding 17 years ago.  The single most effective way to save the planetis to reduce the number of people on it.  And PMC, through the Sabido methodology that helps people make enlightened reproduction choices, is one of the most effective organizations at accomplishing this goal.  
Population Media Center, Inc.	259839		/users/profile/348366	RubyTuesday	Board Member	5	09/26/2015	I follow the work of PMC closely because it represents  a powerful force for good.  This troubled world needs all the help it can get to fix it's many problem issues; clean water, clean air; the rapid disappearance of all those things that make life sustainable on this earth. These issues are driven in large part by overpopulation.  As I read of the work of PMC there is a great emphasis on population size and the empowerment of women. There is a very finite limit to how many humans can inhabit the earth in some state of sustainable existence.  The empowerment of women, while taking nothing from men, can bring some balance to decision making and help enormously, since the healthy and safe raising of children is of profound importance to most women.  Limiting family size offers the best way to give each child a strong start.  In today's world however, women lack the physical power to force their views on others.  In most cases diplomacy, tact and kindness work better and those are the areas in which females must work.  A further PMC focus is to encourage the recognition of the need to reduce the number of humans to a level which can be supported by the natural resources of the earth.  Seems obvious but  there is little evidence that the exploding population on our planet is being addressed effectively by governments around the world. PMC is doing all it can to draw attention to this issue by using entertainment programming that attracts an huge audience while at the same time modeling the issues of women's empowerment and desired family size.  I give  PMC 5 stars for stepping into an area that is critical in so many ways and yet so seldom recognized.
Population Media Center, Inc.	259807		/users/profile/348335	EltonSherwin	Donor	5	09/26/2015	 PMC is my favorite non-profit.  Here is why: Each day, roughly 25,000 girls are forced into marriages around the world. Tragically, even more are raped. PMC has a proven track record of changing social values and behaviors around the treatment of young girls.  This is really hard to do. No other organization that I know of does this on such a large scale, so cost effectively. If you are concerned about human trafficking, sex slavery, the abuse of girls, unwanted children, or teen pregnancy, this is an organization to support.
Population Media Center, Inc.	258638		/users/profile/347145	EarlBabbie	Board Member	5	09/21/2015	Since the late 1960s, I have regarded overpopulation as the Mother of All Social Problems: causing some and aggravating others. Overbreeding has seemed like an intractable problem, so deeply enmeshed in religious, cultural, and economic factors. However, the Population Media Center has proven itself exceptional in this regard. Working with carefully thought-out and tested psychological and communications theories, PMC has proven it's possible to change deeply established patterns. Evaluation research has shown how effective PMC's use of the Sabido methodology has been in fostering smaller families, improved status for women and girls, safe sex, and other related issues--and an economic analysis shows it is remarkably inexpensive per changed behavior. Other organizations and individuals are addressing these problems, but none is more impactful than the Population Media Center.
Population Media Center, Inc.	258431		/users/profile/346921	GoPMC	Volunteer	5	09/19/2015	I've followed PMC closely for more than a decade and I don't think there is any other organization that has such impact through such an innovative approach.

PMC has developed these  superb local collaborations with a strong, media-based population approach that is based on global level knowledge in public health, persuasive speech, marketing, all in service of positive change. GREAT value for your donation dollar!
Population Media Center, Inc.	247743	2	/users/profile/335357	Karengaia	Donor	5	07/08/2015	Population Media Center is my favorite population NGO. Using local play writers and actors, PMS uses education soaps with good role models and bad role models to modify behavior. They teach male responsibility, the benefits of girls education, choosing ones family size instead of leaving it to fate, communications between couples, conserving resources, and safe sex to prevent HIV/AIDS and other STDs. The serial programs are very popular and the results that are measured show that these programs are successful at reducing or increasing the targeted behavior - to great benefit for the members of the audience.

Renew Building Materials & Salvage, Inc.	36780	4	/users/profile/37564	amyamanda	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2010	I love that ReNew helps cycle used and useful things back into use.  Several times, I needed something specific for a house project and didn't have the first clue what I needed or where to find it.  (Materials for cold frames, a pressure tank for our well, hinges for a door, etc.)  The staff was incredibly helpful, listened carefully, and walked me over to exactly the thing I needed.  They really know their stuff and they treated me with respect even though I was inexperienced and unsure of what I wanted.  Their inventory seems to always include a huge variety of useful things (from very tiny to very large), so it's a great place to browse and find pretty much anything you need for house projects.  We have also donated things we removed from our house so they could easily be found by others who could use them.  ReNew has been a very helpful resource for us.

Without recycled materials, I could not have afforded to have the fort built. It was an exciting experience to bring my 8 year old along and have him help to choose the lumber with us. It was much more exciting field trip than shopping at a conventional building supply store. The variety of fixtures, windows, and other recycled materials was fascinating to young and old alike. And the service was extraordinary!! Keep up the good work Renew!

Construction and demolition waste makes up a substantial portion of the waste stream, and a waste it is when it can be re-used!Second, stuff there is cheap.  That matters.  Especially when it's good stuff that's cheap.Third, the staff speak the language of contractors and building professionals, not canned Home Depot customer service.  It's dirty, crowded, hard to find things (there are no big overhead aisle signs - and only a suggestion of aisles in the first place).  This can be a charm and it can be a turn-off.  You might have to ask for help (and the help is knowledgeable).  In general I prefer my retail to be self-service and easy and I want to invest as little as possible in it (it's the stuff I want, not the experience).  You won't get that with ReNew.

A couple of years ago, I decided to turn my life around and to gain practical skills. I enrolled into a green remodeling workshop, although I have no background in building or architecture. I was worried I would feel out of place. But I didn't. The surroundings are beautiful and peaceful, the solar panels were inviting, the food was homey, and most importantly, I really enjoyed the workshop! It made me feel that entering a new field was indeed possible. I left with more motivation than ever to pursue my new career goals.

As a former student and current board member, I can't recommend this program (or the school) highly enough.
Yestermorrow Design/Build School	26874	2	/users/profile/27899	katrinaspade	Board Member	5	02/02/2010	The Certificate Program (Sustainable Building and Design) gave me the foundation for a career in sustainable architecture. My favorite course was the Permaculture Design class, a 2 week foray into designing human environments based on the relationships found in natural ecologies. Teachers at Yestermorrow are passionate and extrememly knowledgeable, and the overall atmosphere at the school is one of striving to create a better world through good design. Great ideas, great people, great food - overall an A+.

The first course I took, in September 2008, was Home Design. I loved it--the teachers, my fellow students, connecting with a neglected  creative part of myself. I also took a course In England on building a stone wall. And this summer I will be taking Carpentry for Women as well as Rustic Furniture. There are always at least a dozen or more courses that I want to take. I'm now looking for land so that I can start to build my dream home. Yestermorrow is a wonderful, magical place.

I came to this school as a novice carpenter, and through a summer internship, became an empowered novice carpenter :)  All kidding aside, this was the best learning experience in any discipline in which I have worked/studied.  The instructors and staff are world class professionals, the campus environment is focused but relaxed, and the educational experience intertwines the classroom with the job site. Yestermorrow is a one of a kind experience and offers the best opportunity to learn the skills of the past while preparing for the challenges of tomorrow.

I continued on in June as the summer camp art instructor and international volunteer coordinator. I most enjoyed working with the diverse individuals who  created a highly passionate team at DREAM. The strong bond I feel to the community has drawn me back to Cabarete for another year to work in coordination with A Ganar & DREAM, and US non-profit EverGift. It's easy to say that The DREAM Project will be the defining experience in my early professional career.  It was and will continue to be a wonderful experience which I would recommend it to anyone who has thought about taking a year off from the routine they are used to.

The volunteers that come to DREAM are incredible and all have so much enthusiasm! The DR is such a happy country and Cabarete has best of both worlds: the international athletes practicing kitesurfing/surfing and volunteering, and the local population, which welcomes everyone with  a GREAT smile!!!The program is inclusive, offers a variety of trips, and will help you grow as a person.

The DREAM Project	98096	1	/users/profile/53068	amallett	Volunteer	5	09/25/2011	Another summer with The DREAM Project. Another summer well-spent. I feel honored to have been a returning volunteer with DREAM. I was placed in a different camp, with different kids. I love them just as much as my first year kids! I LOVE how supportive DREAM is. I planned a water quality/environmental education project with a professor at my university. DREAM was supportive and enthusiastic from the very beginning! Not only did they allow my to plan and execute my project, they gave me help along the way. By the end of camp, I was proud at all that my group and I had accomplished. Again, it is very hard to be gone again from my kids. Building such strong relationships and then leaving is one of the hardest things I've had to do. I think of my kids and my friends everyday and wish that we could all be back in the DR together. For anyone on the fence about applying or accepting, I say do NOT hesitate to take this opportunity and have the best experience of your life WHILE having a positive impact on the lives of Dominican youths!
The DREAM Project	52205	1	/users/profile/53068	amallett	Volunteer	5	09/11/2010	I first heard about DREAM at my university. They had a table set up at our non-profit expo. I stumbled across it and decided I'd at least apply, and before too long I was accepted into the DREAM team (as I like to call it). It didn't really sink in the magnitude of what I was about to do until I said bye to my mom at the airport. I met some of the most amazing people of ever that first week during orientation. Although the workshops were very informative, I wish we would have done more teambuilding because that's what we were for those 4 weeks of camp, a team. The La Cienega team was a five star team. We had really good open lines of communication. For example, one day my co-couselors were both m.i.a. and I was overwhelmed on my own. I talked to Elena and Natalie, the dance teachers, and they worked in a nap time into dance class. All my kids loved it and were really well-behaved after. Now my kids, they are the sweetest, most adorable, loving group of kids I have ever met. What was most precious to see was how eager they were to learn. They gave 110% in their classes, persistent and diligent. In fact, my group improved on their math pre- to post- camp math tests by 18%. One experience in the classroom that I will never in my life forget is when I helped one of my kids, Dani, learn how to do division. I sat down with him and we did a few problems together, and I taught him how to use his fingers to help him. After a few questions, using the new technique, he was cruising through the questions and getting them all right. I could tell the moment he understood how to divide, like a light bulb turned on right above him. Seeing him learn right before my eyes was the most magical moment of my life. My kids and I grew together over the 4 weeks, and became very close. Some of the kids even invited me into their homes and I took them to the beach a few times to play. Needless to say, leaving them at the end was tough. The last few days went too fast, and with many teary eyes. The experience opened my eyes to the passion I have for teaching, and a new possible career path for me. Not to mention, I gained 2 families: the other volunteers I worked and lived with and my kids, Las Manzanas. The experience was the richest and most rewarding of my life, and I mean that whole-heartedly.

Last year we brought a high school basketball team to the DR to work hand in hand with Dream reaching out to the community.  We ran basketball clinics for the locals as well as working on clean up projects and other similar projects.  The Dream Project provided us exactly what we were looking for in a partner organization to work in the area.  With their focus on Education, it was a perfect match for us.  Shortly after we returned home, disaster struck in Haiti.  As a school we raised a large sum of money to assist the releif work Dream was doing with the people of Haiti and we were more than excited to help Dream in their work.  The experience has been so good, we are returning this winter with 2 basketball teams to continue our work with Dream in the DR.

Vermont Folklife Center	61502		/users/profile/67147	tbarrand	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/28/2011	I'm an anthropologist with special interest in folk song.It took a long time for Vermont to be recognized as a place where important folklore was to be found. When the first major collection of vernacular songs from Vermonts Atwood family was published as part of the Schirmer American Folk-Song series,  the major ballad scholars, such as Cecil Sharp, were still scouring southern Appalachia thinking that was where the old ways of singing had survived. And they had, but the 1919 book by Edith Sturgis and Robert Hughes showed that Vermont was also a vital place to look. This was shown in the 1930s when Helen Hartness Flanders took up her work. The impressive value and the generosity of the Vermont Folklife Center was revealed to me when I started a project to explore the place of the Atwoods repertoire  in American singing history. The workers at the VFC immediately supplied me with recordings made by Margaret MacArthur in the 1960s of the son of James Atwood, the central figure collected by Mrs. Sturgis. They gathered together and opened up all of the materials they had with anything related to the Atwoods or Sturgis and were gracious and helpful in enabling the research to continue. Thus far it has resulted in several descendants of Edith Sturgis becoming involved, searching family dwellings for papers, photographs  and files connected to their grand-mothers activities. One grand-daughter has reprinted the original 1919 book of the Atwoods repertoire and included a set Poems written by James Atwood about his friends and neighbors and documenting life in Dover, Vermont from about 1880 to 1920. All of this is in addition to a CD recording of the Atwood songs, the several concerts presenting the songs and verse, and accompanied by projected photos and talk about the fascinating set of characters involved in preserving this invaluable Vermont lore. My story, of course, covers only one example of the legacy of the Vermont Folklife Center in saving and restoring these irreplaceable gifts back to the people of Vermont. We are very fortunate to have such a talented and devoted crew of workers in charge of these crucial parts of Vermonts heritage. Anthony G.

Vermont Folklife Center	60863		/users/profile/66329	NedC	Volunteer	5	01/24/2011	I began working informally with the Vermont Folklife Center in 2008 when I exhibited an documentary photography project in their Vision and Voice Documentary Workspace Gallery.  I discovered that my "approach" to documentary work mirrored the "ethnographic" field research concepts that form the foundation of the organization.  I've gone on to learn about, and participate in, a diverse array of programmatic activities run by the organization, including the Discovering Community Summer Institute, the Traditional Arts Apprenticeship Program, High School/Elementary media outreach, and much more.  While the popular notion of "folklife" congers scenes of "old things"- both activities and people- the Vermont Folklife Center is anything but.   Whether it's working with Somali Bantu refugee communities to support New American artists, or piloting service learning projects in schools, the Vermont Folklife center is up to relevant and exciting things.

The staff has been continually supportive and a joy to work with, from the most nuts and bolts aspects of interviews up through interpreting the meanings of experience through people's stories.

The impact on people's lives has been incredible as tears sometimes flow in the eyes of pet owners knowing they can feed their pets and receive emergency vet medical support for their companion animals. Two recent examples of our emergency medical fund demonstrated the serious need for not only pet food in the community but to also support pet owners with unexpected medical costs that they could not afford due to life circumstances. At Lucy's House we see the love pet owners have for their animals and take heart in the fact that we can continue to keep human and animal families together.

The work Lucy's House does has supported seniors, veterans, military families, people with disabilities, and people who have lost their jobs in keeping their pets in their homes. Not only does Lucy's House provide free pet food and homemade dog biscuits, dog and cat toys but they also provide medical support for pet owners for emergency pet care. Lucy's House works to end senior hunger by providing them with pet food so they can eat their own human food vs. giving it to their pets. My work with Lucy's House stems from my love of animals and desire to ensure that families can keep their pets during difficult times because I believe in the value that pets provide through their loyalty, uncondtional love, and companionship.

With support from Lucy's House, Becca and Charlotte have remained in our home, have long since become part of the family and are happy and healthy girls. My son has also learned so much about caring for puppies and shared so much love from them, that I believe he is a better person from the whole experience. Thank you for helping us to keep these special dogs.

People always tell me that I'm doing such a great thing since it makes it so the pet owners don't have to choose between feeding themselves and their pet!

Lucys House For The Prevention Of Homeless Pets	126865		/users/profile/171887	Anne E.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	I have seen first hand the wonderful work that Lucy's House has done to keep pets in their homes when financial situations may have otherwise made their owners have to turn them into shelters.   I deliver food to the community food shelves for Lucy's House and the response is overwhelming from the food shelf volunteers.   During these past four years when times have been financially hard on families and the elderly, Lucy's House has helped to keep family pets where they belong, in their homes with their loved ones.   Lucy's House is working to make finances not a reason for relinquishing a beloved pet. 
Sustainable Energy Resource Group	110647		/users/profile/150620	lynnb	Client Served	5	04/24/2012	My town had tried to start an Energy Committee.  It worked for a little while then fell apart. Later, SERG contacted people and got interest going and we have had a Town endorsed commission for 5 years. The difference was the support and encouragement from SERG. Support was printed materials and physical presence to pose and to answer questions.

Sustainable Energy Resource Group	109680		/users/profile/149425	mcdaniel_martha	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2012	SERG has done important pioneering work in our region, nudging and helping surrounding towns (such as ours) to form Energy Commissions.  In turn, SERG led the way in taking an energy-efficient approach to streetlighting - we learned importantly from their experience and, in our much larger town, turned off 40% of our streetlights and converted the remainder to LEDs, reducing our electricity use for this purpose by about 80%.  We look to SERG to get inspiration for what's possible....
Sustainable Energy Resource Group	109664		/users/profile/149410	cckelseyesq	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/11/2012	Vermont is a small and very active 'Green' State.  For its size, it is amazing that a rural and relatively impoverished State with challenging weather at best, tourism as our major income, could become a leader in this cutting edge arena of energy conservation and general 'greening' of the planet.  It is no accident that VT is like this and it has been building decades before 'green' became so politically-correct.   The reason for that, in my opinion, is because of the efforts of small, grass-roots organizations lead by visionaries who are also so skilled in the practicalities of taking on long, yet emergency, challenges in a practical, efficient way that they create organizations like SUSTAINABLE ENERGY RESOURCES GROUP.    SERG, on a daily basis, makes a practical difference in each person's ability to cut their carbon footprint in our towns and villages beause of it's innovative programs, its decades-long, hands-on experience and commitment in building a movement that will stay productive and in a practical way, get people to gently understand the severe and frightening challenges facing us and then offering, even orchestrating and finding public funding sources to help real individuals make practical changes, weatherizing old homes for little or no out-pocket money bc SERG was instrumental in finding large grant sources, making huge cuts in energy-use and public expense thereon w/our outdated streetlight programs.   In our largish-small town, in particular, it has grass-root-garnered support for energy initiatives w/measurable results - generated/coordinated/public funding for weatherization projects on town buildings and countless home-weatherization and energy efficient projects.  Day to day in real people's lives, often impoverished persons' lives, SERG has been making a quantifiable difference -- organizing whole brigades of people to canvass our rural area to see who needed help, what kind, and how to make it affordable.   This not only helped the people receiving the information, it increased all-out community involvement and commitment by foraging for so many door-to-door teams of volunteers.    From nuts to dessert, the whole magilla, and now we have a very large (by VT standards) town populace that is not only far better educated and voluntarily making daily better choices regarding the planet and it's finite sources but are actual physical beneficiaries of a warmer home, a safer to place to live,  streetlights that use 1/10th (if that) the power (and money) --a whole town coalesced around energy conversation and conservation in a practical, pass-it-on-to-the-next-generation way that will serve the planet and public good  far longer than most of the people on the Board ever envisioned.  And it's in my town, and it's changing people, people who otherwise wouldn't have learned or acted   AND  that's the biggest difference I see w/this organization --it helps in a far-reacing practical way but it also builds community and changes people.  Without that level of participation in energy-conservation, that personal commitment, no programs in the world are going to work for long enough to make a difference.   -- Plus, SERG has taken it State-wide in building coalitions w/other larger, more 'recognized/sexy' environmental organizations to help them bring the 'theory' into direct practice in the lives of all VT citizenry --but I am privileged to have watched it grow across decades w/the dedication and support of many people but primarily through the hands-on, day-to-day, minute-to-minute, in the trenches efforts of its Exec Dir, Robert Walker, a simple-living, dedicated, quiet example of someone who not only walks his talk but takes it to the far reaches of the State and too often on a shoestring budget.  It is a premier, altho under-recognized, charity that I am proud to write an endorsement for.   C. Creek Kelsey, Esq.

Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports	286958		/users/profile/377030	Ross_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My Journey of DiscoveryIn February of 2008 I had a skiing accident and I fractured my knee, tore my ACL and cut my meniscus.  I was housebound for a month.  Four months after my injury I had surgery followed by complications and was on and off crutches for a total of six months.  Prior to my injury I had never realized how many barriers there were for people with mobility challenges.  For six months I was less active then I have ever been. I had time to contemplate what my life was about.  My grandfather was in a mining accident and wore a prosthetic leg.  In late 2007 my mother was diagnosed with ALS.  My injury and my mothers illness was a life changing experience.I decided to focus on what I am most passionate about, skiing. I was on skis before I was five years old.  I have been skiing on Pico Mountain since I was six.  I had seen Vermont Adaptive at Pico over the years.  It took me a little while to piece together what I needed to do to rebuild myself.I realized what I wanted and what I needed in my life; to be a part of Vermont Adaptive.There are many reasons I volunteer.  In general volunteers seem to be very thoughtful and giving individuals.  I can't think of a better group of people to be around.  The volunteers I have worked with at Rebuild Together and Vermont Adaptive inspire me.  At Vermont Adaptive I have met people with both physical and mental disabilities.  I am constantly amazed that most of the clients aren't the least bit phased by their challenges.  The majority of the clients have great attitudes and are grateful to the volunteers that ski, canoe, ride a bike or just hang out with them.  It is a fantastic feeling of accomplishment, plus I have made some great friends.  I guess it comes back to 'you always get back more than you give.'  It's Ironic, but true for me.  I am a year round volunteer,I serve on the Board of Directors and donate anniually. This journey has lead me to Project Search as a job coach for young adults with either intellectual or developmental disabilities.My advice is to identify what you love to do and find an organization that can use your talents and volunteer!Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sports   http://www.vermontadaptive.org/
Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports	286957		/users/profile/377029	Anne_K3	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My Empowering Internship at Vermont AdaptiveOne moment last winter, I sat in Kim Jacksons office at Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sports, interviewing as a college student, still unsure of what I wanted to do after I graduated. Now I am sitting in my very own office at Vermont Adaptive, with the job I never knew I always wanted.When people ask me what I did with my summer, I find it hard to summarize all that I observed and felt during my internship. I grew personally, more than I ever thought possible in one summer. I can say without a doubt that interning at Vermont Adaptive gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. This past summer I helped plan a major event, The Long Trail Century Ride to benefit Vermont Adaptive, marketed Vermont Adaptives brand to audiences on a national level, orchestrated a silent auction, trained with the northern volunteers on Lake Champlain, was a guide to participants who were visually impaired, and paddled in a kayak for the first time. I traveled to places I had never been to before in Vermont (and Im a native!) and met people from all walks of life. When I started the internship, my goal was to gain professional experience in the industry and help people with disabilities experience opportunities to recreate and overcome their own challenges. But during a time of very difficult transitions in my life, Vermont Adaptive has been my anchor and helped me adapt and overcome as well.Moments of vast mental clarity have a habit of finding us in random ways. I found mine as I sat in the conference room at the Long Trail Brewing Company next to corporate and town leaders of Killington Resort, the Town of Killington, Long Trail Brewing, the Lookout Tavern and Vermont Adaptive, to plan the Long Trail Century Ride. Coming into the conference room, everyone worked together for one common goal- to help provide adaptive sports to people of all abilities and to create an empowered community at the end of it all. Through the experience, I saw commitment of the whole community, brought together through Vermont Adaptive, to make a difference in the lives of people with special needs and disabilities. It is because of these efforts I can see a brighter future for the community and for people with disabilities throughout the state of Vermont. This December I will graduate Magna Cum Laude with my degree in hospitality and resort management from Green Mountain College in Killington. In August, I was hired as the new projects and services assistant at Vermont Adaptive. My academic career has overlapped into my new professional world and no matter where my career takes me, Vermont Adaptive is the start of my biggest adventure.I give to Vermont Adaptive because they have helped me to grow in so many ways and it is my turn now to do what I can to help this amazing organization grow as well.
Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports	286956		/users/profile/377028	Norm_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Selfish GivingI'm a selfish guy.  At my core, in my heart.  I'm selfish.  Please don't misunderstand.  I don't think that I'm greedy, hedonistic or narcissistic.  Just selfish.  Self-interested.  My primary motivation is myself.I do things that make me feel good.  Things that don't feel good, don't have some kind of intrinsic reward, I simply can't keep doing for very long.  Why would I?   But things that make me feel good, that reward me for my efforts, that I feel better in the completion of than in the avoidance of, those things I can really stick with.  Get behind.  Make a lifestyle of.It stands to reason, then, that I must really find some kind of pleasure in giving my time and energy and resources to Vermont Adaptive Ski and Sports.  I've been doing so consistently for more than 8 years.  Every winter weekend day.  Holidays and Vacations.  In good weather and bad.  When there is good snow and bad ice.   30 below and in the rain.  Teaching, training, coaching, mentoring along with less glamour tasks like hauling equipment, standing around freezing, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming floors, fixing gear, and moving trash.  I give because I am selfish.  It makes me feel good.  To know that the skills I teach and the time I put in makes a difference to someone;  that peoples' lives are better, richer, happier because of the gifts I make; that the organization is stronger and better for my efforts.  I don't do it for them.  I do it for me.  Because I feel good about it.  It makes me happy.  It makes me feel like I have done something good, that I have contributed, that I have made a difference.   I don't give to because I'm a good person or because its the right thing to do or because I am filling some external need.  I give because it  fills that selfish need in me.I give because I'm selfish.  I just wish I could be more selfish.
Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports	286955		/users/profile/377027	Stew_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	It's all about the smileshttp://vermontadaptive.org/My wife and I have volunteered with Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports for over 25 years, working with clients with physical and/or mental disabilities, teaching skiing, paddling on 4-day canoe-camping trips, rock climbing and helping in many of their fundraisers. We also donate automatically every month.The reason we give of our time and money because of all the smiles that spontaneously erupt when a VASS client conquers an outdoor activity.  It's that magical moment when they go from being a non-skier to a beginner when their face lights up with a smile because they were scared when they started but now they know they can do it.  When they win their race in a sailing regatta even though they can't see their trophy. Or they feel the peace of canoeing to their wilderness site and camping for the night. It's these moments when they know that they accomplish more in their lives, even though they might have been afraid before.  Sometimes the client has barely left their home during the winter because they were afraid of falling on the ice, yet a VASS volunteer has taught them how to ski over ice, so they're not afraid to get out anymore.It takes special training, special equipment and special people (staff and volunteers) to achieve those smiles.  VASS has brings those resources together daily to help clients with any physical or mental disability, from as far south as Virginia, north to Montreal.  That creates a lot of smiles up and down the Eastern seaboard.Seeing all the smiles on VASS clients makes me smile.
Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports	286954		/users/profile/377026	Gayle_D	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Hope, Happiness and Encouragement!Four years ago, my son Matthew (20) was diagnosed with a life threatening rare form of cancer and also a traumatic brain injury. He was hospitalized for 40 days, underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. He was told he would most likely never ski again. After Matt's first season with Vermont Adaptive, he gained the confidence, self-esteem and physical strength to not only get back on skis, but to be skiing intermediate terrain! The best part was that i was able to ski with him and learn how to ski with him again. The best part...these skills transferred to him being able to go back to college (he's now a 2nd semester student at Saint Michael's College), writing and publishing a book 'My Cancer Card' and being cancer free for 3 years!Last year, I decided that I would become a volunteer ski instructor through Vermont Adaptive. I wanted to give another parent and young adult that same hope, happiness and encouragement that Vermont Adaptive gave me and my son. 
Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports	286953		/users/profile/377025	Beth_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I Give to Pay It ForwardI got my first pair of skis when I was three years old but I didnt fall in love with the mountains until many years later when I learned how to parallel ski. A ski instructor patiently worked with me all day until I had the technique down but she did more than just teach me about skiing. She shared her love of the mountains with me and it's turned into a lifelong passion.  Now, I volunteer every weekend with Vermont Adaptive Ski & Sports. I volunteer to share my love of the mountains with other people who may not otherwise have the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors.  Theres something spectacular about bringing someone to the top of a mountain and watching them ski down when they thought that they would never be able to ski because of a disability.  If youre not a skier, you may not understand the sense of freedom that it provides. Helping people feel that freedom is one of the many reasons way I volunteer.  However, my favorite thing about Vermont Adaptive is that they never turn anyone away. I give my time, talent, and treasure so that Vermont Adaptive can continue to offer recreational opportunities to anyone no matter their circumstances. I give to pay it forward.http://www.vermontadaptive.org/

Heritance	529	5	/users/profile/822	Heather	Client Served	5	01/15/2008	The Missisquoi Museum, a small non-profit organization in the Eastern Townships of Quebec, first encountered Heritance in late 2006. The Heritance team were described to us a "museologists without borders". As we have been struggling for years with falling attendance, a lack of focus and direction, and a decline in energy and enthusiasm we felt that perhaps having wise council from an exterior point of view would be helpful. Little did we know after our first meeting with their director Maureen Doyle what amazing changes were in store for us. Our first workshop involved not only the staff and board of directors of the historical society but also museum professionals, similar organizations and key representatives from the community. Discussions were thought provoking and encouraging. Heritance guided the process with clairity, humour and an understanding of how small museums and small communities work. The result from this first workshop was a renewed interest in the museum's future as a potential regional museum. We started to see the potential that the Heritance team could see in us. Work began immediately on a strategic plan, a mission statement, thoughts on partnering with other organizations, an education programme and a clearer approach to how we want to see our museum in the community and in the future. The advice and guidance from Heritance has been priceless. The team of professionals are intelligent,approachable and committed to their projects. Our continued connection to them means that we are moving in a postive direction and with a sense that we are not alone.

Heritance	518	4	/users/profile/730	Camilo	Client Served	5	12/17/2007	My name is Camilo Sanchez and I'm chief of exhibition design at Maloka, a science centre in Bogota, Colombia. After 9 years of operation, Maloka is working at the moment on the construction of a second phase. Although the original plans for that new development were drawn 5 years ago, the needs of the organization have changed over the years and that old plan is not exactly what we are looking for today. In June we asked Heritance to give us a hand in the construction of a program for the musicological development of the second phase. A month ago, Heritance visited us for 10 days in Bogot. As a result of an inspiring workshop, we created a team devoted to the definition of the program and the concepts that will be the basis of this new development. Heritance made us rethink and reformulate the basic ideas behind the transmition of scientific knowledge to our visitors and gave us lights and new ideas on how to approach the design of Maloka II. Have not been for Heritance, we would still be working on the ideas of the old project. They made us stop and THINK, and that is just priceless!!. After the workshop we kept on working here at Maloka and we regularly communicate with Heritance through the Internet. It is amazing how they keep track of the seed they planted in our minds. WONDERFUL!!!
Heritance	517	4	/users/profile/724	jean@heritance.org	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/16/2007	Hello,My name is Jean Bermon, I' m a french architect traveling right now in the Chiapas (Mexico) for Heritance. Here is an overview of  my work with the Museum of Costumes funded in San Cristobal by Sergio Castro, an agricultural engineer, dedicated to Indians community.The principal goal of the museum is to introduce the public (principally foreigners) to the diversity of contemporary Mayan culture. The museum also raises money for projects in public health (clean water) and education (school construction). The museum possesses a 100 traditional formal and daily outfits coming from different communities in Chiapas. It is unique because typically all clothing is buried with the dead along with all of their personal possessions. The museum also has the following objects in its collection: masks, jewelry, musical instruments, statues, religious objects.. The collection has always been kept in a rented space because the museum lacks the funds to buy a space. For this reason, the collection has never been placed on exhibit.Because of the precarity of the museum , Heritance proposes the following intervention:- protect and facilitate the long-term conservation of costumes, which are currently exposed to numerous destructive agents: light, touch, chemicals, bacteria (especially the plant-based fabrics from the Lacandon community).- to create an exhibit and furthermore make it compatible with traveling exhibits and long-term storage (display w/ light, labels & adequate in all respects for long-term storage)- to create a self-guided visit to increase the number of visits possible to the collection.Some other people I met here are very supportive: Christiane, a member of the french association taking care of the projects funding. Nadia and Fabien, a couple living in San Cristobal, involve in many social projects.After six days of work together, we have been able to achieve our goals: to  write the synopsis of a new program for the better presentation of the artifacts. to draw the outline of a new display. to collect the informations in order to have this display realized on place. to ensure a long distance relationship through basecamp, our working site on the Internet.This is just the beginning of a wonderful experience we wish to share with you.

From day care to my daughters physical therapy, we have been supported and treated with such high respect. My teachers, Heidi Daub and Tammy Cabezola, have helped me regain confidence in myself. When I think about all that this program has brought to myself and others, I am overwhelmed with pride.

This board has created a hostile environment for the staff, who are dedicated and committed to serving children and families. Something should be done to hold boards accountable for the damage they cause to a nonprofit.
Emerge-Family Advocates	205428	1	/users/profile/267595	SophieP	General Member of the Public	1	07/08/2014	I understand Emerge has had some of their funding cut off or frozen due to ongoing complaints and a lack of compliance with the provisionsgoverningca charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code.
Emerge-Family Advocates	86026		/users/profile/96159	maryann.devins	Client Served	5	04/16/2011	I believe that Emerge Family Advocates is a vital service to the upper valley.  They are very friendly and helpful to their clients.  I have never had a negative experience no matter who was involved with the exchanges.  I attended exchanges with my son and his daughter and was very impressed with the facility, the atmosphere and the personnel.  They were very knowledgeable.  
Emerge-Family Advocates	85822		/users/profile/95872	Muriel F.	Board Member	5	04/14/2011	I knew of Emerge from my longtime friend and founder of Emerge, Mona Russell. I was looking for a non-profit to support with my time and efforts following my retirement, so I chose Emerge.  Mona has been the driving force behind Emerge, even when waylaid by a serious automobile accident for months.  I have put a couple newsletters together for Emerge, and we make sure we let people know, "It's all about the children".  I feel Emerge does so much to promote stress-free child exchanges, strives to educate parents in social skills, and helps to increase realization that innocent children need their help and cooperation for a chance at a better life.  I am constantly impressed with how much Emerge and Mona accomplish with so little resources.  They deserve all the help they can get so they can make the childrens' lives better.
Emerge-Family Advocates	85794		/users/profile/95832	Robin	Client Served	5	04/14/2011	Emerge was not only helpful when it came to being a new parent displaced from my daughter, but also provided extensive literature on everything from helping children to helping myself. The staff there was always more than helpful when it came to problems or disputes, and always remained professional, even in the worst of disputes.  Emerge has helped me, and my daughter more than I can describe, and it is my hope that many others can be helped the same way.  
Emerge-Family Advocates	85766		/users/profile/95792	Janet Potter	Volunteer	5	04/14/2011	As a volunteer at Emerge Family Advocates, I supervised visits between non-residential parents and their children.  I also helped facilitate exchanges of children between parents, so that feuding parents did not have any contact with each other--a critical service for safety of victims and children in cases where there had been domestic violence.  While I volunteered at this agency, I was able to see first hand just how many families needed and used the services on a daily basis, and also how short funding was for this very important program.  I was also able to see children light up upon seeing their parents, and getting one on one time with their parents.  Many of the children made cards and paintings thanking staff and volunteers, and these wonderful thank you's line the front office where staff work on case management with families on a daily basis-- certainly a nice reminder of why the work that they do is so vital!
American Theatre Works Inc	29287	4	/users/profile/30316	jake1	Board Member	4	02/19/2010	My wife and I have been attending summer productions since the late 90's, and I am now a board member and involved in hiring our artistic director and her staff and in raising money to support this wonderful asset to the Dorset/ Manchester community. The productions are varied, ranging from the hilarious to the thought provoking and from classics to new plays. We are very fortunate to have a professional theater of this quality in our town and to have the visionary and energetic leadership of Dina Janis, our artistic director.
American Theatre Works Inc	29232	8	/users/profile/30263	emilyvtnyc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/19/2010	I have been an actress, patron, volunteer usher, and assistant house manager at DTF between 1993-2002.  The theatre played an invaluable role in my young life.  The productions are always highly professional, staging a wonderful mixture of old favorites and nurturing new works.  The children's programming has had many incarnations, but as a young adult growing up in a small town, it was the outreach of the late 90's that has had the most lasting impact in my life.

Pagan Alliance Church Incorporated	81213		/users/profile/88811	Christine Krauss	Board Member	5	03/04/2011	The Pagan Alliance church is a non profit agency. This organization prides itself on helping people in the community to become spiritually connected with the universe, and in doing so, these people will be interconnected in a manner that will set the stage for world peace. We need more groups like the Pagan Alliance. World peace starts from within the individual and the Pagan Alliance give people  the hope and the strength to work together. We are all a part of what holds this universe together.  The Pagan Alliance church is the one organization that helps feed the homeless, it  raises money for the animal shelter and toy for tots etc. it is a orginization that this society needs.

Pagan Alliance Church Incorporated	80476		/users/profile/87846	CindyH	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	The Pagan Alliance Church is a wonderful gathering of great, knowledgable, respectable people who work very hard at assisting other's with spiritual guidance, sharing knowledge many seek to find along their path in life and completely represents what the word 'Alliance' means.  They take their time, on a volunteer basis, to bring people together as a union which forms the great, caring family it has become.  Attending many of the ceremonies and rituals for the Sabbats and Esbats, the Pagan Alliance Church has created such great care in bringing people together as one; with no judgement towards anyone or harm to anyone in any way.  They bring about the brighter and better ways in life which is so important within the Pagan community.  The Pagan Alliance Church has shown everyone such pride with what they share with other's, proving that each individual is ever so wise, knowlegable, talented and beautiful in their own ways; their inner selves, giving them more pride and respect for the Pagan lifepath they live.  I truly respect and honor the extremely enriched special gifts the Pagan Alliance Church has given to their members, the public and so much more.The personal time, consideration and appreciation the Pagan Alliance Church has given to so many in the public; without ever asking for anything in return, is a true blessing in itself; and the Pagan Alliance Church, with all they do, are well worth so much consideration for all to appreciate, respect and honor; which I honorably give this to them.  This experience has been a blessing in my life and I can't thank them enough for all they have done and all they continue to do.Blessed Be!Lady Linden

Black River Action Team	51786	1	/users/profile/52529	mpaton61	Volunteer	5	09/04/2010	We are a group of small communities. As a whole we care about all aspects of the life in Vermont. The rivers provide some of the most important visual and recreational lifelines that connect us all. From snow covered rocks and bridges to the cool refreshing waterfalls of summer to the kayaking and fishing to the actual water source our rivers are a mainstay of the Vermont land scape and our futures. When we can pull together even in the smallest way to keep the health of the rivers going. It is a personal shot in the arm and makes the rivers even more personal. I have been proud to help Kelly and her amazing efforts even if it has been minimal. I usually volunteer with corporate type fund raisers put on by professional folks with thousands of participants. To compare the love and emotion that goes into the events Kelly Stetter puts together for the rivers well, I just can't. When all the hoopla of the big events are over, it is the river I go home to and relax. I think of Kelly.
Black River Action Team	51778	3	/users/profile/52513	sue28	Volunteer	4	09/04/2010	This group is the brainchild and lead by an incredibly energetic, resourceful and well informed woman, a true environmental and river advocate.  Because of these virtues she attracts like minded and energetic individuals who somehow are able to get many of the projects done.  There are many educational opportunities to not only take advantage of but also to give!  For those that are more attracted to the physical side of things, there are plenty of opportunities to aid the welfare of the river by hiking, kayaking, observing and recording for geomorphological surveys, BRAT surveys/studies/observations and also enjoying the fellowship of other fellow BRATs on team outings or functions.  There are no formal meetings but we are well informed via email and the blogsite about what is going on, what needs to be done/opportunities and there is always the request for out input.  How can this get better??

These hands on programs are extrmely popular and generate lots of excitement amongst the participants.  Most importantly, Kelly instills a feeling of stewardship for the river in the kids that will last a lifetime.
Black River Action Team	51717	3	/users/profile/52449	blackriverbrat	Board Member	5	09/03/2010	Walking over a bridge in 2000, I looked down into the water to discover shopping carts, tires and litter staring back up at me. I was disgusted; "Somebody ought to DO something about that!" I remember scoffing. My husband elbowed me and replied, "Well, YOU'RE 'somebody.'" And so began the first annual RiverSweep, an ongoing event to keep the Black River clear of trash of all kinds. Volunteers of all ages join the effort in a variety of towns throughout the watershed, and area businesses support our work with donations of goods, services and cash.Over the years, I've learned much more about what it takes to keep a river running in good condition. I do regular Bug Hunts, looking for aquatic macroinvertebrates that live on the bottom of the river and the streams that feed it. I conduct workshops on Japanese knotweed, an invasive exotic plant that can have a negative effect on river banks. And I am fortunate to be surrounded by volunteers who have many skills and ideas to offer, from leading paddling excursions to coordinating outreach events, from videography to mapping.We've been helping the Black River for 10 years now, and we have so many new projects that are just coming together; it's very exciting being a BRAT! I hope you'll consider joining the fun.

Meeting Waters YMCA	25821	11	/users/profile/26823	Westwest	Client Served	5	01/19/2010	My son had a great time at Lewis Day Camp.  He loved canoeing, archery, songs, swimming and games.  I was greatly impressed when we attended family night, and we were warmly greeted by several of his counselors.  The only thing my son did not like was the long bus ride from Putney to Springfield.  He had to take the bus because of our work schedule, but once he got off the bus, he was fine.  He truly had a wonderful time.  I was greatly impressed by the director, who took the time to talk with me about my son and some of his personal challenges that he had before attending the camp.  While at camp, my son was happy and well behaved.  I have to attribute this to the excellent care he received.  Thank you!

Without the Meeting Waters YMCA Aspire program, I could not work full time as a single mother.  The entire staff is wonderful and each day I pick him up, they give me a run down on his time there.  Lewis Day camp has been wonderful because no other programs offer all day care in this area.  I couldn't be happier with the level of service that myself and my son receive from Meeting Waters YMCA!  Thank you for your years of service to this community.  Keep up the good work!
Meeting Waters YMCA	25688	7	/users/profile/26706	rebwax	Client Served	4	01/15/2010	My daughter began attending ASPIRE when I started working full time during her first year of elementary school.  It was an anxious time for her and all the big changes in our routine were overwhelming.  From the very first day, the wonderful ASPIRE staff made her feel comfortable and welcomed.  In just weeks, my daughter was gushing about ASPIRE and missing it when she wasn't there - she still feels that way a year later.  In that cozy room she gets to interact with students of all ages (an experience that has connected her more to her school at large), explore themes, books and projects that are engaging and meaningful, and further develop the social and physical skills that she is so excited about right now.  I cannot thank the ASPIRE team enough for their friendly, creative and responsible care of children.  Meeting Waters YMCA  provides valuable support to my daughter and, therefore, to our whole family.

The practices of this Agency are corrupt and profit based. This Agency attacked me personally in order to gain control of a $246,000 medicaid waiver which they squandered. My advise to anyone receiving services from such an agency is to request and review you records monthly.  Many lies are told and become part of your mental health record. Funding is their priority. Workers have very few real credentials. This is a very bad, corrupt Agency
Kenya Self-Help Project	124037	1	/users/profile/168833	Polly Connell	Donor	5	10/01/2012	I have had the good fortune to be one of the original donors to the Kenya Self-Help Project beginning back in 2005.  Let me say that if anyone is looking for a way to make a difference in the future of a young person living in the developing world, they need look no further than this organization.  First of all, all monies go directly to the education of one's sponsored student.  As the sponsor, you become an integral part of the life of your student.  Letters to sponsors are required at least four times a year.  You will also receive all grade reports of your student including photos from time to time.  I truly have come to see my student as a  friend.  We've come to know one another's families and ways of life.  I am proud to say that my dear Winny is now in her third year at Nairobi University studying for a degree in media studies/journalism.  As part of her program of studies she is involved in community service work in her hometown.  This continues to be a requirement of KSHP as long as the sponsored students are in school as a way of giving back for all they have received.  No question but that your donation will be well used! 
Kenya Self-Help Project	122148	1	/users/profile/166311	zembazooz	Donor	5	09/10/2012	I have had the pleasure of knowing the Kenya Self Help Project(KSHP) for almost five years.  KSHP truly stands out for its excellence above other Non-Profits.  In my professional experiences, I have consulted with large US based Non-profits, raised funds for several organizations, managed the distribution of funds to approved non-profits, served on non-profit boards, volunteered for non-profits and donated to several causes.   In all of my experiences over 30 years, KSHP stands above the rest of the organizations in the following ways: 1. Direct accountability of funds received and expended.  2. Ongoing communication of projects, people and programs in Kenya. 3. Fostering an ongoing communication between sponsors/donors and the children they sponsor. 4. Detailed quarterly information by individual program and child regarding the progress of sponsored children including grade transcripts, awards and letters.  5. An approach of partnership with locals in Kenya to achieve results and implement programs as opposed to a capitalist based US model of investment from afar.  6. An active and accountable Board of Directors who are involved in day to day issues and have a true passion and love for the programs, the sponsored kids and families, the village of Kendu Bay and the donors.   Through KSHP I know the lives that are being touched in Kenya and my life if being changed in the US through the great work of this non-profit.  I continue to be amazed at the level of professionalism, respect, detail and love that the board and the entire organization operates with.  This organization deserves to be recognized for the lives it is touching and it should be bench marked against for how to manage, report and communicate between donors and sponsored children. KSHP is truly a leading Non-Profit in all aspects!

FRANKLIN COUNTY HOME HEALTH AGENCY INC	90129		/users/profile/102717	Jennifer	General Member of the Public	4	06/09/2011	Franklin County Home Health Agency has played an important role in  both my personal and professional development.  I first became aware of the concept of home health as a small child when my grandmother was a member of the local home health council.  This group loaned equipment such as wheelchairs, hospital beds, canes etc. to local residents recovering or living with illness at home.  My next encounter was as a teenager, when my grandfather had a stroke and needed total care.  My grandmother made the decision to provide his care at home.  With the help of home health, she was able to successfully care for him for seven years.   The services of home health not only helped my grandmother care for him, but for those seven years, my grandfather had the best quality of life that he could have given his significant health issues.  When he died his long time home health aide was with him and this gave my grandmother great comfort.  Fast forward many years later,  as an adult I have helped my family members and friends obtain home care and hospice services.  As we have tried to navigate a very complex health system, home health as always supported us through every step of the process.  Because of these experience , I developed a passion for home health and decided to make home health my career.  I was drawn to the concept as a young child driving the loaner wheelchairs around my grandmother's house and this connection has had a lasting effect on me.  So, when I had the opportunity to apply for a job with home health, I pursued it and obtained it.  Although I am not a caregiver, in my role as the Manager of Human Resources, I have the opportunity to indirectly support our client's every day.  By hiring the right staff, having the right policies in place and helping the managers lead our teams, I can make a difference in our client's lives, just as home health has made a difference in my life.

It is hard seeing a family member in this situation, but Franklin County Home Health sure made it easier with there caring nature and response to this situation.
VERMONT WORKS FOR WOMEN INC	19345	1	/users/profile/20572	MDH	Board Member	5	10/22/2009	As a proud former board member and chair, I would like to share my admiration and respect for this organization. The staff at Vermont Works for Women is incredibly professional, caring, and smart. The programs they deliver for women and girls are outstanding and the outcomes are impressive. I remember attending a training program graduation at the Dale Correctional Facility for Women several years ago. The lump in my throat grew as I listened to a father pour out his gratitude to VWW for providing his daughter (an incarcerated woman at the end of her sentence) with real job skills, encouragement and support. He thanked VWW for giving her the chance after many years of failure, to be successful at something! He told the audience that he was confident that she would find a good job and be able to support herself. I will never forget that day!

VWW is a bright star in the darkness for many women who don't know where to turn for workforce skills.

We especially appreciated it as we were first time pet owners. Our cat  Lilly has filled our lives with love and delight and we are thankful to AAUPH for it.
Angels Among Us Pet Hostel, Inc.	51078	4	/users/profile/51661	elizoneill	Client Served	5	08/26/2010	I was displaced by a small stove fire that caused alot of smoke damage and needed to stay in a hotel while my apartment was being fixed. A friend had given me an Angels Among Us business card so i thought it would be worth getting a hold of them as most hotels in my area dont allow pets. I think it took a day for Barbara to come and get my 2 cats (we had to sechudal a pick up time) and she was extremely friends, and we keep in contact via email on how they are doing. She has set up a vet appoinment to fix my male cat and i am sure it lowered the stress level of Sami and Cullen.  I am greatly appricated that they had a safe enviorment to go to where they have been well taken care of.

The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient. I was completely devastated when my workshop burned down. I lost my tools, lumber and livelihood.  A friend and longtime donor recommended CERF+. I figured I'd give it a shot.   I contacted them and "Les" helped me through the application process. He was kind and understanding.  Within a few days I received a letter of acceptance.  They gave me a very generous grant to rebuild. They even gave me a nice drill that was donated to them!  Along with the grant Les offered extremely valuable information and resources to aid in my recovery. I will refer to the information regularly as I rebuild my career.  Absolutely fantastic experience and service.  THANK YOU CERF+

CERF+ provided not only funds to help our craft community recover, but grew another leg due to the organizations determination to respond even more powerfully in the future.   I became a board member in 2011, and thoroughly enjoy all facets of participation on this board.  We continue to increase grant and loan funding levels as well as promote emergency preparedness with a very unique focus on the needs and lifestyles of craft artists and their careers.  Our effectiveness is ever-strengthened by the continual-improvement ethos that the staff, our director, and board members cultivate and nurture.

WAR LEGACIES PROJECT INC	195692		/users/profile/255890	BMWIreland	Donor	5	03/16/2014	A friend introduced me to WLP, I read of the great work they do.  On a visit to Vietnam,  I got to see first hand many of the programs they run.  What impressed me the most is how you can see your small donation directly impact the lives of those whom WLP help.  WLP is a small organization but with a strong goal and purpose to help improve the lives of all those affected by Agent Orange. Their programs help individuals, families, and small rehabilitation facilities,  helping all those affected by Agent Orange.  They work closely with local groups to help minimize the access to the areas which are still (toxic areas) by working on the Green fence program.  They help children get the needed prosthetic legs and arms, and follow them as they grow to help them have as normal a life as possible.  Their programs, to name but a few, range from getting wheelchairs to those in rural Vietnam. Getting funds needed to help families set up a sustainable business or farm successfully with the donations of cows, pigs, etc, plus many, more. I would recommend anyone who has an interest in helping those affected by war, agent orange, or just an interest in helping children to check out the web site and talk to the director.  http://www.warlegacies.org A very good friend of mine after speaking with the director, and understanding the organization, asked her wedding guests to give a donation to WLP in lieu of gifts. Each guest got to select the program they wished their donation to go to, it was a wonderful idea that enriched the lives of many.

While there are many terrific organizations devoted to land conservation, no other that I know of has an exclusive focus on holding wildlands in fee or under easement. With a very small skilled staff and a dedicated board, it is increasing the presence of such lands in New England and building substantial funds to maintain them in perpetuity. 
Puppets In Education Inc	150944		/users/profile/201324	marykdennison	Board Member	5	03/12/2013	I originally got involved with Puppets in Education when my now 27 year old daughter was in Kindergarten! I was amazed by the questions her classmates (and their parents!) asked. I remember sitting on a bus during a field trip when another mother asked me if my daughter, who used a walker, ever liked to go to birthday parties. (I was inwardly surprised by the query. I mean, what child doesn't?)  My daughter was my original inspiration but as I worked for and with Puppets in Education, I heard many such stories. The most powerful one I heard was from one of our high school volunteer puppeteers. When asked about her motivation  for getting involved with the group, her response was, "I was in grade school when I first heard the puppet, Joanne, talking about an incident of sexual abuse that happened to her. I, as well as my best friend, had had the same kinds of experiences the puppet was talking about and we just thought that's what happened to kids. It wasn't until the puppet presentation at my school that I realized my experience wasn't what was SUPPOSED to happen to children." After many years of therapy, here was a young woman courageous enough to share her story with others and help other children learn what she had from the puppets.  These puppets are powerful and change children's lives! 
Puppets In Education Inc	37256	1	/users/profile/37988	katherine-dumerston	Client Served	5	04/28/2010	The presentations Kids on the Block-VT now Puppets in Education did for my child's school changed his life. He was so awestruck with the puppets and how they were able to communicate his own struggles allowed a new empathy to take hold with his class. His classmates now want to talk to him about his condition of living in a wheelchair and they don't fear the difference. He is now invited to birthday parties and he is happier than ever! Thank you Puppets.

Both Namaya and I have worked internally in health and community development since the 1970s. We started GRACE Cares as we wanted to find a way to help local heroes; that is, people who want to help their communities by helping to get water, housing,  healthcare, food or education for their community. We have since provided technical and financial assistance to over a dozen projects in Asia, Africa, Middle East and Latin America. We have no paid staff, just have a consulting book keeper, we are run by volunteers and have intern positions. So you can be sure your funds will be used for our projects and our local heroes make sure your funds will be used wisely. Visit www.gracecares.org to find out more!Yours,Zoe Kopp

Committee on Temporary Shelter	24245	2	/users/profile/25346	scottyone2@hotmail.com	Volunteer	5	12/16/2009	Volunteering with the COTS Literacy program has been a truly wonderful experience. I volunteered with COTS almost 10 years ago and then moved away from the area. I am now back in Burlington and found my way at COTS for a second time. COTS is an organization that is absolutely mission driven which is evident in the staff, the programs offered, and the clients. Working with primary school children to develop literacy and a love for books is amazing. The children are so excited when I get there each week and often run to their rooms to get their reading name tags. They love listening to me read AND really enjoy me listening to them read. They are exicted to hear feedback from me and even welcome me correcting pronunciation of words. When I read, the children often climb up on the couch and snuggle into my arm or lay on my lap to listen. It is clear they enjoy the time and that they take so much from the hour we spend together.Each Monday I look forward to heading to Main Street to see the children and to bring them the books I've chosen from the Library that week. We each choose 2 books we want to read and off we go. The children laugh at funny parts, ask questions about pictures, count items they see on the page, and try to mimick their school teachers when they read to me. I, on the other hand, smile when I see them, laugh with them at funny parts, ask them questions about the pictures, and give out high fives when they finish their reading! It's only an hour each Monday and it is great, but it never feels like enough time.
Committee on Temporary Shelter	24173	3	/users/profile/25278	share/care	Volunteer	5	12/16/2009	COTS provides both food and shelter, sustanence and safety to many folks who live in Burlington,VT. It is so easy to become a volunteer for this organization and then to stay with it because of all of the wonderful things it does for this community's needy.In addition to housing and warmth, it provides ways for people to stay in their current housing situation by providing financial help and counselling, it helps provide clothing and food as well.  Our caseworkers are the best.  Each week I see extreme kindness being shown to COTS clients along with genuine respect for each individual coming through the door.COTS has wonderful fund raisers throughout the year that volunteers can help out and become an integral part of the process such as a huge annual springtime walk involving thousands of Burlington's residents, taking them on a guided tour of all of the shelters around the city.  We also hold a phonathon contacting COTS supporters by phone asking for pledges.  This raises a great deal of money for the organization.  Currently, a local store, City Market, is selling Christmas trees with the proceeds going to COTS.  Coming up is a now annual event called  The Coolest Lunch in Town, with local restaurants providing food for a noontime meal and the proceeds also go to COTS.  The clincher in this one is that the meals must be eaten outside, in the same conditions that many homeless people bear all winter long unless they come to COTS.
Hilltop Montessori School Inc	283976		/users/profile/373986	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	03/29/2016	This school was one of the most terribly run schools I have ever seen.  My daughter went there for 1.5 year in preschool and was routinely picked on and beaten by several boys in her class. One of which was a teachers child. My wife would arrive to pick up our daughter and would witness these two boys tormenting her, while teachers stood around chatting among themselves and not paying attention, until my wife would run across the school yard and deal with the situations personally.  Examples of witnessed attacks:1)  Boy chased my daughter in the snow, pushed her to the ground, jumping on her back and repeatedly and forcefully pushing her face into the snow while my daughter is crying for him to stop.2)  Two boys chasing my daughter into an playhouse enclosure in the playground and one of them punching her in the face, splitting her lip.3)  My daughter bends down in class to pick up a pencil she dropped and one of these boys, walked by and kicked her in the face/head (witnessed by a teacher)4)  My daughter was playing by herself in the sandbox and one of these boys fills a large bucket with sand and purposely dumps it on my daughters head5)  My wife arrives to pick up my daughter, who has a split lip.  Teacher informs us that one of these boys simply punched her in the face.My daughter consistently had nightmares and cried to not go back to school (understandably). We repeatedly demanded action to be taken against these boys; however, nothing was ever done. The schools position on it 1)  My daughter should learn to be more assertive and let these boys know that she doesn't appreciate their behavior. Essentially, it seems like their position that it is a girls fault if she is raped.2)  She should alert a teacher any time something like this occurs rather than teachers should be paying attention to their students so situations like this don't have a chance to occur.3)  Boys and girls express their emotions differently and the boys simply needs to learn how to better express his emotions in a more healthy manner.  He was given 'time-outs' to consider his behavior.  He wasn't expelled, suspended or reprimanded in any meaningful way.4)  Principle stated to my wife, after she detailed an eye witness account of one of these attacks..."we spoke with the boy and he says that the situation wasn't as it seemed"  Essentially, taking the word of a 4yr old boy over my wife who saw the whole scene and that my wife misinterpreted what she saw, when he punched my daughter in the face.End of the day, this school not only didn't address a significant bullying situation in their pre-school classes; but seemed to defend the bullies (again, one of them being a teachers son).  No disciplinary action was ever taken against the boys, we pulled our daughter from the school and it is my belief that this school forever altered my daughters once outgoing personality and her passion for school and learning.

I have volunteered for an organization called KMRIA, Inc. KMRIA, Inc., under the direction of Dr. Donald McGee, is now in its 15th year of operation as a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational corporation and has tutored 305 children (k-14) who have been classified as 'drop-outs' from our public schools. The firm uses the PLATO (K-14) in all academic subjects, Ripple Effects for psychological needs and Rosetta Stone (in 9 foreign languages) for instruction. KMRIA is in operation in the New England states and in New York, New Jersey, and Texas. Their international contacts include Germany, Great Britain, and the Philippines. However, their access to contact with other teachers and students in foreign countries is an ongoing process that may take several years to complete. Alliances with the public libraries, schools, and most importantly, with the teachers and children, are vital aspects to making their mission successful. What they need is financing for the purchase of computers which will enable their students to connect with diverse people and cultures throughout the world. The age of communication truly is here, and we can invest in teaching the children of tomorrow the use of our inventions to bring about a peaceful, wholesome world. Thank you

The truth is, they are after capturing as much of the market as they can, discouraging patient choice.

The providers have to fill out a form to explain any referral anywhere else. FAHC is narcissistic at its core.

Receptor Pharmacology Unit, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America. BIOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONSAs depression predisposes to Alzheimers disease, it is not surprising that antidepressants are capable of preventing, alleviating and arresting the disorder. Excessive synthesis of prostaglandin E2 generates amyloid, and such non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as aspirin and ibuprofen, as well as antidepressants, inhibit prostaglandin E2. Two epidemiological studies have shown that ibuprofen (Motrin), that inhibit prostaglandin E2, can delay the onset of Parkinsons disease, a neurodegenerative disorder closely related to Alzheimers. Antidepressants offer great advantages, and few disadvantages, in addressing Alzheimers,  recently referred to as the coming tsunami, but you would not think so, given the lack of enthusiasm of Alzheimers organizations  and health policy makers, when notified of this innovation. One suspects that conflicts of interest, and the low cost of generic antidepressants, are the root causes of the neglect.   The right to the highest attainable standard of health is codified in numerous legally binding international and regional human rights treaties. The right, or other health-related rights, is also enshrined in over 100 constitutions worldwide. Article19 of the universal declaration of human rights.	Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.Many additional references in Pubmed.For educational purposes only.Julian Lieb, M.DRetired, Yale medical school professordrjulianlieb@gmail.com------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Available in 1990, will not be imitated, permanent damage to society.               
Educational Praxis Inc	128977		/users/profile/174292	PI2001	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	Over the years, my work with Educational Praxis transformed from, initially, a 6-month practicum for a graduate school requirement, into a life-long commitment to the work and the organization itself. For more than 10 years, members of Praxis, all of whom are volunteers, provide the best examples of concrete and visionary work in their local communities in the US , India and many other countries.  Through their daily work as outstanding educators, leaders in various events and fearless advocates for the poor and oppressed, my colleagues has had a great impact on the communities in India, Tanzania, China, Japan and the U.S. In spite of everyones busy schedules they devote a tremendous amount of their personal time and financial means to the Praxis work. They believe that our task as learners, teachers and just human beings is to support and strengthen the best of human experience and actively oppose its worst actions. I believe that their work for Praxis is the best example.

Ascutney Mountain Audubon Society	50755	8	/users/profile/51322	melly	Volunteer	5	08/20/2010	For a relatively small organization, the Ascutney Mountain Audubon Society (AMAS)has some amazing accomplishments to its credit. It engages in all fo the typical activities of Audubon groups, including educational programs and field trips. But two points of focus really stand out:1) More than 10 years ago AMAS held the first Herricks Cove Wildlife Festival in partnership with TransCanada, Inc. to call public attention to the natural values of Herricks Cove, a state Important Bird Area. The response was so positive that it has continued the festival annually (in May) since then. The one-day event now draws 1,500 people or more.2) Perhaps 20 years ago AMAS learned of a great blue heron rookery on private land that deserved protection. Working with the landowners, AMAS successfully petitioned the VT Water Resouces Board for enhanced protection under the state's wetlands law. Later, noticing that the trees supporting the colony, which were in a beaver pond, where dying, AMAS experimented with artificial nesting structures of its own design as substitutes for the trees. Today the colony is thriving even though all of the trees have died and fallen, with 6 to 8 nests per year on these artificial structures.

I started to follow these horses and their rehab process.  The love and energy support that Gina gives these animals is amazing.  Her heart is huge and without her there would be a lot of animals out there with salvation.  It is important that each animal has food, water and love.   Horses are beautiful beings and many people don't understand or realize the work it takes to care for them.   Gina's goal is to rehome most of the horses, but she can't just give them to anyone and is very careful to screen anyone interested in adoption of the horses/animals.Many blessings to Gina and the animals lives that she has changed.

Family Garden	288615		/users/profile/378815	GrannieSays	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/05/2016	As a grandmother familiar with The Family Garden (several children attended), I know the staff and program to be top notch for early education for developmental as well as social skills and learning.  The program is geared to individual needs at any particular time/phase of growth and the staff very loving, kind, attentive, professional as well as firm when correcting, re-directing or responding to unwise choices of the childrren.  The family-style approach of having multiple ages in one group has been quite beneficial from my point of view.  The Family Garden cares for the very young (from 6 weeks)  up to kindergarten transition (5 years).  It has been a wonderful place for children to grow and learn to be part of a "friends" community, to learn their strengths and ways of sharing, cooperating and expressing themselves both verbally and creatively.  The Family Garden is an excellent early learning environment for children.
Tree Farm Management Group	299539		/users/profile/390454	steevie	General Member of the Public	5	08/07/2016	Good morning.  As an Essex Junction resident, not only do I enjoy using the Tree Farm recreational paths to walk my dog, but I also enjoy the many times that I have watched my nieces and nephews playing their various sports on your grounds.  As a 78 year old woman who walks the pat several times a week, I feel safe walking their alone.  However, the last two Sundays and I and my 11 lb. min poodle were walking around 10 A.M. I encountered two, what I thought were runaway dogs.  Both the large white dog and the smaller dog attacked me down to the ground and tried to attack my dog.  I'm sure their intentions were to play, but because I did not know these dogs, I was petefried.  In addition, an elderly man, who could not speak english  and who was pushing a toddler in a stroller, was also very frightened when the dogs approach them. He just stood there frozen. I soon realized that the dogs belonged to one of the parks' employees who was working at the tree farm.  This Sunday, after the dogs once came out of the blue and tried to attack me and my dog,  I approached him who I believed was the owner of the dogs,  and told him what happened last week, and again this week, and asked why his dogs were not on a leach.  He immediately said that the park is a privately owned par, which I did not know, I thought it was owned by Essex, another lesson.  And, it was not necessary for his dogs to be on a leach, and if I wanted to let mine run loose he did not care. I believe that there is a leach law in Essex Junction, in any event, if not on a leach, at least under control.  These dogs were neither.  I want to continue to enjoy the park, and now that I know this is managed by volunteers, please let me know where I can send my contribution to help support this beautiful recreational area.  I would appreciate it though, if the gentleman who owns the dogs, keep them on a leach, as I do mine.   Pat Allard.  
Selamta Family Project Inc	286565		/users/profile/376635	Maya_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I Give So Ethiopian Children Can Stay ChildrenHelp! Help! Maya, help! No, I was not involved in some elaborate rescue, nor was anyone in any true trouble. These cries, shouted by 90 children, were about their need to find the perfect Lego for their separate masterpieces. I was in Ethiopia volunteering at the Selamta Family Project, a nonprofit that unites marginalized women and orphaned children to create forever families. Selamta had received a large donation from Lego and I had arrived in Addis Ababa with three duffel bags stuffed with Lego bricks, Lego heads, and Lego bodies. As a volunteer, I was there to organize and run extracurricular activities for the children during their summer school break. The flurry of Amharic words, of which I knew very few, didn't stop me from falling in love. I fell in love with the children, with their curiosity, intensity, and constant affection. I fell in love with the way they yelled my name and the way they smiled when we couldnt understand each other. I fell in love with their homes tucked away on cobblestone streets and their moms who welcomed me into these homes with hugs and the smells of injera and coffee. The children sensed my love and taught me to say Ewodihalehu in Amharic, I love you in English. The AIDS virus had once orphaned these children by taking their parents, and many were left to fend for themselves on the streets before being brought to Selamta. Their new Selamta moms were once marginalized by society, often the result of them being child brides. Before Selamta, these women and children didnt know where they would get their next meal or where they could spend a night in safety. Selamta gave them a second chance at life and a new loving family. On the day I had to leave to go back to the U.S., Fasika, age 8, sat by the taxi that was to take me back to the airport. Maya, stay? he asked. Ewodihalehu. I promised him I would be back. I flew home with new energy and a desperate need to stay involved with Selamta. I quickly began fundraising and raised enough to become the sponsor for Fasika and his brother for the next two years. I contacted Selamtas Executive Director and asked for any opportunity to help. I soon began running their Instagram account, which I helped to grow to more than 2,000 followers. I then took over Twitter and Facebook and became Selamtas Social Media Coordinator. I am currently in graduate school and completing an internship at a hospital, however, my volunteer work for Selamta is what holds my heart. I give so that their cries of help! can always be in regards to Legos and other child like worries, and not about a need for clean water, clothes, or shelter. I give so their stories can be told. I give in return for what the children gave me; a new outlook on life, a deep passion for others, and a sense of fulfillment in a life that does not always allow for second chances.

BIRDS OF VERMONT MUSEUM INC	160020		/users/profile/212242	Spinney,	General Member of the Public	5	06/07/2013	Whether an avid birder or not you will be captivated by the almost alive carvings of Bob Spear and the nature themed artwork of many others. Watch for local birds, take a carving class, go on educational walks through the woods, or my favorite activity is to take the bird call ID pen through the museum and scan the bar codes at many of the carvings to hear the birds calls echo around you. This museum is intimate and you may even run across the carver himself as his workshop is part of the experience.

The agency's reputation for respecting birth parents was a huge draw for us initially but there came a point when the agency seemed more interested in protecting itself from possible litigation by a birth parent than in the welfare of our child, over whom they still had legal custody at that point. To say this was distressing is to vastly understates our fear for our child's safety and well-being during these several months during the adoption process.

From what I have noticed its presence in the community allows low income families and individuals to have safe and decent homes at an affordable price; which cheats homelessness really. Seniors of the communities it serves also get to have an option to be safe with other seniors in seniors apartments. I can't say much positive about this overlooked organization. I wish it had more support from the community so that it can continue doing what it does.

Funeral Consumers Alliance Inc	19575	1	/users/profile/20782	Joyce in Utah	Volunteer	5	10/24/2009	In 1994 I saw an article about a man that built a plain pine casket for his dad.  In the article a funeral director was quoted as saying, A lot of people say they want to be buried in a plain pine box, but when it comes time they end up with the standard commercial casket.  So I went online to read more about why people don't get what they want and how to I can and bam!  I found FCA [then called FAMSA] and joined.  At first I only read the literature they sent, and didnt move on to implementing what I'd learned into a funeral plan of my own, however the seed was planted.  Over the next several years I saw article after article in my local newspaper about families who needed to raise funds because they couldnt afford the funeral they bought.  Why were people buying funerals they couldnt afford when there are other options, I asked myself?  The answer was that they didnt know any other way. There was no FCA affiliate in my state. So I decided in 2000 to start an affiliate.  Then executive Director, Lisa Carlson, came out from Vermont and helped us organize.  I love her.  Now we are led by another Executive Director, just as fun, intelligent, talented and caring as Lisa.  His name is Joshua Slocum. I can't imagine volunteering for a better organization or cause than FCA.  It is as transparant, meaningful and frugal as the funerals it promotes.

Written in stone above the entrance to the Carnegie library in Oakland, Pennsylvania, it says, "Free to the People".  The Green Mountain Library Consortium and its participating libraries are taking sharing and free resources to the next level with their digital lending library, ListenUpVermont (LUV).  As a librarian at a participating library, Milton High School, it is awesome to see how and when LUV is used.  The tenacious readers now have access to almost 10,000 ebooks and audiobooks 24/7/365 from any remote spot that they hope to read.  Project Gutenburg started this revolution back in the nineties, getting as many novels digitized as possible.  Now through GMLC and the Overdrive platform digital lending and reading is a reality.  eReaders, phones, and tablets all allow for easy reading whatever your situation.  If you want a book and the brick and mortar building is closed, use LUV.  If you want a book and can't get a ride to the public library, use LUV.  If you are away on vacation and can't use the public library in the region you are in, use LUV.  Anytime, anywhere, LUV has books available for you to read.

Angkor Hospital For Children Inc	287052		/users/profile/377124	Katie_L	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I give for two reasons: because I am able to and because I know there are many people in this world suffering a great deal who need it more than I do. My grandmother taught me this lesson day in and day out when she helped raise my brother and I after our father took his own life. Through watching her example, I learned that even people with so little money can make such a difference for people in need through giving things like compassion, time, understanding and so much more.Over the years, I came to learn for myself that life is really all about circumstance and luck - luck as to where you are born, when you are born, what family or gender or ethnicity or state of health or economic level you are born into, and so on. For this reason, it is up to the people who are lucky enough to be able to give, to give to the people who are not so lucky and to remember that at any point, that could be you. This is what humanity is all about which is why I have chosen to dedicate my life to becoming a global development and aid professional. The first nonprofit I was fortunate enough to work for which led me to this lifelong path was Angkor Hospital for Children, a truly inspiring nonprofit children's hospital in Siem Reap Cambodia providing high-quality and compassionate health care to children who may not be able to receive it otherwise. Previous to this job, I was working on Shanghai's Wall Street and my life was going in a very different direction which all started to change after just one long weekend trip to visit a friend from high school living in Cambodia. I saw abject poverty for the first time and decided to move there to try and find a job at a local nonprofit. With only 1 percent of the staff at the hospital being expatriate, I am forever thankful to the Director of Development who saw something in me of value that I would be able to bring to the hospital's mission of providing free health care for all Cambodian children. That one year changed my life and redirected its course forever. After now years later being involved with many different nonprofits, I have come to value the work of the hospital even more for not only do they provide Cambodian children with quality health care regardless of their family's ability to pay, but they are focusing so much of their efforts on rebuilding the national healthcare system since its demise under the Khmer Rouge. And just this year, they handed over the reigns of the hospital to its first ever Cambodian Medical Executive Director. It continues to be a world class nonprofit children's hospital that I couldn't be more proud to support and confident that every dollar they receive is spent wisely with treating all Cambodian children as their top priority.
