Rhode Island Tutorial & Educational Services	271717	1	/users/profile/360593	kduff	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2015	I cannot say enough positive things about RITES! My first experience with RITES was through a summer program offered at Hamilton (Orton-Gillingham-based Language Arts).  My 7 year old dyslexic son made such gains in just 5 weeks that I asked his teacher, Allyson, to continue tutoring him throughout the year.  He attended RITES camp again last summer and continues to work with Allyson each week.  She is wonderful and my son continues to gain confidence and is now reading at grade level.  Having dyslexia is quite a challenge for children in elementary school and I feel very fortunate to have found such amazing help early on in my son's life. I highly recommend RITES to all those needing a little extra support!

My son, who has dyslexia, has maintained skills during the summer by attending the five-week OG program last year, and the mathematics and written expression program this past summer. He is currently having a once-a-week session with a tutor to keep him on track, as his school has dismissed him from his in-school resource help because he has done so well. My high school age daughter enjoyed the study skills workshop offered by RITES before school began. She feels she learned some great organizational skills that prepared her for 9th grade. I have recommended RITES to a number of friends for a variety of academic challenges.

Rhode Island Tutorial & Educational Services	265618		/users/profile/354354	Writer	Client Served	5	10/20/2015	RITES has been a game changer for our family. My oldest daughter is dyslexic and has continued to struggle in school and with her confidence. She went to one of the several camps offered through RITES this past summer. She had no interests in any "school" camp  and promised she would not participate, and they couldn't , make her. After day 1, she could not wait to return to camp with her new friends and teacher, in fact she was very sad when it was over. The work she produced at camp was amazing and I could not even believe how confident and proud she was to share everything with all of us. Through camp she connected with 1 of her  two current RITES tutor. She looks forward to working with her tutor every week. The academic difference is great, but the confidence they have helped her to find again is what has made the biggest difference. She believes in herself and knows she is capable of great work.  We feel so lucky to be able to work with everyone at RITES.

Our doctor referred us to RI Tutorial - thank god - and our daughter has been transformed. She is excited to read, to attempt words she doesn't know, and is so much less frustrated at school.  I'm so grateful to Lisa and her team for improving our lives.

The one on one tutoring is the most effective way to reach students.  ACT/SAT prep is beneficial to students, whose scores can increase with the one on one tutoring.

Rhode Island Tutorial & Educational Services	188314		/users/profile/245673	momsl10	Client Served	5	11/11/2013	My boys would not be where they are today if it were not for RITES.  They are confident, well adjusted,  honor roll high schoolers, who have overcome the difficulties of Dyslexia, and are now looking forward to college!  RITES has helped them not only improve academically, but also grow and mature into responsible young adults.  When I was first introduced to RITES, my children were both 2 years below grade level in reading and writing (after many years with IEP's and Special Ed support in our school system).   I had been referred to many "tutors" who were classroom teachers by day and tutors by weekend and summer.  I was not interested in this approach, since the classroom teachers had not been able to help my boys using their curriculums and I was afraid that they would take the same curriculum and feed it back to my boys.  I wanted something different and specialized - and affordable.  The staff at RITES worked with me to find a tutor who specialized in the areas that each of my son's needed.  The tutors were willing to work with the classroom teachers for the purpose of helping my boys succeed in the classroom.  Today, my boys no longer need support of a tutor on a weekly basis. Their non LD friends will actually call my boys on Sunday nights about homework assignments.  It's amazing!  The tutors at RITES were also a support system for me as a parent.  I was always included in the plans for their curriculums.  The literature in the office and the available parent workshops were very helpful to me so that I could give support from home and also become more educated and less frustrated and fearful about their LD.  Workshops and camps are also available for the students.  I will be enrolling my boys in some of them in the near future in preparation for college, like note taking and SAT prep workshops. I have recently enrolled my youngest child (11 YO) at RITES.  He does not have a documented LD, but struggles with general organization and study skills.  He doesnt know how to "study" for tests, doesn't bring notes or books home and has a hard time planning for projects.  I found that my boys with LD learned study skills through the Special Ed curriculum, but as a non LD student, study skills was not able to be stressed enough in the general classroom - due to the size and vast amount of material that teachers need to cover in a day.   So I am back at RITES so that he too can reach his highest potential.  I recommend RITES to any parent who is looking for a way to help their children become better students - LD or not.  Thank You RITES!

My daughter has challenges with executive functioning, organizational skills, and math skills.  We signed her up for the two week summer session focusing on those issues at the Hamilton School, much to her chagrin.  To my delight, and to my daughter's surprise, she greatly enjoyed the camp, engaged in exciting activities, improved her writing and math skills, and stated that it wasn't at all "like school, which would have been horrible. Learning was actually fun!"  In fact, she stated later that she preferred the RITES camp over her traditional day camp where she could swim every day, which is one of her favorite activities!  She was sent home with a binder full of educational tools designed to correspond with her personal learning style.  She utilizes this binder currently at school, and her teachers greatly appreciated the resources as well.  Her self-esteem increased tremendously, as she now sees herself as having a different learning style, rather than the label of having a learning "disability."   THANK YOU RITES!!!

We looked to get him some extra help and we found RITES. We were so nervous about financially committing to any outside help but we knew we needed something for our son. The staff at RITES were so welcoming and helpful from our first inquiry. The tutor took time to listen to our son, think about his needs, and very thoughtfully implemented support. We continued with their summer program: Reading Comprehension and Study Skills. The knowledge and level of expertise of their staff is incomparable! Our son learned new ways of learning and reading concepts that are helping him into the 6th grade. What I appreciate most of all about the RITES program is that the teachers collectively provided an atmosphere of encouragement and our son has gained some confidence with them.

As a result, his confidence and skill level have benefitted immensely.  This program has been wonderful, not only because it makes use of the abundance of free time in the summer, but also because it provides the  consistency he needs to ensure his academic success.  The teachers in the program are true professionals who genuinely understand the many co-existing conditions that occur with  kids with learning differences (such as attention issues or social/peer related issues).  They work to help the child not only to build skills for reading, but also to develop strategies for better listening or for more appropriate peer interaction.  Not only is the program effective, but he also truly enjoys going. Prior to O.G. training, learning had always been an arduous chore for my son.  RITES has helped him to become motivated, because he now realizes that if he tries, he can actually do it.

They provide excellent resources for the local community to get work done and seek NEW employment opportunities with their new computer resource center. Internationally, they work tirelessly throughout Sierra Leone, Africa, providing food, clothing, toys, shelter, education, and clean renewable energy sources. Since the Co-founder is from Sierra Leone they demonstrate a "hands on" approach to their cause so you know every penny fun-raised goes to helping support theses efforts. What is unique about khadarlis is as volunteer for Khadarlis, you are completely free to work on any fundraising project you desire for any country you would like to help. You are given the tools, resources and knowledge to help you along the way. By having this approach, you are exposed to a number of different areas, people and and knowledge thereby gaining a hands on or "real world" experience that is priceless and attractive to any employer that you want to work for in the future. As a volunteer, I was able learn new fundraising techniques, understand how to manage a team, and build working relationships with people throughout Rhode Island. I have built a strong relationship with its founders and co founders as well and I can honestly say that they are the most dedicated and passionate people I have ever met in my life.

I am a student from Bryant University who is working with Khadarlis for a management service learning project. My team and I have been helping Khadarlis through creating a Pen Pal System with an elementary school in Rhode Island, putting on a Halloween Program for children in the Providence area, getting donations from Staples to create care-packages for children participating in the Ninos del Lago summer camp in Guatemala, and also making a three year strategic plan. It has been an enriching experience working with Khadarlis.  It feels great to help such an amazing organization that makes improvements in Sierra Leone and the Providence area.  Working for Khadarlis has made me more comfortable talking to managers and contacting various places to try to get donations for this great organization. I was very excited when we created a Pen Pal connection that will last for years to come and will benefit many children. I have loved my experience working with Khadarlis for my service learning project and do not want this experience to end.
Khadarlis	145056		/users/profile/191616	kmass5673	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I am a sophomore at Bryant University and have been working with Khadarlis for our service learning project. From the start, everyone at Khadarlis was more than welcoming. Everyone was very enthusiastic and truly cared about the work that Khadarlis does. Right away, my service learning team and I were introduced to the Khadarlis community and learned how we could help. Over the past few months, Khadalris has helped us to achieve more than we ever thought we could. We helped organize and carry out a Halloween Program for children. We have set up a Pen Pal connection between an elementary school in Rhode Island and one in Sierra Leone. We have used various sources of social awareness, and have gained donations for care packages to be sent to Sierra Leone. Working with Khadarlis has been an amazing experience and iIhave learned and accomplished more that iIever thought iIwould.  Khadarlis is an amazing organization and it has been wonderful working with them. 
Khadarlis	145052		/users/profile/191612	olivia930	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I am a student at Bryant University working with Khadarlis for a service learning project. Khadarlis not only helps out tremendously in Sierra Leone by providing help with the education, agriculture, and healthcare among other things but also in the Providence area. For our project, we have seen what Khadarlis does and are extremely impressed by how much they are able to accomplish. The outreach center in Providence itself provides a huge impact for those around it by serving as a place people can go for anything they need. I have learned that as long as you have the will to do something, it can be done and that is shown strongly with Khadarlis. We have learned as a group a lot from Khadarlis such as the importance of helping those who are less fortunate. It does not take a lot to make a difference in someones life and Khadarlis makes helping people look easy because of how good they are at it. I would definitely consider Khadarlis as the best non-profit because it is a small organization that is making a huge impact both in Sierra Leone and Providence. It has definitely taught our group a lot about the difference just a few people can make in others lives.
Khadarlis	145010		/users/profile/191569	Haji	Board Member	5	11/30/2012	I know first hand the difference Khadarlis is making in the lives people in Sierra Leone and in the Providence, Rhose Island area. They are making things happen from nothing due to their dedication to helping the less fortunate among us. Khadarlis is well respected and admired by the communities/towns and villages they serve in Sierra Leone. Khadarlis is helping others help themselves. In the local communities that they serve in the United States they have earned respect and admiration for their work and dedication to Community service. I highly recommend Khadarlis. I have no doubt they are going to be one of the most respected, transparent and dedicated non-profits in their local community and the communities they serve in Sierra Leone, west Africa. Please donate your time, money and prayers for this worthy organization. Thank you.

Khadarlis	144935		/users/profile/191492	Rashad117	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	I've volunteered for other non profits before but I can honestly say that Khadralis is the best non profit organization ever I've volunteered for. The staff at Khadarlis are honestly concerned about those they are trying to help which shows regularly through they're actions. They're compassionate and caring to those who may need their help and who may walk through their door. I've seen some of the work that Khadarlis has done over the years to help the less fortunate and those in need of assistance and the impact of the organization is obvious They've provided books to children who need them among other things. The people who run the organization are also very hospitable to volunteers as well. When I first decided to volunteer I was welcomed with open arms and immediately felt like part of the family. Volunteering for Khadarlis I feel like I really am making a difference in people's lives, including my own. When I come in to Khadarlis I'm always greeted with a smile by the staff. Volunteering for Khadalis is one of the best choices I've made in a very long time. 
Khadarlis	144921		/users/profile/191475	ChelseyMK	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	How do you say thank you to a bunch of people that gave you a chance when other organizations will not accept me for community service via courts. They showed me that they care and wanted to see me complete my service. I have since then completed my hours. I show up there every so often when time permits to help out. Cheeers.
Khadarlis	144919		/users/profile/191472	GayleR	Volunteer	5	11/30/2012	Volunteering at khadarlis is challenging and fun at the same time. Kids can be a handful and being there just makes you appreciate the children and the staff who are all volunteers, I feel that these two women that founded the organization need some recognition and medal for all their hard work in our 02908 zip code.

Khadarlis	144912		/users/profile/191465	Officerfriendly1	Advisor	5	11/30/2012	khadarlis is one of those rare organizations that is not yet well known internationally but is surprisingly solid in its mission, objectives, and staff composition. I've known the staff for more than 2 years and have had some humbling experiences	 during my trips to participate in some programmatic activities. Anyone who is able to interact with the staff or visit the recipients and their families in the impoverished regions in which khadarlis operates will undoubtedly fall in love with this little NGO known askhadarlis.

My commitment to this organization wouldn't have spanned over 5 years and counting if I didn't truly believe in the impact khadarlis is having in communities,  particularly in the lives of young women and girls. I've been able to witness firsthand how khadarlis approaches their work through an empowerment framework working directly with children, families, and communities. .

Khadarlis has been a great place to get my start in grant writing. I started in May, 2011 & have written 3 grants, so far. It is very interesting work & I'm blessed to have a place that let's me learn as I go. While none of my grants have been officially approved yet I look forward to learning from possible denials. Aisha is the best-her passion, enthusiasm & energy are enviable! She is also very supportive & just wrote a grad school recommendation letter for me. The only real down side is phone tag. But that's inevitable, I live in Arizona. Looking forward to several more years at Khadarlis!

Khadarlis	144644		/users/profile/191184	Ekubolageh T.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/29/2012	This is a wonderful organization that does work in rural Sierra Leone. It's been several years since the devatating civil war and though there has been progress, there is still a lot to be done. Khardalis as an organization has catered to the many needs of these rural communities. There work has ranged from providing clean water in areas that once had none, to empowering women to be equal partners in their communities, to helping to build schools. These are just some of the things Khardalis has done to further progress in an area that needs it desperately. We need more organizations like Khardalis around because the world can use it. Thanks for what you've done, what you are doing, and for all you will do in the future. Why do i appreciate the work that Khardalis has done? Because i have been to some of these areas and seen the needs of these people. It's very needed and they are providing help. Humanity benefits when organizations do the kind of work they do. I know how difficult the work is because i am a member of another Non-profit organization(Kushe Soccer).  Continue spreading the love and helping people. They need you, we look up to you, and the world can use more organizations like Khardalis.
Khadarlis	144636		/users/profile/191175	Camille V.	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/29/2012	Distance does not play a significant role when you're passionate about helping others. Khadarlis clearly validates this saying and Aisha, its inspirator, embodies it. The projects contribute to sustainable development initiatives that come from the local communities Khadarlis serves and thus promote the spirit that is already present but needs an extra push to materialize in the concrete projects that you can witness while walking through the communities Khadarlis helps. As managing director of AMAIDI, an international organization supporting local communities worldwide by adding to the capacity of the organizations that serve these communities, I wholeheartedly support Khadarlis' work and hope that we can work together for a long time to come for the benefit of the people that are assisted in their struggle to escape the negative spiral of poverty and all its ugly faces. 
Khadarlis	144629		/users/profile/191166	Gis B.

Khadarlis has been succesfully shared that passion with all of the people that is part of Khadarlis, because of all the wonderful work they do by helping in so many ways, giving to a whole community all the tools and instructional guide they need to be succesful at surviving and thriving!

Khadarlis	144490	2	/users/profile/191021	alhadiz2001	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	Since I started working with Khadarlis, I have realised that the lives of many has been touched in a more positive way. khadarlis has been very instrumental in reaching the far distance to helping the needy especially children and the aged. By providing drinking water wells for several villages and disitributing used clothing to displaced population within the region such as Bargbo Chiefdom has  immensely helped to alleviate some of the unmet needs faced by these people. Khadarlis has also embarked on sensitising the youths and focused a lot on the benefits of education especially for the girl child. There is a saying that 'if you educate a woman, you have educated a nation'

Overall this is an amazing organization that deserves more recognition, I definitely recommend volunteering and contributing to Khadarlis' mission.

Khadarlis	119277		/users/profile/162174	khadarlis-change	Volunteer	3	07/25/2012	I am just short of words! My volunteering to serve Khadarlis for Sierra Leone is one of the huge sacrifices that I enjoy giving to a noble cause like what lies in the mission of the organisation. Having listened to the story behind the creation of this nonprofit, I was glued to help my own little way to move the initiative to the next level that would enable the mission to fulfill its objectives for those vulnerable groups out there in those obscure and remote villages in Sierra Leone. Khadarlis role as the voice of the voiceless, the advocate for those vulnerable groups- the rural women who bear the brunt of the worlds' poverty, those orphaned children from the ruins of the Blood Diamond Conflict, all need to tell their stories to the world and Khadarlis for Sierra Leone championing such noble causes to improve the lives of others is just irresistible for me.
Khadarlis	118830		/users/profile/161567	Ty H.	Volunteer	5	07/18/2012	Khadarlis for Sierra Leone is an amazing organization for several reasons.  The first that comes to mind is the devotion and commitment that its founders and members have.  From day one, I understood how much of a difference I was going to make in the lives of those living in Sierra Leone.  Khadarlis was very young when I volunteered, however, my team and I (we were working through Bryant University's Service Learning Project for Management) were able to accomplish much more than we expected.  Aisha easily showed us how important Khadarlis for Sierra Leone's mission was and still is.  We caught the "Khadarlis bug," and some of our team members actually continued to volunteer past the semester's end.  Finally, I want to emphasize how professional, flexible, energized and motivating Khadarlis for Sierra Leone is.  I am so appreciative for the opportunity to work with Khadarlis, and I know many others who have had similar experiences.  As soon as I have more free time, I'm going to volunteer again!

I was looking for a place to further a personal mission to help others in the world. On my search for a place to volunteer I came across Khadarlis. I can honestly say Khadarlis has been like family! They welcomed me right in, and working alongside them has been nothing short of amazing. I am so happy I came across them, and I'm so excited about what the future will bring for Khadarlis !!!
Khadarlis	117138	1	/users/profile/159335	Serina I.	Volunteer	5	06/28/2012	They instantly felt like family.  I have just begun and I can't wait to see what this experience will bring.  
Khadarlis	116640		/users/profile/158771	AshleyT	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	Although Khadarlis is a small organization, it has big plans and objectives. Everyone involved -- from the administrative assistant to the founder -- is dedicated to Khadarlis' mission. Since the organization will now serve the local community, I only see growth an new opportunity to help those in need. If you're interested in giving back and feeling inspired, I recommend Khadarlis to start. Regardless of your skills, you'll be able to apply any talent to a great cause!
Khadarlis	116552		/users/profile/158662	Diana20	Volunteer	5	06/26/2012	It's rare that you find a non-profit that works to improve the situation in faraway countries that actually gets things done. Khadarlis does. Even though most of their work has been focused in a relatively small group of villages, but their list of accomplishments- new dwellings, new library for the school, basket of food for every household.  Plus they also work to help out their local community by allowing visitors to use their computers for job searches and homework and stuff like that. Khadarlis is small, but it's growing, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. They're also very open to ideas and feedback from volunteers, even ones who are just starting out. Definitely a good place to volunteer if you want to make a difference and learn how to run organizations.
Khadarlis	116547		/users/profile/158656	mnatale100	Volunteer	4	06/26/2012	I found Khadarlis while browsing the web for volunteer opportunities. As someone who is looking to break into philanthropic work in the future, I thought volunteering with a small "start-up"like Khadarlis would be a great experience and give me insight into the kind of work it takes to start a nonprofit organization. When I went in for my interview with Aisha, I was blown away by the work they are doing for Sierra Leone. This kind of grassroots work is inspiring and hugely impactful. To me, even to be able to write blog posts for them, highlighting the issues they face and the work they are doing, means a lot. The people I have worked with there are helpful, kind and understanding, and I have loved being part of this organization since I started there in the beginning of this year.

He was a remarkable young boy.  The MattyFund is a wonderful tribute to his name.  The family and staff of the MattyFund care very deeply for people, especially those effected by epilepsy.  I have attended several of their events since the foundations fruition and the number of people they help and the number of supporters is very touching.

The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	278787		/users/profile/368775	Writer	Donor	5	02/02/2016	I've had the tremendous honor of being involved with The Matty Fund, since it opened its doors to the non profit community in 2003. As a committee member, donor and long time supporter, I've witnessed this exceptional organization grow to new heights each year. Richard and Debra Siravo have truly made a difference in not only the Southern New England community, but throughout the country with their efforts to bring epilepsy to light. Countless children and families affected by epilepsy have benefited from The Matty Fund through fundraisers, support groups, scholarships, educational seminars and camps for children. If ever I hear of some one affected by epilepsy, I always advise them to contact The Matty Fund and amazingly enough, most folks around New England have already heard of them. I look forward to supporting The Matty Fund for many years to come at their annual 5k run and walk, golf tournament, and Snow Angel Ball. Kudos to Debra and Richard, they've left a lasting impression on so many folks nationwide. 
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	278632		/users/profile/368600	Writer	Board Member	5	02/01/2016	The Matty Fund (Matthew Siravo Memorial Foundation) is a non-profit that focuses on epilepsy and provides support to the families affected by it.  Not only do they cover the basics (fundraising, awareness, legislation) but they take it a step further bringing awareness to children and teachers in schools, assisting nurses and physicians  in various settings with the latest updates on research through lectureship programs.  They bring children with epilepsy together for fun family events (pumpkin festival, etc.) that enables children and their family members to interact with others who may also be faced with the same issues and challenges.  This past weekend's Snow Angel Ball was a well run event that helped to highlight what The Matty Fund does and to share real stories about the families who are a part of The Matty Fund family.  The food was good, the music (Sugar) was great, and everyone who attended learned a little bit more about The Matty Fund staff, their efforts, and enjoyed meeting some of the young recipients of the Foundation's support. 
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	278616		/users/profile/368583	Beth-F	Client Served	5	02/01/2016	The Matty Fund is different from other non-profits.  They cover the basics (fundraising, awareness, legislation) but they take it a step further.  They have a wonderful program that brings awareness to children in schools and teaches them how to be a good friend to somebody that has epilepsy.  They bring children with epilepsy and their families together for fantastic events. They have created a true family environment.  They enable the parents to connect and share their stories and experiences with each other while the kids are able to be kids in a safe environment. They understand that epilepsy impacts the entire family and they are wonderfully supportive.  I only wish I lived closer so that I could attend more events.

The event was extremely well run with countless volunteers helping out with every facet of the Ball. There was a real sense of commitment and also a feeling of family amongst all those attending. The  feature presentation focused on one family and their daughter, all of whom were benefitting from The Matty Fund's services. It  was truly touching. The auction items were exceptional, the food was delicious, and the band, Sugar, was outstanding.  Just a great time for a great cause.

One can know about the quality and quantity of  the Matty Fund by how it performs its mission. It raises awareness of  epilepsy abroad to the citizens of Rhode Island; it improves the  quality of life for children and families whose daily lives are  affected by epilepsy; and is very effective raising funds for the  success of its mission. What more may one ask of such a non-profit  foundation? The work of the Fund changes peoples' lives for the  better. Those who contribute financial and human resources are warmed  by their participation -- they make a decision to participate, and do  so repeatedly.  How do I know this? I am a willing contributor and continually ask  how I can regularly participate. I do believe in The Matty Fund and  know it to be humming along in fine fashion. Each event turns out a  passionate group of people who participate to the highest level that  they are able. I am pleased to support this essential foundation in  the Rhode Island community. Anthony J. (Tony) Agostinelli

Having trained and worked in MA, PA and WI, I found that The Matty Fund was the best support group for my little patients. Not even the Epilepsy Foundation provides what they do, not just for children with epilepsy, but also for their families to be involved and for education. I give their information out to every new patient with epilepsy that I see, and some are initially reluctant, but sooner or later do check them out online, out of curiosity, even if they feel hesitant/scared/stigmatized by the diagnosis. Please keep up the good work!

From participating on a panel discussion, attending fundraisers like the Snow Ball and Lobster bake, and creating the Alyssa Rose team to run in honor of our daughter each year - it has been really wonderful.  All of the people at the Matty Fund have been amazing, and we are so fortunate to have this organization.

We were meeting to make a decision on which  Rhode Island children's charity RNJ Charities was going to support that year, with our two-days of fund raising events.   When Rich and Deb got through telling us the story behind The Matty Fund and what they do, and have accomplished, there wasn't a dry eye at the table and we voted unanimously to support The Matty Fund that year and each year since.   Along the way, we have supported other groups with The Matty Fund, but we have found that when it comes to event support The Matty Fund is 100% on board supporting all of our efforts.  Whether it's advertising our events through their social media pages, helping set up silent auction tables, right  down to helping load in sound equipment for the concert, The Matty Fund personnel, including Rich and Deb, are right there.   I would strongly encourage any fund raising organizations that are looking to make donations to a very worthy non-profit, please consider The Matty Fund.   RNJ Charities will continue to support The Matty Fund as long as I am a director on this board.  I now consider Rich and Deb friends, and you will too.

We host a concert and golf tournament in August with the proceeds supporting the work that The Matty Fund accomplishes.  We have supported a number of charities in years past.  When we met Richard and Debbie Siravo and heard their story we instantly  knew that this charity was one that we had to support through our fundraising efforts.   After working with them for two years my family was suddenly dealing with a very small family member who was diagnosed with epilepsy.  The Matty Fund has supported this little one with their Camp Matty, their Easter Egg Hunt as well as providing resources and education for our family.  I can not even image the heartbreak that the founders of The Matty Fund must have felt when they lost Matthew--they however turned their lose into a foundation that supports so many.

Donations support activities for children living with seizures and the side effects of strong medications and much needed support for parents to help them understand, accept and deal with this condition; as well as, to become strong and effective advocates for their children.  I have seen firsthand the positve impact of their programs and services.  Their school awareness program has had statewide impact among school age children to encourage an atmosphere of understanding, inclusion and safety while children are in school; support groups that are now accessible statewide connect families who share similar experiences so they can learn from and support each other through the challenging and rewarding times; workshops on epilepsy related topics help parents navigate complex educational and medical systems on behalf of their children; professional development for medical professionals encourage and improve patient safety, college scholarhips and childrens activities that are fun and safe are all examples of a local non-profit doing great work right here in Rhode Island, and I know my donation is making a difference!

The fund's programs provide resources and outreaches to patients with seizures and families providing education on diagnosis, treatment and quality of life issues. Through the foundation's research initiative, seed fund grants allow important work in the pilot stages to be carried out in the critical initial phases. Collaboration with Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital basic and clinician neuroscientists also allows mentoring and training of the next generation of researchers. Research sponsored by the Matty Fund has been published in national neurologic journals.

Even though I am fortunate not to be affected by epilepsy, I have seen first hand the support that the Matty Fund affords those who need it.  God forbid another family be inflicted the way the Siravos have, but if so, they can be assured they will have more support than they ever could have imagined.

Matty was and is their love as well as the rest of their children. However, not every parent(s) devote their life to help fill the void that others feel given the same situation. They have gone a long way in helping children and parents dealing with the many forms of epilepsy. Their work is truly heartfelt and  meaningful. 
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	100484		/users/profile/122723	Barbara2345678910	Volunteer	5	11/10/2011	I am both a volunteer in this organization and a recipient of the many support services it provides. My children were both diagnosed with epilepsy and I struggled to understand more about their condition and to help them feel as comfortable as possible with it. The matty fund sponsors the support group that we attend, they sponsor educational events that help families living with epilepsy get answers, and they promote epilepsy awareness to help people in our schools and communities understand what epilepsy is. Debra and Richard's love and dedication for this cause is a blessing to so many families, and their staff, board, and volunteers are incredible.
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	100452		/users/profile/122582	LL199	Board Member	5	11/09/2011	As a board member and a mom of a child with epilepsy, I know first hand the stuggles that families go through dealing with this disease everyday.  The Matty Fund has done so many wonderful things for the children and families who have joined our organization.  The few fundraisers that the Matty Fund promotes every year fully funds such wonderful family events  like Camp Matty, Pumpkin Fest, Easter Egg Hunt , and Support Groups each and every year.  The Matty Fund also has a wonderful program that educates the community and schools about epilepsy.  Research has been funded by the Matty Fund as well as lectures with world renowned doctors.  If you have a child with epilepsy and are looking for a great support system and fun activities for your child, you will want to call the MATTY FUND!

The Matty Fund was there every step of the way--offering support to our family as we negotiated this difficult step.  I have no doubt that they will be an organization we will turn to again and again as our son's needs and our needs change.  We are grateful for The Matty Fund.

They are always there when you have a question,, concerrn, or just need someone to talk to that knows what your going through!  They raise awareness for epilepsy which most people know nothing about, but with their help it's becoming more and more known.  I can't say enough good things about them they are GREAT!

The devotion that the Siravo's have to the foundation's mission and their desire to help others in memory of their son Matty is reflected in all that they do to "put smiles on the faces of children with epilepsy".
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	97355		/users/profile/114218	Lauren.Gallagher	Volunteer	5	09/11/2011	It's hard to put into words the compassion Deb and Richard Siravo possess. Prior to the creation of the Matty Fund, there was minimal local support for those touched by Epilepsy. After losing their youngest son, Matty, the Siravo's dedicated themselves fully to helping others. While the Matty Fund supports ground breaking research, its biggest accomplishment is bringing normalcy back into these Children's  lives. The Matty Fund offers an escape from hospitals and doctors through programs such as a therapeutic summer camp. Richard and Deb have created more than an ordinary support group. They have created a family which continues to grow and inspire.
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	97305		/users/profile/114106	smkri	Donor	5	09/08/2011	As someone who is involved with various organizations, I have as much respect for the Matty Fund as I do for any other. What started as an organization of one family to prevent a similar tragedy to any other family, has grown into a community organization and a vehicle that supports so many families now - whether it be through support groups or research. The Matty Fund now embodies the spirit of its namesake and will carry on for years to come to help families deal with epilepsy.     And through the hard work of its founders, the Siravo family, it will continue not only supporting families, but funding research to hopefully rid families of this dreaded disease.
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	95359		/users/profile/110677	S_Rosenberg	Volunteer	5	08/09/2011	As an intern for The Matty Fund, I was able to witness first hand the willingness from the Siravo's to make sure Epilepsy Awareness was constantly reaching new boarders. The dedication of the organization is top notch and they're always looking for new ways to expand. Not to mention the connection they share with the children is a completely different experience within itself. Although they focus on raising Epilepsy Awareness, it is clear the relationships with the children is their main focus, which I believe is extremely important in an organization of their type. The Matty Fund's desire to reach out to families suffering through problems with Epilepsy is unbelievable, and I strongly believe they are far and away the best Epilepsy Resource Center in Rhode Island and the surrounding New England area.
The Matty Fund aka Matthew Siravo Memorial Fundation, Inc.	95353		/users/profile/110669	brightmoon008	Client Served	5	08/09/2011	The Matthew Siravo Memorial Foundation is a Wonderful nonprofit organization commited to helping families deal with the realities and uncertainties of epilepsy and seizure disorders.  All staff members at the foundation, including Mr and Mrs Siravo have been a great help to my family from the moment that we began our long journey to get a diagnosis for my daughter.  Each and every time I have contacted the foundation with a question or just feeling frustrated, someone has answered the phone or responded very quickly to any message that I have left via phone or email.  The activities that are offered for the families served under this Non profit are outstanding also.  Camp Matty and the other activities, including the M.E. Support group give children and families dealing with seizure disorders a place to go where they can interact with other families dealing with the same and/or similar issues and also have a safe and fun atmosphere where the children can still feel "normal".  This has to be one of the best non profits ever created, especially if you are looking for one dealing with seizure disorders.  I am grateful to have The Matthew Siravo Memorial Foundation in my families life, and I know many other families feel the same way.

I serve on the Board of Directors and help to keep this wonderful organization going. I have been involved with therapeutic riding for the last 5 years and it still amazes me every day as to how much this therapy helps both the riders and the volunteers.  Non verbal clients leave talking and singing, unsettled clients leave calm and those with physical disabilities are gaining core strength and balance.  The volunteers also reap the benefits by being witness to these miracles unfolding. It is so rewarding.  Our volunteers and donors are what helps us to help others.

Gaits of Harmony Therapeutic Riding	270533	8	/users/profile/359254	Writer	Client Served	5	10/31/2015	There is something magical about the love affair between little girls and horses.   My daughter was no exception and at 9 years old her birthday present of choice was a riding package.  Each year she would be delighted to find another series of lessons among her birthday gifts.  However, due to the reckless choice of another, her dreams of riding horses ended before her 13th birthday.  In fact, all of our hopes and dreams were shattered when she  was struck by a hit and run drunk driver while walking home from her school bus.A traumatic brain injury left her unable to walk, to talk or to eat.  This active little girl now relied on others for her every need.  Her life, now void of horses and other things little girls love to do, was filled with doctors appointments, durable medical equipment and therapies.Until that is, Pat OLeary and Gaits of Harmony entered our lives.  Working with my daughter for 2 years to increase her trunk and head control, September 22nd she rode again.As a mom who has watched her child struggle not only to thrive but to survive for the past 12.5 years, the sight of seeing my child back on a horse evoked such strong emotion.  In addition to the benefits she will receive from the movement and the sensory input of riding, we have renewed hope.Just last week as she was riding back towards the ramp we were gifted with a giggle and a great big smile.  I never thought I would get to witness my child experience the joy of riding again.  Thanks to the dedication and perseverance of a committed group, I can - at Gaits of Harmony.

Gaits of Harmony Therapeutic Riding	269853	8	/users/profile/358587	Lisa507	Client Served	5	10/30/2015	My daughter receives therapeutic horse riding at Gaits of Harmony.  The staff and volunteers are always friendly.  They take the time to know your child and to know what works with each child.   My daughter has autism and sensory issues.  just arriving at the barn, she has a feeling of calm.  Being calm is a constant challenge for her.  Riding the horses sensory regulates her body and the effect lasts 2-3 days.  The most effective therapy or intervention we have ever tried.   I recall after her first lesson.  She normally verbally recites movies and lines from movies non-stop, more-so when her sensory system is unregulated.  She was so quiet on the ride home that I had to keep asking if she was okay.  She was just finally regulated mind and body.  When I ask her how horse riding helps her she replies, "It makes me calm.  My brain works".   Best non-profit you could support

Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	307436	1	/users/profile/353909	Jane96,	Volunteer	5	10/01/2016	This is one of my favourite charitable organisations. I initially became interested in their work while I was cycling through Vietnam and meeting girls riding their bikes to school - so I was thrilled that Rock Paper Scissors had a program where we could donate directly to helping girls get to school by bike. This past summer, Sara asked us to come to Vietnam and help teach the girls who had received bikes how to care for them and maintain them properly. Being in Vietnam with the team allowed us to see how unfailingly dedicated Rock Paper Scissors US volunteers and their Vietnamese staff are to helping kids in the region! We got to see directly the impact that even a few dollars can make in the life of the children there.This is an amazing organisation and I highly recommend them.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	317726		/users/profile/408861	PhoebeN	Volunteer	5	10/31/2016	Hi-My mom, sister and I started this non-profit almost four years ago! I feel like we've done so much since we started. In the summers we bring volunteers to help us run our music and art classes and to hold out summer camps in the ethnic minority villages. This year we had 500 kids come to our camps. It was a lot of fun and the kids really liked it. I have experienced seeing a lot of poverty in Vietnam, especially in the villages that we work in. Families have very little to eat and live on, and their homes have no furniture, it's very sad to see. Since I have been going to Vietnam with my family, I have learned a lot about how people can suffer in other countries. I am glad that we are able to help kids through Rock-Paper-Scissors!

Being from Vietnam and having gone to school there up until middle school, I know that there is a significant lack of these art and music programs. They are a rarity in many parts of Vietnam. Thank you RPS for providing these opportunities, I know that it is making a difference! 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	308885		/users/profile/400260	baotran2	Board Member	5	10/07/2016	RPS is a wonderful non-profit organization that is making a difference in the lives of underprivileged youth in Vietnam. I've been very blessed to work alongside very compassionate & committed people. I am inspired by Sara for her continued effort and endless dedication to this great organization. I look forward to seeing RPS grow and continue to bring positive changes to those who really deserve it!
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	307934		/users/profile/399308	Stephen88	Volunteer	5	10/04/2016	For several years I have been a supporter of Rock Papers Scissors and this past year (2016) I was able to go to Vietnam with them and spend time within the communities they are helping. I was blown away with the love and care they put into the work they do. And it absolutely shows in the children. They are so happy when they receive their new bicycles, or when they get together to practice violin, and do art projects. The support these children get from Rock Paper Scissors is essential to their growth, to their happiness, and to their future possibilities. I highly recommend supporting RPS in anyway you can.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	307436	1	/users/profile/353909	Jane96	Volunteer	5	10/01/2016	This is one of my favourite charitable organisations. I initially became interested in their work while I was cycling through Vietnam and meeting girls riding their bikes to school - so I was thrilled that Rock Paper Scissors had a program where we could donate directly to helping girls get to school by bike. This past summer, Sara asked us to come to Vietnam and help teach the girls who had received bikes how to care for them and maintain them properly. Being in Vietnam with the team allowed us to see how unfailingly dedicated Rock Paper Scissors US volunteers and their Vietnamese staff are to helping kids in the region! We got to see directly the impact that even a few dollars can make in the life of the children there.This is an amazing organisation and I highly recommend them.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	265158		/users/profile/353909	Jane96	Donor	5	10/19/2015	This is my favourite charity in the world. They address the issue of children's education at a grass-roots level in Vietnam. They are dedicated to providing bikes to girls to allow them to get to school safely, often over long distances, but they also ensure that the girls have the tools and the help they need to fix the bikes should anything go wrong. Combine this initiative with a school teaching music, dance and the arts in a small village in Vietnam and this charity gets my vote. So far, we have donated the equivalent of around 40 bikes and I plan to continue supporting Rock-Paper-Scissors in the future. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	307392		/users/profile/398728	sscurdts	Volunteer	5	09/30/2016	I loved working with this organization! It provides wonderful opportunities for kids and families in Vietnam, and it was so wonderful to experience this change. Amazing, hardworking people doing amazing things. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	307244		/users/profile/289452	cjorin	Volunteer	5	09/30/2016	I am very pleased to support Rock-Paper-Scissors Childrens Fund as a truly commendable nonprofit organization. I, and my 17-year-old son, born in Vietnam, had the opportunity to volunteer with Sara Nerone and her family in Vietnam in 2014 and again in 2016. We were able to experience first-hand the incredible work that R-P-S does for the children it serves. The ongoing music and art programs for children provide opportunities for them to learn and express themselves in ways typically unknown in their everyday environments. The programs provide not only opportunities to develop their talents, but also to build camaraderie and long-term deep relationships with their fellow artists. The bicycles that are provided for girls allow them to go to school when they might not otherwise have the opportunity that most of us take for granted. Even the youngest girls in Vietnam are often tasked with taking care of younger siblings and helping at home as a priority over the learning that they yearn to experience. With bicycles, they can get to and from school faster, allowing them to fulfill their family responsibilities and study too.  The summer camps put on by R-P-S in minority villages provide a lovely retreat for children of all ages  with games, music, art, and healthy snacks, the kids engage in special times that would otherwise not be possible. The team in Vietnam is extremely capable and dedicated, warm and genuine, connecting with the children they serve and with the volunteers in very special ways. Sara does an incredible job of keeping the organization running smoothly in Vietnam in addition to managing her very full life at home in the US. I am proud to support R-P-Ss valuable and successful programs. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	225696	1	/users/profile/289452	cjorin	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	When I first contacted Sara Nerone about the possibility of my son, Zachary, and I helping out at for a week at the Rock, Paper, Scissors violin school in Cam Duc, Vietnam, during summer 2014, I had a feeling that the opportunity would be a very special experience. Little did I know how special it would turn out to be for both of us, especially for Zachary. From the first night, when we met the volunteer team at our small motel, to five nights later, when we celebrated the completion of a truly special week with the incredible group of Vietnamese children, teachers, director and family members of the wonderful program that Sara has put together, each moment was a gift. We arrived at the school on Monday morning to meet anxiously waiting violin students, and after a full of warm spirits and joyful sounds, we said our tearful goodbyes at the airport.  The school is held in a lovely home with big open spaces and cheerful pale blue and green colors accented by the natural light pouring in from the open porch. When they werent practicing their instruments, all the kids were singing and chatting  teaching each other songs and phrases in Vietnamese and English, playing games, doing art projects.  We spent one morning at an ethnic minority village school, with about 60 local children, engaging them in music, art and games. This was a very special day for all. The end of the week brought a wonderful culmination of the efforts of everyone  a musical performance by the children for the local government officials followed by the giving of bicycles to twenty very shyly grateful girls.   Our last evening was celebrated with a feast of Vietnamese dishes for all the volunteers in addition to the students, about 35 of us in all. The Vietnamese kids all sang a song to Zachary after which one of the girls made a little speech in English and Zachary made a speech to them in Vietnamese.  It was the culmination of a deeply meaningful week of learning and sharing cultures through music and art. Our time in Cam Duc was one of those extraordinary life experiences that are uniquely valuable in a myriad of ways  a genuine gift. We went to volunteer time working with the kids, thinking it would be special, but never imagining the depth of what we would receive in return  such honest warmth, joy, trust and love from these lovely young people.  Rock, Paper, Scissors is an exemplary organization offering exceptional opportunities for the children it serves as well as for volunteers, with Sara Nerone and her family at the helm, steering a steady course to make a difference. We cant wait to go back!
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	305069		/users/profile/396292	tcurdts	Volunteer	5	09/16/2016	I had the opportunity to volunteer with RPC in Vietnam this past summer (2016) with my wife and two teenage daughters.  We were all impressed by RPCs effectiveness at imparting positive impacts on the lives of Vietnamese kids. We participated in the larger camps, where up to 300 kids from surrounding villages came to participate in music and art activities over a 3-day period. We were also involved in teaching art and music to smaller classes, both in rural villages and as part of a year-round after school program in Cam Duc. Finally, we attended two bike-giving ceremonies where girls (screened and chosen by the Red Cross, based on need) were given bicycles, pumps and helmets, which facilitate their ability to attend school. Sara is doing an amazing job of coordinating these various RPC programs and has put together an inspiring and effective group of local staff and volunteers. In addition to several very hard working and dedicated Vietnamese adults, RPC engages a cadre of local teenage tutors, who have opportunities to further their own art and music education, mentor younger students, and gain international experience by serving as interpreters for foreign volunteers. RPC is an efficient, effective and highly successful program that I am proud to support.

The dedication of the staff is impressive.  This organization touches so many children's lives.  To watch children's' faces light up when they participate in a musical and artistic experience is wonderful to behold.  I witnessed how this organization changes childrens' lives by enriching their experiences.  I feel honored to be a part of this amazing organization.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	270554		/users/profile/359274	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2015	My daughter volunteered with the Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund last summer and had an amazing experience.  The work that the organization does to provide opportunities for music and art education in Vietnam is well managed, valuable and meaningful. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	270551		/users/profile/359270	Eleanor E.	Volunteer	5	10/31/2015	I was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to volunteer with Rock-Paper-Scissors this past summer in Vietnam. I had been to Vietnam twice prior to this trip, but both times as a tourist.  To visit as a volunteer for three and a half weeks was a completely different experience. It was so gratifying to give back to the people of this beautiful country through music and art education. I think that one of the best things about this trip was that it allowed me to connect with the people whom we worked with and helped. I made friends that I will never forget, which taught me that true bonds of friendship can form even between people of very different languages and cultures. This experience also taught me to be grateful for what I have and encouraged me to help others. My trip with Rock-Paper-Scissors changed my life, and I know that every day it improves the lives of children and families in Vietnam. I respect and appreciate the Nerone family so much for having founded and continually supported this organization. I sincerely hope that donors and volunteers will give Rock-Paper-Scissors the same caliber of support that the organization provides for children in Vietnam. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	269632		/users/profile/358353	Rozanne	Volunteer	5	10/30/2015	I volunteered in Vietnam last summer with Rock Paper Scissors, teaching music and helping run summer camps. It is amazing to me how such a small group of people can do so much. Hundreds of kids came to the camps in the villages and made art and music and had fun. It was wonderful to see the music students and young translators from the town interacting with the kids at the camps, along with our group of volunteers. So RPS helps local people to help other local people, and form relationships with them. Recently, a group of young musicians from the RPS music program in Cam Duc went to play for the kids in the village. It was their first ensemble piece, for violins and cello, which we had taught them in the summer.  It was also great to attend the bike giving ceremonies, and meet the girls who received the bikes, hoping that they will stay in school. We also met girls who had received bikes before, and saw that they were still going to school. I know I would love to return to Vietnam, but will continue to work from here so that these programs continue to grow and flourish. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	267118		/users/profile/355865	Laurette V.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2015	In July 2015, I was lucky to travel with Rock Paper Scissors to Vietnam and witness first hand the work that RPS has undertaken. Vietnam is a beautiful country but many of the people live in poverty. RPS empowers lives by providing support and enrichment by way of art and music programs, sponsorship in educational pursuits and bicycles for transportation to school. As a volunteer, I helped to provided art and music camps for children in remote villages and I taught violin lessons to disadvantaged youths in Cam Dc. RPS also coordinated with the local Red Cross to identify children at risk and in need of a bicycle to help their family and ride to school. The delight of the children, their resourcefulness, gratitude and dedication will stay with me my whole life.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	267114		/users/profile/355862	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/25/2015	I volunteered with RPS this past July in Vietnam and hope to return in 2016. Sara Nerone and her family have not only built this organization from the ground up, they've also cemented their influence in the town of Cam Duc and elsewhere as a hugely positive resource for the local children. I witnessed nothing but joy, learning, and passion from the children in the program, as well as from the teenaged translators. The appreciation and affection that each community showed our RPS team was evidence to me of how important our role was to the local students and familes. For the majority of the children, Rock Paper Scissors was their only access to creative education in an inspiring and healthy environment. And being a part of such an influential group of teachers was something I'll never forget. I hope dearly that I'll be able to join Sara and her team in 2016 to reconnect with those tightly knit communities in Vietnam.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	267042		/users/profile/273945	hbeekman	Volunteer	5	10/25/2015	I've volunteered with RPS in Vietnam twice - this past summer and the one before, and both times have been impressed by its clear-sighted, needs-based direction and its overwhelming impact on the children it serves. Many of the reviews I've seen focus on the Bikes for Girls program - however, as a volunteer, I spent most of my time working face-to-face with children on art projects and teaching music. I cannot say enough about the wonderful enthusiasm these kids bring to their projects. They are truly remarkable!  What I love about RPS is that it recognizes the intangible needs of children as well as the tangible. A bike can make such a difference in a girl's life, because it gives her the means of getting to school. But providing a consistent, structured art or music program where a child can come and explore the depths of her potential gives her the will to keep on trying - even when the odds seem to be weighed against her.  RPS is not just about providing for basic needs or supporting education or enriching lives with arts and music. It works to do all those things. Many needy children benefit from all three of it's projects, and all three are so important to changing their lives. It has been such a gift to be a part of this nonprofit's work!
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	211089		/users/profile/273945	hbeekman	Volunteer	5	08/18/2014	I just returned from a trip to Vietnam with RPS a few days ago. Along with RPS founder Sara, her family, and several other volunteers, I spent three busy weeks working in the town of Cam Duc. It has been refreshing to be involved in an organization with such clear, ethically-minded direction. Sara constantly emphasizes the need to translate donations into tangible impacts for the people she serves. I have been fortunate enough to see the results of her approach first hand. During our stay we attended three bike givings -all funded by donations- and took part in RPSs community music and arts programs. These programs provide low-income students in Cam Duc with otherwise unavailable creative outlets, as well as a close-knit support structure of caring peers and adults. (I wish I could write a review of the students themselves - their earnestness and consideration for everyone around them deeply underscored, for me, the importance of helping them succeed.) Lastly, with the help of our students in Cam Duc, we were able to run day camps in three ethnic minority villages around the area, bringing arts and music to children for whom it would normally be far, far out of reach. It has been a truly eye-opening experience for me as a young American, not only seeing the extent of the need, but also how much can be done to make a difference when good intentions are implemented with positive, well-organized direction. I will be recommending RPS to my friends and family, and recommend it to readers here as a trustworthy and effective non-profit.

This amazing organization works tirelessly to bring art, music, and bicycles to children and youth in Vietnam. Because the members of this nonprofit volunteer all of their time and spend their own money on transportation and logistics, the donated funds go directly to help the needy children. Their tremendous work enriches the lives of children that have so little.

Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	265142		/users/profile/353892	Stephen E.	Donor	5	10/19/2015	Rock Paper Scissors do AMAZING work. They have helped countless young people in Vietnam with dance and music programs, but my favourite campaign of theirs: 100 Bike For 100 Girls. They have far-exceeded their original goal, and continue to raise money for more bicycles, more instruments, and better supplies for their schools. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	265114		/users/profile/353860	ctilchin	Volunteer	5	10/19/2015	I volunteered with RPS for one month last year, and it was an absolutely phenomenal experience.  Like many of the reviewers below, I had a wonderful time being creative with the kids and getting to know them. We did collaborative art projects, started a band, worked on our violin skills, learned Vietnamese songs and American songs together, and generally just enjoyed cultural exchange of food, customs, and language. It has been about a year since I was at RPS, and I definitely miss the energy before violin practice of all the kids getting together, eating snacks, tuning up, and talking about their days.   Not only did I enjoy working with the students, but I was thoroughly impressed with the infrastructure of the program and how well it is integrated into the community. I feel this is an exceptionally well run and sustainable non-profit with incredibly talented and dedicated  Vietnamese staff, and a visionary program director who has taken the time to understand the needs of the community and how RPS can make the biggest impact.  Go RPS!

Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	265112		/users/profile/353857	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2015	I volunteered with RPS last fall and fell in love with the organization and cause.  Though Rock-Paper-Scissors is not a large organization, it affects tremendous positive change in the lives of its students in Cam Duc.  The community that exists in their small school house is unlike any I've ever been a part of before and the students get so much more than just music and art instruction by being a part of it.  The bike-giving program is similarly special and very practically assists young girls in rural communities.   Consider giving to the Rocks Paper Scissors Childrens Fund so that the team can expand their awesome operations to benefit more under-served Vietnamese youth.   -Grady Hogan
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	264901	1	/users/profile/353631	Writer	Donor	5	10/18/2015	I am proud to be a supporter of RPS. I have met with founder Sara Nerone, and been impressed with her dedication, expertise, and commitment. She and her team are creative and do a great job at communicating their mission and progress-- so important for sustainability and accountability. When I donate, I know my contributions are directly benefitting the children. Their bikes for girls program is simple, innovative, and an affordable way for small donors to participate in a very tangible way.  They make it easy for donors and they're effective. For example, their follow-up and bike repair services show the RPS approach of offering community-driven solutions that make sense for the families and go beyond just initial contact. A great nonprofit!

He learned so much by helping others and the children that he interacted with and the other volunteers left a lasting impression. One of his college application essays is based on a man he met who lived through the Vietnam War. The dedication is impressive and mission of this organization is incredibly important for the children that they serve. I am a supporter.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	226846	1	/users/profile/290584	ZachJorin	Volunteer	5	10/26/2014		This past summer, I was so fortunate to be able to join Rock Paper Scissors Childrens Fund, a non for profit organization, on their first big trip to Vietnam to give lessons to music and art students. Being adopted from Vietnam in 1999, I have a strong connection to the country, to its people, and especially to the arts. Having played violin for eight years, I know that having someone to watch and look up to who is better at the violin is an amazing learning experience. I was able to be this figure that they studied and analyzed as I played with them throughout the one week I had with the students. This experience for me was surely unforgettable for I gained so much knowledge of the people around me and learned so many things. These children taught me a valuable lesson in life  happiness and success is not measured in wealth. They all came from poor families, some even below poverty. Throughout the week, the kids all seemed to be like me, to be like any other fifteen year old or any other six year old. They were innocent and playful. Teaching these children violin, though we spoke nowhere near the same language, was touching. It taught me that music is a universal language, a language that all can learn and all can learn to love. All of this would not have been possible without this amazing organization and the amazing people in it. With passionate hardworking owners, Sara and Pat and their two daughters, this experience to say the least, was incredible. The bonds that I have made with the people in the organization and the students are truly genuine and I hope to return. 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	224666	1	/users/profile/288424	ThangHuynh	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	As far as I know, RPSCF is an amazing nonprofit organization. It was founded in 2012 by Sara Narone, a wonderful and kind-hearted woman. RPSCRs mission is to bring art, music and education to poor children and minority children in Vietnam. RPSCF open art and music classes for children with difficult family situations in my local area. The children have opportunities to learn to play violin and to perform their talent on the paintings. I could see how much the children enjoy what they are doing. Besides, I spent 3 weeks volunteering with RPSCF last summer and had the experience that I had never had before joining volunteer activities which were aimed at bringing educational supports and fun to minority children in Son Tan and Cam An town. RPSCF gave bikes to the children here so that they could ride to school. In fact, most of the minority children here have to go to school on foot. It usually takes them around half an hour or more to get to school. Their parents can hardly afford a bike for them. Thats why most of them quit school right after finishing their primary school. RPS hopes that each of the bikes given will give them motivation for continuing their school. RPS also set up the camps in which minority children could watch young American artists playing violin, participate in painting activities and have fun with American and Vietnamese volunteers. It was so great to see how talented the kids could be through their paintings. RPSCF helped bring us American people and Vietnamese people closer to each other, and together we bring joys to minority children of ethnic groups. RPSCF has made a very good impression on Vietnamese people and government. I hope that RPSCF will continue its mission and become a supporter of the poor and minority children in Vietnam.

They taught the children in my hometown how to play Violin, Cello and how to paint a picture. They went to the mountain and helped ethnic minorities children. They played with them,give them candy, clothes and especially LOVE. Members of RPS are very friendly, kind and humorous. Mrs.Sara is a good person, she always tries her best to help people. Working with them is a opportunity for me to improve my English. Now,my English is good enough to talk to an American.

Working to help poor kids in a poor place like Cam Ranh, Vietnam, RPS has been able to help hundreds of kids through art, music and bike programs. I wish all people in the would could see how the kids enjoyed being with RPS volunteers during the summer. I was so lucky to see how the language barrier was ignored, the cultural differences were eased. Everyone was full of joy, like a family getting together. Sara and her family members as well as the volunteers did bring miracles to the kids' lives. The kids have been more self- confident, more enjoying of their lives and see the world under more positive eyes. I can also never forget the moments when the kids and the volunteers sang together, danced together and had fun together. Those are the most memorable moments in my life! Great job, RPS!

SMART!Art and music make people smarter and those are things RPS teach their children! 3. SPEAKING ENGLISH!In Vietnam, learning English focus on grammar too much so children's speaking skill is bad and when RPS come, children have opportunities to practice and improve their speaking skill. Those are what I saw when I joined in RPS's summer trip! Thanks Mrs. Sara and RPS family!

Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	216713	1	/users/profile/280214	Thy Trang H.	Volunteer	4	09/23/2014	As a member of RPS organization, I deeply understand the famous quote that I have read somewhere "Living by sharing". I have got hooked on being a volunteer for the program since I first read the brief description on facebook about it. Then,  how lucky I am when I have an awesome chance to take part in the summer camp with the little kids in Cam Ranh, Vietnam. These angles are living in low living standards, therefore rarely do they have such a great opportunity to enjoy themselves by drawing, playing outdoor games to develop their vivid imagination. Besides, bike giving is another meaningful deed that RPS brings to children there. Everyday, students have to walk for hours to go to school under the extreme heat in summer, as they live far from school. Not only students but also their parents are very happy when their children have a better condition to study. I also visited one of students who received bike from the program. She is in grade six. She attracts me with her lovely smile and her confident speech in public. Unfortunately, their parents passed away some year ago after an traffic accident. Now, her 2 siblings and she are living with her old grandparents. No matter how difficult the life is, she always tries her utmost to achieve brilliant results in learning and extra curriculum at school. RPS promises that RPS will raise more fund to support her and family.Last but not least, I want to express my great gratitude to Sara, the leader of the program and her two daughters. They have been working so hard to bring happiness to little child in Vietnam.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	307436	1	/users/profile/353909	Jane96,	Volunteer	5	10/01/2016	This is one of my favourite charitable organisations. I initially became interested in their work while I was cycling through Vietnam and meeting girls riding their bikes to school - so I was thrilled that Rock Paper Scissors had a program where we could donate directly to helping girls get to school by bike. This past summer, Sara asked us to come to Vietnam and help teach the girls who had received bikes how to care for them and maintain them properly. Being in Vietnam with the team allowed us to see how unfailingly dedicated Rock Paper Scissors US volunteers and their Vietnamese staff are to helping kids in the region! We got to see directly the impact that even a few dollars can make in the life of the children there.This is an amazing organisation and I highly recommend them.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	212947	1	/users/profile/276052	Kaitlin P.	Volunteer	5	09/01/2014	A couple weeks ago I returned to the states after volunteering for a month with Rock Paper Scissors in Vietnam.  During the trip I taught music to children who attend the RPS art and music school.  I loved being at the school and helping the students.  The atmosphere had a palpable sense of love and warmth that you can only find in a place that is really working for the greater good.  Rock Paper Scissors created this environment that brought people together to create inseparable ties and moments that we will never forget.  The school brought true, honest beauty into the lives of many wonderful students who aren't afforded many opportunities of creativity or self expression.  It was obvious that the kids really enjoyed being at the school and appreciated learning so much.  Many of the kids expressed that coming to the school was the highlight of their year.  It was for me too.  You know those times when you experience a moment and you wish it could last forever? That happened every day I was with the kids in Vietnam.  I never thought that I could become so close with people that I can barely communicate with.  Yet these kids achieved the impossible.  Together we shared a once in a lifetime experience, and I can honestly say they are some of the greatest friends I will ever know.       RPS also put together some bike donations for girls.  The bikes give girls the opportunity to stay in school, which they might otherwise drop out of because families are more likely to send their boys to school and have their girls stay at home and work.  There was an empowering sense of pride that the girls had once they received their new bikes and as they promised to try hard in school.  They made it clear that they really appreciated what RPS did for them and really wanted to do get an education.          During the trip RPS also put on some ethnic minority camps, where we would travel to their schools and perform music, do art and play games with the kids.  They were clearly having lots of fun and it was really great spending time with them.  The kids had so much talent and sincerity in all they did.  We got to visit some of their houses too, and deliver some supplies to the families.  As a high school-er, who is just starting to question the world she's been raised in, I was so fortunate to have this opportunity to see where the kids came from.  You learn about poverty in school, and there's a sense of humbling sympathy you get from hearing about the lives of others.  But there's still a psychological disconnect between you and the other side of the world.  Its not until you experience poverty first hand that you gain a better understanding of what it means.  Then you realize that although its very far away, the third world is really only across an ocean.  And we know how to cross an ocean, so then you wonder why we don't, and you wonder why the third world even exists today.  Then you look at wonderful things like the Rock Paper Scissors nonprofit, and you are very thankful of the time and energy they put in to breaking down the walls and creating a connection between the first and third world.  I am very thankful of the generosity of this organization to not ignore the suffering of others and to bring beauty and relief into people's lives.        
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	212061	2	/users/profile/275008	mcariello	Volunteer	5	08/23/2014	I was fortunate enough to be able to join the other volunteers on Rock Paper Scissors Childrens fund's first big volunteer trip and there are no words to be able to express how rewarding this trip was for me. I have been working with this non-profit since its beginning in 2012 and have got to know these children only through picture in the last two years. When I came to meet them in person and was able to hold their hands it became real. All the hard work for the donations that I was helping to bring in were directly helping these kids standing right in front of me. To see the joy, happiness and graditude they felt because of these art and music programs that have been made avaible to them made it all worth it. I hope to continue working with this children's fund and hope to go back again and again for years to come! 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	211065		/users/profile/273917	robynpothier	Volunteer	5	08/18/2014	I have just returned to the States after volunteering for a month in Vietnam with Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund Inc. It was an amazing experience that has left me so very impressed with the motives and actions of this nonprofit whose mission is to support education, art, and, music for Vietnamese children in poverty stricken rural areas in the region of Cam Duc.  This young nonprofit has already established a school in the region that offers both art and music lessons tuition free.  I spent a month getting to know the children attending classes and saw first hand the joy and beauty the school brings to their lives.  Rock-Paper-Scissors continues to provide bikes to girls in rural villages through donations so that they will be encouraged to continue their education past primary school, and this summer approximately sixty bicycles were awarded to the poorest of girls in three different villages.  We also provided a three-day camp in each of the three villages where the boys and girls came to experience art, music, and games with us.  I was able to purchase one hundred sweatshirts to hand out to the children and saw how grateful they were.  These are children who have very little and sometimes nothing more than the set of clothes they are wearing.Rock-Paper-Scissors is, and will continue to be, a successful nonprofit much to the genius of its founder who has so much talent for building bridges between people and organizations and government.  Sara Narone has established a strong connection with the Red Cross in Vietnam for assistance in identifying girls who need bikes.  She connects the children in her school to the ethnic minority children living in the remote rural areas by bringing them to the camps to help and interpret.  People like myself are now connected to those children and I will extend that bridge to my friends and coworkers.  Just before we left to return home, this organization was granted a license to officially operate in Vietnam which is evidence of its unrelenting determination to make a positive difference for the children living in poverty there.  Requiring a lot of time and effort, being granted this official status further empowers this organization to do its work.  Great job Rock-Paper-Scissors!

Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	180698		/users/profile/237389	crastoqueen	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	I have watched one person's dream of wanting to give something back to the poor and underprivileged children of Vietnam turn in to a reality. It has been inspiring to me to witness the dedication, hard work, and unwavering determination  of its founder to create something so wonderful.  The success that RPS Children's fund has already achieved is told in the photos of the children! Their eyes and smiles say it all. Without this organization these children who have little to no opportunities for the future now can dream.RPS rocks!!!!!!

Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	179194		/users/profile/235832	Molly O.	Donor	5	10/17/2013	Rock Paper Scissors Childrens Fund is an amazing non profit providing education, funding, transportation, art and music to poverty stricken children of Vietnam. They have established a music school providing string instrumemts and lessons for local children. Earlier this year they ran a fundraiser and was able to provide bicycles to multiple young children assisting in their long distant travel to and from school. This non profit is ran by a very involved team of people with strong ties to Vietnam. With more funding, there would be so much more help they would be able to do.

I am a busy person and do get request from many worthwhile non-profits.  What I like about RPS in addition to the simplicity and worthwhile goal of bringing music/art to children, is that I feel a little more connected knowing that Luu, from Seattle, is activiely involved and has contributed directly in the communities served.

Donor	4	10/07/2013	While there are many good non-profits to donate to I am very happy to donate to RPS Childrens Fund because I think there are many reasons to start a music program in a place like rural Vietnam. Providing education is essential to children of course and having a non-profit that concentrates on that is needed, but music is something that many of those children, especially in the countryside, will never get to experience at an organized level. Learning an instrument will not only give them a useful skill but allow them to express themselves artistically and develop self esteem in the process. All children need to be able to express themselves and hopefully this program will give this chance to some of the children of rural Vietnam.

However, I am not an Art teacher, I am an English Teacher. But I still think that this is a great chance for joining in your organization.  I was born in Cam Duc town in a poor family and grow up by my father's hard working life. I am now teaching English in a neighbour town's primary school, and live in my hometown. Truly love the kids, understanding their feeling when being a poor and futhermore, I know the hopeness in their parents' eyes about their childrens' future. I would like to give a hand to make kids  become a happy, successful and grateful people when they are mature.   Poor condition will let the kids lack of smiles on their face when they are amongs their friends, and even when they become success in life later. I want to look for my smiles and their smile, too. Please contact me if I could help. Miss Phuong. mphuong_872002@yahoo.com 
Rock-Paper-Scissors Children's Fund	174327		/users/profile/230596	qlphan1	Volunteer	5	10/06/2013	I have been volunteering with RPS for 8 months now: soliciting donations; drafting letters; and participating in meetings via Skype and in-person. A year ago, I would not have imagined that my goal to help empower children in Vietnam through recreation, especially art and music, would take shape so soon. RPS has essentially become an integral part of my life. Every donation RPS received has gone directly to the projects in Vietnam. After getting to know the board members and their families personally, I am more than confident that our team will work as hard as we can to keep minimizing expenses so our donors hard earned money goes directly to where its promised.      -Luu
Plan International USA, Inc.	306672	1	/users/profile/397956	hilde555	Donor	4	09/27/2016	My Dad used to support children via Plan International his whole life. I remember him reading us the letters and showing us the pictures the kids drew over the years and once I started making my own money I followed in his foot steps. I do encourage my friends do support a child since we can make such a difference in these children life with such little effort. I've been with Plan International for over 15 years and now my children and husband enjoy receiving frequent letters from our current child from India. 
Plan International USA, Inc.	302796	1	/users/profile/393943	cubangirl	Donor	5	09/07/2016	I am delighted that I found Plan USA.  You are doing a wonderful job for children and their families.  I worked with children as teacher, counselor and Special Education Specialist for 35 years.  I am delighted that I found you.  You keep us informed about the children we sponsor and about your work.  Communication with "my children" is very important to me.  I cannot imagine how you do it, but keep up the great work.  The children will be able to have a better life because of Plan Int USA.  I wish I could do more, but one thing I can do is pray for all of you.

The training has been the best capacity building training I have ever received and coming from a developing nation, it has been such a godsend. My organisation has a strategic management plan, and our programs running well all due to the much needed training I got from PLAN USA.
Plan International USA, Inc.	300503	1	/users/profile/391363	Susan485	Client Served	5	08/14/2016	I would like to thank Plan for all of the great programs they offer.  I have been a sponsor since 1988!  Through the years I have recommended Plan to friends as well who want to help a child. I have been impressed always with what they have done to help the children and the communities .  The children receive health care and education in a world where they and their communities need support. Also , Plan makes it easy to communicate with your child as well . Plan runs their organization with integrity and honesty asking for a monthly donation that is very affordable.

Through the various development projects weve supported over the years, our employees have been able to connect our organizations mission of supporting student success to Plans mission of improving the quality of life for children in developing countries.Plan staff, both those based in the US offices and around the globe within country offices, are wonderful advocates for children and communities. Theyre knowledgeable on the issues facing the various countries weve worked in throughout the years. Theyve welcomed our employees with open arms during site visits and share their love of each project. Weve also been fortunate to be able to receive updates over the years on the various projects weve supported. Its great to see the continued progress year over year; our employees look forward to these updates.Our partnership with Plan International is an important part of the culture of our organization and our focus on student success around the globe.

I can not speak highly enough of Plan, having seen the ins and outs of this organization. The work that Plan does is so incredibly important and to be a part of it feels extremely gratifying.
Plan International USA, Inc.	299603	1	/users/profile/390524	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/08/2016	My organization has partnered with PLAN for a decade, and I have been volunteering with PLAN for 6 years. I also had the opportunity to visit an educational project site in Nepal. I so valued seeing how the project is always staffed in country and region, providing opportunities and economic growth to the area they are serving. I was impressed to see and learn more about not only the educational project, but also the healthcare, water, and girl empowerment projects in the area.

Plan International USA, Inc.	288876	1	/users/profile/379080	Writer	Donor	5	05/06/2016	I work for Study Group, a global education company offering ELT and Higher Education opportunities for international students.  Study Group has been partnered with Plan International for many years, sponsoring a large project each year as part of our Building Futures initiative to bring quality education to communities around the globe who lack it.  I personally had the opportunity to visit our 2015 project in Sri Lanka, which was the construction of a new primary school in the northern region of Anuradhapura.  I certainly can attest to the great work Plan does in each of the communities they work in, and their model is one I wish all international development organizations followed.  Plan works at the grassroots level to not only build lasting relationships with each community they work in, but also makes sure to involve every part of the community in the design, construction, and implementation of any project they are facilitating.  This ensures long-term sustainability as the community feels a sense of ownership and also has emotional ties to the work being done to better their community for generations to come.  Visiting the 2015 school project we sponsored was an experience I'll never forget and makes me proud to know my company is partnering with an organization truly making a lasting difference in so many communities.

I believe in Plan, what they do and what they stand for.  I have pictures of my children on my desk where I see them often.  It warms my heart to help change their lives for the better.  I am a firm believer that, rather than be overwhelmed by all the "stuff" that goes on in the world, it is helping one-on-one that works.  It is a win-win.  If all of us did that, think of the result!  It is amazing what we can do if we just bring it down to that.   *** Thank you,Susan Stauffacher
Plan International USA, Inc.	273926		/users/profile/363241	Writer	Donor	5	12/07/2015	It was my father who taught me to think, to share, and to be generous.  It was my daughter and daughter-in-law who introduced me to Plan International, both were attending college at the time.  So it not surprising that I have given to educational institutions and more frequently scholarships to college students and to children of the third world.    Plan International was the perfect philanthropic organization for me as it provided children with the greatest need an opportunity to learn, the communities in which they lived an opportunity to improve their lives through knowledge, and an experience of a lifetime for the teachers and administrators in a far away land.  Giving to Plan outright and/or to a sponsored child gives the donor the satisfaction of helping so many with the gift of letters and numbers and the gift of hope and encouragement, good will and friendship.Make a difference in a young persons life, get acquainted with another world through newsletters and personal letters, and share your life with another to know the satisfaction of truly giving and taking.Peggy
Plan International USA, Inc.	272593	1	/users/profile/361669	Writer	Donor	4	11/20/2015	I've been a donor for the last 10+ years, even before we had our own children. Having grown up in a lower middle class family in India myself I was interested in making a difference to at least 1 child in India. I found Plan International. They allowed me to make the most effective use of my humble contribution, which otherwise I wouldn't know how to make it effective. I really liked the emphasis paid to schooling. I would receive letters from these kids, written in their native language, and it was very heartening to see how these kids progressed. Once we had our own kids I made sure that I shared the letters and photos of the kids in India who I was sponsoring. It really helped our own kids understand how it works in rest of the world. This is my 3rd child, and I am so very happy and proud that 2 children benefited from the humble contributions I made. I couldn't have done it without Plan International. Thanks a lot for continuing this work.

My world history students decided to sponsor a child for a year, and I continued the sponsorship of a girl from the Philippines. Since that time, I have sponsored several children from Africa and Asia. The latest young man from Burkina Faso was one of the most interesting and communicative. I will continue my sponsorship and encouragement of the program as long as possible and am considering a bequest in my will.

I am especially proud of Plan's Because I Am A Girl program, which has improved the lives and futures of so many girls around the world and in doing so, makes the world a better place for boys and girls alike.
Plan International USA, Inc.	269809	2	/users/profile/358543	Writer	Donor	5	10/30/2015	My daughter and I have been sponsoring a child through Plan for almost a year. I chose Plan because their model supports communities to solve their own problems. We got to see this in action several months ago when we went to visit our sponsored child in Nicaragua. The community had several projects that they were developing and implementing with financial and technical support from Plan, including creating a self-sustaining system for getting electricity into the community, literacy in the elementary school, and an anti-bullying programs run by teens in the community. The people who lived their, including the kids, came up with the problems and solutions, and Plan was there to provide resources needed to get it going. Our visit was amazing. We got to meet our sponsored child and her family, visit her school and home, and spend time playing with the kids and learning about their activities at school. I came away all the more convinced that Plan was the right choice for our donations.
Plan International USA, Inc.	267585	2	/users/profile/356319	Writer	Board Member	5	10/27/2015	I have been a strong supporter of Plan for years. They are an oxutstanding charity that forms lasting bonds with the people that they serve . I am particularly fond of Plan's Because I am a Girl Program. Their goal is to support girls' education in a variety of practical ways, like buying bikes for girls to get to school on time or paying tuition. As a donor, I love this, because I can see how my donation is being applied, and I often get a thank you note from the girls that I help, which is really moving.

I have visited Plan sites in the Dominican Republic and Ecuador over the last few years, and have been very impressed with their community based, grassroots approach to issues of education, health, and gender equality.  This organization strongly supports the rights of women and children, is very involved in birth registration in many countries, and has made a real impact on the day-to-day life of numerous individuals in many countries.  I was very impressed on my visits to see their support of small businesses started by women in both urban and rural communities, providing technical and financial support to aid these women in establishing self-sustaining businesses, develop banking skills and relationships, and be better able to support themselves and their families.  This organization truly helps communities evolve and grow in very practical and sustainable ways.

I saw first hand that Plan does an extraordinary job of making sure that our donations make a lasting impact in local communities.  I saw water wells that had been provided by Plan, schools built by Plan and a number of other wonderful projects that were developed and managed, with Plan's help, by the communities they benefit.  Plan does not just drill a well, take a picture and leave.  They work in communities for years and they work very hard to make sure their projects are sustainable.  After seeing the work that Plan does and seeing how engaged they are in the communities they serve, I know that the donations we make are helping children improve their lives and increasing their chances of finding their way out of poverty.  I wish we could do more.  
Plan International USA, Inc.	266099		/users/profile/354857	Writer	Donor	5	10/21/2015	Plan International is a great cause and they always keep you informed about the child you sponsor.  After initially picking a child from India, I have since let them pick children based on where they have the greatest need and the most difficulty getting sponsors.  They are easy to deal with and do not waste money with needless and costly spam.  I have been involved with them for 14 years now and hope to be able to do this for many years to follow.

Through Plan USA's programs, we have sponsored children in Kenya and Pakistan, which included writing letters back-and-forth and exchanging books and photos.  We have helped women with Micro-finance loans in Vietnam.  And, we were a lead sponsor to finish the construction of a  primary school in Togo, Africa.  The Plan USA organization makes a big impact in the lives of children around the world!  Their staff is very professional and knowledgeable. A 1st Class Organization for sure! They make a difference!

This has been only through writing---we were never able to visit any of them.  I feel that Plan has helped their communities with their living conditions and promoted education, especially among girls. Also, Plan has always been on the ground when a major catastrophe happens, as in Haiti, Nepal and during the Ebola crisis.  My daughter has agreed to maintain our support of Plan after we pass.
Plan International USA, Inc.	253483	2	/users/profile/341686	DenLo01	Donor	4	08/20/2015	I started donating about 18 years ago. The program fulfills the old adage of teaching a man to fish so that he will always have food in the future, not just today with today's handout. I really appreciate the Give Differently program in buying animals and cultivation products for families. I've lost track of how many children I've sponsored, but I'm proud of the good that has been done in each area.

I like that they partner with local organizations and leave a community when their end objectives have been met.

Plan International USA, Inc.	168086	2	/users/profile/222987	firefly123	Donor	1	09/06/2013	I'm sure that Plan International probably does a lot of good, but I will no longer be contributing to the organization, and it makes me sick that I have in the past.  I found out tonight after doing some internet research that Plan International has supported Reproductive Health Uganda, which is affiliated with Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the United States.   I have to agree with another reviewer who stated that Plan's marketing materials are very slick.  Plan has a highly touted campaign against sex-selective abortions in countries like India, a campaign which I would normally support if I wasn't aware of their aid to Reproductive Health Uganda.  As it is, my charitable dollars will be going elsewhere in the future.   I know many well-meaning folks will disagree with my views about abortion, as I have a lot of friends on the other side of the issue, but I'm not leaving this review for them.  I'm leaving this review for those like me who are opposed to abortion on demand and who don't want their charitable contributions going to organizations that support it.

Plan International USA, Inc.	147785	7	/users/profile/195539	ElizabethBL	Donor	1	01/07/2013	I started giving to  this organization when it had a different name, many years ago.  I sponsored  children and received letters from them, wrote back,  etc.  After a while I agreed to  let my monthly donation be p[aid directly by my credit card.  After that the letters dried up, and I no longer knew w ho or where my money was going.  After  several years of this,  my credit card expired and I got a letter asking for the new  information. I wrote back saying I had decided not to renew my msupport.  Surprise!  I immediate received two different letters from children in Africa - the actual country was not specified -  one wrote thanking me for "choosing  me to be your chld".    I feel I am being subjected to emotinal blackmail - I never agreed to resume if the organization  started arranging for letters again, but  I feel terrible about not anwering these  letters!  and of course,  there is an envelope enclosed so I can send my gifts by electronic funds transfer.

Plan International USA, Inc.	113044	6	/users/profile/153841	cupcakequeen	Donor	5	05/26/2012	Reading these reviews, many people seem to be disappointed with the sponsorship program.  You need to understand YOU ARE NO SPONSORING ONE CHILD!  Plan makes it very clear that they work on COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.  This means that your sponsor child is just a symbolic link to the COMMUNITY you're supporting.  They don't receive any more aid than another child in the community.  This might be why they don't have as strong of a connection with the donor as you might have hoped.   Additionally, people seem to be concerned that 1. administrative costs are increasing and 2. that communication is less than they'd like, without recognizing that you need admin to better communication. I recently had the opportunity to visit my sponsor child and her community, and I'm must say, I was incredibly impressed.  The local staff was efficient and friendly, and Plan organized the logistics of my visit for me.  I got to see the school, water access points, sanitation facilities and health care units that had previously been sent to me in photographs, so I know all correspondence I had with the community was accurate.  
Plan International USA, Inc.	102426	2	/users/profile/133470	markzion42	Donor	5	12/17/2011	My experience with Plan International USA is wonderful thus far. The organization keeps me well informed of their activities and innovative programs. I like the way Plan International USA focuses in on building communities at the local level through programs for children and collaboration with local (NGO) Non-Governmental Organizations. I have been sponsoring a girl in Kenya since the summer of this year. I received communication from the girl's father a few months after beginning sponsorship. The girl is only five years of age, and I was not expecting to receive written letters from her. I was very excited to receive communication from her father though, as he expressed the gratitude of their family. I just sent a second letter this morning. I look forward to becoming more involved with Plan International USA. 
Plan International USA, Inc.	97504	4	/users/profile/114504	fan of PLAN	Donor	5	09/15/2011	I have been a donor since 9/11 when I decided that we as a nation need to be doing more internationally to bridge the gap between the have's and the have nots. Since I did not want to go with a religious organization, and I wanted to have some interpersonal contact, and possibly go to visit my sponsor child, I researched hard and decided on PLAN. I am so glad I did. I have now sponsored, and also visited, two girls from different parts of Guatemala.  On both visits I was extremely impressed with the local staff and what they were doing in the very rural communities we visited. They are having a huge impact on many communities and many many children and families. It is one of the best things I have done in my 60 years and has culminated in a strong and permanent connection to Guatemala for me personally.  Like some of the other reviewers, I found it hard to have as much personal contact with my sponsored child as I would have preferred via letters. But after actually being in the communities, I realize that much of that is because we are dealing with different languages and cultures that do not have the kind of literacy we have in the U.S. I think it is more important for the staff to be out there helping people than figuring out how to communicate in a different language with someone from a different culture. And I'm not just talking English/Spanish, in my case with Guatemala, but one of the 22 different Mayan languages spoken in rural Guatemala. I am sure this is the same in most of the other countries PLAN operates in. They are doing a great job. Go see for yourself!
Plan International USA, Inc.	92248	6	/users/profile/105737	William Turner	Donor	3	06/27/2011	I began as a sponsor for this organization in the early 1970's when it was Foster Parents Plan. At the time, I had little money and wanted to make sure it went where it would do the most good. FPP had an extremely low administrative overhead, and I appreciated the blunt tone of their manually-typed correspondence. They were open about where my money was going, gave recommendations as to whether the family I was sponsoring would benefit from additional funds, and communicated clearly what they were doing to keep administrative costs down. Communications from the organization had the feel of coming from someone who really cared and was probably not being paid very much him/herself. Although nearly 30 years later I am still sponsoring multiple families through what is now Plan International, over time the organization has become increasingly "slick" in their communications, and that their administrative spending has been increasing relative to their program spending. This trend appears to be accelerating in the past few years. While I am continuing with the families I sponsor, my new donations are going to other organizations. As the current children I sponsor age out of the program, I will not renew with Plan.
Plan International USA, Inc.	92118	6	/users/profile/105567	sally vavrek	General Member of the Public	4	06/26/2011	I have never given money to Plan; in fact, I convinced my mother not to give to their child sponsorship a couple of years ago, because of the rating. However, I am now prepared to donate to this charity because of the work I saw they were doing in Zimbabwe. I have just returned from a mission trip there where we are supporting an orphan trust. Everywhere I went, people at schools and clinics were saying that PLAN had made contributions and donations that were invaluable. Anyone who helps my friends is a friend to me. I also am pleased that they have no religious or government affiliation. 
Plan International USA, Inc.	81282		/users/profile/88927	Child Sponsor	Donor	2	03/06/2011	I am not fully satisfied with my sponsorship with Plan USA.  I began sponsoring just over a year ago.  I also have sponsored with several other organizations and developed my own case study.  There are others that I like more than this one.  I have been sponsoring for 1.5 years and I have received one communication from my child.  I feel as though I am blindly sponsoring this child. I know that most of the reason to sponsor a child is for what the organization has to offer, but I feel that there are other things that my child may need, and communicating with her sponsor is one of them that may encourage her not to marry at age 13 like her mother.  She is about 10 years old already. What I do like is that this is the only organization that I have found that sponsors children in China.  Although, my child is not in China, I would like to sponsor a child in China in the future.

Instead, they quietly provide support and a "home away from home" for people when they are distressed over the life and care of children.  Our company has proudly "adopted" a room at RMH Providence for multiple years due to the House's dedication to mission:  to provide services that assist families during times of medical crisis. I have visited RMH Providence on multiple occasions, and always find a helpful smile, strong leadership, and genuine hospitality to all who enter their doors.  The city and families across Rhode Island are very fortunate to have the House.

The PRMH is truly a home away from home when families are dealing with a very serious illness with a child.   I became involved in a RMH years ago and when we had a son who was very ill  with cancer, we were fortunate enough to live close to the hospital he was treated in .  We were able to see first hand , families who had no where to stay and often lived in their vehicles.

Ronald Mcdonald House of Providence Inc	168452	3	/users/profile/223349	Mary195	Donor	5	09/08/2013	When our oldest son was born, we never knew about the Ronald McDonald House or how it would play such a significant role in the life of our family.  While we had heard of the organization, we had never been intimately aware of the physical and emotional support that they provide to families in need.  While our son was in the intensive care unit at Women & Infants, we tried to keep a round the clock bedside vigil.  When I was released from the hospital after 48 hours accomplishing that became a difficult task because there was nowhere to change our clothes, wash or rest.  The social work staff referred us at that time to the Ronald McDonald House. What the PRMH provided us was a clean bed; plentiful, nutritious food; a warm shower; a smiling face to greet us each day and an attentive listener if we needed to unburden ourselves.  Best of all, it was right across the street from our baby.   During our stay we met other families at the house.  There was a young couple whose daughter had been born three months prematurely on the Cape; she had been transferred to W&I and the mother was staying at the PRMH for the duration.  We also met several families from Greece whose children were being treated for congenital defects at Hasbro Hospital.  And we met some incredible volunteers.  When my father and uncle left the hospital to check us in at RMH, they came back with full stomachs; the volunteers had insisted that they stay for a meatball dinner.  One Sunday morning, I recall a couple of older women making us a delicious hearty breakfast and letting us talk at length about our son. Everyone we met there was truly special. One year later, our second son was born and he too was admitted to the intensive care unit.  Again, we availed ourselves of PRMH.  In fact, I almost felt compelled to pre-register before delivering again in 2004.  Thankfully that son was born healthy but it was reassuring to know that there was a friendly, convenient, safe and affordable place to stay if circumstances had been different. The Ronald McDonald House only charges its guests if they can afford to pay.  Maximum charge per day is $10.  Generous donors cover other expenses and most is raised on their annual walk.  Please consider making a donation.  Your gift will assist families in what may be their greatest time of need.
Ronald Mcdonald House of Providence Inc	168037	2	/users/profile/222927	CEH2013	Board Member	5	09/06/2013	Although I currently serve as a board member, nine years ago my only nephew was born when my sister was a mere 28 weeks pregnant. As a resident of MA, she was fortunate that RMH had "room at the inn", so to speak. The intensity of the decisions that she and her husband needed to make regarding their son's health far exceeded anything I had ever dealt with when my sons were born. This was my first introduction to any of the Ronald McDonald Houses. As a bystander, an ear, a shoulder or a supplier of personal supplies when necessary, I stood in awe of this House which had given my sister and brother in law a place to retreat and sleep and make these ever so important decisions. The volunteers at this House are loving and kind and they listen, and they clean and they answer the phone to relay incredibly important and hopefully joyful messages, messages like "He's definitely strong enough and weighs enough to go home". When that news was delivered, my one resolve was to somehow give back to the House. I started by raising money when I ran endurance races, when the opportunity to become involved at a committee, and then a board level arose he decision was simple. Ultimately, the goal at the board level is to ensure that we can provide comfort for as many people as possible and to maintain a true home for folks who desperately need a room close to their child.  
Ronald Mcdonald House of Providence Inc	154025	1	/users/profile/204851	Joanna8	Client Served	5	04/10/2013	After an unexpected , early, and scary delivery , I spent two months at PRMH while my daughter was across the street at the Women&Infants NICU. Over two hours from my home, my husband and I were faced with the reality that we would either spend a fortune on a hotel or essentially miss out on the first two months of our child's life. When the hospital suggested the PRMH I felt uneasy - I didn't want to be a charity case. Walking in to the house the first night, I cried. The warmth I felt from the volunteers and other families was overwhelming. I recieved so much support and love within those walls and never once felt pitied or judged. While staying there I was able to bond with my daughter during those crucial months. I was able to give my daughter my heart while having the retreat of PRMH just steps away. The moments I cherish most from the house are having a midnight bowl of cereal in the kitchen and being able to blow kisses goodnight to my daughters hospital room window.  Also, doing my very first load of heavenly smelling baby laundry and folding it in the family room. These moments are priceless to me and I thank PRMH for all that they have done for my family. 
Ronald Mcdonald House of Providence Inc	153408	1	/users/profile/204213	Ryan28	Client Served	5	04/08/2013	Last month my youngest son was born pre-term and experienced difficulty breathing and eating. The little guy ended up spending a week in the NICU at Women and Infants. This week pales in comparison to the ordeals that many other families and babies will experience in the W&I NICU. However, my family lives about an hour from W&I and we still needed to care for our two year old son, while being there for the baby.  Being invited to stay at the Ronald McDonald House allowed me to do both with little hardship. I could come and go from the NICU as I pleased which allowed me to assist my wife who spent most of her time there nursing and caring for our baby. This arrangement also allowed my wife to see our two year old son often throughout the day and for him to meet his new baby brother. Honestly, the Ronald McDonald House turned what could have been a frustrating and emotional week into a sort of mini vacation for my two year old son and I. The room was comfortable and homey. The kitchen was huge and accommodating for my picky toddler. The beautiful basement family room provided a regular retreat where my son and I shared a lot of laughs and hugs - he even made some new playmates there! On sunny days he begged to play on the swing set outside. Every staff and volunteer was friendly and helpful.  I'm so grateful for my brief time at the Ronald McDonald House and I hope to contribute in whatever ways I can to help other future guests.

My husband and I and our 6 yr old son Conner stayed there in June 2011 after Conner was involved in a lawnmower accident in which he injured his foot.  We needed to be close to the hospital since Conner was requiring weekly procedures and additional surgeries.  Though I am from Rhode Island, we currently live in Georgia and were visiting my family when the accident occurred.  The RMH provided us a much needed home away from home, and I couldn't have asked for a better one.  From the staff to the volunteers to other families staying at the house, it was a great experience.  Loving support, hot meals, smiling faces and warm embraces helped get us through this difficult time.  They are a top notch organization and do so much for the local community.

I don't know what we would've done without the house. You can feel the kindness and compassion from the moment you walk through the doors. The volunteers are all such wonderful people. Each time we saw them, we were greeted with a smile and asked how our son was doing. I can't tell you how much that meant to us.  It was such a relief to know that at the end of our day we knew we would return "home" to a hot meal and smiling faces. The volunteers even put together a Thanksgiving meal for us. That truly touched my heart. We were able to bring our son home on Thanksgiving, but it was very moving to know that these people were spending their holiday at the house, providing a holiday meal for perfect strangers instead of dining with their families. This is a very special place. Although the time we spent there was short in comparison to some families,   our lives were forever changed by it. The kindness, compassion and support we were given while there showed us that good still does exist in this world. We will never, ever forget the RMH Providence for all that they did for us.

When we left the house, the circumstances were not good. We were bringing Ben home because there was nothing more that could be done for him. When we told the staff we were sending someone to clean our room and pack our stuff, they insisted they would do it for us. What a huge help! One less thing for us to have to do! We will always be thankful for the support we received during our stay there. And though it is a very difficult time to think about, we couldn't be more thankful that the house was there for us.

They do whatever they can when they can simply because they love helping people. From the very beginning they have always been dedicated in their mission and have never wavered. They sacrifice much of their own lives for others and work together with other agencies to not only feed people but improve the quality of their lives. They have kept many from going hungry but have also made many people feel loved and cared for. In these times we live in this is so very important and we need more people like this group in the world.
Be The Change Sunday Meal	313212	3	/users/profile/404584	robertal	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	Coreen St Jean and her group of volunteers are amazing. I learned about her organization almost a year ago. I have seen the tremendous support that "Be the Change" offers to the less fortunate in our community.  I also see Coreen and her group give 100% of their time and effort not only cooking, preparing meals, and serving food, but working on all kinds of ways on making life better. Clothing drives, food drives, school supplies, toiletries drives, events to raise money and 100% of money goes to the organization. It's a great organization for our community. 
Be The Change Sunday Meal	313038	3	/users/profile/404407	Nicole171	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	Homemade marinara simmered on my stove and in the oven Chicken Florentine. It was time to join the rest of the Sunday cooks. Like a royals feast laid tins of meatballs, pasta, salad, vegetables, breads & desserts. Our friends waited by the door of the former ice cream shop turned buffet hall. There are families with infants and others who partake in the banquet. The group is diverse in age and ethnicity but have a commonality: They are the destitute and homeless in our local area. The cooks have a commonality: We are a group of volunteers who believe that no one regardless of poor economic circumstance should be without a home-cooked meal. Be the Change (BTC), is a registered 501(c)(3) charitable organization, and comprised of a group of community members. We use social media to organize meals and other items of need for the homeless and impoverished in West Warwick, RI and its surrounding areas. Our ask is simple: Please share our efforts to help us find new volunteers, inspire other communities to start their own BTC, and find monetary or tangible donations.

With the communities help we have been able to lift the spirits of so many. Each Sunday it's wonderful to be able to serve a hot, home cooked meal to the homeless and impoverished in West Warwick.  We also collect donations of toiletries and in the past have collected school supplies and now are collecting coats etc for the winter months to make things a little better for the people we help.

They feel they have right to these items because they put their time an effort into Be the Change for  "free"  Donated until I found one of the top staff members wearing clothing I donated for a drive  for homeless  well before the items were offered to homeless.

The organization recently had a FREE store for members of the public!!! Be the Change has just been such an awesome organization that makes sure that every single person is helped, and also that they too are special no matter the circumstances. I truly have seen the hard work that the founders have put in to make sure that people have food in their stomachs, clothes on their back, and even homes to live in.

I have given monetary donations. I am very impressed with the way this organization has helped needy people in our community they provide a Sunday meal to anyone in need. They have also brought our community together and there has been no shortage of people that want to help. The people who run this organization and the volunteers work very hard on a variety of projects to aid the needy. they even organized a bus to collect school supplies, they help homeless find housing and they help obtain donations for these people to help them move into their first apartment. They are a dedicated group of people and I am proud to have them in our community.

Be The Change Sunday Meal	312320	2	/users/profile/403673	Dianne28	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2016	Coreen St. Jean has taken this charity from a few small events organizing and accepting donations of clothes and food to feeding people on a weekly basis.    She has with the help of volunteers assisted people with housing that not many have been able to accomplish. This organization has grown in such a small amount of time it's inspiring. What a wonderful example how people can come together and help their community. 
Be The Change Sunday Meal	312317	4	/users/profile/403670	jenniferharritos	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I first learned about Be the Change a few years ago.  I can't believe what this group does for the community! They feed so many hungry people each week with great homemade dishes. They have fundraisers to benefit the community such as a fill the bus event that helped supply local schools with supplies and the generosity was outstanding! Free store,toiletries, sock and coat collections are always going on to help people in need. It's always about helping others.  Everything that is donated to Be the Change goes to help others!  Everything!  Not 1 penny is taken for themselves!  They pour their heart abc soul in everything they do!

New Urban Arts	10511	3	/users/profile/12395	L688	Volunteer	5	09/18/2009	NUA is one of the most incredible communities I've ever been a part of. The studio gives everyone who walks through the doors permission to be themselves, to grow, to experiment, to be honest, and to share. There is some sort of indescribable magic that happens at NUA. Every single time I came to the studio I left feeling more hopeful and happier than when I arrived. This place is a positive influence on everyone who is a part of it in any way. I really wish that more people could experience it.

New Urban Arts	9848	10	/users/profile/11674	DObalil	Board Member	5	09/02/2009	New Urban Arts manages to make everyone who comes into contact with it have hope for the future of Providence and the world.  As a board member for the past 7 years I've seen it grow and evolve - but most importantly, I've been able to grow and evolve with it.  My profession is as a non-profit leader and consultant, but much of my greatest learning in this field has come from my interaction with New Urban Arts.  That's what is so amazing about this organization - everyone is a learner, everyone is a teacher.  If we all carry that out into the rest of the world, we will be the change we want to see in the world.
New Urban Arts	9834	9	/users/profile/11658	paul	Client Served	5	09/01/2009	When I was a student at New Urban Arts I learned more about myself and the arts in a few weeks than I would have learned in a year elsewhere. The teaching methods had empowered me as a student to realize my potential. NUA had sparked my interest in poetry, photography, welding, ceramics, and many other art mediums. It had opened up a world of expression that as an inner-city youth I had no idea I could participate in.
New Urban Arts	9825	10	/users/profile/11649	ssmulyan	Board Member	5	09/01/2009	New Urban Arts is a great place, not only for the students and mentors, but for Board Members like me, as well.  I love the energy and the creativity the infuses the entire operation.

New Urban Arts	9704	14	/users/profile/11520	Pete	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/28/2009	After a long association as a board member, volunteer and financial contributor, I was an Artist Mentor Fellow for the last two years.  This means I worked with mentors to help them develop their teaching practice. After understanding the organization from a governance and, frankly theoretical point of view, being a Fellow allowed me to understand the real value of the organization -- and to see, feel, and know how New Urban Arts is an experience of both intellectual and embodied learning for youth and mentors. New Urban Arts is a strong organization in many ways, but it's also a revolutionary organization in its understanding of the dignity of all who participate and in the way that it values creative practice as tool for personal development and social change.
New Urban Arts	9703	1	/users/profile/11519	Emmy	Volunteer	5	08/28/2009	I was a mentor at New Urban Arts in 2006. It was a great experience. I remember everyone I met in my short time there. It was challenging, but really valuable. NUA does really amazing things for high school students. I remember a lot of my mentees telling me how terrible their public schools were: how art classes were cut entirely from the curriculum. And then to see these students doing something constructive and positive in their time outside of school was really great.
New Urban Arts	9667	1	/users/profile/11480	jbird	Volunteer	5	08/27/2009	New Urban Arts is the healthiest nonprofit I have ever been involved with. The staff is totally dedicated and supportive.

New Urban Arts	9662	1	/users/profile/11475	jinel91	General Member of the Public	5	08/27/2009	New Urban Arts is the kind of place that can make anyone smile and say, "This is great- we need more!" However, New Urban Arts is such a great find because we could definitely use more places like it. The studio space is homey and open to visitors of all walks of life. The students who work there are all focused on whatever creative project is at hand. There is a strong sense of unity and equality. Who knew such a small space could bare such great fruits of the arts and of human endeavors in creativity? The mentors and volunteers are full of patience, positive hands-on attitudes, acceptance and understanding, making the environment ideal for young learners and blossoming artists in the community.
New Urban Arts	9646	1	/users/profile/11459	Ustacular	Volunteer	5	08/27/2009	One of the most supportive and welcoming communities for young people and artists.  Truly a leader in the field of youth development and arts communities.

I lived in the building just next door and would always pop in on my way to/from the neighborhood coffee shop to see "what was up".  It was always something new and innovative.  The kids were always engaged, the mentors constantly amazed and the rest of us in awe of the power of art.thanx for being part of the 'hood and the community!

As a safe place for young people to explore their own creativity and have positive interactions with their peers while building their confidence, NUA has made an incredible contribution to our quality of place while strengthening Providence's reputation as an arts and cultural powerhouse. Thanks NUA students, mentors, staff and volunteers!!!!

New Urban Arts	9441	1	/users/profile/11252	Sothdra	Volunteer	5	08/21/2009	As a reserved, yet typical high school student searching for something to do after school, I was completely overwhelmed when I bumped into New Urban Arts. The second I stepped inside the studio I was immediately greeted warmly and given a tour. Upon deciding to return and become a member of New Urban Arts, I found myself also becoming a part of an incredibly supportive community. New Urban Arts allows students to think and create very freely without a trace of judgment or any expectations for that matter; this allows the student to be work without pressure. With the assistance of artist mentors, who learn just as much as their students do, students become immersed in the wonderful world of studio arts. After four years of being involved with New Urban Arts, I decided to become a mentor and give back to a place that has undoubtedly bettered my creative process.
New Urban Arts	9438	9	/users/profile/11249	FacelessAmaurys	Volunteer	5	08/21/2009	At New Urban Arts, the experience for me was very near phenomenal! It was great because practically everyone there shared interests similar to mine. So clearly, it is and was a very sociable environment for me. I highly recommend New Urban Arts to ANY art lovers, and anyone who is interested in learning new artistic skills. During my 6 week summer job, I learned how to paint, and sketch better than I ever did. The employees were very nice and friendly. New Urban Arts is indeed a wonderful place, and will be a great experience for anyone!

Narcolepsy Network, Inc.	317661		/users/profile/408797	hemie	Client Served	5	10/31/2016	I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy almost 20 years ago.  I don't remember how I found the Narcolepsy Network but I am and will always be so grateful that I did!!! My role for this review is "Client Serviced" .  I want to change that to "Client will always be served"  Once a PWN joins the NN they become part of a global organization that embraces and welcomes you with open arms into "the family".  We are brothers and sisters and we are bonded  for life.  The connection is unreal....The NN is all about US!!! They share resources, create awareness, fundraise for research, even fight when necessary to protect us.  The officers are volunteers and totally selfless.  Thank you NN for having my back, getting me,  not judging me, helping me, teaching me and guiding me.  I have had my share of challenging moments struggling,feeling all alone  and so frightened and terrified  but I always found my way back.  Always with the help of the Narcolepsy Network THANK YOU...xoxo

Narcolepsy Network, Inc.	316281	1	/users/profile/407546	sleepyguy19	Donor	5	10/28/2016	Being diagnosed with Narcolepsy can be a scary and disheartening experience. The NN community is helpful in so many ways, and it's great to see and get to know so many people who not only just cope, but excel and succeed in so many facets of life.

And they are popping up in the news more and more which is a big benefit not only to those who've had narcolepsy for years, but especially to those recently diagnosed.  Their online information for people with narcolepsy has proved valuable for me and my family many times and is a great resource for newly diagnosed patients and their families.
Narcolepsy Network, Inc.	316018	1	/users/profile/407287	Heather282	Volunteer	5	10/28/2016	My husband was diagnosed with narcolepsy in 2011 and everything changed for us after that.  We thought it was the end of the world with this diagnosis; meaning that he is no longer able to drive long distances anything over 15 minutes, no long trips unless I drive, needing to find a new job that understands that he needs naps everyday, and I'm sure about having a family. 5 years later we have moved closer to family for extra support and help when needed and we now have two beautiful children along with us building a house which he is managing most by himself, and working a full-time job.  Narcolepsy has changed our lives but for the better and with the help of this network organization we found support and no longer felt alone. We have met great people through this organization and still keep in touch to this day. Once things settle down with our family I will be getting more actively involved because it made such a difference for our family. Thank you narcolepsy Network for all your support and help! -Heather Dudeck 
Narcolepsy Network, Inc.	315916	1	/users/profile/407200	rahulkakkar	Board Member	5	10/28/2016	It is one of the most hard working and creative group of people who work to help PWNs and their families and friends. I am a professional and a board member and I have learnt a lot by coming to their conferences and speaking to the members.  The members creativity and intrigue aroused a big research interest amongst professional community recently. It is the narcolepsy  network community who raised questions about safety of undergoing anesthesia and sedation, a topic hitherto largely outside the radar of sleep research and anesthesia research. Now leading experts in both specialties are coming together to do more work in this field. Hats off to all the members and board members for facilitating this.

Having an "invisible condition" can be difficult, and the isolation of not knowing others who share your condition can make it that much harder to manage. Of the many programs and services it offers, I am most thankful for Narcolepsy Network's wonderful conferences it hosts each year which brings together patients, their supporters, and physicians, for a weekend full of education, awareness, and inspiration.

Narcolepsy Network, Inc.	315524	1	/users/profile/406846	JoyceAS55	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	Years ago I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy. I searched the web and found the link to Narcolepsy Network. From there I joined! It became the best thing I could ever do! I started getting quarterly newsletters. I would read every word - sometimes over and over again. I went to my first conference and it changed my life. Ever since then they have given me support, knowledge, comfort, and made me believe that I AM NOT ALONE!!!!

The annual conference is an absolutely amazing annual gathering of people with narcolepsy, researchers, advocates, supporters, and friends. I am not being hyperbolic when I say that the conference is a life-changing event. I have never felt so connected to such a large group of people, so quickly, in my entire life.
Narcolepsy Network, Inc.	315091	1	/users/profile/406427	Mark228	Board Member	5	10/26/2016	Narcolepsy Network is the 'Go To' organization for patients, families and supporters, and physicians dealing the chronic neurological condition narcolepsy. When my daughter was diagnosed in 2004, the NN annual conference was invaluable is providing me with information to give to her doctor to help with her treatments. I have been involved in the organization since that time and recommend it to all affected people.

It was a terrific experience centered around learning all of the good things this organization does by assisting families and their children celebrate birthdays during a hospital stay. I am happy to be a volunteer and look forward to the next opportunity.

This Charity stays focused on the children and the celebration of their special day with colorful, fun and meaningful party decorations and cards.  And she has volunteers from coast to coast who bring the party for the children right into the hospitals...nothing but love!  Quite amazing!

The Confetti Foundation	226174	1	/users/profile/289914	AMYBI	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2014	It's amazing what a difference one person can make. Stephanie and The Confetti Foundation are proving just that. From an idea in her heart for a long time, to realizing the dream and bringing birthday joy to kids in the hospitalsuch a beautiful story. The Confetti Foundation has already blessed so many sick children in such a short time and with support can do so much more.I can't say enough good things about The Confetti Foundation and what it does not only for the kids but for the families during what is a stressful time.  A simple idea. A huge impact. Truly 5 stars! 
The Confetti Foundation	226171	1	/users/profile/289910	Kath C.	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	The Confetti Foundation is fantastic! I am proud to say that my family and I have been volunteers and that we are so impressed by Stephanie Frazier Grimm and her team of Birthday Heroes and Birthday Fairies  the entire organization is absolutely amazing! The joy that The Confetti Foundation brings to children and families in the hospital setting is such a wonderful thing. So grateful for the drive Stephanie has to pay it forward and spread cheer where it is needed most. With Love, Kathleen Connerton & Family 
The Confetti Foundation	226170		/users/profile/289909	Soliday	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2014	A wonderful organization to assist children and families that need the help. I have a professional relationship with the founder and she sincerely is an amazing person with true spirit. 
The Confetti Foundation	226167	1	/users/profile/289906	Kristin52	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	This is such a wonderful organization and I absolutely love their mission. So much so, I sponsor them and also serve as a volunteer birthday fairy. As a mom, I can imagine the stress I would be under with a sick child in the hospital and it would be such a relief to know that I could focus on my child while someone else took care of his birthday decorations. A small effort that makes such a huge difference in someone's day!
The Confetti Foundation	226166	1	/users/profile/289905	Katie110	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	Just love helping Confetti Foundation spread love to children.  Stephanie, who runs the organization, has one of the biggest hearts.  She is so creative and has found the most unique and creative way to celebrate birthdays for sick children in hospital.  This organization is growing exponentially and deserves national attention!

The Confetti Foundation	217654	1	/users/profile/263061	Jan E.	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	The Confetti Foundation is a feel good for anybody who just cares! You don't need to know a sick child in a hospital to be involved.  I am lucky to be a Birthday Fairy who loves putting smiles on other people/children's faces. Stefanie Grimm and The Confetti Foundation make it very easy to give back.  A birthday box is  $22.00 and that is worth a million Happy Birthday parties! This is a well organized foundation that is going to grow fast and I am happy to be a part of it!
The Confetti Foundation	201569		/users/profile/263061	Jan E.	Volunteer	5	06/01/2014	I found the Confetti Foundation  through a mutual colleague on my Facebook page. The idea of volunteering and giving back is a very small part of my busy life as an event planner. The more I thought about the mission the more I was intrigued and realized that no matter how busy I was this was something I wanted to be involved with on a long time basis. I contacted Stephanie and after a brief conversation by phone and through emails I knew this was a perfect fit! I love children, I love doing happy things with them  and I felt there was no better way of spreading good cheer! Because of Stephanie's unbelievable commitment I get my daughter, sister-in-law and niece involved. I also celebrated a special birthday by asking friends and family to make donations. The Confetti Foundation makes a big difference in a sick child's life.  It also has made a big difference in my life.
The Confetti Foundation	216854	2	/users/profile/280375	jens_star	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I think this is such a great organization. When I deliver those boxes to the hospital and see all the children in there it makes me feel just a little better knowing what we do makes them smile and feel better even if it's just for one day. 
The Confetti Foundation	216834		/users/profile/280357	Lisa387	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	Love the Confetti Foundation and all that it does for children! Proud to be involved with this fantastic organization!
The Confetti Foundation	216798		/users/profile/280315	Tanya22	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	I'm completely in love with this charity's mission. So much so that I've signed up to be a volunteer Birthday Fairy in my area, and am constantly working on ways to raise money for their Foundation. Their mission is genuine, and they are a great Foundation to volunteer for. They are respectful of the families and present a sweet and quality Birthday Box with different themes, which ensures that every kid will be happy with their Box!  
The Confetti Foundation	203703		/users/profile/265733	GMD2014	Volunteer	5	06/25/2014	So proud to be part of this wonderful organization. Wonderful to see people from all over the country getting involved. The birthday party kits are cheerful and age-appropriate with fun, adorable themes. What a great way to brighten the day of a hospitalized child and their family. I can't even begin to imagine spending my birthday in a hospital as a kid. So great to know I can help to make a difference through my involvement with The Confetti Foundation.
The Confetti Foundation	201782		/users/profile/263316	kyliejjenkins	Volunteer	5	06/03/2014	This is such a wonderful cause! I am thrilled and honored to be a part of this organization and look forward to watching it grow bigger and bigger.
The Confetti Foundation	201559	3	/users/profile/263050	tunkymonkey	Volunteer	5	06/01/2014	I came across The Confetti Foundation on my Facebook by coincidence. As my curiosity serves me, i clicked on further. As I read more into what her (Stephanie) mission and her reason behind The Confetti Foundation, my heart skipped a beat for good reasons. As a parent who had a child in the hospital from the time of his birth to the time of his passing, i knew what a few minutes of a sweet distraction can be for a child and their parents. 30 mins, 10 mins or few seconds of joy, smile, love for the child(ren) can have without having to worry about the meds, pain, suffering. The Confetti Foundation provides that with their "party in a box". The supplies they provide a child with in the hopsital on their birthdays are simple, sweet and all from heart. We love the Confetti Foundation for so many reasons. They gave our team, our family and our friends a reason to give back to the hospital that cared so much for our son to the very end!

Rare Disease United Foundation	167799		/users/profile/222688	tnagle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/06/2013	Rare Disease United Foundation is an effective and efficient patient advocacy organization.  Their passion for making a difference is evident through their proactive outreach to patients and families as well as their powerful advocacy at the state level.  They have built credibility at the state level, as well as the national level, with key stakeholders, policy makers, and third party partners.  The patients and the volunteers are the hearts and hands that bring the mission of this organization to life!
Rare Disease United Foundation	167698		/users/profile/222564	BDCarter5	Client Served	5	09/05/2013	Being a parent of a child with a rare disorder is extremely challenging! It is just one of the many roles so many of us have been dealing with all alone. We are fortunate to have an online family support network for our child's condition but this can get pretty lonely as families are so far away. Each country and each state has their own guidelines, rules and services to navigate. When I first read the Providence Journal article about Patty Weltin and her goal to unite all of those touched by rare diseases, I felt tears of relief. Finally, it wasn't all about one disease or set of issues but rather uniting as a group that is dealing with so many of the same feelings, concerns and frustrations. The monthly support group meetings are a hidden gem. The advocacy is heart-warming. The high level of understanding and assistance provided for obtaining medications being used off-label has been a blessing. The many unique needs are a constant source of stress but having such a great advocate on my side, willing to help in any way possible, makes life just that much easier. Being a part of this foundation has brought hope to our family. Hope for more understanding, support  and compassion within the medical community, our political leaders, our friends and our families. Please, Care for Rare!
Rare Disease United Foundation	166962		/users/profile/221814	Nicholas O.	Board Member	5	09/04/2013	I am proud to be the first rare disease survivor that serves as President/Chair of the Rare Disease United Foundation's Board of Directors. I originally came to this organization through its "Care for Rare" survivorship support group meet ups. My goal was to meet people that are going through similar struggles as I face and seek peer-to-peer support. For me, I was not necessarily looking for others with my specific rare disease, rather people in my age group sharing similar issues of disability. Along the way, I learned more about parents with children of rare disease and other adults in my area with rare diseases that I still am grasping to understand and learn to pronounce. As I became more involved, I developed a passion for helping this organization grow. I believe that the strategic direction of RDUF to outreach directly to survivors and their family caregivers, advocate for systems change to promote better access to quality health care and social services for survivors, and generate a recognizable brand behind rare diseases that has been missing in the current landscape of nonprofit organizations supporting the rare disease community. It is my hope that RDUF will ascend as the lead organization on rare disease patient advocacy and public policy reform as this is the fast-track direction in which RDUF is heading. If you are a rare disease survivor or caregiver, this is the organization to seek support and information.  
Rare Disease United Foundation	166891		/users/profile/221739	Kim_87	General Member of the Public	5	09/04/2013	I am an advocate for a rare disease called FIRES. It is form of epilepsy that takes a previously healthy kid and puts them into status without warning. Rare Disease United Foundation helped us spread the word by putting us in a monthly letter they put out. They also gave the parents of these kids a place to find more information on FIRES and direct them to our page, so parents with the same problems can talk to someone who understands. Love, love, love Patty!

Rare Disease United Foundation	166222		/users/profile/220808	wfranz	Volunteer	5	08/27/2013	When my daughter got sick sudden in 2010 we did not know what was wrong with her and whether she would live or die.  Since then I have worked hard to help other parents in the same situation.  When I met Patty I knew I found another parent that wanted to change the world just like me.  We both say all the time that while our diseases are different our struggles are the same.  In being a part of the Rare Disease United Foundation I have met other parents going through the same thing as I am and I realize we are not alone.  Recently my daughter was  not approved, by the insurance company, for a medication she needs.  Patty said the foundation would get involved to help us get approval and I was so grateful for that.  It means I don't have to fight alone any more.

I have not been able to meet up with other parents as of yet due to scheduling issues. I do hope someday to meet other parents. I have connected through Facebook with parents who have the same genetic disorder as my daughter. It's amazing to hear things they are going through. Most of the parents are overseas unfortunately.

Patty Weltin and the Rare Disease United Foundation, (RDUF) helped me by listening. She took it upon herself to find resources that educated me and helped me to help my loved ones. Patty, the founder and executive director of RDUF, also connected me with people that had the same rare diseases, giving me an instant family that understood what my life was like and helped me with the helplessness I had been living with. The Rare Disease United Foundation is ESSENTIAL to the rare disease community. We need the RDUF to console us, to stand up for us, to fight at the state level for us! I'm not sure where I would be right now without their help. You need not live in isolation any more because the Rare Disease United Foundation and Patty Weltin are there for us. My deepest gratitude.

Then one day while shearing the internet i find the RI Rare Disease Foundation. Miss Weltin feels our pain and helps us find the right doctor. I am amazing that after few emails exchange that it leads us to the proper doctor to help my son. words cannot do justice to how i feel about the efforts and understanding we receive from Patty , I only thank god i found her for my son sake.

In so doing, it becomes not only a source of support for those with rare diseases, but also a network for communicating valuable medical information many may never have discovered otherwise.  For the millions of people with rare diseases--statistically, ten percent---the hope is the RIRDF will become a valuable, sought-after resource that will place both knowledge and comfort at the disposal of those needing them most.  Indeed, it already has.  While only a fledgeling entity, it has to date already begun to unite many, many people in these ways.

Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue	234315		/users/profile/298474	Tim_58	Client Served	5	11/23/2014	I can not emphasize enough how wonderful Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue...and its founder/owner/operator Pam Hood....are.  I found the Sweet Binks site way back in 2003 when I was thinking about adopting a pair of rabbits. Although there were several shelters closer to me, I drove an hour to meet Pam and check out the facility. From the start, it was evident that Pam knew SO much about rabbit care and I knew at once that I would adopt from her. Since that time, the shelter has grown enormously and I have adopted two other pairs of rabbits from her and also fostered a number of rabbits for Pam. Sweet Binks has rescued and saved so so many rabbits and set them up with great homes. It is amazing how much time and effort that Pam (and the volunteers that assist her) puts into running this fantastic organization. If you are thinking about adopting a rabbit, Sweet Binks is the place to go ! ! ! !  
Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue	234297		/users/profile/298455	thispersonalbanese	Client Served	5	11/23/2014	Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue is one of few organizations that cares exclusively for domestic rabbits. Growing up, my parents were among many to purchase an "Easter bunny" as a gift for my me and my siblings. Although we all believed otherwise at the time, we did not take proper care in raising this bunny or the ones that followed due to a lack of research and misconceptions. Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue takes great care of all rabbits that enter its shelter, and educates adopters to spread the right information about rabbit care! My girlfriend and I visited the shelter this weekend to find a bondmate (or partner) for our bunny Wazoo. We hope that Wazoo and his new bondmate Micky will turn out to be a match made in heaven. If not, we will be back again to work with Pam and the accommodating Sweet Binks to find that match! I love this organization, and look forward to its continued prosperity!

I have become a new adopter in early September, Pam made sure I knew what I was getting our family into and is always available for advice. When I got my second bun from them, she guided me through the bonding process via email. Any time I ask a question, she responds very promptly. The shelter is clean and you get to meet the buns before adopting. Best part is that you don't have to buy anything from the pet store for your bun before hand as they have everything you would ever need including ex-pens CHEAP! I highly recommend Sweet Binks and would adopt from them again and again!

Sweet Binks also helps with bonding of singleton buns, which is a very difficult process and many shelters (erroneously) do not allow you to bring your rabbit in to do 'speed dating.'  I've had 2 rabbits from Sweet Binks and would never buy from a pet store.  Rescue, don't buy!

It was a weekend and it was late.. I didn't expect a reply so soon ! I was contacted very quickly . The information I received was very helpful and I continued to ask questions and received very prompt honest friendly replies. When I'm ready to adopt another rabbit I will definitely travel to sweet binks. It isn't in my state but not too far.
Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue	234132		/users/profile/298241	Laura227	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2014	I always thought about adopting a rabbit, but was hesitant due to having a cat. SweetBinks was so helpful. I adopted a rabbit that fell in love with my cat. They are a perfect pair. Now that I also have a dog, all three play and snuggle together. 
Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue	234131		/users/profile/298239	Sparkie99	Client Served	5	11/20/2014	I adopted a wonderful rescue rabbit from Sweet Binks Rabbit Rescue.  My adoption experience was amazing.  I was given plenty of time to get introduced to the available rabbits and given expert information on the care of the rabbit.  The special little guy I adopted had already been spade and was on a program to ensure a healthy life.  The application process is detailed as Sweet Binks is a very responsible rescue and genuinely cares about where the rabbits find their forever home.  Really love this rescue and I will be back for more!

West Place Animal Sanctuary	96985		/users/profile/113367	merrittwalsh	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/31/2011	My first visit to the Animal Sanctuary was about 2 years ago, when I dropped of a box of orphaned baby geese from the RI Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic.  I've been involved in the field for 10 years and this sanctuary is by far the most beautiful, up-kept, and caring facility I have seen. Each animal, whether great or small is treated like a beloved family member with all the medical attention, patience, and tenderness you could imagine.     The grounds look straight out of a fairy tale book; with flower gardens, duck pond, hills, fields, and white paddock fences.  Its one of my favorite places to visit in Rhode Island.   
West Place Animal Sanctuary	96709		/users/profile/112958	thump	General Member of the Public	5	08/27/2011	West Place Animal Sanctury is a beautiful small farm whose owners have rescued various types of animals, i.e. various types of birds, goats, sheep, horses, cows, cats, and dogs: providing loving care at their own expense. Many of these animals were injured, unwanted, or left without their parent to care for them. An example is a flock of baby wild turkeys who lost their parents. Wendy cared for them until they were able to live on their own. One was a runt with a broken leg and wing who would never be capable of living in the wild. With the care of a vet,she nursed it back to health and takes care of it on the farm. Really extraordinary.                       
West Place Animal Sanctuary	96686		/users/profile/112907	1CDK	Client Served	5	08/26/2011	West Place Animal Sanctuary rescued a horse that was very dear to me.  Since he was rescued, his quality of life has increased greatly.  He came from a rocky and dusty paddock and now thrives in a field of tall green grass.  He was always alone and now lives with another horse and an assortment of cows, goats, ducks, and the most BEAUTIFUL swans.  To see him standing beside a swan, a greyhound and a bunch of ducks is a very funny sight.  Each time I visit, I am amazed at the personal attention and care that each animal receives.  Before coming to West Place Animal Sanctuary this horse suffered from a long and painful illness involving his two front feet.  He wore shoes that were heavy and thickly padded and caused him to trip frequently.  He spent so many hours laying down in his paddock that people passing by would stop to offer help.  Now, after receiving awesome veterinary care he stands for as long as he likes AND stands barefoot!  As a community, our lives are richer, more humble, and compassionate by the examples set by West Place Animal Sanctuary.

West Place Animal Sanctuary	96411		/users/profile/112287	humfry14	General Member of the Public	5	08/23/2011	Invisible from the road, when you drive up the driveway you find a haven for a myriad of animals.  From a retired racing greyhound, to aging horses, rescued domestic ducks and rehabilitating wild turkeys this sanctuary has a place for everyone.  The outreach to the community is enhanced by its proximity to a local Land Trust park.  I seen many of their animals come to their final resting place as well as many rehabilitated and sent back into nature.  All of them were treated with care, dignity and love.  The best thing WPAS could do is fundraise to be able top employ full time help.  This would increase their ability to rehab more wildlife.
West Place Animal Sanctuary	96409		/users/profile/112285	tommyj	Advisor	5	08/23/2011	Since it's inception, this non-profit for animals has been top-notch.  A wonderful concept, flawlessly run.
West Place Animal Sanctuary	96408		/users/profile/112284	Nick23	General Member of the Public	5	08/23/2011	West Place Animal Sanctuary is a remarkable haven for all sorts of fauna and fowl.  I have known the caretakers of this property for many years, and can truly attest to the fact that they develop a deep and personal relationship with each and every animal who arrives and spends any amount of time there.  Whether it's a migratory bird with an injured foot in need of a few days' rest and rehabilitation, or a displaced farm animal in need of long term care and permanent shelter, all new arrivals and residents alike receive the same impeccable care and utmost attention to their every need, while benefiting from the safety and security of a beautiful facility which somehow seems to be constantly expanding and improving. Indeed, West Place has grown in recent years from a small part -time operation to a full scale refuge for all kinds of animals in need.  I have witnessed firsthand this transformation, which can only be explained as a labor of love.  From the contruction of a brand new barn with state of the art stall and feeding facilities, to the redesign, landscaping and detailing of the onsite pond which provides an astonishingly natural-like habititat for birds and fish alike, or the seemingly ever-expanding area of paddock designated for the happy grazing of the numerous four-legged residents, it is obvious that at West Place, the wellbeing of all furry and winged residents takes precedence over everything else.  It has been a truly enjoyable and spiritually rewarding experience to watch West Place become what it is today, and it is good to know that so many of our animal friends here in Rhode Island can now have a chance to benefit from such a perfect sanctuary where they are provided with round the clock treatment, care and love in order to get a much-deserved second chance.  
West Place Animal Sanctuary	96405		/users/profile/112278	ADoucet	Board Member	5	08/23/2011	A beneficial organization to animals.  The care is genuine and the education they provide to children and adults alike is well received.
West Place Animal Sanctuary	96295		/users/profile/112102	wtaylor	Board Member	5	08/22/2011	This peaceful sanctuary gives both unwanted farm animals and injured wild ducks and wild turkeys a fresh start.  Organized by a DEM permitted wildlife rehabilitator, West Place has a constant influx of waterfowl and Eastern American wild turkeys, providing food, shelter, care and necessary medical attention.  The animals are also utilized to educate the public, by appearing at festivals and Easter Egg hunts around the area.  Animals of the sanctuary have been featured in various newspapers and the RI Bar Journal.

I am proud to contribute and highly recommend AIDS Relief International as a GREAT non-profit.
AIDS Relief International	44569	8	/users/profile/45474	maurie	Donor	4	06/19/2010	I was first approached by one of the founders in the summer of 2008 about the potential of this project.  Using nutritional supplements to boost the efficacy of the AIDS medicine is a very enticing idea.  I must admit, I was taken by the passion and tenacity of these Brown students.  I wish I had more contact with the students.  Receiving more regular updates (via blog, email, or letter) would make me feel more connected to the excellent work they are doing and encourage me to donate in the future.

AIDS Relief International	44316	7	/users/profile/45229	asroos	Board Member	5	06/17/2010	AIDS Relief International's work so far is a great program because it is designed to target a specific and very important need of AIDS patients--proper nutrition.  This is an area often overlooked by traditional AIDS organizations, and also by the Indian government.  We are working to address this need, and hope to carry success over to other patients across the globe
AIDS Relief International	44308	5	/users/profile/45221	ava0551	General Member of the Public	5	06/17/2010	AIDS Relief International is dedicated to supporting the millions of patients around the world who struggle with HIV/AIDS. They have identified several aspects of international relief efforts which require additional focus, and areas where they can contribute in a unique, specialized way. Specifically, they are providing nutritional supplementation and medication delivery services to help fulfill the basic requirements for adequate therapy. They have excellent contacts in Mumbai, India, and have demonstrated both an ability and a desire to make a significant impact on the impoverished HIV/AIDS population. The cumulative accomplishments of members within the group are beyond impressive, and I predict that their current endeavor will equal or surpass their past achievements.

We have gained the support of the Rhode Island community and of several professors and students at Brown University, recruited many additional members, fundraised strongly, and spread the word about our work through newspaper articles and events. We are incredibly passionate about helping patients who are suffering from HIV/AIDS, which keeps us motivated to pursue better methods. Currently, we are providing nutrition to children in a hospital in Mumbai who are having trouble processing their antiretroviral medications because they have been declared severely malnourished by a doctor. I am proud that we have worked to understand the countries in which we are creating our programs as to make changes that will be sustainable and accepted by the communities.

The results they are getting and helping all children grow up healthy no matter where they live on this earth is what we should all strive for. Make a change!

From inside out, this non-profit is full of greatness, generosity, and care. I had a chance to work with Edesia on one occasion, so far. I volunteered to organize a Zumbathon for them, which turned out to be a big success, with over 50 people participating. As a part of an organization process prior to the event, I was taken on a facility tour and was shown how everything works: from measuring child's arm and determining how severely he/she is malnourished, to food lab, to packaging of the miracle supplement. Everyone I encountered was nice and kind, ready to tell their own story how they found Edesia and how proud they are to be a part of this great organization.

I was privileged to be given a tour of the newly opened high tech plant in the Quonset Point Industrial Park. I saw first hand the dedication of the staff to keep the cartons rolling off the belts for rapid shipment to crisis areas around the world. USAID purchases the product and distributes it as quickly as they can to troubled areas such as Haiti and Syria. Lives are being saved every day because of the dedication of the staff, many of whom are skilled refugees who know the cost of war and natural disasters personally. This organization is definitely worthy of a visit and your support.

After leaving the public school, I have noticed some big improvements in their attitude towards school.  As a mom, it delights me to see that they are excited to try new things and are no longer hindered by a fear of failure.  All four of my children attend BCA and it has been incredible to see them blossom in this grace-filled, joy-bursting, and academically challenging school!  The teachers go above and beyond to create a nurturing but structured environment.  Another plus - I love that my elementary, middle, and high school children can attend school together - only one school to drop off all four kids!!

Speaking as someone who has volunteered at two other Christian schools,  I have never seen more devoted teachers filled with Godly counsel.  They truly consider the education of our children to be their mission field.  It's been quite humbling.   Also, through BCA's variety of leadership and missionary programs, we have witnessed our child grow both personally and spiritually into a young man who is aware of his gifts and is well-prepared for the challenges he will face in the coming years.  In short, Barrington Christian Academy is passionate about equipping our children to be academically gifted with missionary hearts so that they may glorify our LORD and Savior in whatever vocation they are called to.

Chase The Cure, Inc	189299		/users/profile/247040	Kathy145	Client Served	5	11/25/2013	As a mother of a child afflicted with NPC, I can attest to the fact that Chase The Cure, truly cares about our children.  Shannon Reedy personally makes phone calls, does research and offers advice, connects parents with researchers and medical doctors.  She goes beyond the call of duty to ensure our children's needs are met.

The research, testing and treatment is extremely expensive.  Any support you can offer makes a difference.

Amos House	87230	2	/users/profile/97862	Creighton93	Board Member	5	04/26/2011	The Amos House is a first rate organization.  The Executive Director, Eileen Hayes, cares about her employees and everyone who uses the Amos House, like her own children.  Her dedication to the Amos House mission is unlike anything I have experienced in my years of business experience.  That is why it is no coincidence that the Amos House is a success and a model for how non profits should operate. It is all part of the bigger strategic plan.  The Amos House is successful also because it is not just about helping people, it is about helping people help themselves, which in the long run makes the persons success sustainable.  The Amos House gives you the tools to succeed and then it is up to you.  
Amos House	86690	1	/users/profile/97134	board	Board Member	5	04/21/2011	Amos helps the poorest of the poor in the community.  In addition to providing meals, housing, counseling, medical and rental assistance, the agency is committed to turning lives around through teaching skills and providing employment opportunities through its social ventures.  This includes a restaurant, catering business, and building contractor services.  
Amos House	86273	1	/users/profile/96521	Peter W.	Board Member	5	04/19/2011	Amos House, what can you say.  They provide services for the most challanged population with compassion and dignity.  Amos House has also taken on enterprises that help get people jobs, such as the home improvement business and the restaraunt business.   Without this organization, there would be no place for many of this population to go.  These are humans who have had issues in their lives, but still are given a chance to suceed. Amos House is well run, and is a great organization.  Can't say enough about the total approach they take when dealing with their clients, it is a great model, and great for Rhode Island.
Amos House	86272	1	/users/profile/96519	tmoorf	Board Member	5	04/19/2011	As a volunteer, donor and board member, Amos House is an amazing organization affecting real change in people's lives.  Amos House gives people a second chance and provides them not only food and social services, but the tools and skills to turn their life around.  The staff is incredibly dedicated and hard working and I regularly hear people in the Amos House programs talk about how grateful they are for Amos House. 
Amos House	86113	2	/users/profile/96275	pvddonor	Donor	5	04/18/2011	I choose to give to Amos House because I like that my donation is working to elicite long term change and not just a short term fix.  I never doubt that my money is going exactly where it is most needed.
Urban Collaborative	147758		/users/profile/195499	Gary F	Board Member	5	01/07/2013	UCAP is a school that provides a critical need for middle school students at risk of dropping out.  80% of the schools students live in poverty and 51% reside in households where English is not the primary language.  The schools programs allow students to complete three grades in two years allowing the student to head into high school on time.  Everyone that I have had an opportunity to meet at the school has shown an extreme amount of energy and devotion to the students attending UCAP. They really care!   I would recommend that you call to arrange a visit to see this for yourself as well as to see the expansion of the school, which will include a new gymnasium, art studio and science lab.  
Urban Collaborative	147549		/users/profile/195146	jeffreyxcav	Board Member	5	01/02/2013	This school for middle school students at risk of dropping out is so unique.  First, it tackles one of the most difficult issues in education head on.  Second, it is effective and finally, it is an efficiently run non-profit.  Funds are channeled directly into programs that enable these kids to beat the odds!
Urban Collaborative	147267		/users/profile/194563	tsburman	Volunteer	5	12/26/2012	Unique school that takes at-risk youth who have stayed behind in middle or elementary school and works with them to get them to complete 2 grade levels in 1 year or 3 levels in 2! Amazing teachers and administration that care about each child, they take the time to help students to get back on grade to continue their high school years with same age peers. UCAP works hard to allow students to gain the opportunity to graduate with their peers helps to reduce high school drop out rates! 
Urban Collaborative	147046		/users/profile/194182	Haffenreffer David	Board Member	5	12/20/2012	I first became aware of UCAP years ago. Their mission is to help kids that are in danger of flunking out of school. These children for many different reasons had been held back for one or two grades and thus were highly likely to drop out. At UCAP these kids can make up the lost ground and graduate from high school with their peers. They have an 75% chance of graduating from high school which is far higher than their peers who have not gone to UCAP. This mission appealed to me because the children were being given a second chance just like I had been given a second chance by a kindly man who accepted me into his school when I had been asked to leave my prior school. Everyone deserves a second chance!
Urban Collaborative	146934	1	/users/profile/193997	C.Worthy	Donor	5	12/18/2012	The first time I walked into UCAP, the poise and confidence of my student host  told me this was a good, safe place, a place where youngsters who'd repeated an elementary grade could accelerate, could catch up.  My host was proud of her school; she had expectations ("I want to go to college and law school.").   I taught 8th grade for 15 years; I believe Middle school is the last chance for kids to develop strong skills and intellectual curiosity not only for the challenges of high school, but also for life.  If they can't find success, if they don't "belong," if they don't have aspirations for the future, they can easily fall through the cracks in another school, and never go on to earn that high school diploma.  What are the job prospects for a young adult who has no diploma?  UCAP's remarkable teachers and staff pull them up and give kids that second chance.  UCAP provides them a future.
Frontlines Missions And Ministries Inc	82920		/users/profile/91686	my2ndlife	Volunteer	5	03/22/2011	I've been involved with Frontlines for a number of years and my life has been changed.  I can't imagine not returning to the mountain villages of Campur Guatemala with Frontlines. The only thing I would change is to be able to go more or stay longer!   The founders (a married couple) have been in the ministry for decades. They have primarily been preachers, but Frontlines is their main ministry now.  I believe their daughter did go on the board a few years ago and a new director is also becoming involved as the founders are older and probably won't be able to continue the work themselves much longer.   I have had the opportunity to work in several different areas on the trips and things have generally been very well organized and with good attention to preparation.  There is always someone to go to with a question or problem and there is a feeling among team members of being part of a family by the end of the trip.  Going back to Campur feels like going home for a family reunion.  There are some people who have been going to Guatemala for many more years than I and still come back every year.   Unlike some organizations that work with just medical needs or are involved in evangelism, Frontlines usually has three different teams each year.  They have a medical team that works in the village that the mission is based in as well as outlying villages where people are too far away to walk to Campur.  There is a construction team that either helps to build a church or works on the construction of the children's home (Casa Heidi).  There is also at least one and sometimes two evangelism teams that go out into the mountain villages to work with children.  It has been wonderful to see the relationship with the local Kekchi people build over the years that frontlines has been going there.  There are two locals, Santiago and Pedro, who are like team members themselves.  There is a local Assemblies of God Church that Frontines works with and there seems to be a great relationship with the pastor of the church. The children's home has taken a few years to build.  Frontlines is not a big organization and they depend on donations, which of course affects what can be done for construction.  There is now a guatemalan couple (a doctor and a pastor) that have moved into the children's home to get programs going while the rest of the construction is done.  I have given a significant amount of money to Frontlines over the years and have never had a concern about how the funds are handled.     
Frontlines Missions And Ministries Inc	82880		/users/profile/91650	Joe L	Volunteer	5	03/22/2011	Frontlines Missions & Ministries is a hard working Missions Team. I cannot understand why this person would say a negative word about them. I have been to Guatemala with Frontlines two years in a row now. We have been blessed by the leadership & team members. A hard working group from top to bottom. I would encourage anyone to go with the team, you will be blessed. 
Frontlines Missions And Ministries Inc	82765		/users/profile/91480	sistergirl	Volunteer	5	03/21/2011	I can not express the experiences that I have had with Frontlines Missions.  I have been going to Guatemala with this group for near 10 years and I have been truly blessed. I would recommend taking a mission trip with the organization anytime.  I have felt safe and all the travel has always been organized and smooth from the airport to Campur.  As for the board members they are very experienced in what they are doing and I have no questions as to their dependability and transparency.I have done everything from kp duty (kitchen), medical, evangelistic, and also the interior team.  Nothing has ever been more satisfying.
Frontlines Missions And Ministries Inc	82756		/users/profile/91468	Rick M.	General Member of the Public	5	03/21/2011	In all my years of knowing the founder of this great Ministry I have never expierienced any type of misleading or misconduct of this exceptional man of God, nor have I heard anything bad about what the ministry does for the people of Guatamala. I have worked closly and have had personal friendships with not only the founder of the ministry but many of the people who have volenteered. Everything is done in great respect for the work God has done and is doing through this ministry and its volunteers.  For anyone who attacks what God has a hand on is wrong and needs to check themselves in Prayer.  I leave you with this.  And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.     Romans 8:28. 
Ocean State Theatre Company Inc	245506		/users/profile/63211	jfiedler	General Member of the Public	1	06/17/2015	This non-profit has been deceiving donors about their relationship with the owner of the property known as Theatre by the Sea in Matunuck, RI.  Based on the sharp decline in their donations recently it is clear that donors are finally realizing that their support of the organization known as OSTC (Ocean State Theatre Company) is not what they thought.  Donors are interested in supporting the building AND the current producer at the Theatre by the Sea, Bill Hanney.
Ocean State Theatre Company Inc	93524		/users/profile/63211	jfiedler	General Member of the Public	1	07/07/2011	This organization is not disclosing their relationship with the owner of the property known as "Theatre by the Sea" to their donors.  Donors think they are supporting the continuance of this theatre institution and grounds but in reality they are supporting a producing team that has a short term  lease with the property owner. Not one dollar of these donations can ensure the continuation of this theatre because the non-profit known as "Ocean State Theatre Company" does NOT own the building or grounds that people have known over the years as Theatre by the Sea. 
Ocean State Theatre Company Inc	58948		/users/profile/63211	jfiedler	Donor	2	12/19/2010	This non-profit has some problems with it's organization.  The two most senior paid staff are serving as President and Vice President of the Board.  They voted to increase their our salaries dispite the fact that the organization took in less money in the previous year.
Ocean State Theatre Company Inc	82080		/users/profile/90075	bizguru	Board Member	4	03/13/2011	As clarification and correction to previous comment, the referenced staff members are Board members, per the orgainization's bylaws.  Under their employment contract terms, they were entitled to pay increases. In fact, both individuals offered to forgo these increases. They recused themselves while the remainder of the Board considered, and declined, their offer. As all Board meeting minutes reflect, any Board member who might have a conflict of interest in a particular topic, recuses him or herself for the related discussions.
Grace Family Church of Rhode Island	171142		/users/profile/226691	Dianna6	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2013	I was blessed tremendously by Grace Family Church of RI by their Biblical Counseling Classes.  I am now a Certified Biblical Counselor and owe it all to the fantastic courses at this church.  Pastor Cozzi is an amazing man of God and an excellent teacher of the Word.  I am so thankful to have had the opportunity to spend countless hours at Grace church learning the Word and how to apply it to save lives!!  I will be forever grateful to Grace Family Church of RI!!
Grace Family Church of Rhode Island	171064		/users/profile/226574	esm7magic	Client Served	5	09/22/2013	I am honored and proud to write this review for Grace Family Church. Pastor Lucianno Cozzi is an incredible and effective Christian counselor.  He has provided us with counseling during some very difficult times, and I honestly don't know how we would have gotten through these times without his help.  I have been a Christian my entire life and have met many priests, pastors and ministers and I must say that Pastor Cozzi is true to what an ideal pastor should be.  He is selfless, honest, vastly knowledgeable in the Bible and is willing to teach others.  My husband and I took many biblical courses with him and it was absolutely life changing.  I also would like to state that Pastor Cozzi constantly helps this community and leads a very loving and kind congregation.  This church is so vastly needed and the community is so grateful for Grace Church and Pastor Cozzi.  In addition to his services to the community, Pastor Cozzi always makes himself available to anyone who needs him.  I have referred several other people to him for various reasons ( grief counseling etc).  
Grace Family Church of Rhode Island	171037		/users/profile/226546	Coppernoggin	Volunteer	5	09/22/2013	This may be a smaller congregation but it is very much alive and very loving. There is a love for the community and a desire to help. Whether it is volunteering at the local mission or raising donations to help three homeless shelters in the area or providing counseling to families in need in our community and beyond there is a love for the community we are in. It is like a family. When one member rejoices we all rejoice. When one suffers, we all suffer with , pray and serve them.
Grace Family Church of Rhode Island	171014		/users/profile/226502	Ms Peg	Donor	4	09/21/2013	Whenever I visit this church, I see a lively, diverse community worshiping together, even if there's no  formal service.  The members of this community join in outreach with other churches on various projects to benefit the neighborhood.  In addition to pastoral ministries, Grace Family Church offers counseling, training seminars, as well as spiritual resources.  The Bible studies I attended were informative and exciting with lots of give and take discussion.  This tiny store-front church is very big on hospitality.   I always feel welcomed and valued.

I was on her during a Med cruise and again in 'Nam while I was an Avaiation Fire Control Technician (AQ) attached to VF-103. There never was , nor will there ever be a better, more proud ship than the Sara. While she was on the Delaware river, in Philadelphia, I was able to pull alongside of her in my 26' boat. My very young sons eyes lit up when I told him that this was the ship Daddy had spent many a day and night on while deployed in Vietnam. We were able to reach out and touch Sara's hull, which instantly brought back many memories. At the time, he didn't realize how important those years were to me, but now, as an 18 year old, his passion for his heritage, includes stories I have told him, and now, Sara is part of him as well.

Which to me is dispicable and The SARA should be in Jacksonville, Fl Where She was last ported and supported the Great State of Florida. The mighty Sara needs to be in the warmth of the South. Where The Veteran's WILL CARE FOR HER.

From this, the 7DayPSA competition was born, starting here in Rhode Island and spreading to other states. The events challenge filmmaker teams to write, shoot and edit a public service announcement for a deserving local non-profit in just seven days. The results have been amazing as the winning spots are broadcast for one year on local television stations and placed on the internet to make the public aware of the services that are available and raising the awareness of the needs of each non-profits. FLICKERS is working on expanding this effort and with a little more support, it will expand across the country.

Hope Of Life International	181309	1	/users/profile/238032	Sally44	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	My church has teamed up with Hope of Life to serve the small community of El Oasis in Guatemala.  My husband and I were part of a mission team sent by our church this past June.  I cannot tell you the impact visiting Hope of Life had on our lives.  The work they are doing is tremendous!  Lives are being saved and changed every day.  Their goal is to motivate and help at the same time. When you see a fourteen year old arrive at Hope of Life weighing fearful and weighing only 19 lbs., and within 24 hours has a smile on her face and is eating, it really lets you know that God has his hand in this mission and that their work is anointed by God.  To be blessed to be a part of this mission is incredible. We are returning in January.  We are so looking forward to loving on the children in the orphanage and in the hospital again.  Loving them is so important to their emotional and spiritual growth.  We also look forward to seeing our Guatemala family in El Oasis.
Hope Of Life International	181043	1	/users/profile/237752	Phil15	Donor	5	10/22/2013	Our family has personally visited Hope of Life International Several times in the last couple of years, starting in 2012.  Our local church (www.visitlifepoint.org) regularly organizes short-term mission trips to Hope of Life with the help of Advancing Native Missions (www.advancingnativemissions.com), to come alongside and serve some of the poorest people on earth in Zacapa, Guatemala. We personally witnessed and participated in the distribution of meals, clothing, and educational resources to Guatemalans living in heart-breaking conditions. Some of the sites we visited included landfills where families actually have their dwellings - typically a discarded board or tarp propped up with some sticks. These families also try to earn money by finding and reselling pieces of recyclable plastic, glass, etc. Some of the children we met appeared to have never worm shoes in their life. Malnutrition and disease are apparent in many of the children. Hope of Life visits these locations several times a week to bring warm meals to these families. Permanent roofed shelters on concrete slabs have been built by the ministry to provide some protection from the elements during the rainy seasons. We spent time playing with orphans at Hope of Life's orphanage. We met children who had been severely abused. Young mothers who were victims of unspeakable acts. But through the work of Hope of Life International, we saw the happiness of children who once did not have a place to go, who now have a safe home, food, education, friends, and have seen and hear of God's love.  There is even a senior care center on the campus of Hope of Life. It is a beautiful model of care and love for the elders. These precious folk get to spend time outdoors and some are even able to be involved in the lives of some of the children as grandparents would. The work Hope of Life is doing is changing the face of Guatemala, one child at a time, one widow at time, one rescued victim at a time, one village at a time.  The gospel is preached, churches are planted, leaders are cultivated, orphans and widows are cared for, food and clothing are distributed, and jobs are being created. Children are educated (the school at Hope of Life has gained a tremendous reputation in the community). A university is being built in partnership with Liberty University (from Lynchburg, Virginia). A hospital has been built and is being staffed.  The needs of this third world country are being advocated for in the most loving of ways: Through tangible love. A "practical gospel", as Carlos Vargas says. As a family, and with a circle of friends in our community of Fredericksburg, Virginia, we have fallen in love with this country, with these people, and intend to continue supporting this ministry tangibly with raising support, advocating for the needs, and through prayer.
Save The Bay, Inc.	191417	1	/users/profile/249884	stbayer	Volunteer	4	12/23/2013	Save The Bay has made an invaluable contribution to promoting the need to clean up one of the country's outstanding estuaries. I have volunteered on eelgrass restoration, beach clean up, and other activities, and have enjoyed many excursions on the bay with STB. The people at STB are always enthusiastic and knowledgable about bay-related issues. They have done an excellent job of engaging the public, educating children and adults, and in encouraging legislation that is vital to the bay. Without STBs many protection activities over the past 40-years, Narragansett Bay would not be the healthy ecosystem that it is today. 
Save The Bay, Inc.	189959	1	/users/profile/248018	VA__	Volunteer	4	12/05/2013	As one of Rhode Island's largest and foremost environmental organizations, Save The Bay and its work involving Narragansett Bay has succeeded in fostering a sense of community and stewardship around New England's largest estuary -- at least for this volunteer. I am highly impressed with the work that STB has done in protecting and restoring Rhode Island's largest natural resource. It receives a great deal of community support and involves people of all ages and backgrounds with its robust volunteer/internship program, education programs, public events, and corporate opportunities. Since its founding, STB has made great headway in its restoration and conservation efforts to ensure Narragansett Bay and its natural beauty will be here for posterity.

CHILDRENS WISH GROUP OF RI	105473	1	/users/profile/141731	Paulaterri	Board Member	5	02/02/2012	This organization formed to serve children with life threatening illnesses when the RI chapter of Make a Wish was revoked.  We also accept wish referrals from nearby Massachusetts; our mission is to help as many children as possible.   It is a grass roots organization with only two paid staff, who served the first 2 years without pay because of their belief in the mission of the organization.  To date we have granted 17 wishes and hope to double that in the next 18-24 months. Like me, many of our volunteers and board members are dedicated individuals, many of whom actively engaged since Make a Wish was first created in RI.  We have a commitment tothe cause, whatever the organization title.  We keep our expenses to a bare minimum so that more wishes can be granted. 
The Guardian Angel Cat Haven Inc	276487	1	/users/profile/366269	Writer	Client Served	5	01/13/2016	I had a great experience with this organization as well! Unfortunately this nonprofit is no longer in operation although Wanda, the owner, still takes cats in. I had found a kitten who was injured and ended up having nerve damage. She couldn't control her bowels or bladder therefore had to use a diaper. Im a college student with 3 cats that I rescued from the streets so I couldn't take in another cat especially one who would require so much time and money. I called ALL the no kill shelters/cat sanctuary/cat havens in RI and some in MA and I was turned down by all of them. Then I found Wanda's contact information online and she was amazing. Like I mentioned she no longer runs the nonprofit but she was more than willing to take her in. Im so grateful. God bless. 
The Guardian Angel Cat Haven Inc	89328	2	/users/profile/101438	DESTANE45	Client Served	5	05/31/2011	I began feeding a bedraggled scrawny cat that some owner dumped on my street. I fed the cat for months and she would eat and leave everyday. Having 3 rescue cats of my own I could not take her inside. On night when she came home she brought 4 kittens with her and basically adopted me. I began calling shelters for help. There was no way I could spay and keep 5 more cats. During the frantic process of trying to find a place that wouldn't kill the cats I came accross many a heartless person running what was called a "shelter" The lack of empathy and concern was alarming. I was told they would take the kittens but no one would take the mother cat, even after I offered to pay her spaying bill and board for two months while she adjusted to losing her kittens and then not being able to roam free anymore. Then if the "shelter" couldnt' find a home for Momma cat I would come back and get her and try to incorporate her into our feline family.  I was told so many times NO WAY,,, Ivy Turner who ran a wonderfull humane shelter in Pascoag, must be rolling in her grave. The shelter that vowed to continue her work caring for the homeless animals was the worst one I dealt with. They told me to put them on craigs list! I was appalled. The would NOT HELP AT ALL! Then Wanda came into my life.. not only did she offer to take my kittens she would come and pick them up with their mother, take them to the vet and have Mom checked out and spayed... she said if I want her back I can come and get her. She told me of all the cats she has already picked up this month and of all the sick cats with leukemia and aids that she has in a seperate place that she tends to so they can live out their final days with someone's love.This experience taught me so very much. One careless selfish pet owner who abandonned their pregnant cat had brought so much heartache ... shelter after shelter, so called rescue after rescue wanted no part of this cat, even if they were paid to keep her. They should be ashamed!! Wanda is a cats guardian angel. I am sure her generous heart has been broken many times by watching this cats pass over. The comfort she brought me will always be  remembered. I will go back and get the MOmma cat and try to make her a member of my family and if it is not meant to be , if my cats reject her I know Wanda will open her haven and her heart to this cat once again. Moral of this long story is if you have 10 cents to give to a shelter please please please send it to Wanda because she is the one that is really sheltering and rescuing! Human feelings are cared for also which was really nice after what I had found before her. If you would like a reference feel free to email me.Destane45@aol.com

PORTSMOUTH HISTORICAL SOCIETY	129616	1	/users/profile/174945	Webster	Volunteer	4	10/26/2012	Portsmouth Historical Society is an undiscovered gem. Situated on the corner of East Main Road and Union Street, it occupies the now defunct Christian Union Church. The first floor consists of a small research library and a museum with permanent displays of local interest. Each year the curators committee creates a temporary exhibit. The 2012 exhibit was titled On the Water. It focused on commerce, recreation, bridges and lighthouses. The second floor is the beautifully restored church space which is used for speakers. On the grounds is the Old Town Hall, circa 1860, where farming implements and a collection of horse drawn vehicles are exhibited. The small red building is the oldest schoolhouse in Rhode Island. Funds for its construction were authorized by Portsmouth in 1716 and it was built in 1725. All are open free to the public. Donations are welcomed.  A mere $10 annual membership fee provides members with newsletters about speakers and events. I give the organization 4 stars only because their limited funding restricts the hours of operation to Sundays 2-4 from Memorial Day through Columbus Day. Scheduled appointments, speakers and events are accommodated beyond these times.  Their website is being recreated as it has recently moved to PortsmouthHistorical.com As a volunteer I can attest that it is rewarding to work with this small group of enthusiastic, creative individuals. They produce great results on a shoe string!

Gaia Vaccine Foundation	147296		/users/profile/194596	dr.annie.degroot	Advisor	5	12/26/2012	Why I give to GAIA and I would like to ask you to give too:                                                                         It is no secret that I am one of the founders of GAIA Vaccine Foundation.  What you may not know is that I gave $500 per month to GAIA Vaccine Foundation in 2012, and just as much the year before (and before that). And in 2013, I plan to give even more. Why is that? GAIA is one of the best investments that I have ever made with my donation dollars. See more about that below.* I believe in GAIA's vision. GAIA's goal is to "support the development of a globally relevant, globally accessible HIV/AIDS vaccine".  It takes a long time (over 20 years) to make a vaccine, so it should come as no surprise that we're still working on that mission. In fact, just this year, GAIA (and scientists at EpiVax) published a few papers on the vaccine (see here if one of several scientific reports on the vaccine). I believe that we will get there, because, as one of the founders, I believe in our mission. I give to GAIA because I want to end AIDS in our lifetime, and GAIA has a history of delivering on promises. What's an example of that? Well, we built an HIV clinic to provide mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention to a village called Sikoro in 2006. We expanded it to include all patients (moms, dads and children) with HIV in 2008, and we're still providing HIV care there, today. That's commitment. We build relationships. We have created a solid foundation of support among West African physicians and scientists for our work.  And we are building the scientific foundation for testing our HIV vaccine in the future. We have performed HIV vaccine readiness research and we publish it. We have concrete goals. Over the next year we plan to leverage innovative HIV management techniques, expand village-level HIV care and increase HIV knowledge throughout West Africa. [For more information read here]. So why should you support GAIA Vaccine Foundation? Because you know that ending AIDS in Africa is one of the things that you would like to do, in your lifetime, too. Giving to GAIA is a really great way to do that. So please click on this link, or go to http://www.gaiavaccine.org/donate and send in your contribution, today.Thank you! Together, we can make AIDS history. Annie De Groot MD
WOLF SCHOOL INC	140554		/users/profile/186753	Lindsay12	General Member of the Public	5	11/16/2012	As a parent of a child who attends the wolf school I can tell you first hand this school is as amazing as you probably already heard. My daughter has a complex neurological disorder known as developmental dyspraxia. She was basically written off by our public school system. They had very little hope for her and sat me down on day to tell me they would like to make her a life skilled child. At this point I knew they had given up on her. As her mother I knew there was great knowledge in her brain and they just didn't know how to reach her or even go about trying to. My daughter has only been at the wolf school for about 4 months and already have noticed huge goals she has been reaching. She can read sight words , write her numbers, and loves to go to school. My child now has self confidence that allows her to feel good about herself to succeed. Most of all she has found a love for school and learning. You will never feel alone at this school. The parents and facility are all loving , caring, and understanding. We are all in this together. The children are all very nice and accepting of one another. Take the time and go visit the school it truly life changing. It has become the light at the end of my tunnel!

Oasis International	286524		/users/profile/376594	Ginger_P	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	www.oasisinternational.info#GivingTuesday#OasisInternationalSeveral years ago, God began working on the hearts of myself and my husband to go into missions.  I have never been one to want to go out of the country, whereas my husband was ready to go.  About 3 years ago, God brought a ministry into our lives that has forever changed us. We were approached at our church to help a single, Muslim woman who had 3 daughters make their home live-able.  Although we were extremely nervous meeting her....we very quickly learned how lovely she is.  Over the course of a summer, of being there every single weekend....we got to know their family, we got to share our faith with them...and we still have a relationship to this day.  Meeting this sweet family has burned in us a desire to reach out and share the love of Jesus with every refugee we can.Oasis offers furniture, English classes, baby showers, driving lessons and the love of Christ to these refugee families.  I would ask that you go to their website at www.oasisinternational.info and learn more about their non-profit.Oasis has made a difference in these frightened and alone sweet people.  It has made us aware that so many are right here about 20 minutes from my home.  They come from war torn countries, they have left their homes, their families, their countries and they are all so thankful to be in the United States of America. Join us as we make a difference in their lives.  As we love them like Jesus loves.

Water For Cambodia A Middletown Rotary Charitable Trust	204519		/users/profile/266539	Rono	Donor	5	06/28/2014	I ran across this program on a trip to Cambodia a few years ago. I saw their work in a village and on a boat trip. The small amount I give can purchase quite a few water filters. I'm also impressed by their moving into literacy programs as well. Last year, the director called me personally to thank me for my donation. It doesn't seem like such an impersonal entity after that. Lastly, I looked up their expenses, I am impressed that their overhead/administrative costs are very low compared to many other reputable and good charities.

Transitions Foundation Of Guatemala Inc	22600	2	/users/profile/23609	bmurlas	Volunteer	5	11/13/2009	This story is from Transitions Client Diego. I am only the translator.My name is Diego Marroquin. I am 21 years old, and am from Guatemala. When I was 15, I was selected to play professional soccer, so I stopped my studies, and supported my family with my earnings from soccer. My future as an athlete was bright, and I was excited.One and a half years ago, as I was walking to my house with a friend, a vehicle approached us and shot us both. As we lay on the ground, scared and in pain, the car disappeared. My life changed dramatically that day. I am now a paraplegic.Everyday, I thank God for the opportunities I have found at Transitions. Here I found the support I needed to recover, and regain my motivation. Now Im studying to finish high school, and Im training to be a wheelchair manufacturer and repair technician at the Transitions wheelchair workshop.My peers at Transitions have taught me to be excited again about my future, and to again become an athlete, because I am now part of the Transitions wheelchair basketball team.

Friends Of The Warwick Animal Shelter	320300		/users/profile/412658	Thanksno	Client Served	4	12/19/2016	Based on my experience, I am a big fan of the Warwick Animal Shelter. After our Leonberger passed away, I visited the shelter in search of a large, friendly, smart, and protective dog. At the shelter, a  German shepherd formerly known as Goliath bonded with me in an instant.Before we adopted, the shelter director permitted a family visit in an enclosed area, where our  trusted Cert. Vet Tech friend was permitted to give the dog a physical exam and test his behavior in the somewhat stressful environment. We adopted the six-year-old GSD who lived to the ripe age of 14. Our feeling for the adoption process as we experienced it was that we were quite appropriately being tested by the shelter as much as we were testing the dog--both parties in pursuit of a good placement.  That degree of dedication impressed us immediately. Years later, when they were unable to provide us with a replacement for our dear shepherd, the Warwick shelter made inquiries at other shelters on our behalf. Ultimately, we had to adopt elsewhere, but we still have very warm feelings for the Warwick Animal Shelter. It is a clean, bright, and pleasant place and we are happy to continue to support it through its Friends organization.
Blackstone Academy Inc	140787	1	/users/profile/187004	gaylegifford	Board Member	5	11/17/2012	I've been involved with this public charter high school for over five years. I did a small consulting project at the school as was so impressed with the incredible work that they are doing with primarily low-income kids from the communities of Pawtucket and Central Falls, RI that I asked to join the board of directors when my project ended. This year, the school was rated Commendable -- the top rating given by the Rhode Island Department of Education.  Beyond the extraordinary dedication of all of the staff at the school, I'm impressed with this model where education includes development of the whole student. All of our students are involved with community improvement projects where they not only learn authentically, but also have the opportunity to become leaders and learn real grit. Many charters that serve high school want their kids starting in elementary or middle school so that by the time they are taking high school tests they score high marks. We take kids in 9th grade and they make great progress. And they stay -- we want our kids to graduate, even if it takes 5 years. Our 4 year graduation rate is 90%., which is phenomenal for an urban high school. And most of our graduates are going off to four year colleges. Come visit. BACS is one of a kind!
Project Goal Inc	93762		/users/profile/108079	Claudia Varga	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2011	I am an addiction counselor from Romania and I received a lot of help in my professional experience and to become a good leader in this field. Since 1999, when I was a student Terry made my first introduction to addiction field by a small training in Romania, which directed my study from there on. I received training in the addiction field, from the members of GOAL Project since 2001, when I was already working in the St. Dimitrie Project in Cluj Napoca, I was helped financially to participate to an international training in Egypt with ISAACS in 2001, for becoming an addiction specialist and to an international conference in US in 2008. Besides that I received a lot of support through other specific trainings in my country, literature and printing the romanian translation of "Tree of life" book by Terry Webb. The support I received either through training or personal experience made me what I am today. I think that in my country as in others where GOAL Project is present it made a difference in preparing g people to be leaders in this field. I greatly appreciate all their efforts in this direction, and I hope I can give back this help by helping others to grow as I did.
