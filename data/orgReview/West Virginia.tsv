As a new participant in their Rural to Urban Markets program, I have witnessed their determination to help West Virginia artisans flourish.  They provide access to  an incredible network of support, from accounting  to professional photography.  With their financial assistance, I now have an opportunity to enter the wholesale market with a new level of professionalism, well-prepared to grow my small business. (I believe in the organization so I became a member of the Tamarack Artisan Foundation, too!)

Tamarack Foundation Inc	153398		/users/profile/204204	Merideth Y.	Client Served	5	04/08/2013	The Tamarack Foundation has been monumental with my goals to better myself as an artist.   I am a West Virginia jewelry artist who turned to them for support and mentoring.  They have helped me hone my skills by taking me and 2 others to one of the best wholesale shows in the country and paying the all the fees.  I would never have been able to participate without this grant.  But the best thing is how they  taught me the skills to be a wonderful business woman.  The mentoring is priceless.  We learned from the 3 artists they took last year.   Most serious artists have the skills to sell their product in the world.  The hard part is obtaining the audience that will respect and potentially buy the product you made.  They taught me and brought me to a place where that happened.   I have also participated in business summits they have held at Tamarack.  They have been instrumental in my development of being a successful artist.  I really couldn't have done it without them.   This knowledge I have learned will be shared with three new artists for next year's wholesale show in Philadelphia.    They have challenged me to be a better artist and I love them for that.

Tamarack Foundation Inc	204721		/users/profile/30676	spoon-lady	Board Member	5	06/30/2014	Before I became a Board Member I benefitted from the Foundation on several occations.  They sent me to attend and study two different national shows.  One of which a year later we attended which we wouldn't have without the prior exposure.  This show increased our income close to $100,000 that year alone and continues to contribute to our income years later.  We also won a fellowship award that bought the tools we needed to teach our craft to students.  This is a work in progress but has aided in our plans for the future and what we want to do with it as we near a retirement age.   As a Board Member I am so honored to work with such amazing people that go out of their way to help artist throughout our state.  It humbles me what this foundation does for small business owners.  The Artist Directory they have just launced has potential to bring many people business to their homes and communities.  Looking forward to see the effects of this site.

This is wonderful expecially with a work force of nine employees.  Next the Foundation sent me on another fact finding trip to the New York International Gift Show and we came away with product information and a nationally known accout which has put our work infront of millions of potential customers.  Most recently we won a Fellowship Award from the Tamarack Foundation that funded three complete sets of hand tools so we can begin teaching our craft to students whom are interested in making traditional hand made Treenware.  Also there was money to purchase three more tools for our shop that will enable us to begin experimenting with a new line of primitive furniture.

Tamarack Foundation Inc	204257		/users/profile/266276	Sherri19	Client Served	5	06/27/2014	I want to personally thank the Tamarack Foundation for their help in my time of professional crisis. I am a Tamarack Stained Glass Artist and I also live/work in the area of WV affected by the Jan.9th 2014, toxic chemical spill into 300,000 people's tap water supply.  My equipment in my studio that requires water was contaminated as well.  This equipment is vital to my glass business and I lost many orders during this time, due to the damage to my equipment.  The chemical destroyed the rubber bearings and belts in my glass grinders.  I did not have the extra money on hand for repairs.   I applied to Tamarack Foundation for assistance to get my production equipment back online.  They sent me a small monetary grant and a contact for the equipment manufacturer for cleaning instruction, allowing me to repair instead of replacing the costly machines.  I was able to get my production back up and running with a short downtime instead of refunding orders and canceling orders that had already been placed.  Since my artwork is our family's only income it means that I can get back to my work and making ends meet for my family.  This is the type of assistance Tamarack is providing to this community and it is exactly the boost we all need from time to time to keep our businesses headed in the right direction.  Thank you Tamarack Foundation!

They help artists in so many different ways  --  financial support when tragedy strikes, on-going training and development and providing business support.  But, there is another way the Tamarack Foundation helps WV artists and this is personal to me.  I received a Fellowship from the Foundation.  It profoundly affected my development as an artist.

The Fellowship allowed me to have time to create my new work.  I am proud to be a WV artist and to be a part of the Tamarack family.

And I meant it.  While on my own, I struggled to market and sell my photography and failed four times to be juried into Tamarack. My career made a quick turn for the better after being  mentored by Steve Cassle in a pre-jury session at the Artisan Services Office in Beckley. I was subsequently juried into Tamarack and in a little over a year sold more than $3000 of photography at Tamarack. I even sold a piece at a Juried show in North Carolina. Without the advice and guidance of The Tamarack Foundation none of this would have happened.     Steve Cassle and The Tamarack Foundation are continuing to assist my artistic and product development. Along with another Tamarack artisan, Randall Sanger, I am going to publish a book of photography of the waterfalls of the New River Gorge. Both Randy and I view this book as more than a personal goal; we believe our book will motivate many others to experience for themselves the beauty of the Gorge and to help preserve it. From the outset, The Tamarack Foundation has nurtured and supported this book by marketing, artistic, and practical guidance.    I should mention that the artistic talent of my coauthor, Randall Sanger, was also developed and honed by The Tamarack Foundation. Steve Cassle mentored Randy as well, and Randy is now a juried artisan at Tamarack and MountainMade and will be the Photographer-in-Residence for the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge in the month of June.     Randy and I are just two of the many artisans that The Tamarack Foundation has helped. I can only imagine how many more artisans they have assisted. Personally, I will always be grateful for the past support of The Tamarack Foundation and will continue to need its help for future development as an artisan. Ed Rehbein

They answered any questions we had concerning business operations, marketing, etc. They set up a photography session and made it possible to have professional pictures to use for brochures, advertising, etc.  Through them, we were given the opportunity to attend larger shows by inviting us to The Winterfair Shows in Covington, KY, and Columbus, OH. They helped pay our booth fee for two years and now we have juried in the shows and are doing them on our own. They help build confidence and support to business just starting out. Without their help and resources, our business would not be where it is today. We are so thankful for the foundation and their staff, and have grown to love each one of them.   Tamarack and the Foundation portray a very positive image for West Virginia. Everywhere we go, when we mention Tamarack we always get excellent feedback. They are the best thing that has happened to West Virginia. Their support is essential to the growth of art and culture in this state.Jerry and Linda SmithJ&L Woodturning

The Foundation has helped me with funding for two classes that have proven instrumental in furthering my understanding of the dyeing process, design, and color theory. I am currently working with a series of ministers' stoles as well as journal covers, bags and wearable art that are based on my own experimentation with the techniques I learned in these venues.In the spirit of "paying it forward" I have participated (as a mentor) three times in the Foundation's mentoring program. Each time I was delighted and amazed at how much information was able to be shared in a period of only three days, and how much student and instructor BOTH learn in an intensive  one-on-one environment. I am endlessly delighted when I see a piece of artwork from one of these women and recognize a technique whose seeds were sown (sewn) in my studio.I have benefited too from the great variety of business support that the Foundation provides. My business cards, resume, artist statement, brochures, hang tags and all the photography of my work has been assisted or wholly generated by programs the Foundation has made available to artists. They have provided assistance in business planning and  market development as well as a number of oppotunities to visit wholesale markets and shows in large urban areas.I currently serve on the Artisans Advisory Board, have been involved with the jurying process, as well as the annual fundraiser and have seen first hand how the Foundation is always available to reach out and lend a hand to us artists. I'm a grateful admirer of the Tamarack Foundation.
Tamarack Foundation Inc	30254	2	/users/profile/31249	mik	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	I am a born again West Virginian artisan.  I have lived in Lewis  County these last seventeen years.  My companys name is ' Those Shoes '.      I have been a member and supporter of Tamarack since way back when it started. I started my leatherwork back in Africa and then several years in London and Somerset in the U.K. from where I traveled a lot in Europe.    In all my years of travel and selling my product around the world I have never come across anything quite like Tamarack, which is recognized far beyond West Virginia.    It never fails to astound  me, anywhere I go there isSomeone I meet who has been to Tamarack. The connections I have made and the customers I run into, all  over the country at fine quality craft shows who say,"these are the shoes we saw at Tamarack".  This always opens a conversation that often leads to a sale but even if not, a great discussion about my wonderful state. It is a destination for a lot of travelers. There is always great praise for Tamarack. The ambiance, the building. THE ART.  The food.      It makes me proud to receive the praise and feel that I am a part of it. It would be hard for me to remember a month that I dont get at least one or two calls from people from all over the country who were at Tamarack and saw my products there and placed an order.    The foundations support of us artisan owned small businesses is vital to our successespecially in these difficult economic times.  Please support funding the Tamarack Foundation so it can continue to retail and attract creative small businesses throughout West Virginia.Sincerely, Mik Wright

Tamarack Foundation Inc	29221	4	/users/profile/30253	jpowens	General Member of the Public	2	02/19/2010	I believe Tamarack has great vision and adequate funding to help support the economic development of WV craftsman, artists such as myself and general public. Unfortunately I've never been impressed with anyone I've met who works for or manages day to day activities in the organization. Although some of these individuals may have been enthusiatic about their craft and their position with Tamarack, I do not feel they were experienced enough nor focused enough to grow the organization. Tamarack needs to be run as a business by business men and women and not as a non-profit organization who continually looks for handouts and political support to meet their budget requirements. I have not participated with Tamarack as an artist nor as a patron in the past 9 months as there is nothing new and exciting to see there. As a previous board member for a non-profit art museum, I hope someone with new and exciting ideas begins to assist Tamarack soon as I would love to have a reason to take my young family there soon.

This organization has made it's goal the improvement and exposuer of an artist. With the many ways they are able to improve an artists work or help an emerging artist, it's value is beyond anything we artists ever imagined. The foundation has made it possible for artist to go into a wholesale show and learn how to compete in that world. Something most artists would never have had the oppotunity to do had it not been for the Foundation. Through the Foundation I have been afforded the opportunity to visit Pittsburge and Baltimore to attend NCECA a major conference for ceramic artists (potters). Also for three years now the foundation has provided scholarships to attend our annual Potter's Gathering at Cedar Lakes Conferance Center. The services the foundation provides are so important to emerging artist. The help and info they recieve is what it takes most artists years to learn on their own.When I talk to artist from out of state they are amazed at what we are so fortunate to have available to us.

From start to finish, we felt like our adoption counselor became part of the family. It took us to few dogs to find "the one" and she guided us every step of the way. They have such a wonderful facility that we knew each animal was being studied and vetted to make sure that they were placed with the right family. And each family was studied as well! Our children were even retaining the education our counselor was giving at each visit. Our adoption was smooth, our new dog healthy and happy, and he has been such a joy to our family. We were so impressed with the detailed paperwork that came with him upon his delivery from just-in-case "lost dog" signs, to medical records, medicines, food, a blanket, and even "new dog in house" signs to post on our front door.

I knew he was destined to be my dog when I saw his smiling face on an online animal website. I knew it even though he was in an adoption center four hours away from my home in Pittsburgh. What I didn't know at the time was Eddie's backstory. He had come to the center as a skinny stressed animal- a dog forced to live in confined areas with large unruly pitbulls. Apparently Eddie decided the best way to escape the daily attacks was to jump the fence.  Instead of removing the offending pack of pitbulls, the owner placed the onus on Eddie. and decide he should be put down. I know this harrowing story because of the detailed history kept by the Briggs Animal Adoption Center, an organization that functions under the umbrella of The National Humane Educational Society in Charles Town,WV.  Eddie thrived under the kind, watchful eyes of the people who work at BAAC. His wounds healed, he gained weight and his loving calm personality shone. I can't thank them enough for saving Eddie and taking a careful deliberate route to adopting him. He is perfection incarnate. I already love him and I feel certain he knows he is home.

The staff at BRIGGS remain supportive and when we have visited for fundraisers or Alumni events, she is well received and lovingly remembered. She runs into the center like she owns the place. We had medical issues with Fiona after her adoption and Dr Kerfoot and the staff were very supportive and helpful in her needed care(she was orig surrendered to the shelter with foot injury)   The staff and counsellors are all so knowledgable, patient and thorough. The facility is clean, well maintained and has a great outdoor area where we brought our pack of 5 other dogs to introduce to Ms Fiona. On a scale of 1-10 and 10 being the best, I'd say of all the shelters I have been to, I give them a 10+.    Thank you BRIGGS for all you do and we will be back for more when we can.

Mingo has settled in wonderfully and is a doting (and extremely patient) 'little brother' to our toddler daughter.

National Humane Education Society	320036	2	/users/profile/412090	Writer	Client Served	5	12/11/2016	Our family visited Briggs on a sheer whim. We are new to the area and didn't know anything  about the place but had passed by it many times.  We decided to stop in one day to kill some time. We could not have been more impressed by the cleanliness of the facility itself, the large pens, the cat room (AMAZING. Literally zen, I'll never understand how many cats can live in one place so peacefully) and overall friendlines of the staff.  One dog in particular caught our eye. We weren't really in the market for a dog, but we felt a connection and decided to pursue it.  Our adoption process took several weeks- which I think was really wise. We were required to visit with the dog at least 3 times to ensure a match,  but as we have 3 children under the age of 6, I was hesitant and wanted to have several additional visits.  The staff was more than accommodating and understanding and allowed us to take as much time as necessary to feel comfortable.  When he did finally come home I believe he adjusted much more easily because  of these visits and his established familiarity with us.  He was brought to us with food and medications and paperwork to get us through the first few months  and the transition was truly seamless. I don't have enough good things to say about Briggs.  I truly believe that it's apparent they have the animal's best interest at heart.  They absolutely will not adopt an animal just to get them out of the center and free up space. Life term placement is the goal,  and when time and care is taken to ensure such,  good results ensue.  I would 100% recommend this adoption facility.

The devoted staff at NHES is a major reason the cruelty that was once accepted as a norm is now exposed and the life of pets vastly improved. The educators work tirelessly both on site and through school programs to educate a new generations and show them a better, humane way to enjoy their pets.

Ever since then our three children have been dying for a new family pet.  We went to about three animal shelters, and didn't really fall in love until we found Durgan.  We knew right away that Durgan had to be ours.  We visited him twice and still felt the same way.  Brigg's staff helped us get all the time we needed and they really helped us with our decision.  Durgan has now been at our home for one day, and we love him.  Durgan is a great addition to our family.  Thank you, Briggs, for helping us complete our family.

The process was easy and the people were caring and considerate to both us and the dogs that we saw.  They take care of all medical needs be it shots, teeth cleaning, etc. for dogs and cats to be adopted.  We return to Briggs for the "reunion" that they hold every year in October. Our point of contact in adopting Holly was a lady named Connie, who later came to our home to see how we all were doing.  That is the kind of dedication Briggs shows to all of its animals.    We will definitely adopt from there again..  As Connie left our house she said to Holly, "Holly, have a good life,"  We can assure her that she has.Margie and George Dellagiarino

Of the 15 animals I have had, 8 have come from Briggs (the other 7 were "happenstance," street dogs and stray cats, for example). I adopted my first animal from them in the late 1980s and my latest in 2013.   Briggs is my "go-to" place when I decide to adopt another animal.  As other reviewers have noted, they go out of their way to try to match adopting parents with the right critter for them.  They have a good facility for allowing an adopter's current animals to interact with the potential new animal to make sure they get along OK.  They also have rescued animals from horrible situations--one of my dogs was to be euthanized that day in high-kill shelter before being rescued; another dog of mine was previously kept chained in a back yard; another dog of mine spent the first years of his life in a hoarding situation; one kitten of mine was born under the hood of a car to a stray cat.  Briggs tries to educate owners who are not taking proper care of animals and if that doesn't work, try to convince them to turn them over to their organization to find a better home.  The educational efforts also help set them apart from many of the other humane societies in the area.  I believe so strongly in their mission that I donated my recreational vehicle to them to turn into an animal rescue and travel vehicle for their educational efforts.  
National Humane Education Society	319960		/users/profile/411931	Writer	Client Served	5	12/08/2016	I have volunteered at Briggs and it is a very well-run, clean facility. The staff is very friendly with the intentions of taking extra-special care of the animals in the hopes of finding them well-placed homes.  In the process, I found the most precious little beagle mix and since losing my minpin 5 months earlier, my heart was ready to love another fur baby. The adoption process was very thorough including checking references, insuring the dog accepted humans, cats and other close family dogs that he would come in contact with, ending with a home safety inspection. The dog that I adopted, at an extremely reasonable fee, was neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, and had his teeth cleaned.  He arrived at my home with his remaining meds and a generous bag of food which he was accustomed to eating, and his next flea and tick treatment. He is the best dog I could have hoped for. The rescue is located on many acres and has fenced in runs for the dogs, a large fenced and double-gated play yard, and lots of land to walk the dogs.  The cate also have indoor and outdoor areas with lots of climbing and play areas. It is a first-class organization.

We met with several dogs, and felt we had made a choice.  It was hard because we wanted them all!!  We had a second visit filled out the final paperwork and scheduled the delivery of our new family member.   Briggs staff brought Gizmo to our home and checked with us via phone over the next several months in case we had any questions or concerns.

They had a large variety of small dogs on their website, so we thought we'd give them a shot. After perusing their website, I already had the dog in mind that I wanted to see that day; a neglected, tough little boy that had been at Briggs for over a year. I was determined to take home the dog that no one else wanted!! When we walked by his cage, he threw himself on the door and was practically foaming at the mouth, but I was determined to give him a try. The staff was so helpful and patient with us the entire time, and after about 8 different visits to see our little boy, we decided to make him a part of our family. Briggs was so helpful and supportive throughout the entire process, and even delivered the dog right to our house so that they could do a home visit when they dropped him off. Our baby has come a million miles from where he was before, and even lets people of all ages pet him now! We are so thankful for Briggs and their persistence on finding our little baby a good home!

Each time, the staff has gone out of their way to make sure that the dog and the person adopting the animal are right for each other (at least as best as anyone can judge). That has included visits between the potential adoptee and other dogs already living in the home. Before the dogs are adopted out they are given wonderful care to include all medical issues. My last fellow was adopted out while still ill because he was not getting better in the shelter - the medical staff continued to take care of him until he was cleared.  They truly care about their animals and  I would recommend anyone thinking about adopting a cat or a dog - go to visit Briggs and spend as much time as needed with the animals you are interested in - a unique opportunity not afford by all rescue groups.

Loxie had been tied up in the yard, and the family moved away.  After she was rescued and arrived at Briggs, they realized she was pregnant.  The Briggs Vet took her home where she gave birth to eight healthy puppies.  When the puppies were weaned, Loxie and her puppies came back to Briggs where we adopted Loxie, and all the puppies were also adopted.  The people at Briggs are warm, kind, and generous with their time and help!  Our dog, Loxie, is smart and sweet, so we could not be happier!

The goal of our group is to work to extend kindness in our community in as many ways as possible.  NHES was gracious enough to join us to present educational curriculum for our students and leaders for a full 90 minutes. The representatives centered the discussion around personal safety and kindness towards animals, an important subject we hadn't yet explored in our club. In addition, the students were thrilled to see Megan and Megan had brought two adorable puppies along from the shelter that were available for adoption, giving all our students a valuable hands-on experience of interacting with an unfamiliar animal.  Our leadership team and volunteers were very impressed with the passion and commitment Megan and Megan brought to the table.  They are true professionals in every sense of the word and provided meaningful and useful information our students could use on a regular basis. Megan discussed sensitive information with ease and gave our students ideas and scenarios to think about both now and in the future.  It is both the NHES and our Kindness Club's goal to change social outlooks when it comes to the humane treatment of all animals. Megan and Megan are excellent ambassadors working towards this goal. We look forward to working with them and the NHES in the future. 
National Humane Education Society	317974		/users/profile/409111	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/01/2016	When I was a little girl (many years ago now!), I lived in the small town of Sterling, VA.  Also living in that small town was a wonderful lady who took in and cared for homeless animals.  Her name was Anna Briggs and her home was called Peace Plantation.  Since Peace Plantation was located near my grandmother's home, I was allowed to walk there from time to time, and Mrs. Briggs would allow me to follow her around as she cared for the dogs and cats.  She became my hero because I had never met a kinder, sweeter lady, and her love for all the animals she had saved was clear to see.  Time passed, I grew up and had other interests, and Mrs. Briggs and her animals moved away.  Many years (about 45) passed, and one day on my way to work, I heard an ad on the radio about Briggs Animal Adoption Center in Charles Town, West Virginia.  I wondered if it could possibly be the same Mrs. Briggs.  I called and asked if it was, and sure enough, her grandson, Jim, told me my childhood hero (she was in her late 90s by then) was still active in the lives of animals.  The very next weekend I took my grandson with me to visit BAAC and to see Mrs. Briggs again.  What a wonderful place!  I immediately wanted to volunteer so that I could be a part of their amazing work.  I felt like I'd come home again!  And later, as we sat together in the beautiful cattery, my 10-year-old grandson said, "I think this is what heaven must be like."  I'm sure the cats who live there would definitely agree with him!

When we came across the National Humane Education Society / Briggs Animal Adoption Center near Charles Town, it really changed the way I looked at adopting a pet. It's not a place that you can walk into and then walk out 5 minutes later with a dog or cat. They take the time to make sure that the adopting family is a good fit so that the dogs (or cats) get a great forever home. We interviewed, found a young dog (Jayda) that we adored, and then scheduled to come back with our other dogs and all of our family members. Once the counselor determined the chemistry was good, she scheduled a visit to our home to see that it would be a safe and happy place for our newest 4-legged family member. I was really impressed with how much care and attention the entire staff put into helping the dogs and cats at Briggs find a forever home. I can't recommend this particular adoption center enough. They did a great job and we couldn't be happier with Jayda.

What a blessing it has been to volunteer with such a caring and committed staff and dedicated NHES educators.  Just recently we adopted an older husky mix that was rescued by Briggs from a remote kill shelter in WV. The  process was very smooth and our adoption counselor checked on our adopted dog several times to see how he was settling into his new forever home. Last summer my son was attending their "Cool to Care Camp" which is run by the NHES, and he learned so much about caring for all types animals (not just dogs/cats). Megan F. and Megan H. were awesome facilitators dedicated every single day ensuring that all the children had fun, learned something, and built new friendships. The facility is one of the best I have ever seen. It is clean, organized, and every single staff member is always willing to give you a hand. They truly love their animals, and they want the best home for them. We also had both of our GSDs spayed/neutered through their fantastic stay/neuter program. The counselor made all the appointments and assisted us throughout the process.We also had the pleasure of volunteering at the local elementary school with the educators, Megan F. and Megan H. They teach the children how to care for dogs and cats by playing fun games, singing wonderful songs, and baking doggy treats for all our four-legged friends. The Briggs Animal Shelter is top-notch and a vital resource to our community.  We are so grateful to have such a wonderful facility with dedicated members and volunteers always committed to finding forever homes for all our furry friends.

I was quite impressed with their process, as they go to considerable lengths in order to ensure the match is a good one for both the adopter and the dog (or cat). 'Charley' was adopted, and has had a great home ever since.A few years later, I spied a photo that Briggs had posted of Gifford, and it was instant love! We went to visit him, and learned of the life he had endured before being rescued. Due to his background, he was extremely shy, but the staff had been working with him to help him come out of his shell. Giffie has now been a part of our family for nearly 3 years, and I cannot imagine life without him.I am now a volunteer, and love taking part in their events such as 'Footin' For The Animals', 'Pedals for Pooches', and visiting various pet boutiques and stores with some of the adoptable animals. The love for all the animals and care given to them by the staff members is exemplary. I especially love knowing that being a no-kill facility, each and every one has a home until they find their 'forever family'.
National Humane Education Society	308937	2	/users/profile/400305	rfrank	Client Served	5	10/07/2016	My review of The National Humane Education Society is offered from an uncommon perspective.  I am and have been an employee of the organization for many years and have adopted numerous animals.  I have, in fact, known of the organization and been involved in different capacities for over 35 years.  I can remember details of the facilities from nearly 40 years ago and while they were much smaller and limited in comparison to the Briggs Animal Adoption Center, the cleanliness, order and absolute commitment to the animals have been constant.  As an employee here, in a non-management type position, I see the reality of the the day to day operations.  I see the many people who come here with an injured or unwanted animal, the  vast number of those who have adopted pets and return just to visit or attend the annual Alumni Day celebration.  I see the many, many people who bring their pets to utilize our low-cost spay and neuter program.  There are many volunteers who regularly come to spend time with the dogs or cats, or those that help with the various fund raising or information events.  There are quite a few of the clerical or administrative staff who bring their own pets to work.  It is normal that when an animal has been adopted and is ready to be taken to it's new home, the receptionist will announce over the p.a. that this particular animal is leaving for their new home and if any staff wants to come say goodbye, come to the front lobby.  There is always a group of those that have cared for the animals directly that come to say goodbye.  I see the truck loads of food and supplies that arrive regularly, the extensive and detailed procedures for cleaning and feeding. The special diets, the dog isolation/ intake building, the bathing and grooming room, the feline areas with walkways, climbing trees, the Education building for teaching events and fundraising events.   There are vehicles to rescue and adopt pets with, machinery to maintain the grounds and facilities, the well-appointed vet room and full-time vet for in-house animal care.  I see the many hardworking coworkers, the sometimes ill or injured incoming animals, the ongoing display of photos in the break room of newly adopted animals and happy owners.  I see the stress in upper management when operating funds are not enough, the difficulty in telling another person we are full and cannot take in more.  I could go on but my point is this, from my perspective, this organization is consistently and continually working to better the lives of multitudes of animals and, indirectly, improving the lives of many people.  Briggs Animal Adoption Center is in Charles Town, WV, and I would invite you to arrive on any given day, during our open hours, and look to see if what I have outlined is true.  If you do come, you will be pleased.

I was scared to enter the facility, not understanding that this is a no-kill rescue facility, the dignity and care with which all the animals are shown, and the welcoming, helpful staff.  Octavia, named because she gave birth to 8 puppies after being rescued, sat calmly in her area while we walked up and down past all the dog areas and was given an introduction to each one.  When asked if there was a dog that we would like to meet, we immediately said, Octavia!  Her soulful eyes looked deep into my heart and touched me in a way that no dog had ever done.  Our wonderful adoption counselor helped us understand that we could bring Octavia into our lives, even though we already had Rubble, our cat, in our home.  Without going into detail, Octavia rescued us rather than us rescuing Octavia.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about the facility and the staff at Briggs.
National Humane Education Society	188204	5	/users/profile/245507	bfru	Volunteer	5	11/09/2013	My first interaction with Briggs was in March of 2001 when I adopted a wonderful Big Benji-type terrier mix from their shelter.  Hudson had some issues not the least of which was that he despised cats.  We already had three felines in our household.  It appeared to be an impossible situation but with help from Briggs in behavior modification training we were able to change Hudson's attitude toward the cats and everyone lived together peacefully after that and Hudson remained a very good boy until his passing.  Our home now includes two cats and one dog adopted from Briggs along with our sweet sheepdog.  Our recently adopted dog is considered a special needs guy because of his shyness.  Again with the help of Briggs' counselors our guy is making great strides.  He attended the alumni event a few weeks ago and showed his developing bravado to the delight of the Briggs staff (and me).I have participated in the fundraising events held by Briggs.  Many of these events include pet participation (walks/runs for example) including many dogs adopted from Briggs.  The camaraderie among staff, volunteers and participants is heartwarming.It is a privilege to volunteer for this organization and especially to attend outside events at such places as Lowe's, Petco, Tractor Supply and farmer's markets where I can not only introduce the public to some of the wonderful dogs available for adoption but can let people know of the awesome job done at Briggs.  Adoption counselors get it right by interviewing everyone who will be living with the potential adopted dog and encourage famiies to bring other pets to the center to test the interaction.  Once adopted the counselors are available whenever needed to answer questions.  Dogs and cats leave the center with current vaccinations, a supply of flea/tick prevention, food, information to register the microchip and the animal's health records (all are spayed or neutered) prepared by their full-time staff veterinarian as well as useful behavioral commentary added by staff throughout the time the animal's stay at Briggs.I live about 30 minutes away from Briggs but it is worth the trip for me to drive either to the center or the Buried Treasures thrift shop to volunteer.  Working with such a dedicated staff is pure pleasure and I am proud to play a small part in helping this organization succeed in its mission.

I have heard dozens of happy stories and met tons of ex-Briggs dogs, now in their "forever homes".  Briggs is a no-kill shelter, which is AMAZING.  You know that these animals are going to find a great home.  While I am just a volunteer, the people that actually work at Briggs treat each of these animals like their own.  They work hard to find the right fit for each of them.  They also work with them to correct some of their bad habits so they will have a better chance of getting adopted.  These people would do anything needed!  I am amazed every day how loving they are.  
National Humane Education Society	308225	3	/users/profile/399617	sbblack,	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2016	As an older person I can truly say how very important the work at NHES is. I grew up in an era where often people had no real idea of the needs of their pets. It was not unusual to see dogs chained in yards, cats and dogs not spayed or neutered, and health issues neglected. The devoted staff at NHES is a major reason the cruelty that was once accepted as a norm is now exposed and the life of pets vastly improved. The educators work tirelessly both on site and through school programs to educate a new generations and show them a better, humane way to enjoy their pets. NEHS, through its educational programs, addresses safety concerns and encourages dog training. I have no doubt that NHES is making a huge difference in the lives of both pets and owners. Their facility is first rate and that they have a full time vet on staff allows the educators access to expert information on health and nutritional needs. Behavior issues are also addressed making NHES the authority on companion animals. Schools have an opportunity to have a free program presented by NHES professionals conducted with humor, compassion, and knowledge.

National Humane Education Society	188140	3	/users/profile/245408	rabradley	Volunteer	5	11/08/2013	rabradley12  I began volunteering at Briggs approximately 6 months ago and WOW....what a rewarding experience.  I began assisting with the Saturday dog events at the local farmers markets, etc. and was always impressed by the staffs knowledge of all the dogs and cats names at Briggs and the attention they showed to all the animals.  The real testimony of the staffs never ending love, compassion and commitment for their 4 legged guests was witnessed during the recent Alumni Day.  I had the opportunity to meet former Briggs dogs and their now forever families.  What caught my attention the most was how the dogs interacted with the staff.  As soon as they heard the staffs voices or saw them, it was instant recognition, lots of tail wagging and of course lots of kisses.  This type of love and loyalty to all animals at Briggs is the norm at Briggs. As a volunteer, I feel like such a part of the Briggs family already and look forward to becoming more actively involved with their mission.

National Humane Education Society	187098	3	/users/profile/244097	Falcon63	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	I first became aware of NHES many years ago and will, without reservation, wholeheartedly recommend them to you as a genuine and truthful organization.  It has been my good fortune to have adopted 4 dogs from them over the past 29 years.  In 1984 I adopted a wonderful, young Shepherd mix.  She was a loyal and faithful friend for many years.  As I write this, my younger Chihuahua mix is by my side and my other, elder Chihuahua is sleeping in her bed. These wonderful little creatures have and continue to enrich my life in many ways.   I have had opportunity visit NHES facilities both current and prior.  I have also had opportunities to interact with their personnel at different levels within the organization.  My honest opinion is that they are completely who they claim to be.  There are policies in place to help safeguard the placement of animals into homes.  The animals receive a level of care that probably exceeds that given in many private households.  It appears to me that NHES is a most worthy and reputable group of people.  My recommendation would be to tour the facility in Charles Town and interact with some of the folks, and then form an opinion.  I read the negative reviews about the fund raising technique that utilized the mailing of a $2 dollar check.  Obviously some may misunderstand this or view the mailing out of $2 dollar checks as inappropriate; however, the sad truth is that fund raising is difficult and ongoing.  I have observed NHES personnel diligently work towards meager funds generation through yard sales, bicycling and walking events and other labor-of-love efforts.  NHES is struggling to generate additional funds through a first time effort in a nearby thrift store. It is obvious to me that they are in pursuit of every viable option to bring in the funds necessary to continue their noble mission.
National Humane Education Society	186422	2	/users/profile/243431	RVAVA7	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	I began putting food out for a stray cat in my neighborhood, it wasn't long before I realized there was more than one hungry stray cat coming around. I found myself watching at night for them and it was what appeared to be a mom and 3 kittens. I got online and began reading about stray/feral cats and found that before long I would have a colony of cats if I didn't get them spayed or neutered.  I was worried that it would be very expensive to take this on, so I began searching in my area for a vet to help me and tell me how to catch them. One of the vet offices I contacted told me to call Spay Today, a program through NHES, which offers low cost spay and neuters. I called and the ladies there were very helpful, and the cost was very reasonable. They even rented me a humane trap and showed me how to use it. ( I had to give a small deposit on the trap and they gave it back to me when I returned their trap). I was able to get all 3 kittens spayed/neutered and the mom spayed along with rabies shots completed. I brought them home to my garage and was able to care for them and eventually they all were very friendly and ready for new homes. I ended up keeping mom and placing the kittens in homes. Thank goodness I found Spay Today and got the help I needed.   
National Humane Education Society	185196	3	/users/profile/242154	kacurtis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2013	After a long day of work I was looking forward to going home to relax, but as I drove home a deer jumped out of the woods and ran across the road in front of my car.  In that one second when I turned to make sure it made it across the road, I saw that it was a dog, not a deer. I immediately pulled off the road, put my flashers on and jumped outnot sure how I was going to get this dog but I had to try! I called him and he stopped and turned very hesitantly and, oh no, a car was coming.  I began waving frantically and prayed the other driver would stop and thinking, please dog don't runjust stay. A man stopped and saw the dog & put his flashers on too. I called the dog again and he came, the closer he came in the lights, the more of him I could see. I saw blood on his face (how was he hurt? was he friendly? what do I do now?) These were the questions running through my mind. I said another prayer and opened my car doorhe jumped in and licked my hand as if to say, thanks. Immediately, I turned and went back to workyou see I work at The Briggs Animal Adoption Center (Briggs), a program of The National Humane Education Society (NHES).When I arrived at Briggs, I then called the director for help.  This was many years ago, and it was my first rescue of an injured animal. We took him to the vet room and help was on the way. We offered him some water and food (he was starving.) As he ate, we noticed he was covered in burrs.  Gingerly, I began taking them off and again I was rewarded with a lick and a look of sincere thanks. I took off my Bermuda hoodie sweatshirt and laid it on the blanket.  He laid his head on it. We got a trash can full of burrs off that boy and when the vet saw him she determined that he had been shot.  She performed surgery and removed BBs.  She even removed one from his eye, which thank god he didn't lose. I picked up that sweatshirt off the floor later and as I looked at the blood stains, I cried that this gentle soul who had known nothing but pain and suffering had shown kindness when he was hurt so badly. I was allowed to name this sweet boy and I named him Bermuda Jake (of course you can figure where Bermuda came from and Jake after one of my sweet dogs at home).This is the type of care and compassion that is given to every animal that comes to our Briggs. We love them all, though I daresay they teach us all so much more about compassion. Bermuda Jake spent a lot of time with me during his recovery in my office and what a great dog he was. You see that is something else we do at Briggs. We bring dogs to our offices to spend time with us while they are waiting on their forever homes. Bermuda Jakes picture hangs at my desk. I was lucky enough to have placed him in his new home, and every time I look at that picture I am grateful that I work at a place like Briggs and NHES because it gives meand all of us herean opportunity to make a difference in an animals life, and we make this difference for thousands more through all of NHESs programsHumane Education, Briggs, Peace Plantation, and Spay Today.

Both experiences were wonderful. The Adoption Counselors were so helpful and really "nailed it" when they helped us select the perfect matches for our family! We had such  a positive experience and even recommended Briggs to our adult daughter. She is now a proud mama to the most adorable Yorkie! We love Briggs and would encourage anyone living in this area to go check out all the precious animals they have rescued!! 
National Humane Education Society	155844	2	/users/profile/206808	OleMissRebel	General Member of the Public	1	04/23/2013	I regularly donate to animal and environmental charities. When I got a letter (and a $2 check) from this charity, I came to charity navigator to check them out and found that they only have 2 stars. Also I found it suspicious that the president and vice-president have the same last name.  To keep them from continuing to send me letters requesting a donation, I  have decided to cash their $2 check and give it to my LOCAL animal shelter.  That way, the money will still go to animals, but to a place that uses the money much more wisely, and I won't get any more donation requests from them.  
National Humane Education Society	151373	3	/users/profile/168882	Charity Supporter	Donor	3	03/20/2013	This is an organization that does wonderful work, in an underserved, over populated (meaning animals needing assistance) region. They pull animals from horrid situations, rehabilatate them and work with other rescues, in areas that have a higher adoption rate, to put these animals into good forever homes. But, on the other side, they send out negotiable $2.00 checks and multiple mailings to prospective doners. As a doner, I want to believe that the majority of the money I send to an organization, will go to saving and re-homing the animals. Not to postage or to checks that can be cashed by someone who does not even donate to the group. I received another $2.00 check today, which I put into my shredder. I honestly don't know if I will send them a donation. Will my donation be used up by those who cash their $2.00 checks?
National Humane Education Society	114410	1	/users/profile/155698	Kim kensinger	Donor	2	06/08/2012	I used to donate to this organization....I stopped when they started sending me $2.00 checks.  I have written to them repeatedly to stop sending me checks.....but the checks keep coming.  I feel that any charity that can afford to send checks out to people at the risk that they may just cash them doesn't need a donation from me........that's a ridiculous risk!
National Humane Education Society	109613	2	/users/profile/149351	visionnow	General Member of the Public	1	04/11/2012	Upon visiting this site, I was impressed at their treatment of animals. It is a very inviting environment and reminds me of orphanages I have visited. However, when I applied to adopt an animal, I was initially approved, but later received a phone call and was told that because I have a child with a disability (5 y/o), I was not approved for the puppy I sought to adopt. Their reason was not due to concern over care for the animal, but they somehow thought that a child with a hearing/speach problem would create a problem for the dog. Very odd. I choose not to recommend this location and not to donate there.

We have adopted two amazing loving souls from them that wouldn't be if not for Heart of Phoenix. I wish I could add before and after photos of our two loves but I can't seem to upload them from my iPad. Shetan and Sangria.  HOP took them out of life threatening circumstances and gave them a chance at a happy healthy life. HOP does this on a daily basis and has saved so many souls from horrific circumstances. They are an amazing group of people with sincere and loving, kind hearts. If only we had more people like them in this world.

They have offered educational clinics, gelding clinics, health-care clinics,  networking opportunities and countless other resources that aid in the prevention of neglect. This group is by far one of the best organizations in the Appalachia region! With their broad vision they not only address the immediate, their dedication prevents future neglect.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	308806		/users/profile/400180	loriharless	Volunteer	5	10/07/2016	It is amazing to see how many animals that hop has rescued. The need is so great. They help these beautiful horses and other animals and give them hope when there was none. My daughter and I volunteered and saw some of the most recent cases that were unimaginable unless you saw for yourself. How someone can do that to another breathing animal I will never understand. But with each animal, they were eager to be brushed and loved on and learning to trust us humans. I said to each one if them " no more hungry, bad days" it broke my heart but brought me much joy to give them a little piece of love that they had been neglected of for so long. The volunteers work many many long hours and days and see things Noone should ever have to witness. But they do it because of their love for another one of God's creatures
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	308666		/users/profile/400040	Writer	Donor	5	10/07/2016	I have been supporting Heart of Phoenix for several years.  Beyond amazing transformation on the horses they rescue.  There are lots of rescues to support, but they are so passionate about helping the horses.  This is not a 9 to 5 job for them but 24/7 mission for these volunteers.  I only wish I had more money to donate each month.
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	308636	1	/users/profile/400005	Sharon202	General Member of the Public	5	10/07/2016	A friend of mine suggested Heart of Phoenix last year when I was looking for an equine partner, so I studied the descriptions of each of the available horses.  One mare affected me strongly, so I filled out an adoption application and, within several weeks, was able to visit her.  I was very impressed with the time Tinia Creamer took with me, even though it was clear quite early in my visit that this mare and I would not be a good fit.  I'm grateful for how candid Tinia was;  there was no attempt at all to mask potential difficulties, and for that I am thankful.  I would not hesitate to recommend Heart of Phoenix to anyone;  the work these people do is beyond amazing!
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	308624	1	/users/profile/399992	Sarah330	Donor	5	10/07/2016	This organization  has made a huge impact on the lives of horses and people in WV.  It is truly impressive  to see the horses that they have brought  back from the brink of death.  Not only do they rescue horses from extreme neglect and abuse,  but they have helped so much in providing education.   They provide a network that helps owners with things, like finding a farrier for example,  that should be simple but sometimes isn't.   If I know someone that is new to the horse world, following this group is my first suggestion. I have learned a lot from them myself and it has improved the lives of my horses.   I could go on about Heart of Phoenix  at length, I really respect these people and what they do.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	308564	1	/users/profile/399936	Melanie56	Client Served	5	10/07/2016	My beautiful mare Splenda came from HOP. I had been following their rescue for a while and keeping an eye out for a horse that would be a good addition to my little herd. I saw her video and filled out an application. The process went quickly, and I soon went to meet her. I was impressed that there was no pressure at all for me to make a decision. It was clear that the priority was making a good match, and they were totally upfront with me about issues she had because of her past. I didn't bring her home then, but when I realized I couldn't stop thinking about her, I knew she was the one. When I went to pick her up, I met many of the horses that were being loved and fed back from the edge of death, and seeing them was heartbreaking, but I have followed them on Facebook and rejoiced to see them regain health and move on to their happy ever after families. HOP members are fiercely loving advocates for animals, and I find hope in their efforts.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	298929	1	/users/profile/389813	Susan Falcon S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/02/2016	Since 1968 I have worked with dozens of small and large animal rescues.   Many start out with good intentions, but fail.  They fail supporters, themselves and the very lives they are trying to save.  They lack focus, budgeting skills, resource management, foresight and grit.  Many even lack basic animal care knowledge and honour.  You HAVE to be a little nuts to run a good rescue, you have to be strong, vocal, informed and have limitless fire.  But it cannot be done by one person.  It takes the coordinated efforts of many knowledgeable people willing to put the lives of the animals ahead of their own egos.  A good rescue team will get up in the middle of the night to drive hundreds of miles to get to an auction at o'dark-thirty to lift collapsed animals and carry them to a borrowed trailer.  A great rescue understands that you can't save all lives.  An epic rescue educates all people and works with legislation to reduce the chances that animal care will fail in the first place.   For the efforts and continuing journey towards ending the practice of abandoning horses at coal mines - or worse, using public land as free grazing for breeding MORE horses and/or to fatten up horses destined for meat slaughter -  for the work done to fight  this portion of commercialized abuse alone - This amazing team deserves all the support and  respect  the nation's equine lovers  have in their hearts.   Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue has added to the body of knowledge on how to bring back to glowing, sound, working health an animal considered by vets and other equine professionals as beyond help.  And they have been generous in spreading that knowledge.   They have held free gelding clinics to reduce the number of breeding animals and help turn brainless studs into safe partners.  Heart of Phoenix Equine rescue epitomizes all of these hard won skills.   And they'be manage to take amazing care of their own farms, families and jobs.   Then they went a step farther.  Southern West Virginia and surrounding areas have experienced devastating floods this year.  I swear, I don't think it was 24 hours before the HOP team was networking and taking action to help ALL animals put at risk by the loss of pasture, fences, shelters and owners.   The coordination efforts to find temporary fosters, hay, supplies, feed, medical care, shelter - and get it all where it needed to go - saved the hearts of many devastated families from having to sell goats, horses and cattle at auction and dump pets at the shelter.  This state has a strong 4H and FFA presence.  Children do without a lot of things to raise these animals.  Though HOP efforts may seem like a drop in the bucket during this  time, to the lives they have been able to touch, they have brought comfort and hope.  Plus  the knowledge that somewhere out there, other animal lovers really do care. And during all of this heartbreaking chaos, the rescues never failed.  Animals tied to spikes in the ground by ropes grinding into their necks -  newborn foals who's mothers could barely stand - gaunt haunted faces of  animals who had no reason to hope - a mare foaling in the wild facing yet one more of our harsh mountain winters - all have been brought into a professional network of caring and safety.   And they face the knowledge that this winter will expose many animals made homeless by the floods to starvation, pregnancy and slow death from lack of minimal shelter.   Heart of Phoenix has been there for me when I've had to deal with  neighbors who own a free range stallion.  They offered to geld him.  They offered to spend the funds to train him and assure that he became a useful, valuable animal instead of a danger to the county.  But the job of education has not ended.  The owners, despite the horse totaling a car in a midnight accident on a major highway, would not take advantage of the help offered.  They still don't understand their responsibility for control of a 1,000 pound breeding animal nor that this poor animal lives a lonely life all by himself.  This stallion continued to break down fencing as long as I had mares on the property.  Driving us to the brink of financial ruin and forcing me to rehome my beloved forever mares.  And even with vet checks and ultra-sounds, we ended up with two colts.  These boys will need gelding, training and care for a lifetime.  They are loved.  But honestly?  They were not 'wanted'.  (Law enforcement, animal control and the courts were of no help - so don't bother telling me that they would have.  Laws differ from state to state, burden of enforcement sometimes falls to citizens.)  I hope that Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue thrives for decades to come.  I hope that there comes a time when they aren't pulled out of bed at three in the morning to transport a crippled, blind or starved animal to its final resting place - able to provide a few loving hours in a life of misery because the owners and authorities FINALLY did the right thing, Too late... too late.  I hope that someday they can focus JUST on proactive education.  Helping loving struggling owners to get along during times of need instead of documenting carcasses in a barren pen because an owner was in hospital and no one cared.  I hope that someday, long after I am gone, this amazing team looks back on a lifetime of change.   Stories that the next generation will have trouble believing - because seriously - look at the before pictures.   Who could believe so many animals are suffering around us all the time through ignorance, lack of law enforcement or evil intent?   The HOP team has a vision and have developed a practical approach to maximizing  every penny to help the most animals and owners possible - right now and into the future. This is the legacy, ethics and excellence for which every rescue should be striving.   =============== Because of the handful of rescue animals I care for myself, I am unable to donate money to the rescue.  But, oh my... I wish I could.  I've seen money wasted and spent foolishly at so many other rescues.  Not these folks.   I've seen greed and ego and over reaching and lack of local support doom well meaning  rescues to failure.  Not these folks.   Please, help them change our future and the future of all animals.

I do not have much money left after paying my bills, but I am a monthly donor to HOP. The work they have done and continue to do in the name of love for horses, is truly amazing. They educate communities, police and animal control out of necessity for the work they do in saving the lives of horses. It takes a village and Heart of Phoenix is the heart that keeps the village united in their cause. I wish I lived local to them; I would be a foster and transporter for them.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	298678	1	/users/profile/389569	LizE	Volunteer	5	07/31/2016	Heart of Phoenix is a fantastic, responsible rescue organization. I couldn't have found a better group to volunteer for. Everyone truly cares about animals and finding the best possible outcome for them. The foster network is amazing. They are very knowledgeable horse people and have an incredible track record for rehabbing some of the worst neglect cases you could imagine. It's very rare that we lose a horse, and when we do it's felt by all of us. Fortunately the vast majority of horses HOP takes in are success stories. I have seen horses go from skeletal, unresponsive, and sour to being fat, happy babies who look forward to human interaction and enjoy having a job to do. HOP does amazing work and I'm proud to be a small part of the organization.
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	298652	1	/users/profile/389543	Sonora W.	Board Member	5	07/31/2016	Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue has been the most rewarding non for profit group I have ever involved with.I have been with this group for over 4 years and this group of dedicated people are the best by far.We strive every day to bring education,awareness and aid to our tristate community as well as rescuing and rehabilitating horses in need.We run entirely on the donations from the community and others that follow our work.We offer educational clinics for the public as well as Humane officers in the state.We hold gelding clinics yearly for those unable to afford gelding,dental ,farrier and veterinary care for their equines.Please vote for us and help us to continue this important work .

I was astonished by how much this organization cares about animals and by the dedication the volunteers have to save "just one more." If not for HOP, I wouldn't have my dream horse, Dozer.
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	256339	2	/users/profile/344743	Debby R.	Donor	5	09/11/2015	This rescue goes above and beyond for horses in great need in an impoverished area of our country. There is sincere compassion for the horses as well as the people who have fallen on hard times. The love and care provided is truly inspirational. There has been horses who couldn't stand on their own that were nurtured back to a fairy tale ending.

I follow the rescue on Facebook and Sonora Winds as my pets groomer. This rescue is ran with the upmost ethical ability and compassion. As a horse lover, this rescue has impressed me most with their ability and knowledge and efficient treatment of the animals that come to their fields. The incredible turnaround of these animals and the animals response to the care and love that they are given is shown in every update.  
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	256288	2	/users/profile/344686	Sandra92	Donor	5	09/10/2015	My family follows this group on facebook. My daughter donated her cold water challenge earnings to their great cause.  Time and time again they come in when help is needed, even when they don't have the resources to give.  They are working to tackle the growing problem of the abandoned coal mine horses despite tied hands.  They set up clinics to teach, educate and help horses and the people that love them.  I am sure that there are other rescues that do the same but this group is close to our hearts.  We hope that they keep up and are able to keep up all the good work they do.  God bless and thank you HOP.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	256191	1	/users/profile/87519	Sarah S.	Donor	5	09/10/2015	I have been watching this group for about a year now and I am blown away by the dedication of the team that is HOP. They always go far beyond the call of duty and often beyond what seems even possible when a horse needs them. Their success with the skeletal horses they have saved is next to none as is their success with horses whose mental equilibrium has been damaged and I find those stories truly inspirational. I am also impressed by their ability to make the hard choices when they are best for the horse. I admire their philosophy because it is often easier to do what's best for us which may well prolong the horse's suffering; HOP looks that situation straight in the face and puts the horse first and foremost. I shed many tears reading those posts but I support their humaneness. This group makes me wish I lived in their area so that I could do more for them than be a monthly contributor!

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	256167	3	/users/profile/344562	yaya11	Donor	5	09/10/2015	Well, ive followed them since I first came on fb. Right after they started. I have had only positive results from watching them carefully. As another two rescued let me down with wasted money and not keeping up with the animals in there care. I think every thing they do is good. Tinia and staff, put stuff out for all to see. Best thing ever. Love them to pieces. And have never met the founder. But like I said they check out on the up and up. Won't any body help them? Please try. They love animals. As us animal lovers do. Wish they were closer I would volunteer. Even being disabled I'd help if I could. Just smelling a horse and barn smells, sigh in love. And only real animal people understand this. Save as many as you can. You have prayers and all the love and moral Support I can give.

Having seen the transformation of walking skeletons of  horses to vibrant and beautiful  horses is amazing.   The rescue has an amazing support system of core rescuers, I am sure I can not describe adequately the work they do.  But I know their heart is in it for every horse.

They also try to educate owners in order to help horses.... A truly excellent Rescue....

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	256110	3	/users/profile/344503	LynnMarie	Donor	5	09/10/2015	I have been following Heart of Phoenix over the past year after they were recommended by Stacy Westfall.  That got my attention!  I love that HOP has accountability measures in place.  They document their rescues very well, then continue to post updates of exactly how each horse is doing, so that people like me who live far away in another state, and cannot see them in person, can trust to make a donation.  I am very impressed that they have built trusted relationships with some of the top veterinarians in the nation and with local law enforcement.  It is amazing that they also go above and beyond to continue to check on adopted horses in their adoptive homes to ensure they havent gone back into the same neglect or sold to someone that would eventually sell them for slaughter.  You can tell they truly care about the well-being of animals since they share their knowledge and have been educating not only our nation of horse owners, but those who are following from around the world.  They post very informative articles from refeeding a starved horse to basic nutrition. They constantly prove that they want to work positively and support other rescues, which is valiant in an age of competition where animals pay the price for dissention.  But what will really grab you, go to the website and be sure to read Tinia Creamers story combined with how this rescue began.  Grab tissue, but it will make you want to cheer her on in support.  And all of the volunteers who make up this hard working team that fights day in and day out.  Not for glory, but simply to save lives.  And... they are hilarious, too!

A team of amazing people who work tirelessly to save those who've been forgotten.  Never seeking riches or glory.  Going without sleep, food, time with their families in order to care for the unwanted.  They travel hundreds and hundreds of miles, work around the clock to provide care often to the critically ill and never complain.  They give dignity and wings to those who cannot be saved.  I cannot comprehend the emotional strength it takes to rescue day in, day out, and still maintain a positive outlook on the world.  Heart of Phoenix are amazing, so many horses now healthy, comfortable, loved and cared for, brought back from the edge of the abyss.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	256082	2	/users/profile/344473	WVAnne	Donor	5	09/10/2015	I have been following this rescue for several years.  What they have accomplished in saving lives of horses in our  tri-state area is nothing short of a miracle as well as a lot of blood, sweat and tears on their part.   They are the much needed voice of abused and neglected equines in this economically depressed area and in addition to bringing awareness to this plight they have taken inititiative and done something about it.  They are the first to try to address the problem and search for a solution to that of thousands of abandoned horses left on strip mines.   They post photos and video of the horrific and heart wrenching beginnings of rescue and show each stage of the horses rehab and recovery and even follow through with updates after placement into their new homes.  Not only have they rescued equine lives but other animals like our black lab, Bo, was very fortunate to have been networked to us by way of Heart of Phoenix.  We love him and are so thankful for him and just can't imagine the fate that may have awaited him if HOP had not brought him into our lives.  I've yet to adopt a horse from here but hope one day to do so.  Until then, I will continue to follow and support this incredible group of animal-loving angels in any way that I can.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	224273	3	/users/profile/288017	Jessica195	Volunteer	5	10/19/2014	I've seen many people try to start a "rescue" in this area (WV, OH, and KY) and who have failed because the need here is greater than any one person can handle on their own. That's why Heart of Phoenix succeeds where others could not. They are a network, many people uniting under one cause with the same determination and strength, who believe they can make a difference... And they are. HOP continues to grow, uniting other, farther away rescues, and bringing everyone together. They support each other, if there is a horse in need, even if they have no room, they find someone who does. They are relentless in their dedication to the equines they save from horrible neglect and pain. They do not sugar-coat the truth and when others have failed in their duty to these animals, to keep them safe, fed, and protected, HOP steps in and tries to repair the damage. They are a blessing to the state of WV, every single volunteer and dedicated supporter.

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	193090	3	/users/profile/252199	Jessi A.	Donor	5	01/25/2014	I love this rescue.  For Christmas this year my daughter wanted to donate some of her money to help horses as she'd lost her aged mare that fall and she had kept up with the page the rescue operates where they list up to date information on the horses they have.  She loved seeing the pictures of the horses when they came in to HOP and how they improved and so decided this was a place she wanted to help because she could see where her money was going to go.   And I have a feeling that one day, should we ever get another horse, odds are I will do my best to adopt through them as I know the care they take to ensure the adopter knows the good and bad of the horse they get to ensure safety to both horse and adopter.
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	193086	3	/users/profile/252195	softball.mom33	Donor	5	01/24/2014	I am careful where I put my financial support.  There are so many needs for people and animals alike everywhere we look.  I want my donations to be well spent in areas where the need is greatest.  HOP is the kind of organization where I can donate and know that equines are benefiting from everything I donate.  They operate in an area of intense need as well so I know that with the funds I send horses, and sometime the people who just can't sustain them anymore, are benefiting and I am not just another coin in the coffers.  A small group of volunteers does an amazing job, not just at the official rescues jobs, but in networking for those they can't, as an organization or individuals, take in.  There are lots of places to put your money but HOP is one of the best in my opinion.  
Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	193057	5	/users/profile/252157	suzanna1973	Client Served	5	01/24/2014	Three years ago we adopted a beautiful, Arabian mare from this organization.  They provided extensive information on her capabilities and personality.  She was in excellent health when she came to live with us and my teenager fell in love with her.  Although a few people object to the adoption contract that comes with each animal, we find comfort in knowing that they are concerned with how Teza is doing for her lifetime.  It is no hardship to provide pictures and updates so that they can continue to monitor her well being.  Since our adoption, my children and I have volunteered for Heart of Phoenix and made numerous donations to them.  The fact that they provide continual updates on their current and past rescues, by picture and in word, let us see exactly where our money is going.  Heart of Phoenix exemplifies the gold standard that all rescue organizations should strive for!!!

Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue Inc.	193045	3	/users/profile/252136	moore_a86	General Member of the Public	5	01/24/2014	I  personally have rescued many animals over the years. My parents were the type of people that never let an animal suffer. Even if my dad had to wheel and deal to get the animal safe at home with us. So over the years  living in a rural community you will see your fair share of animal neglect and abuse. What you do not see as often is someone to help them. In the short time I have been aware  of Heart of Phoenix Equine Rescue I really am blown away by the care and dedication they have to these horses in desparate need. Not only are they going above and beyond what most people will  it is for a large animal that has such a small chance of being rescued. Thumbs up for the 2 and 4 hr drives and carrying sad little starved ponies and a pat on the back for HOP and all of its volunteers!

For many of the GWCH clients, this organization has been a Godsend; for most, a lifeline; for all, a goal-directed path toward improved situations and a higher quality of life.  There has been very little turnover in staff throughout the existence of the coalition; therefore, there is consistency, continuity, and a genuine camaraderie amongst and between the administration, case management, support staff and adjunct providers that is transmitted to excellent client care. Clients often express a sense of belonging and a deep gratitude to the people of the organization for demonstrating compassion but also knowing when and how to push them toward successful transitions.

Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless Inc	102074	1	/users/profile/132064	jmanning	Board Member	5	12/09/2011	It has been my pleasure to serve on the board for the Homeless Coalition for the past six years, and as the board's president the past several.  I have been involved with other organizations, and I have found that few have staff members who are as devoted to their work, as caring about their clients, and as dedicated to providing services to the homeless of our area.  The staff's work makes our work as board members easy in one sense, but also challenges us to be more diligent and provide them the tools they need to succeed.  Under the Executive Director's leadership, they have grown the organization from being reactive to proactively trying to prevent homelessness.  I am happy to continue my involvement with the Coalition and will remain involved even if I leave the board.
Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless Inc	102055	1	/users/profile/131985	rg1160	Client Served	5	12/08/2011	I had been seen by the Coalition since 2003.  I had a long history or addiction and mental health issues and have been in and out of shelter for years.  Each time I went to the Coalition I was treated with respect and encouraged to change.  I have been sober and in treatment for 2 years now and I have my own apartment.  None of this would have been possible without the positive encouragement of the Coalition's staff.
Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless Inc	101968	1	/users/profile/131804	bdalek	Volunteer	5	12/08/2011	I volunteered for the Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless in the summer of 2009. I found the services and attention provided for the staff to be far above the norm, and I believe this is an undervalued organization in the Ohio Valley. If more places put the effort into caring for those around them like the GWCH does, the area would be a better place overall.

Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless Inc	101775	1	/users/profile/131323	Neal W.	Board Member	5	12/06/2011	I have served on the board of the Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless for many years. I have rarely seen an organization so focused and passionate about its mission. It's not a "hand-out" type of organization (not that there's anything wrong with that). It's truly a hand-up organization. It works with its clients to not only help them, but teach them how to help themselves - how to become independent, productive and confident. It moves them from homelessness to self-support, from those who have hit rock-bottom to those who are rock-climbers - slowly and deliberately improving their position in life - with a goal, direction and the strength to get there. The accomplishment of this mission has been a humbling feat for me to watch over the years. I can't begin to explain in words the strength of character the staff of the Coalition possess. They have so much more than just caring hearts. Working with the homeless every day is an extremely challenging and stressful career choice - because they aren't just doing a job. People's lives actually depend on the staff and how dedicated and sincere they are about their "job". It's real, it's serious, it can be heartbreaking at times, and at other times it can be the most rewarding experience imaginable. It's worth becoming involved in. The community can help. Contact the Coalition for more information on how you can help the homeless through your contribution of either time, money or goods. The Coalition is making a difference in people's lives, and with your help they can make that difference faster and better.

Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless Inc	101757		/users/profile/131280	Wendy Scatterday	Board Member	5	12/06/2011	I have had the privilege of serving on the Executive Board for the GWCH for over ten years.  I have witnessed the caring staff truly nurture & care for our clients, daily, in ways that are not in a 'job description', but are from their hearts.  They listen, they advise, they put the needs of the clients above all else.  In addition to the high quality services provided, the GWCH does so in creative ways, given an ever reduced budget.  They are determined to provide the maximum 'hand up' to our clients with minimal resources.  I am amazed at the success stories & the lives changed for the people the GWCH serves.  It is an organization that makes a difference and does so with the highest level of fiduciary, moral, and personal accountability.
Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless Inc	101726		/users/profile/131094	kvoytecek	General Member of the Public	5	12/05/2011	In the fall of 2010, I was lucky enough to be hired by the Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless as Programs Coordinator.  Although my employment at the Coalition was far more brief than I would have liked, I cherished the months I spent there and the people I met.  Like most people, before I worked there, I thought that the Homeless Coalition was primarily a shelter for the homeless, when in fact, it is not.  While the Coalition does work in conjunction with several other agencies, including local shelters, it's primary function and goal, is to end homelessness.  When a person who is homeless becomes a client of the Coalition, they avail themselves to, many programs that have the potential to truly change their lives.  The Coalition staff works closely with individuals to provide them with immediate shelter, and for those who qualify, help in finding long-term housing and even permanent housing, all while providing education and support in essential life skills, such as securing employment, learning to budget and navigating the often-confusing path to earned government benefits.  The staff at the Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless are a rare bunch, always ready with a warm greeting and a cup of the city's best coffee.  They truly are the kindest, most compassionate people I have ever worked with, treating each client with respect and dignity.  Every employee makes it his/her mission to identify the best, most effective options available to help each client find his/her way to a better life.  Clients who ask for, and receive, assistance are required to actively partake in making life changes, in educational opportunities, and to serve their own hours of service to better their living environments or that of those in the community.   They are constantly seeking out new programs that may benefit the homless population of the Ohio Valley, or crafting new ways to pay for the continuation of programs that have proven successful in the past.  In short, any individual who finds themselves down on their luck and chooses to step inside the doors of the Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless, has already taken the first step to a better life.
Greater Wheeling Coalition for the Homeless Inc	101708		/users/profile/131057	ljahantab	Volunteer	5	12/05/2011	I have volunteered through unpaid internships at the Coalition twice, and have had a positive experience each and every time.  The Coalition is one of those agencies that takes their mission to heart; everyday, the case managers and staff focus their work towards ending the cycle of homelessness permanently in the community.  I was blessed that I had the opportunity to intern here, and be inspired by the strength and resiliency of Coalition clients, supported continually towards achieving their goals by skilled, caring staff.

I am volunteering for this non-profit as a receptionist, making coffee, signing clients into the agency and answering the phone, as well as doing any filing or odd jobs that need completing while I'm here. It has been extremely rewarding as I get to interact and speak directly with clients on a regular basis. I have always felt welcome and appreciated as a volunteer by both clients and Coalition personnel alike. Volunteering at the Coalition has proved genuinely enjoyable, and has given me valuable insight into the way non-profit agencies operate and provide aid to clients. The Coalition has provided me with ample training and guidance to best help them.

I have introduced them to top-quality performances of Shakespeare, Arthur Miller, and many other historic and new playrights and musicals.  The performances are not only top notch (and quite affordable), but they prompt family conversations that extend over the years about society, characters, and history.  Thanks GVT!!!

Since then GVT has been a life-changing place for me, a family that I have had the wonderful opportunity to call my home. It's amazing that this place exists in such a small town and its sheer presence has sent ripples throughout the community and far beyond. I am proud to say that GVT was my first employer and I continued to work, act and volunteer there every year that I lived in West Virginia. GVT is a one of a kind place that cannot be missed.

I am now an actress living in NYC, and when times are tough and I feel like I am losing my way, all I have to do to reclaim my passion is remember how good it felt to be on the GVT stage. I would not be living the life I now lead if not for GVT's influence.

They learned about responsibility, art, set building,  working with others, and they had all this with the sheer joy of creating.  GVT has enhanced our community with entertainment and economic development by drawing visitors who came to see a play but the also ate, shopped and stayed in out hotels.  This is one of Lewisburg's - no, West Virginian's greatest assets!
Greenbrier Valley Theatre	144828		/users/profile/191372	Kirsten5	Donor	5	11/30/2012	GVT is far more than a theatre.  As a parent I admire the education programs.  The children learn so many aspects of theatre such as writing, lighting, costuming, set designing, etc. They also have life skills reinforced such as discipline and working in groups. Wonderful to watch children develop confidence.  They also develop love and respect for the theatre.  Every summer a children's show is produced.  Amazing to see the little ones watch in awe as adults take make-believe to a new level! GVT is a place where dreams are born and realized!

Greenbrier Valley Theatre	144638		/users/profile/191177	Loreleilucy	Board Member	5	11/29/2012	GVT is a theatre run by artists who are dedicated to the theatre and to the community we share.  The art comes first.  As a Board member, we totally support that effort, through our fund raising and our support of the artists.  As a member of the community, to see students from all around the region come to this theatre, see challenging work, "get it", and grown talking with the artists is a thrill and a privilege.  To see little kids in the community attend the education program, growing in self-confidence, self-expression, imagination and creativity, all in a safe place, without competition, is very special.  To top it off, to know that the work on stage rivals that of many other theatres in much larger metropolitan areas, it is easy to support the work as a Board member.  I love the work and I love the people.

The theatre provides a widely varied roster of plays and musicals and takes artistic risks in its programming.  I have been lucky enough to work there over several years and see how they have grown and continue to reach out to the community with expanding educational offerings, taking shows on the road to areas of the state that have NO OTHER theatre option, and employing top quality artists from around the country.  The leadership at the theatre is inspiring and visionary and it has a strong and active board of directors in place.

West Virginia is so lucky to have such a wonderful place in its state.  GVT has so much to offer between their top-caliber theatrical productions, several music events, and their amazing Education Department.  It is so great that such a small town has such a huge asset.  One of the most amazing things about GVT is the community within the business.  It is so wonderful to see so many people committed to the arts and to making a difference.  GVT is nurturing our future generation through its education classes.  The students learn about all aspects of theatre, but more importantly, they leave with self-confidence, great public speaking skills, and lifelong friendships.  GVT is a place that deserves to be recognized!

My friends and I saw Cabaret earlier this year and it was totally worth seeing.  The lead actress who played Sally, was excellent.  Not only was her performance captivating, we found that the overall direction of the other characters was very strong.  The costume was right on with the times as with set design.  We look forward to coming back to GVT very soon. - Christina Entenmann.

Greenbrier Valley Theatre	124645		/users/profile/169590	taurus2at	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2012	It is such a joy to have Greenbrier Valley Theatre in our community. The performance quality is exceptional, but they are so much more than just a good show. Their summer and after school programs for children are fantastic, and they never turn a child away if their family can't afford tuition (which is already less than the cost of most babysitters around here!). I also love that they use their lobby space to showcase works of local artists. My favorite program, though, is the"pay what you can nights". Every show, the night before opening, they invite audiences to come see the final dress, and only expect people to pay what they can afford. What a great way to get everyone to love theatre!

Under the caring and leadership of Kathie Brown, the organization has grown from a very small clinic to one that is now serving over 15,000 working poor individuals for their primary health care and medications.  More services have been added each year and the clinic is about to initiate a full service Dental Clinic.  For the past eight years I have been involved directly with the clinic as a volunteer physician, seeing first-hand the competent and caring work of the mid-level providers, nurses and support staff.  As in all organizations, successful ones, must have leadership at the top that sets the tone for the organization.  We are blessed to have Kathie Brown as our leader who serves tirelessly to care the economically less fortunate individuals of our community and she does it with a very small administrative staff.  In spite of significant cuts in funding by our state government, the clinic has a positive bottom line.  This is accomplished through Kathies efforts to be the designated beggar of the organization.Wheeling Health Right is truly deserving to be honored by receiving a 2015 Top Rated Award.					Donald H.

Wheeling Health Right Inc	43156	7	/users/profile/43942	rite-healthy	Former Volunteer	5	06/07/2010	As a volunteer, I helped with different areas of care.  My first day I was overwhelmed at the number of prescriptions that were filled in a day. I realized most of these people would go without their medicines if not for Health Right. I also helped with filing papers on charts and noticed the extent of care these patients recieved.  They treated simple colds to major life threarening illnesses.  So many of the doctors do volunteer work to help the underprivledged.   The doctors were psychiatrist, OB and gyne doctors, cardiologist, family doctors and more.  All were treated with respect and dignity and made to feel that their life mattered.  The community would be in dire need of care if Wheeling Health Right did not exist.  They make community care important to people not just in Wheeling but many counties in WV and Ohio. Their special programs include going out into the community for Diabetic education, smoking cessation, Baby and child care and many other helpful programs.
Wheeling Health Right Inc	42711	9	/users/profile/43430	stephanie18	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/02/2010	My mother owes her life to this nonprofit organization.  She was able to be admitted to the hospital through the emergency department because this is a service offered by Wheeling Health Right.  Dr. Commerci, her family physician, consulted a surgeon when she was admitted and she was found to have a life threatening fatal infection known as necrotizing fascitis (tissue eating bacteria).  She was transported via ambulance to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh after having one surgery to try to contain the bacteria.  The surgery was not a success and she needed more specialized surgeon and care that were not provided at Wheeling hospital.  She ended up having 22 total surgeries, a wound vac placed, and went into acute renal failure.  If she was not able to go to the hospital because of Health Right in the first place, she would be dead today!  Thank you for saving my mother's life and allowing her to continue being an awesome mother.  Thanks to Kathie Brown, the president of this organization, as her dedication to her patient's, patient's families, physicians, and staff has exceeded all expectations.  Wheeling Health Right still provides care to my mother today and she receives her medications here as well.  The staff are friendly, empathetic and always willing to help.  Please keep nonprofit health care organizations such as this one up and running for those individuals that are not fortunate enough to be able to afford health care.  I highly recommend Wheeling Health Right to anyone!!
Communities Of Shalom Inc	80052		/users/profile/87409	Riley	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	As a pastor of a local congregation, I have long felt that the problem with churches is primarily the pastors. Pastors oftentimes fail to cooperate with each other because they feel that they are in competition with other pastors. As a consequence, they are attempting to build up their own fiefdom, as opposed to building up the kingdom. If churches could only work together, we could accomplish so much more than we currently do. This also includes our local Council of Churches.  I attended meetings of Communities of Shalom several times before being  willing to be a part of the Board. My reason for joining is that I found that Shalom was actually doing something, rather than just talking about doing things.  For the last two years I have participated in Building Bridges and Global Gathering programs. I am also now participating in outreach to International Students at our local college. For the last two years I have participated in Habitat for Humanity, building houses in Mannington and Fairmont.  What I find most helpful about Shalom is their stress on asset-based planning.  Shalom is not just Christian but crosses over into other faith traditions. We participate in celebrating varied faith traditions. 
Communities Of Shalom Inc	79886		/users/profile/87235	KitCatWV	Volunteer	4	02/28/2011	Marion Shalom  is a process in building in many ways. Marion Shalom is all-inclusive in its many objectives. We have wonderful planning retreats where all are heard. We have time of prayer and are deeply concerned over issues that affect many. Respect is also high on our list. 
Communities Of Shalom Inc	78796		/users/profile/86088	Faithbow	Board Member	5	02/27/2011	We are a varied group. Everyone has such different talents and all the talents we have fit into our program. We use all our talents. I am really proud of the group because we build assets in the community and we are willing to share them with the community.  I'm most proud that we started Teen Court. It is one of the most wonderful things to come out of Shalom.
Communities Of Shalom Inc	78789		/users/profile/86081	Rorbow	Board Member	4	02/27/2011	I was a part of the original founding group. I believe in the concept and the principles of Shalom, especially asset-based community development.

Communities Of Shalom Inc	75740		/users/profile/82733	Ted L.	Board Member	5	02/25/2011	I have been involved with the Marion County Communities of Shalom since in conception in 1998.  This small organization has achieved many accomplishments in its brief history.  There are five strategic areas we concentrate in:  Health and Wellness, Community Spirituality, Re-newing and Rebuilding Community life, Housing and Economical Development.  The goal is to empower the community to bring systemic change by recognizing strengths and to build upon those strengths to empower others to make a positive change in the community.   When we first organized as a group, we looked at what were some of the strengths in Marion County.  We found from surveys that were taken through out Marion County, that our youth was one of our most important assets.  At that time there was a severe problem with the judicial system with youth offenders and how the system was dealing with punishment for these young individuals.  We were able to make a change with the system by initiating the Teen Court program here in Marion County.  The program was started in 2000 and has become a non-profit 501 (3) organization that is an active court system run by the youth for first time juvenile offenders.  This organization that was started by the communities of Shalom has made a positive impact on the youth and the court system to bring systemic change in Marion County. Another area Communities of Shalom has made a difference is in  housing for low income families.  In early 1999 Marion County Communities of Shalom recognized the need to reorganize the local Habitat for Humanity affiliate due to lack of proper leadership and funding.  The Shalom site took the leadership over and built partnerships to strengthen the organization.   We are very pleased to have succeeded in this endeavor to have built ten houses for needy families in Marion County.  These are just two examples where the Communities of Shalom have made a difference in Marion County West Virginia. Marion County Communities of Shalom can be more effective when funding is secure for a full time or part time director.  We are a 501 (c3) organization and have qualified persons on the team to write grants and provide leadership but we need to have a person who can take on the daily responsibilities of runing the organization to reach out into the community effectively in doing more to make a difference in Marion County.    
Communities Of Shalom Inc	75447		/users/profile/82412	FPAllen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/25/2011	This organization was formed in the wake of a terrible hate crime that left people all over West Virginia shocked and feeling powerless. Those of us from other parts of the state watched as this community came forward with positive action. As a mediator, dedicated to promoting understanding and peaceful resolution of conflict, I was impressed and encouraged to see the way Marion County made collaboration the center of their efforts to educate themselves and their neighbors about living beyond tolerance. I have been asked to speak at their Building Bridges of Respect Conference many times, and have always been eager to donate my time. The crown on their work, for me, is their full and respectful involvement of the youth of their community. This not only recognizes the dignity of their young people in the present, but is an investment that will yield benefits to us all.

Over my entire career, which includes several years as a Social Worker, Substance Abuse therapist, and Teacher, I have never before encountered an organization who so greatly embraces everyone. Communities of Shalom strives to bring people together from all walks of life to work on building a better community. They encourage citizens to get involved at a local level to create change and they provide opportunites for our community to learn and grow. 
Communities Of Shalom Inc	74514		/users/profile/81424	ElainePollock	Board Member	5	02/24/2011	Without a religious congregation connection locally, I feel that my association with the members of Shalom I consider my religious family. 
Communities Of Shalom Inc	73710		/users/profile/80547	Divine Ms. M	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2011	Communities of Shalom is one of the most multi-faceted, inclusive organization in West Virginia.  As a Professional in the field of Public Health and Community Development, I have traveled the state and region assisting communities to develop a coalition to address social concerns.  I always use Communities of Shalom as an example of a coalition that truly meets the needs of their community, have an inclusive membership that is open to one and all, and truly implements programs that increases knowledge and awareness from acceptance, substance abuse prevention,   to coordinating and sponsoring Global Gatherings, Building Bridges conference that speaks to cultural diversity, youth trainings on bullying, etc.  Communities of Shalom truly represents an interfaith organization that serves everyone in the community.
Communities Of Shalom Inc	73026		/users/profile/79827	annaletitia	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	This organization was an integral part of my high school experience. I participated in a youth group started and funded by Shalom. I met other high school students from a variety of backgrounds who were interested in serving others. I worked on countless service projects through this group. This group was open to all who were interested. I felt like I finally belonged to a group of people who accepted me for who I am. I also was able to significantly contribute to my community, as well as to other communities on service trips. 
Communities Of Shalom Inc	72809		/users/profile/79585	MarthaDavid1985	Board Member	4	02/22/2011	I have been a member of Communities of Shalom, Inc. for approximately 7 years. I have volunteered with special projects such as Building Bridges of Respect, Global Gathering, Fund-raisers, and serve as the Treasurer of the organization. For me, Shalom accentuates the positive in our community. The group seeks out small projects that have a big impact. For instance, Shalom supported and guided Teen Court into existence.  Shalom also offers a support system to the international students at the local university. We provide an opportunity for them to share their cultures and integrate more with the community.
Communities Of Shalom Inc	72121		/users/profile/78861	Susan	Board Member	5	02/21/2011	I became involved with Communities of Shalom when I participated in a political forum the organization sponosored.  Through this forum, I learned more about the organization and how an interfaith group could do so much with so little.  I immediately wanted to become involved.   Communities of Shalom, Inc. focuses on problems from a different angle -- how can we use the assets already available in the community to make the situation better.  It's not throwing money at a problem and walking away from it.  It is taking action to assemble the positives to eliminate the negatives. Of the faith based organizations with which I have been involved, Communities of Shalom is a unified, cooperative organization that I am very pleased to be a part.
Communities Of Shalom Inc	68792		/users/profile/75174	mesimis	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	The youth of our community were lucky enough to benefit from the support that the Communities of Shalom gave to a vibrant, welcoming ecumenical youth organization called JOURNEY.  JOURNEY was able to provide numerous opportunities of fellowship, mission experiences, worship, and leadership to many pre teens, teenagers and young adults through Communities of Shalom's  financial support and adult leadership.  Communities of Shalom continues to provide opportunities for our citizens to reach out and make our community a better place.

Clay Center for the Arts & Sciences of West Virginia Inc.	176158		/users/profile/232546	Andrew60	Board Member	5	10/09/2013	Civic and business leaders, along with arts organizations studied what we wanted for the Center for the Arts and Sciences of West Virginia for over a decade before we started construction. We wanted to bring Education, Economic Development, and Entertainment to the city, region and State. The Clay Foundation and family, along with many people, businesses, organizations and government helped us achieve our goals and promises. Ten years after its opening, I believe we have delivered on our promises of the 3 E's, plus more. I am so proud of the employees, volunteers, individuals, and businesses that have made the Clay Center the vibrant economic, entertainment, and educational centerpiece of our city, region, and State. Thanks to everyone who helped make this dream a reality. We look forward to continued success in the next decade and beyond.  Former Board Chair, Andrew K Teeter
Clay Center for the Arts & Sciences of West Virginia Inc.	176038		/users/profile/232429	RLNicholson	Donor	5	10/09/2013	The Clay Center has been a resource for my family since its inception.  I was introduced to it when my children were small and loved attending the science museum, which is entertaining and geared toward inquisitive kids.  As an adult, I also found the Clay Center to be rewarding for a varied stream of musical performances in a performance hall that boasts sterling sound quality for a concert experience, as well as the art museum.  Over the years, the Clay Center's performance lineup has shifted to include acts by emerging artists on the way up (bolstered by its periodic hosting of Mountain Stage performances) in addition to well-known artists.  This shift shows the Center's focus on reaching all age groups in its programming and developing the next generation of subscribers.  Charleston is a small city, and West Virginia a smaller state, so it is a treasure to have such a fabulous performing hall, science museum and art museum all under one roof.
Clay Center for the Arts & Sciences of West Virginia Inc.	174722		/users/profile/231029	Lloyd Jackson	Board Member	5	10/07/2013	During its first ten years of serving West Virginia and the entire tri-state area, the Clay Center for the Arts and Sciences has become the regional place to go for great entertainment and unique educational experiences for children and adults of all ages.  From Tony Bennett to the Jonas Brothers and from Broadway to ballet, the multiple genres offered by the Clay Center have made the performing arts available and attractive to every sector of our society.  And with the spectacular art exhibits and the science museum, there are visual arts and educational offerings for everyone.  The performance hall accommodates not only outstanding musical acts and theatrical performances, it also serves as home to the West Virginia Symphony, one of the gems of our region. The first ten years have been a time of incredible growth and maturity for the Clay Center, and the obvious trajectory points to even greater things to come.

The staff go out of their way to insure that patrons enjoy a wonder experience and the exposure to art and science through the rotating exhibits and displyas and children's museum makes a visit to the Clay a wonderfully enriching experience. The planetarium and Electric Sky theatre offer an experience like no other in WV and truly one wortha  visit.

Direct Action Welfare Group Inc	182385		/users/profile/239201	mgerisch	Volunteer	5	10/25/2013	This nonprofit has helped so many folks who are marginalized to empower each others' voices.  They work tirelessly to organize communities so that they can empower themselves to overcome the stigmas of poverty and recognize their own worth as human beings.  Wherever they go, telling their stories, they gain support from others with stories to tell, and foster recognition that we are all suffering for lack of human rights and dignity in this country.  The have been successful at overcoming sterotypes which disempower groups that are traditionally marginalized, and have lead with love, inspiring others to do the same. They have grown from a local organization to one that is recognized by human rights allies nationwide.  They have provided support and solidarity to those struggling with oppression from the systems in place which do not respond to their clients with respect or dignity.  DAWG has changed and continues to change that situation.  I cannot speak highly enough of the work they have done wich spans all age groups, ethnicities and educational levels.  They foster a unification of welfare parents and teens that would not otherwise be possible, and which continues striving to change the social injustices of the systems within which we all live.
Direct Action Welfare Group Inc	172432		/users/profile/228333	Samuel H.	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/30/2013	The Direct Action Welfare Group succeeds in doing what is often so terribly difficult in social services: to involve and inspire consumers and clients to take a personal interest in improving service delivery system for the benefit of all. "DAWG" does this by educating consumers, creating leadership opportunities, advocating for good social policy development, and encouraging consumers to become fully participating citizens. The importance of this work cannot be overstated: creating an atmosphere of self-reliance on the part of vulnerable people and families, and demonstrating the value of shared responsibility to the public at large.

It is wonderful to be involved in an organization who is trying to help improve the lives of families who live in darkness around the world.
New Vision Renewable Energy	230751		/users/profile/294375	ntrudel	Advisor	5	10/30/2014	New Vision Renewable Energy ("NVRE") is a charitable organization that has changed the world, literally one light as a time, and does so with great enthusiasm, faith and a sense of kindness for humanity.  The organization teaches people, nationally and internationally, how to implement solar and sustainable energy into their world so that they may have light after sundown (when previously there was none) or so that they  may be free of kerosene and other pollutant-based forms of energy.   And then they provide the sustainable-energy equipment as well!  NVRE brings light to those who have none in remarkable ways-and with great success.
New Vision Renewable Energy	230710		/users/profile/294336	sandbarqn	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2014	By providing light to communities who may only have light as as long as the sun is up, New Vision gives people hope and a chance develop their families and communities. Those of us who stay up late take light for granted. Until I had heard about New Vision Renewable Energy, I hadn't realized how many people still use kerosene for light. NVRE's work truly is life changing.
New Vision Renewable Energy	230692		/users/profile/294319	MaxiesMom	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2014	NVRE is a faith-based non-profit bringing renewable energy solutions and products to people that have none. That in itself is life changing to all people in need.  Renewable energy is a global concern and the dedicate folks at NVRE are committed to the research, development and supply of affordable and effective renewable energy solutions and products. 
New Vision Renewable Energy	230400		/users/profile/294035	chrishaddox	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/30/2014	NRVE has been a great partner as I teach students at West Virginia University about collective stewardship of the earth and all her resources.  I've brought students to see the operations up on the ridge, engaged students in the construction of solar lights and most recently involved students in a project to raise funds for, and build, water filters and solar lights for a fellow student from Ethiopia.   The work NRVE is doing around the world to raise awareness of energy poverty, and to address it with on the ground projects, is top notch--very glad to be a small part of it all and I encourage others to do the same. 
New Vision Renewable Energy	230330		/users/profile/293972	SteveA	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/30/2014	NVRE was inspired by a spirit centered vision to use solar renewable energy to respond to the needs of some of the poorest areas of the US and overseas. With previous experience in these areas, and sound technical staff, they have and are designing, fabricating, distributing and supporting these systems in the field. Their onsite presence and strategic partnerships enhance their ability to serve.  I wholeheartedly endorse continued support of NVRE to help them grow and expand their vision and capabilities. 
New Vision Renewable Energy	224633		/users/profile/288388	cmm07	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2014	NVRE is doing great things to change the world that we live in.  From educating youth on climate issues, solar energy, and business to sending solar lights to those who are fighting Ebola, they are truly lighting up the world!  We need more organizations like NVRE who genuinely care and who are willing to work hard to make the changes that are necessary to improve the quality of life for those in need.

New Vision Renewable Energy	222770		/users/profile/286512	Gregg K.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2014	I know NVRE very well.  I've visited their site in West Virginia and came home driving a vegetable oil powered car!  I traveled with them when they donated over 200 solar lights to a community in Kenya where my organization worked.  I was even in the live radio audience when Ruston Seaman recently received the prestigious e-Town humanitarian award on NPR radio.  NVRE is the real deal, can't speak highly enough of their work!
New Vision Renewable Energy	222738		/users/profile/286479	Cindy150	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2014	New Vision has sent solar lights to 32 countries around the world. With a small staff, they have done miraculous things.  Right now they are in the midst of trying to send Solar light to their in-country partner in Liberia to help them fight the spread of Ebola.  They have changed the lives of families, but especially women and children.  Thousands of stories of success.  They have helped remove Kerosene lamps and their toxic fumes and replacing them with Solar lights, they have help start-up micro-businesses using their solar panels and batteries to sell phone charges, girls moving up in school because they can study at night, allowing them to not have to marry early or worse.  The stories go on and on.  Selfless wonderful group and people 
Lazy C Large Animal Rescue Ranch	307627		/users/profile/398977	Ashleigh4,	Client Served	5	10/03/2016	When my best friend, a Quarter Horse named Raven, died suddenly in the summer of 2014, my mother and I were heartbroken. Especially because it left our rescue mare Karma alone. Karma is missing an eye due to an unknown accident and was very skiddish, and could be very nervous without a buddy. I wasn't ready for another horse after the loss of Raven, so we decided the best thing for Karma would be to find her a herd of her own. My mother found Lazy C a few months later and when we first brought Karma I was very nervous - she is very submissive so I was worried about how the other horses in the herd would treat her and if the owner of the rescue would be in tune to her needs. Within a few minutes of meeting Marty and seeing the way she interacted with her horse Chief I began to feel at ease. Fast forward to July of this year and on a whim my mother and I decided to go to Lazy C and visit Karma. When we got there, we were surprised to learn that Karma had been adopted into a new home with a loving family! I'm so happy for her and I appreciate everything Marty did to make her happy. While mom and Marty talked about Karma, I decided to get to know the other horses. A beautiful strawberry roan walker horse came up to me and nuzzled me, playing with my hair and snuggling against my shoulder. That  was it - I was in love. I learned that his name was Shiloh and he was indeed up for adoption. I wasn't looking for a horse as I was getting ready to leave for my junior year of college and would be three hours away - but I just couldn't stop thinking about him. Not a week later and he was mine. Marty has been kind enough to board him for me while I'm away at school. This is ideal for me, as he is young, and I like the idea of him socilizing not only with other horses, but with other people. He is an amazing horse and I feel very connected to him, so I'm grateful for the chance to be able to visit and work with him, groom him, and ride him. He loves his little herd (especially his best friend Missy!) and respects Marty. He's been trained very well and is very gentle for his size, which is exactly what I need. Marty isn't just the woman who owns the rescue and feeds the horses. She's their friend, she treats the horses like family and they treat her as such. She's excellent at her job and has a great heart. I appreciate any time I get to spend with her, the tips she gives me, and her stories. I aspire to one day be able to work with horses the way she does. Thank you, Marty, for all that you do!

Marty is so friendly and knowledgeable about each horse there. She brings out their personalities and you can tell she is truly passionate about what she does! Kiyana was also very helpful with communicating all the arrangements for our visit and then later for our adoption. We've already recommended them to others in our family. Thanks for all you do.

She cares for each of them as her own. Marty has a veterinarian on call, and can take care of any major issues on the ranch. The few volunteers that she has are really helping her turn this small rescue into very dignified non-profit organization. I believe this Ranch will do nothing but improve over the next few years. Donate to Lazy C Rescue to help them complete their mission!

It's very easy to come to the rescue and receive needed service hours, college credit, and hands on experience.

West Virginia Community Development Hub	176832		/users/profile/233289	Luke E.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2013	The Hub's unofficial operating approach is 'turf suppression', which is something WV desperately needs.  The Hub's goal is to provide communities with tools, resources, and support for whatever local needs are identified, and they do it extremely well by bringing together a wide array of partners and service providers to work on a solving a problem in a collaborative and engaging way.  They have no interest in 'owning' their solutions - any successful work they do is spread as far and wide as possible.

Especially helpful are the coaches, technical expertise and advice, and the knowledge that we are not alone in trying to create a better community.  I personally think the HUB is one of the best organizations we have in the state to really help us help ourselves.  And hearing from other communities we find they have an outstanding record of continued support.  I'm very pleased with the HUB and  highly recommend them to others.

West Virginia Community Development Hub	169929		/users/profile/225208	Robert93	Client Served	5	09/16/2013	Our city became involved with the West Virginia Community Development HUB as a selected "Blueprint Community."  The Blueprint Community initiative combines a local steering team of eight members, who receive off-site capacity training.  A community coach is assigned by The HUB, to help facilitate program and project development to focus community energy.  In our instance, four sub-groups have been created to address specific community-building issues.  The sub-groups have individually prepared formalized planning and activity documents to ensure continuing work and program continuity.  Under the leadership of Kent Spellman, The HUB and its capable staff have helped energize a lethargic small city.  We anticipate that the 'boots on the ground' project work in our small city--coordinated with technical assistance from The HUB--will continue well into our future.  I have no hesitation in endorsing the fine work of The HUB.   
West Virginia Community Development Hub	169894		/users/profile/225173	jillyoung	Client Served	4	09/16/2013	I have been involved with the WV Hub for over 5 yrs.  My initial contact with them came when my community enrolled in the Community Development Training Program.  We took a team of 8 people to learn and explore ways to help build our community from the ground up.  The training was delivered in monthly meetings over a 10 month period.  The format of the training allowed for both work and reflection between trainings.  As a newcomer to my community, this training was the tool that I needed to be able to present my ideas in ways that would be received as helpful in my community.  Since that time, I have used the skills that I learned through that training on a near daily basis.  I have also worked with the Hub through their WV Food and Farm Coalition.  The Hub's early support of that project was instrumental in the development of a state-wide coalition of believers in the local food movement.  The WVFFC has been instrumental in building a strong network of people seriously committed to making a difference for our farmers and our families.I will continue to work with and rely on the Hub for their deep contributions to our communities across our state.

Now, as a director of an After School and preschool program in a low income neighborhood, I have come to appreciate all that these volunteers do for our children.  Many times, the CASA Volunteer is the most dependable person in the lives of the children they serve.  They truly do give the child a voice in their own situations, as a judge is determining their future.  I encourage others to give to this organization, in order to keep their operations solid.  They work very hard, in very difficult situations.

Their involvement with the children they represent is more than any other agency or caseworker can provide.  They make recommendations to the judges based on what they learn from building relationships with the children.  Those relationships hold no matter how many times they are in and out of the home, how many foster families they live with throughout the state or institutions they are placed in.  The role of a CASA Volunteer is critical for our children in the court system.

I came across A Child's Place CASA via a link on Volunteer.org.  When I met the Director and her small, but dedicated staff, I knew immediately this was the organization I wanted to be involved with.  CASA helps to provide a voice for children that have suffered from abuse or neglect in our communities.  It's not some far off charity in another country where you have no visibility to your donated funds and you can't easily volunteer your time.  A Child's Place CASA sends out newsletters and updates telling you exactly what they are doing to advocate for the children in our community.  There are many levels at which one can volunteer.  You can make a donation of time and/or money, you can be a court appointed advocate or you can help them fundraise.  You can assist with keeping the office tidy or donating supplies.  You can also drop off your used, one-sided copy paper and toner cartridges.  Every little bit helps this very worthy organization.  Invest in the future of our community...our children.

HCPAP is always working to help the dog and everything they do is directed towards helping rehabilitate and find the dogs fur-ever family.  They never put an animal down due to overpopulation in the rescue, once they are taken into it they stay until they find a home, for some that has been years.

Steve was very helpful in providing materials we needed as well as answering any questions I had to make it successful.Not only was the staff helpful, but the community was very supportive of our efforts.And after the event, Steve and Mark were quick to hear of our experience to learn how to make future opportunities more effective and successful.

Their knowledge of accessibility helps me gear my game designs and aesthetics to where they can be played and enjoyed by a wider audience. Ablegamers doesn't just help developers make their games more accessible to disabled gamers. Whether they intended it or not, their help makes games more accessible for everyone.

The Ablegamers Foundation Inc	55149		/users/profile/57145	Suzanne R.	Board Member	5	10/22/2010	I have worked with Ablegamers for over a year. They put together an amazing Accessibility Day at Games for Health in Boston last year, and also hosted a Game Arcade where people could come and play video games using adaptive switches and joysticks. Mark Barlet's passion for helping people with disabilities get more access to digital entertainment is infectious, and he was just honored by New York City's Mayor Bloomberg for his efforts. Ablegamers also works to help non-profits build computer accessibility into places like youth centers. The writers for the website, ablegamers.com, are an authentic community of disabled gamers and Mark has given them a place to talk about gaming and the devices and workarounds that will help give them a more fruitful gaming experience. I'm honored to be a member of the advisory board, and plan to continue working with Mark and his team as they advance accessibility for everyone.
The Ablegamers Foundation Inc	54839		/users/profile/56757	Nathan B.	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2010	Very briefly I worked as an editor/game reviewer when Ablegamers was first starting, though it has been many years since I have had an active role with Ablegamers, I frequently use and direct others to the website. It is through the game and tech reviews that I am able to better make decisions before investing in expensive games and adaptive equipment. As a disabled veteran, gaming, particularly online gaming, enables me to have interactions and a sense of accomplishment doing things, that I simply cannot do in real life. Folks sometimes find it odd that my characters in games tend to jump all over creation, climb things, and other activities, but these are things I cannot do anymore. Ablegamers provides an important resource for those of us who find a healthy outlet in gaming. Given the increase in Disabled Veterans, many avid gamers well before their disability, a source like this is so very important, information on games and tech to assist Disabled persons is shockingly hard to find at times, Ablegamers provides an invaluable resource for those transitioning from "able bodied gaming" to being disabled, and realizing that their loves and passions can find new venues, new outlets, and allow one to consider enjoying what they used too.

There Twitter feed highlights interesting articles about gaming on other sites as well as letting me know about updates on their site as well. Plus, when I've message them via Twitter I've gotten prompt, personal replies.I mostly use the website for the forums, groups, and game reviews. The groups and forums allow for peer support and community brainstorming. Their reviews actually give me an idea of whether or not I will find a game playable.

It was a time in my life that I did not have the ability to pay out extra money to have a puppy fixed.  The puppy I adopted was emaciated, in poor health, and very neglected.  Thanks to M-SNAP, we were able to adopt her! In 2012 Taylor won the Marilla Park Splash Bash Dog Trick Contest!!! THANK YOU M-SNAP, she changed our lives!

Mountaineer Spay Neuter Assistance Program	170920		/users/profile/226371	Wvfeline	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/20/2013	M-SNAP efficiently and effectively helps reduce the unwanted pet population by working with local veterinarians to subsidize the sterilization of many, many dogs and cats that would otherwise be left intact to produce hundreds of unwanted pets.
Mountaineer Spay Neuter Assistance Program	170801		/users/profile/226241	Cat52	Volunteer	5	09/20/2013	I got involved with M-SNAP in late 2008 because I hate the practice of killing off surplus dogs and cats at the pound and, based on the numbers published by our county pound, the kill-count was growing annually, which told me that euthanasia and the rescue/adoption programs were not nearly effective enough in curbing cat and dog overpopulation. M-SNAP enables people to fix their pets and neighborhood strays (for which they are care-providers); the animals would otherwise breed and add to the problem. I consider spaying and neutering to be the only long-term, humane solution to pet overpopulation.  I especially like it that, unlike almost every other non-profit that gives benefits to the public, M-SNAP has no income threshold for qualification. Not only poor people have pets, and not only poor people have trouble affording to fix them. While M-SNAP does ask that people wanting vouchers truly need the help, it understands that someone with a higher-than-minimum income might have three kids in college when that pregnant stray cat gets dumped on their street and he or she decides to take responsibility for it. Although not having a minimum income requirement means M-SNAP doesn't qualify for outside funding from some sources, the organization is willing to forego those benefits for the sake of the animals.

Since the inception of this organization a few short years ago, literally hundreds of women have been given professional attire, career resources, and most importantly, the support and networking opportunities needed to maximize employment opportunities and transition into the workforce. Dress for Success River Cities' clients routinely tell us that this organization and, particularly, the one-on-one attention and follow-up support from our amazing staff have made a world of difference to them and their families. There is nothing more rewarding than watching a client leave our boutique and career center with head held high and the confidence to take on the world.

Trillium Collective, Ltd.	203427		/users/profile/265347	Kelsea H.	Client Served	5	06/21/2014	I was a dancer here for most of my life. I am 18 now and have been dancing with Trillium since kindergarten (12 years). My love for dance has been nurished and nurtured through their teachers since day 1. I have gained experiences that I could not have gained anywhere else. In my search for "the right college" I realized how well they have prepared me for the dance world and how amazing their reputation is with the dance community. Whenever someone finds out that I dance with trillium, they immediately have a bit more respect for me. I am grateful for all they have given me. This is the best dance school in the area. 
Trillium Collective, Ltd.	145514		/users/profile/192010	YrralSivad	General Member of the Public	5	12/01/2012	Trillium has it all, performing arts wise.  Dance is the mainstay, but many other types of performances are featured in concert, at Friday Night Alive shows, or during workshops.  Here's a list prepared off the top of my head:  dramatic pieces with dance elements, songs and instrumental pieces, poi spinning, comic routines with a message, visual art projected on the big screen during dances, and percussion ensemble performances.  All this variety creates an innovative atmosphere.  
Trillium Collective, Ltd.	30206	6	/users/profile/31207	dianafhunt	Client Served	5	02/23/2010	I met TPAC in my early 20's and literally grew up with them as did my children and now my children's children.  They are a staple in the arts community here in Southern West Virginia. the group has over and over proved adaptability, sustainability and fiscal responsibility.  This is not an easy task in the current cultural, political, financial enfiornment.  Yet Trillium continues to perform the arts collectively and exquistely and is a true treasure to all who come in contact.
Trillium Collective, Ltd.	28808	8	/users/profile/29870	laura4	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	Trillium Performing Arts Collective is an breath of fresh air for everyone in WV and beyond. I have been touched by many Trillium people/events but mainly by Trillium Performing Youth (TPY). I began dancing with The Dance Studio/Trillium at the age of 3, and performed with TPY from 1998-2002. I knew as a child that dance would forever be a part of my life, but I am confident that Trillium and TPY fostered the strong love of performing that I have today.  TPY joins youth with one common bond, the love of movement. Students are fortunate to experience a weekly technique class, rehearsal time, and performances in either local elementary schools or nursing homes. TPY also provides the opportunity to take classes with guest artists and to perform work in the West Virginia Dance Festival held each year in Charleston, WV.        I believe the training that I received through Trillium has enhanced my performance strength, and allowed me to excel. I have performed with two professional companies, one of which performed as guest artists in one of Trilliums spring concerts.      I will forever come home to perform with the persons who were responsible for my success. My strong relationship with my Trillium has given me endless performance opportunities as a guest artist, including Friday Night Alive, the annual Garden Party, and many spring concerts. Always, I am recognized as an alumnus of TPY, and feel honored to have been a member of such a rewarding group.     Trillium gives children through adults a place to be creative and allows all performers to feel that they can truly excel. I think I can speak for all former and current members in saying that the value one gains is priceless.     During these economically challenging times, the arts are the first to be hit, which makes the financial support of performing arts even more important. Trillium Performing Arts is a much deserving program that is worthy of support at the highest level!

MORGANTOWN AREA YOUTH SERVICES PROJECT INC	108237		/users/profile/147313	Jordan G.	Client Served	5	03/23/2012	Well basically i was a bad kid, skipping school, doing drugs, all the nonsense of high school life. I was "forced" to go to MAYSP at the age of 15, i was hesitant to go and quite afraid of what the staff would have to say about my troubling behavior. For awhile it was awkward of course, me being a little kid and all. Having to discuss all the laws I had broke and the reasons why i would do these things was very unnerving seeing as to how these people held my future in their hands basically. But in the long run it all worked out, they helped me to better understand the nature of my behavior and how i could change to a respectable responsible person. After finishing the program i would still visit the staff and volunteer, It's like a big family there. I will forever and always be in debt to juinell, danny, kathy, and jamie. OHHH Dan "6" too!!   If you're looking for a place to send your kid for counseling i would absolutely suggest MAYSP above any other place available!  The staff is very understanding and i guarantee any child who goes here will connect on a personal level with every individual there. These awesome possums have never judged me or tried to tell me i was a bad person, they simply want to help and heal. Much love and respect to this crew, I hope and pray MAYSP will be around for many years to come!!

After years of struggling as a single parent we were brought together when one of my children had recurring issues with truancy. instead of being judged and not helped at all which is what happened to us prior to meeting maysp- we were met with open arms, we never felt judged or like we could not trust the staff. We were all treated with the utmost respect and understanding and this group of people provided the guidance, tools and empowerment we needed to improve our relationsips with one another and our community. I will always consider the people of maysp my personal heroes and hope they continue to operate in this community for many years they are truly a valuable asset.

Children of Uganda	155687	1	/users/profile/206627	MarthaC	Donor	5	04/22/2013	In 2007, I was fortunate to visit the Children of Uganda, orphanage for a week.  The experiance was life changing.  I was moved beyond my wildest dreams...the love that COU provides to these vunerable and orphaned children was so touching.  The children were so appreciative of everything.  A student, Martha, stuck close to my side, my name partner...her  many questions were mind boggling...but the one that forever touched my heart was "do you have stars in America?"  Educating these children is essential for their continued growth as individuals, and as members in their village and country.  I feel that I can do without a fancy coffee drink as day, for a year...which in turn pays for a child's education, clothing, medical, and food.  As soon as we returned home, we began sponsoring a child...whom now is in vocational school. Without the support of COU, he would most likely would not be continuing his education to become a self-suffient person.  We also were able to coordinate the COU Tour of Light- Freeport program.  It was so wonderful to see some of the children which we met, sing and dance. There smiles never ended, and neither will ours.

This is a small organization and has a very personal touch. You can meet the kids when they come perform in the US on the Tour of Light every few years. And if you sponsor a child, you can build a personal relationship by writing letters to them. I have been on the Board for 3 years now and serve as the Vice Chair. Children of Uganda changed my life and I am eternally grateful for the gift of relationships with so many wonderful kids.

Nazareth Farm Inc	99743		/users/profile/120706	katievirgin23	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	I have gone to Naz Farm twice so far, and will hopefully be going more than that. I was reluctant to go the first time that I went, but ended up having the time of my life getting to know the other volunteers there. We split into groups (away from the people that we traveled there with) and these groups became our work groups which we spent the week with. During the day we would do anything from split wood, clean the farm, build a roof or deck in the community, paint someone's house, the list was endless. At night, we got to just spend time with all the volunteers and really enjoy each others company. One of my favorite nights was tuesdays, because members from the community would come to the farm and join us for dinner and we would get to sit and learn their life stories. They just wanted someone to talk to. Overall, I would have to say the weeks that I have spent at Nazareth Farms have been some of the best weeks of my life. Nazareth Farms is a place where you can relax and be yourself and just enjoy other people's company. 
Nazareth Farm Inc	99742		/users/profile/120705	gbperks	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	My experience was absolutely incredible.  It is hard for me to find the words to adequately describe the great works that Naz Farm does.  They educate their volunteers on issues that effect the nation as a whole (mountain top removal, gas fracking, etc.).  Naz also lives out their cornerstones of Community and Service by going out into the surrounding area in West Virginia and fix homes.  My time there has radically changed my life for the better and I will be forever indebted to Naz Farm. 
Nazareth Farm Inc	99741		/users/profile/120704	mike_t	Volunteer	5	10/25/2011	The week I spent at Naz was easily one of the best weeks of my life. Helping to repair homes sounds great on paper, and it is, but the Naz experience is much more than that. Just hanging out with everybody on Community Night was awesome, and I think that all the volunteers had as much fun as the community members who stopped by. Talking to all of the homeowners across WV really was an eye opening experience. My week at Nazareth Farm  was three years ago by now, and i remember everything as if it were yesterday. It changed my life for the better.

Danville Panthers Midget Football I Nc	213141	1	/users/profile/276281	Cheermom	General Member of the Public	5	09/03/2014	I have been involved in Danville Panthers for several years now and I can not say a negative thing about the league or their coaches! Danville Panthers in my opinion goes above and beyond to help the children on the league succeed in the activity they are participating in. As for the person stating it is all about a trophy I can say without a shadow of doubt it isn't about the trophy as each of those teams has lost and has told the children to hold their heads high as they did the best they could and they couldn't be prouder! Is it nice to win? YES!!! Who doesn't like to win? Rules are put in place for a reason and if you do not teach children at a young age that rules are important and there is consequences for not following the rules they more in likely will not obey the rules as they get older! Danville Panthers has had children follow the same rules in the past and has grown up to be successful in sports career!
Danville Panthers Midget Football I Nc	212882	2	/users/profile/275978	Kim_149	General Member of the Public	1	08/31/2014	This league has absolutely no interest in providing girls with dedicated, caring role models for coaches.  One particular coach is more concerned about a $15 trophy than the esteem of her girls.  These girls are being ridiculed, not rewarded and praised for their efforts, dedication, and hard work.  Anyone with common sense knows that this age is a crucial time for their esteem and confidence, therefore, these coaches should have the ability to put their personal desires aside and contribute to these girls' confidence and self-respect.  When a league has coaches like this, their reputation will be ruined and no parent (well, those who care more about their child than their own personal desires) will allow their child to cheer for this league.  The league needs to consider how this kind of treatment will affect a child later on; it can destroy their esteem, confidence, and they will have no respect for themselves. Why? All because of one selfish, inconsiderate, despicable coach!
Danville Panthers Midget Football I Nc	212870		/users/profile/275966	grandma711	General Member of the Public	1	08/31/2014	So it's been made clear that it's all about a TROPHY. I was told that by the cheerleading president and someone that is on the board. So it has nothing to with building a child's self esteem. It's about killing it. Lexie has not missed one practice or a game. When Tosha signed her up she told them that she works and there would be days that she would be late. She was told that it world be ok if she was a little late, not to worry about it. It was all good. Now all 3 kids ride to practice together so if one is late so are the others. No one else has a problem with it except the C team coach. But it gets better, she was over heard telling Lexie that she was going to keep them from getting a trophy. And it was told to another parent that it was said that Lexie just wasn't good enough. There was no warning that this was coming. No one ever said that if she was late one more time or anything that she would be kept from competition at the festival. No one ever anything. Just a phone call to say she wasn't allowed to compete. If she had missed practices then I could understand if being late was a problem something should have been said so it could have been prevented and sit out for a game. A lot of money was paid to this team for her to cheer and now she isn't allowed to. I just think it's wrong and I hate being lied to. I know she isn't the best one out there and it's a struggle but this is a teaching time especially at this age. To be told (which the coach is refusing to tell her and I think she should be the one to tell her because it was her decision) that she can't cheer when in fact she has not missed not one practice or game is a shame and disgrace. I would like to know if Ramage or the Madison colts treats their kids like this as well. Like I said before it is a form of discrimination. I know I get upset and mad when my kids don't get a chance but you know what I would stand upFor any kid that was being treated unfairly.

This organization honored the military service of my father-in-law, Ford Gregory, at his burial service on August 4, 2012.  As an Army Wife of 20 years, I've attended numerous funerals with military honors and can say with confidence that the Lewis County Honor Guard is right up there with the best.  The professionalism and respect that these gentlemen gave our family was top notch and of the caliber of any Active Duty unit. Even my husband, an Active Duty Colonel, was impressed by these men, their precision and their attention to details.  Thank you Lewis County Honor Guard for making the burial so special for our family and honoring Ford's service to his country.

Military Working Dog Team Support Association Inc	272616		/users/profile/361699	jazzylady	Volunteer	5	11/21/2015	Because this is an all volunteer organization, donors can be assured that anything they donate will be used to directly support the Mission.  I have witnessed  the immense growth of this organization and the dedication and the integrity of the volunteers has remained  stellar.  This organization makes a positive  difference to Military Working Dogs and to their Handlers, both past and present.
Military Working Dog Team Support Association Inc	86474		/users/profile/96804	risingwolf1	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	This organization was co-founded by myself and Ken, a veteran dog handler from the Vietnam War.  Our missions are all about the team because we support both ends of the lead:  dog and handler.  Having served in many capacities in Vietnam, Ken drew upon his emotional experience in wanting to make certain that no dog handler returned to the US ever again from a war zone with the feeling of sacrifice without appreciation.  He also is an active dog person and wanted to support the dogs currently being deployed.  Our missions are straight forward:We support current dogs and handlers.We support veteran dog handler events.We advocate on behalf of retired military dogs in order to encourage their adoption.We support memorials to honor the dogs and handlers andWe educate the general public.Please know that we appreciate each and every donation and utilize them well.  We welcome you to stop by our dynamic website at www.mwdtsa.org to see what we are doing now.  An electronic newsletter is available to anyone who requests one; simply shoot us an email.We appreciate your support on behalf of dogs and handlers doing a dangerous job.

I would suggest that if anyone is pursuing a MA career, they work here so that you get a variety of patients. I wouldn't know what some of these patients would do if this clinic wasn't here.

Goodwill Industries Of Kanawha Valley Inc	258033	2	/users/profile/346516	Broken_Hearted	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/17/2015	So I'm going to totally agree with the first review this place is a joke! They could give a crap about anyone and what we do! All they care about is that money that goes into their pockets and they need to look into changing their name cause they are far from a non-profit organization! With that being said their back-stabbing and liars! If you do so much helping people then way is your CEO making all this money! Haha you all are a bunch of crazy people that need to come off your high horses and look around at how many people we could help right in "our own towns" instead of throwing stuff away and sending things that probably never go overseas! Let that sink in for a minute! Because our home towns need things just to get by that's simple, but instead we have to turn our backs and say no sorry it's only worth $15 of clothes and with y'alls prices and for only clothes come on now they need dishes etc. But whatever, that's down right dirty but you all wouldn't know about giving, just receiving am I right?! Yeah I know I am right! You will never see things that I see through my eyes so why am I even writing this review! Because I am sick and tired of all the bullcrap you all make yourself out to be that is why! Good day!
Goodwill Industries Of Kanawha Valley Inc	200155	4	/users/profile/261292	hopesanddreama	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/13/2014	Stay away from this organization!!! They promise you what sounds like a wonderful fulfilling, very rewarding job and what you get is far from that. The CEO is micro-manager who will not let make decisions on your own, had issues with control and is never wrong. There is very little support and you are not given the tools with which to successfully complete your job function. No training. I was taken to another store for one day for training and then the next day given my store and left on my own that was understaffed and a set of keys. The organization claims to be all about employing mentally and physically disabled but underneath all of the fluff what "she" really cares about is the almighty dollar and she couldn't care less about them. If the store isn't making enough money from all of the free donations because the clients are too slow; they either get moved or their hours get cut until they quit. Someone on the board if directors needs to look into the current administration instead of just reading her report that she brings to the table. Visit a store, talk to a client.
WEST VIRGINIA RAPTOR REHABILITATION CENTER	101808	3	/users/profile/131397	Guest45	Professional with expertise in this field	2	12/06/2011	I am extremely concerned about the way the animals are cared for at this organization. I have years of professional experience working with raptors and after volunteering for WVRRC, I do not believe the board is properly managing the collection of birds in their possession. The organization recently went through some changes in board leadership and currently there is no one involved with the veterinary, husbandry, or natural history expertise to manage a collection of wild birds. 
WEST VIRGINIA RAPTOR REHABILITATION CENTER	65165	1	/users/profile/71230	jckptprty	Volunteer	5	02/08/2011	This is a wonderful organization.  Birds of prey that have been illegally trapped, shot or injured are brought in from all across West Virginia and the veterinarians and other volunteers do everything they can to help save them!  Once they are able to care for themselves they are released back into the wild.

A Reason To Believe Animal Rescue, Inc. (ARTBAR)	322416		/users/profile/370961	Public2016	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/31/2017	I am a dog rescuer with 15 years experience and have gotten to know Jessica White (who runs ARTBAR) over the past several years. To say she is the real deal is an understatement. She is in this for the dogs all the way. She likes to save old, sick, and injured dogs...the ones many rescues don't have the desire or ability to help. She has a medical background so is able to provide them with capable aftercare should they need surgeries or treatments for things like mange. She is very choosy about her placements and collaborates well with other animal rescue organizations.  ARTBAR is located in a poor, rural area of southwestern WV where dogs run as strays, get shot, get hit by vehicles, get dumped on back roads near coal mines, etc., on a regular basis. I have visited there in person and have seen what they have to work with.  I have seen ARTBAR save dogs that were shot and spend thousands on their care. Dogs that suffered horrible abuse and weren't expected to make it (one with his brain exposed), yet Jessica managed to save them in collaboration with her vet.  Her determination is unmatched, as is her compassion. She found a dog poisoned with antifreeze. It was too late to save him but she had the vet run all the necessary tests to verify and eventually held him while he crossed over and cried like he was her very own pet. She is one of the most compassionate rescuers I've ever met, but also understands all rescues must work within the physical limitations of what they can  handle. She's the kind of person who will stop her vehicle to help a turtle cross a road, climb through abandoned buildings to catch moms with puppies, feed a stray dog for weeks until she can coax it into her vehicle, and do everything that can be done to save a dog's life. She also helps out other domestic pets that cross her path from time to time and has been known to save injured wildlife and transport it to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator for care and hopefully eventual release. If you live in or near Mingo County WV (southwest of Charleston on the KY border) and would like to foster to help save lives, this is a great organization to collaborate with. ARTBAR always needs good foster families who are dog savvy and can keep foster dogs indoors. I highly recommend volunteering for ARTBAR and/or financially supporting this very deserving organization.

United Way Of The Eastern Panhandle Inc	106946		/users/profile/144713	Stacierohn	Client Served	5	02/23/2012	The United Way of the Eastern Panhandle has been a blessing to local non-profits and I have been fortunate to see the results at the agency level.  Over the past 15 years, I have worked with two different non-profit organizations that receive United Way funds.  As an agency recipient of these resources, I have had the opportunity to see the power of the United Way from a first hand perspective.  From helping a chronically ill patient manage a diabetes diagnosis at the Eastern Panhandle Free Clinic to giving a child the tools to excel in school at the Boys & Girls Club of the Eastern Panhandle, the United Way supports results driven programs within our community.  In addition to funding community solutions, the United Way brought new volunteers through the doors of these non-profits simply by introducing Day of Caring to our community.  Not only were we able to complete many necessary projects within those facilities, but we were also able to share our mission with those volunteers.  Our United Way has truly shown the eastern panhandle what it means to Live United and that is why I am grateful for its support.
United Way Of The Eastern Panhandle Inc	106423		/users/profile/143775	Layne D.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/14/2012	I am very impressed with the United Way of the Eastern Panhandle in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  The leadership and staff of this charity truly seek to administer this program in accordance with the fiduciary capacity in which they have been employed and they work hard to ensure that every dollar that is given is utilized in accordance with the mission and vision of the organization.  They have established processes for reviewing their funding agencies to determine appropriate distributions of funds.  These processes are friendly, but rigorous, and include members of the community who provide input into the process and results.  UWEP is also very forward thinking in addressing community issues.  They have often served as the fiscal agent for community initiatives that have not fully organized into formal non-profit organizations, but which initiatives add value to services already provided in the region.  They are prudent with the management of their funds and not extravagant in their administrative expenses.  I would not hesitate to recommend to donors in the region that they consider the United Way of the Eastern Panhandle in their charitable giving plans.

Animal Friends Of North Central West Virginia Inc	56225		/users/profile/58579	AggieP	Volunteer	5	11/01/2010	Animal Friends of North Central West Virginia is a non-for-profit no-kill animal sanctuary.  The organization is lead by a wonderful person, Cynthis Lucas, who opened her heart to helping animals in need.  The sanctuary currently has many rescued cats and dogs and even a rat saved from a neuroscience department.  Some of the other animals that got to live at Animal Friends included: a dear, a pig, opossums, etc.  All animals go through a vet examination before they can enter the premise.  This is a precautionary measure to protect the animals that are currently residing there; those that require special attention are isolated from the rest to aid their recovery or to generally help their transition.  Cynthis makes frequent visits to the local kill shelters and continues to pull out the animals that are qualified as the least adoptable.  She is also constantly planning and carrying out ideas that help to make the sanctuary the best it can be for the residing and prospective animals.  The organization is benefited by many wonderful volunteers who are true animal friends.  Their time and input seem to be always appreciated by Cynthis, and certainly reinforced by the animals.  Cynthis, as well as other selfless individuals that all have become a part of this wonderful, and quite frankly, one of a kind organization are all an incredible inspiration and hope not only for animals, but also for people that strive to believe.

While I am pending VA disability, LHVO taught me how to reach, locate and assist other veterans and now I volunteer for them. Since I can't work, LHVO helped me arrange for me to volunteer for them and in return I receive a small monetary amount from the state to help support my family until I receive my disability.

They accept both men and women in modern times. The O.O.O. has four known Degrees. They use ritual, passwords, and fraternal grips.  The ritual, as in most fraternal orders, is for members only.  The O.O.O. publications contend that its ritual has no religious elements and so they are considered non-denominational.  An older edition of the ritual states:  "We advocate no creed.  We know there are so many gods, so many creeds, so many paths that wind and wind.  We believe that the art of being kind is all this world needs." I recommend them as a good group to have in the community, as well as other similar Orders of High Esteem.

Read Aloud West Virginia	320611		/users/profile/413345	Jennie F.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/29/2016	As a teacher who has been a champion of reading-aloud for over thirty years, I have a story to tell about Read-Aloud West Virginia (RAWV).  I was born and raised in West Virgina yet I have lived in Massachusetts for decades.  When my childhood friend died and asked that donations be made to RAWV I learned about this wonderful organization.  Many places give books, but few to none instill a love of reading.  RAWV trains volunteers to go to schools and read, among other things.  I organized my preschool in Massachusetts, Groton Community School, to have a major fundraiser and book drive.  We collected hundreds of dollars, and more importantly hundreds of books ~ quality hardcover books.  I drove over 500 miles to make the delivery in person.  Meeting the folks who run this incredible non-profit confirmed their quality, kindness, and good work.  Reading-aloud to a school class of children was the icing on the cake for me.  Since then, I have been an unofficial ambassador, as Read-Aloud West Virginia has changed my life.  I now have an important mission!  Thank you!

Mountaineer Military Museum	277295		/users/profile/367091	mmm345	Board Member	5	01/20/2016	The Mountaineer Military Museum, located at 345 Center Avenue in Weston, WV... was founded on a "PROMISE" made by the Museum's owner at the graveside of his best friend lost during the Vietnam War.  As a pall-bearer, he said, "I PROMISE that I'll never let anyone forget you."  That "PROMISE" is the underlying theme of the Museum as you view the 700 square feet of "Personal Stories" of local Veterans who have served and sacrificed for their country.  The remaining 2,200 square feet of the Museum houses artifacts, dioramas, and numerous static displays of items ranging from the Civil War to our current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The Museum also hosts the annual "VET-TOGETHER" on the Saturday prior to Memorial Day.  The festivities begin with participating in the city's Memorial Day Parade and ends with a Remembrance Program and catered luncheon on the Museum's grounds.   For information about the Museum's hours or about participating in the "VET-TOGETHER", contact: Barb McVaney, Executive Director, at : (304) 516-0800.

Haven Of Hope Church	258259		/users/profile/346742	EdsyP	General Member of the Public	1	09/18/2015	The food outreach at their thrift store is a wonderful and generous program. However, I have witnessed the elderly and disabled that come in need being treated rather rudely-"looked down upon" by church members.  The church staff and volunteers grab arm loads of food and desserts for themselves before those in need are permitted to come forth to gather their limited quantities.   The people seeking help graciously stand and wait for hours at times, yet treated as if they are greedy or burdensome to these "elite" church folks. It seems to me that the outreach is more for recognition than heartfelt caring and generosity.

It is a faith-based charity that makes its services available to all, making a real difference to poor families. ABLE Families integrates the efforts of several programs, and they faithfully direct targeted gifts to the intended recipients. The fundraising costs appear to be minimal, so nearly all funds go to the needy. The newsletter is excellent. This is one charity anyone can support with confidence.
Community Alternatives To Violence Inc	286898		/users/profile/376969	Carolyn_Z	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Community Alternatives to Violence (www.commav.org)changed my life.  When I started working here I knew nothing about family violence, but I knew that I was about to start something great.  I saw what had happened in my own life was abuse and that I could help others.  Working with abusive behavior became my life.Over the past 11 years I have become more passionate about our clients, their partners and the children.  They continually teach me about abusive behavior and empower me to become more skilled and a bigger help to them.  CAV clients have done some terrible things in their past, but every day they prove to me that change is possible.I give much volunteer time to CAV because the cause is critical to save lives.  I also give financially because the CAV cause is not a popular one--no warm and fuzzies here.
Vicki Dils Dance Company	195758		/users/profile/256000	bubblingover	Client Served	5	03/18/2014	I grew up spending a few hours a week with Vicki - mostly in her dance studio, some on her porch and in her kitchen, some at the barn with the horses and jogging along the dirt roads. She invested in me. She shared herself with me. She opened up her life to me. She supported me - always celebrating what was inside me and what came out of me. She encouraged me to become more and to trust the greatness within me. Space, time, shape, and motion were the concepts that opened up a world of creativity and expression and art to me. She was tough and emphasized discipline, but in a way that lifted me up and got me excited about growth. She was gentle and kind, in a way that made me feel powerful and important. I have carried so many lessons with me through the years that she taught me: "don't be sorry, just fix it!" and "no 'buts' - just try it and turn it into something else." Vicki Dills is a gem! Anytime a child spends with her is priceless. I am going to bring my own children to her soon.
Special Olympics West Virginia Inc	238709		/users/profile/146527	Sapphire Atkinson	General Member of the Public	2	03/01/2015	This organization needs to be organized a bit better by having more people volunteering and more teams available for specific sports like for example more swim teams available in a more areas across the state like for example in the cities. The organization needs to be listing sports that are available by area and not by county and put contact information in for those folks that are in charge of what sport.

I applied, interviewed, and have been working with them ever since. They do more than just sell clothes. There are recycling programs, cleaning contracts, youth center, a backpack program to feed kids on the weekends, a career center, numerous training programs, and more. I never realized how much they do until I started working for them. I can't imagine being anywhere else now. 
Mount Hope Heritage And Hope Inc	131620		/users/profile/177192	BeckleyRegisterHerald	Board Member	1	10/31/2012	This board was not legally voted upon, those currently attempting to represent themselves as the board for this structure were voted on without consent or legal communication with the board members they were attempting to remove.  This was done to circumvent a voted upon agreement to split an organization structure recorded in minutes along with an agreed upon distribution of assets. Said minutes were approved and voted upon, as well as witnessed by the Mayor.

The food they give is always free of charge.  Their Store is also the outlet for the Family Services clients to receive clothing, furniture and household goods also free of charge.  One of the greatest attributes of Union Mission Ministries and the main reason I financially support them is traditionally 80% of income goes directly to services for the community.

The volunteers are so friendly and very willing to meet you when and where you want. Anything it takes to get these sweet babies a good home :) 
Clay Co Development Corp	320097		/users/profile/323143	ValerieK	Professional with expertise in this field	1	12/13/2016	The director has made openly racist remarks as well as being disrespectful to publicly elected non-white officials. That this distressing behavior and ignorant attitude is condoned by the board makes me question how this nonprofit can provide service without preference to race or gender or religion. I find this place and places like it throughout the south personally offensive and a shame to decent Americans everywhere.

Student surveys of 500 students reported In less than 6 months, 62% of the students  had seen the coordinated monthly themed materials in merchants like their grocery store, Food lion, and felt more positive and supported by their community.  Many reported doing more homework, working harder in  school and helping out at home more often.  One teacher at our school painted her fingernails "slow-down lavender" because that was the monthly color for October when "Be Patient & Listen" is the theme.  This is so easy and organized - some kids said this is "COOL"
Manna Meal Inc	178236	2	/users/profile/195810	Michelle Walker	Donor	5	10/16/2013	Manna Meal operates out of a church in downtown Charleston, WV. It is a challenge to feed up to 300 people twice a day, seven days a week, no questions asked. People that are fed range from homeless people to gainfully employed people.

Central West Virginia Aging Services Inc	155003		/users/profile/205860	Evelyn5	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/16/2013	This organization has the most amazing staff members.  Its services are outstanding.  I had called around every where for services for my Mother and because she was not Medicaid eligible, was told that she could not get any help.  This organization assisted with their Helping Hands program which was designed to assist those frail seniors who truly 'fall through the cracks' of a social service system.  They deserve a five-star rating for their friendliness, helpfulness and efficiency.  BG from Charleston, WV
West Virginia State Honey Festival & Fair Inc	193917	2	/users/profile/193801	friend.sarah.a	General Member of the Public	3	02/07/2014	Written by a attendee of the fair who passed through on chance the first year and revisited the event: I have attended the West Virginia State Honey Festival at the Parkersburg City Park in previous years. There is an admission fee and vendors that follow the typical fair scene. The part that makes this event special is the West Virginian and nearby Ohioan vendors providing small scale honey, each with a story. The beekeeper who sold me honey had his family help package if for me and told me about their land. Education events brought by a bee keeping society were entertaining for children and adults. I could not find raw honey for sale, all appeared to be proudly pasteurized. I'm glad that all the merchants took care to make their honey safe for consumption but would have appreciated the variety of being able to purchase raw local honey that is popular in the homeopathic circles. I entered a  baking contest the 2nd year. That was discontinued for 2013. Maybe they'll bring it back. 
Dubois On Main Museum Company Ltd	271507		/users/profile/360361	Writer	Donor	3	11/08/2015	This is a museum that underscores the lives and achievements of a group of students who had very little, but accomplished a lot.  It wants the youth of today to realize that there are no excuses - just do it! It is very interesting to see report cards from long ago students that deal with typing, languages, music, and to realize that cleanliness was dealt with in the schools.  The woman who runs the museum works very hard to get community input, and to have the place be an active part of the community.
Paws Squad	283230		/users/profile/373446	rainsparkles	Volunteer	5	03/23/2016	In spite of the tremendous number of layoff in the coal mining industry, this small group of less than 20 volunteers managed to send to rescue last year alone 1289 cats and dogs.  They do not charge a fee to 501C3 groups. All monies are from donations and fundraising.  Only money given to volunteers is for reimbursement of travel expenses.   Because of their persistence for three years, they were able to convince the county to construct a modern pound in 2016. The old pound had no windows, heating, or cooling.The new one is state of the art complete with individual runs and drainage for cleaning.

Tom C Smith Charitable Tr	210763		/users/profile/273557	rwylie67	General Member of the Public	1	08/14/2014	NOT a very good Public Service Organization.  They are presently displacing many elderly Mobile Home Park residents to make room for condominiums on their trust properties.  NO help is being offered to those elderly and low-income people that they are kicking out !  Basically, they are uncaring.  It is no wonder they will not submit the names of their officers or a source of contact (just a mailbox).
Northwoods Property Owners Association Inc	277995	2	/users/profile/367863	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	01/25/2016	Dear Fellow Property Owners:Today, marks the third consecutive day that residents have been stranded in this development with no way out and, no word from the NPOA elected board.I have spoken with several other residents and one board member by phone. The concensus is, the development remains impassable for most, if not all residents. That is unacceptable.On Saturday, I plowed a section of Shady Tree Lane to where it connects to Wandering Lane. The NPOAA is responsible to ensure the safety of all residents - which includes the safe upkeep of our roads.Moreover, in the event of an immediate medical emergency, it is critical that these roads are passable. Also, many of our residents, including myself, work - loss of employment, termination, due to the negligent actions of our board is unacceptable. We, pay homeowners fees and assessments which should ensure the safe upkeep of our roads, yet the money is squandered on paving and asphalt, not the essentials: plowing, snow removal and general maintenence.I am by copy of this E-mail, informing all residents of these conditions and requesting an emergency meeting with the NPOA board to address these matters. I am also requesting that a vote be taken to dissolve the NPOA, for consideration at the earliest.Bottom line, you don't want to live in Northwoods. 
Appalachian Trail Conservancy	108034	2	/users/profile/146764	Jason Goodman	Donor	2	03/19/2012	They have little respect for donor privacy.   I rarely make any type of donation that is not anonymous.  After I moved to Georgia, I find myself using parts of the A.T. for day hikes  and some weekend backpacking.  I figured I'd donate to the conservancy as a way to give back.   For some reason, I didn't feel the need to donate anonymously with the ATC when making my first.    Within a month  my mailbox was full of solicitation from seemingly every nature type charity that exists.    That really turned my stomach; how these folks at the ATC sold me out.  It also brought a swift end to any thoughts of donating to the ATC again. 
Pearl S Buck Birthplace Foundation Inc	145994		/users/profile/192621	davewave2340	Board Member	5	12/05/2012	The Pearl S. Buck Birthplace in Hillsboro, West Virginia is a 1858 Dutch farmhouse built in the Appalchian Mountains of Eastern West Virginia by her forefathers in a beautiful valley setting.  It was the home of the Pulitizer Prize and Nobel Laureate "Pearl Sydenstricker Buck's" maternal grandfather, the Stulting farm where her parents returned from China in 1892 to give birth to their first surviving daughter "Pearl Comfort Sydenstricker".   The museum has actual furniture from both the Sydenstricker and Stulting families.  Also her fathers home from Ronceverte, West Virginia in Greenbrier County has been relocated to Hillsboro, West Virginia.  It is a 1832 log cabin with historical furniture donated by members of the family.  A great place to visit when you are in South Eastern West Virginia.  It is a bit remote to find, but only 30 miles North of Interstate 64 which passes near White Sulphur Springs, WV, home of the famous "Greenbrier Golf Resort"  Hillsboro is on US Route 219 in Pocohontas County and is on the route to the Snowshoe Ski Resort.  Unfortunately, it is only open during the summer months, but is well worth the drive if you are looking to experience firsthand a 19th Century self-sustaining farm.  And a great history lesson for the kids looking to see how people lived in the 19th century.  Check out the Museum's web site for directions and tour times during the summer months only.  www.pearlsbuckbirthplace.com
