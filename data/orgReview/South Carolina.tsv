Charleston Animal Society	244594	4	/users/profile/331540	Wendy119,	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2015	I'm sure that you're being overwhelmed with responses after the world learning about Caitlyn. It's sad that such an unfortunate incident had to occur to bring to light what a wonderful gem you have in the Charleston Animal Society. As our societies slowly change and begin to realize that having opposable thumbs doesn't give us the right to inflict damage on the earth and its inhabitants, places like the Animal Society shine through as leaders. They walk the walk and talk the talk and the animals are the better off for them. Kudos CAS!!
Charleston Animal Society	291485	2	/users/profile/381913	Elena L.	General Member of the Public	5	05/31/2016	Charleston Animal Society is an AMAZING organization! We have adopted 2 animals from the shelter and we could not be more grateful for our furry friends! The staff is so helpful and we had a great experience all around! :) We highly recommend that if you are looking for a pet the first place you stop is Charleston Animal Society!!
Charleston Animal Society	291185	3	/users/profile/381563	Writer	Donor	5	05/26/2016	I have been a lifelong animal lover and avid supporter of the Charleston Animal Society for several years and have had many family members adopt wonderful pets from this organization. I am proud to be friends with the Director of Administration as she is an exceptional example of the kind of person that you would want to work there and who should work there. She has rescued and provided  many pets with a beautiful life in a loving home and has made a life's commitment to provide for the abandoned or abused. She truly "walks the walk and talks the talk."  I am thankful for her and the entire staff of this no kill shelter.

Charleston Animal Society	291137	2	/users/profile/223510	Winkie	Donor	5	05/26/2016	If I ever win the lottery, I will pay for every animal to have a forever home!!!  Well, that won't happen but I can wish that every animal at the Charleston Animal Society will find their forever home.  It is such a great place! As a donor and a volunteer for the Charleston Animal Society, I want everyone to know what a super staff runs the Charleston Animal Society.   I write for the internal newsletter and a lot of what I write is staff interviews ... so I get to ask personal questions and write about the individuals.  Almost to a person, every staffer is happy in their job, happy with where they work, and happy to be working with animals.  It is kind of incredible that so many staffers plan to be at the Charleston Animal Society in 5 years!!!   It's a great place to work (obviously!) and a wonderful progressive animal shelter.  Charleston Animal Society is a No Kill shelter and has now become a No Harm shelter.  They do great things!!  Nuff said!!!
Charleston Animal Society	203820	1	/users/profile/223510	Winkie	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	Well, I'm probably the only volunteer who can't go in the building!!  You see, the combination of dander, chemicals, and pet food makes it impossible for me to breathe in the building.  So I do fundraising.  A very important and very needed function.  I love to talk to people and "NO" doesn't bother me. Some of the things the Charleston Animal Society does includes:  The Charleston Animal Society (CAS) doesn't turn away ANY hurt or abused or abandoned animal from our doors and medical treatment is funded through our Toby Fund.  You can imagine the magnitude of medical treatment needed by thousands of animals.   CAS offers low-cost (or free) spay/neuter clinics to the public.  CAS runs a 'no judgment' pet food bank so people can keep their pets rather than abandoning them.  (Cost of food is the number one reason pets are abandoned.)  This food bank is community involvement at its finest because, you see, the public donates all food for the food bank!  Neighbors truly helping neighbors.  We also have a large network of foster homes where animals stay while recuperating from treatment or until they are adopted.  In our network of foster homes, we actually have 'hospice' foster homes where sick or otherwise unadoptable senior animals can live out the remaining years of their lives in a warm loving home.   Our goal was to be a No-Kill Community by 2015.  We met that goal in late 2013 and have been 'No Kill" for 16 months.  But it was expensive.  Many 'no-fee' adoption events were held.  It takes over $250 to get an animal ready for the adoption floor ... adoption fees only reduce that amount, not pay for it.  We've been offering adult cats at no-fee for over a year.  As part of our No-Kill Community effort, we routinely trap feral cats, spay/neuter, and release the cats back where they lived.  Yes, expensive.  But very necessary. Perhaps I'm prejudiced ... but I am certainly proud to be associated with the Charleston Animal Society.  I consider the Charleston Animal Society to be one of the most progressive shelters in the Southeast ... but perhaps I'm prejudiced.   
Charleston Animal Society	168579	1	/users/profile/223510	Winkie	Volunteer	5	09/09/2013	A funny thing happened on my way to being a volunteer ... I can't breathe inside the building!!!  So just having recovered from lung cancer, breathing seemed to be very important.  To me, anyway.  Well, I was determined to help in some way so I said here's what I can do ... I can make phone calls and ask for donations or whatever happens to be needed.  So I'm a phone volunteer ... a far cry from bottle feeding the newborn puppies and kittens I had envisioned when I first volunteered!  But such is life and my very small contribution, when combined with contributions of other volunteers, makes the Charleston Animal Society the great place that it is.   I love animals and want to help them all!  Every single one ... if I just had a couple of million dollars, I'd help so very many animals and that would make me so very happy.  But you know what?  I've heard so many people (generally volunteers) say the same thing ... so many of us must think money -- more of it -- is the answer.  Yes, but not entirely.  Without a dedicated staff and dedicated volunteers, animal shelters would just be bigger ... not better.  There are two things that amaze me about the Charleston Animal Society ... probably because in the past I have given money and not myself.  The first is Hospice Foster Homes for older, sick, or otherwise not adoptable animals where they can live out their lives in a warm and loving home.   The second is the No-Fault Community Food Bank.  There is a very REAL need in our community to help families keep their pets at home.  One of the main reasons people are forced to give up their pets is the cost of feeding them.  The Charleston Animal Society has addressed this compelling need by establishing a no-fault Community Food Bank.  With many pet owners out of work or underemployed and struggling to make ends meet, the Community Food Bank helps them feed the 4-legged members of their family rather than face the distressing possibility of having to give them up.  Each month, the Community Food Bank provides approximately 100 struggling families with food for their pets. The service depends entirely on donations by the public.  And I could go on ... but I'm sure I've gotten my point across:  The Charleston Animal Society is great!  
Charleston Animal Society	291134	2	/users/profile/381502	dkrosse	Advisor	5	05/26/2016	There are many things about Charleston Animal Society that I think are very admirable. But the one I will focus on here is their transparency. On their website,  (www.charlestonanimalsociety.org/important-documents) you will find their tax returns, audits, annual reports and other information that is designed to keep donors and supporters completely informed as to the operation of the organization. All nonprofits should be this open! 
Charleston Animal Society	291018	2	/users/profile/381364	Charles70	General Member of the Public	5	05/25/2016	I have a long family tie to the Charleston Animal Society and have seen the current generation of leadership take the society to a place that my grandmother would hardly believe. Integrity in policy is essential, and the Charleston Animal Society stands tall for our community to do what is right. The society is innovative and knows how to work with a variety of different constituencies so that the whole community understands the mission and the progress. Joe Elmore and his team deserve credit for raising the bar and exceeding expectations consistently.
Charleston Animal Society	290685	2	/users/profile/226935	RandolphCooper	Donor	5	05/23/2016	The Charleston community is so thankful for the hard-work and dedication of the CAS staff. CAS has implemented key developments that has lead to the first no kill community in the South (a goal many of us believed to be impossible.) Aside from the ever-present triumphs in the common-wealth, CAS has dedicated numerous resources into academia to better enforce the success of said triumphs; whether through obedience courses at the North Charleston facility, summer camps/birthdays for children, or classroom visits in the local schools. CAS has provided our community with the tools to ensure that animal well fare continue to be a priority in our wonderful city. I personally have three dogs for CAS and each has changed my life for the better, I will always be indebted to CAS.                All of my thanks and praise,                                                                       Randolph Cooper
Charleston Animal Society	171389	2	/users/profile/226935	RandolphCooper	Client Served	5	09/23/2013	I was fortunate enough to find my most recent canine companion through CAS. Their amazing staff and unmatched dedication saw that I was coupled with the perfect pup. My dog "Louis" arrived at CAS malnourished with matted hair, the trained staff brought my new bud back to perfect health and gave him a great haircut. I can't thank CAS enough for the latest addition to my family.  I strongly encourage members of the Charleston community to support this local jewel or perhaps pearl is more appropriate.                   Incredibly thankful,                                                  Randolph W.

Charleston Animal Society	290644	2	/users/profile/381005	Connie82	Client Served	5	05/23/2016	Charleston Animal Society is a wonderful organization. Finding homes for so many animals and prosecuting those who abuse animals.  I will always be greatful to CAS as I adopted my own sweet little terrier mix from them.  Huck is a great dog who we love dearly. 5 stars is too little for them.  I wish I could give 10.  
Charleston Animal Society	290561	2	/users/profile/380925	veniceman3	Client Served	5	05/22/2016	Charleston Animal Society helped me enjoy a much better life by pairing me with several great animals that I adopted.  I applaud the organization's leadership in the protection of animals and its willingness to help other organizations succeed.  Most of all, its integrity, as evidenced by its numerous awards and honors, makes our entire community proud!
Charleston Animal Society	290472	2	/users/profile/380812	WindGirl	Donor	5	05/20/2016	Thank you to this wonderful organization and the great job they do controlling the population of free roaming cats!

The staff is knowledgeable and genuinely caring about matching the right animal with the right family. They are visible in the community and care for more than 19,000 animals every year. I am amazed.
Charleston Animal Society	289878		/users/profile/380137	leamest	General Member of the Public	1	05/13/2016	Me and family members trapped feral cats and paid for them to get spayed. Now all of them are sick and we took them to the vet and she said it's a bacterial infection from getting spayed. We took our house cats there too and both ended up getting sick after being spayed Also they were going to euthanize a cat that I brought it all because it had a hurt paw. Now that same cat I paid for all the expenses and it's in a great home. No kill is a lie and also they are making cats sick by not sterilizing their instruments. I have vet bills to prove it. 
Charleston Animal Society	280221		/users/profile/370060	Linda401	General Member of the Public	1	02/15/2016	Where are the 70 confiscated rabbits CEO of CAS?  70 confiscated domestic rabbits (helpless prey animals) have been hidden by both  Charleston Animal Society & Halifax Humane Society since 1/1/2016 and sent in c/o predator owners & undisclosed "farms" without spay and neuter.  Valid questions of concern remain unanswered. Why would (CAS) a no - kill shelter send 70 confiscated rabbits out of State to a kill shelter (Halifax) who states they have no room for more than 3 rabbits?  Upon arrival, Halifax immediately transferred the 70 rabbits to a Wildlife Ctr/predator owner that distributed them to his friends on 3 farms where they remain hidden.   Claiming to be Hero's and possibly sending neglected rabbits from one bad situation to another on farms that may have placed them into another bad situation is not acceptable.  Local rabbit rescue persons working with CAS and Rabbit Rescues to find placement for these rabbits when they were shot down. The Rabbit Community is asking for full transparency and proof these rabbits are in adoptive family homes As Promised in the media, spayed & neutered,alive, given proper medical care, not being used as food for predators or humans and not being bred for profit.  Read the facts here:https://www.change.org/p/joe-elmore-miguel-abi-hassan-where-are-the-69-neglected-rescued-rabbits

I read where this guy is already out on bond and has another dog in spite of the judges order that he cannot have anymore animals.  Since, he broke the conditions of his release are they going to save this next little victim before it's too late and take this guy back to jail  to serve his full sentence ?

Charleston Animal Society	244435	7	/users/profile/331343	Regina15	Volunteer	5	06/02/2015	The Charleston Animal Society is a fantastic place for fur babies in distress. Adopting an animal should be a lifetime commitment, no exceptions except of course if the pet parent dies. All my life I have gotten my fur babies from shelters because they are so in need of love and care. The great thing is that love, care, and finding great forever families to adopt them is all in a day's love for these wondrous folks. I just can't  say enough great things about them. But, the way Caitlin looks today compared to how she looked on admission, just says it all.  Love is the most needed thing in the lives of dogs and humans.
Charleston Animal Society	244433	4	/users/profile/331341	Sandy94	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2015	Where I live we have an "Animal Control" officer, that changes several times a year and they do nothing. I rescue animals and find them homes myself. I can barely make it on my own but I will not sit by & let an innocent animal be abused, starved whatever! So these people are so awesome and I look forward to reading their posts everyday. I would give anything to have a no kill shelter here in my town but unfortunately we dont. 12 innocent dogs were euthinized on Monday because thier "time was up". It makes me sick. I can't donate because I have to try and rescue the animals here in my town because with me they get a second chance with our messed up system they get a death sentence = no chance! Keep up the awesome work everyone has done with Caitlin she desereved her second chance. Thank YouSigned: A very loving,caring, and giving pet owner/rescuer

I am from a rural community in Kentucky where no-kill shelters are a rarity and large dogs in particular are picked up and turned in to these shelters at an alarming rate.  My husband and I have 7 rescue cats and 2 rescue dogs, all beautiful and loving.  It warms my heart to hear about the progress being made across the South.  Find out what is happening in your communities , people and make a stand.    God bless you.

Charleston Animal Society	244310	2	/users/profile/331209	kayxbby	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2015	When I was a little girl, one of my dogs was let out of her cage by the neighborhood kids and she was then lured away. My stepdad went to look for her at all of the local pounds hoping someone had picked her up. When he got to the last one near our house, he found her and also found out that the shelters near us gassed the animals after several weeks of holding them BC they didn't have the room to keep them. My family are huge dog lovers. He ended up coming home with not only our dog, but about 10 more on top of it. He couldn't stand the thought of those innocent pets being gassed just because they had been there a couple weeks. It broke my heart to find out that's what happened to these poor animals. So it's truly amazing to find a place where the people not only nurse the animals back to health, but also do not kill them. Y'all are truly heaven sent for these animals and I greatly appreciate the work y'all do. There should be many more places like this everywhere. No animal should ever have to be abused but the sad truth is the world can be a cruel place. It warms my heart to see good people helping these innocent animals. Y'all are truly amazing people. 
Charleston Animal Society	244308	2	/users/profile/331208	Robin126	General Member of the Public	5	06/02/2015	I live in Texas and have seen the kind of work this awesome place does thru social media, primarily Facebook.

I wish there were more places like this....although I wish there wasn't such a need. Your work with Caitlyn has been just amazing. The time, love & work you've put into this poor little angel just fills my heart. Keep up the wonderful work you're doing....together we can save them all.  
Charleston Animal Society	244267	1	/users/profile/331165	Stephieg22	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	You guys are fantastic, looking after beautiful Caitlyn, and a No-Kill shelter! We need more of your shelters for our animals throughout the world. Love from the United Kingdom 
Charleston Animal Society	244266	1	/users/profile/331164	1948	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	I am so thankful that we have the most wonderful, caring, loving Animal Society in the U.S.! I appreciate all of you and all that you do for all the animals and for finding loving homes for them and I know they appreciate it too!  We are so fortunate to have a place where animals can go to get another chance at having a furever home and know that when lost, or homeless animals show up they will not be given a death sentence. You are my favorite charity and I give and will always give to the animals whenever I can. Thank you all for saving Caitlyn and all the other abused animals that come in to CAS. God Bless you all. You are their guardian angels!
Charleston Animal Society	244265	2	/users/profile/331163	Alisa B.	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	I have been completely impressed with the not only the level of care that has been given to Caitlyn during this ordeal but how honest and with great compassion each comment and question have been answered. I do feel this shelter has gone far above what is customary in this type of situation in the quality of care given and the measures used to give this dog a fighting chance at a normal life. I am a real animal lover and support many local shelters in my area and see sometimes just how difficult this is to do. Thank you so much for the work you do. May you always have the compassion and the funds to continue the work.

Charleston Animal Society	244594	4	/users/profile/331540	Wendy119,	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2015	I'm sure that you're being overwhelmed with responses after the world learning about Caitlyn. It's sad that such an unfortunate incident had to occur to bring to light what a wonderful gem you have in the Charleston Animal Society. As our societies slowly change and begin to realize that having opposable thumbs doesn't give us the right to inflict damage on the earth and its inhabitants, places like the Animal Society shine through as leaders. They walk the walk and talk the talk and the animals are the better off for them. Kudos CAS!!

Charleston Animal Society	244256	1	/users/profile/331152	ksherman	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	The people and organizations helping to rescue and heal abused animals are unsung heroes.  The story of Caitlyn is so heart wrenching it was difficult to read.  How is someone capable of doing something so cruel to a helpless animal?  I volunteer at the local shelter and see first hand how cruel people can be.  I sincerely hope Caitlyn gets adopted by a family who will appreciate what a special girl she is. Support your local shelter and ALL organizations providing for animals that have been abandoned and/or abused!

Charleston Animal Society	244248	2	/users/profile/331144	faradayh	Donor	5	06/01/2015	The Charleston Animal Society has touched my heart with their caring and swift attention to dogs like Caitlyn who was found with her muzzle taped shut and so horrendous it has moved an entire country.  What would we do without great agencies to come to care for those who can not help themselves and work diligently to save and protect, care for and find forever homes for.  They are tops in my book and have won my respect

That poor pup certainly deserves the love and care that you are.providing for her. It is amazing how far she has come along since I first read her story. It's wonderful to see her bright-eyed with a chewy. 
Charleston Animal Society	244244	2	/users/profile/331139	radha.ma	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	After reading about the very sad story of Caitlyn and the other dog impaled on a tree, and this organization coming to the rescue of these animals, I can only give them 5 stars. Anyone who works at saving these overly-abused animals with an iffy chance to live deserves nothing but the highest marks. Caitlyn's story has touched the world. This dog should never have suffered, and I hope South Carolina will review its penalties for animal abuse cases as $5000 and 5 years doesn't even touch the level of penalty for the person who did this to Caitlyn. Nothing but kudos, A+++, and good work to the Charleston Animal Society.   Radha FournierSalt Spring Island, BCCanada
Charleston Animal Society	244243	2	/users/profile/331138	Marisa L.	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	 Animals don't have a voice ..Many of us weep in despair in having to witness what depraved actions human beings are capable of doing to defenseless creatures.  Animals are never a priority to our lawmakers. This organization  is amazing & the work they do in caring for neglected, abused, abandoned animals is phenomenal! The rest of the country should follow their example.  They have done a wonderful job with Caitlyn. 
Charleston Animal Society	244241	2	/users/profile/331136	seanmichaels	Donor	5	06/01/2015	I learned about Charleston Animal Society when they recently rescued Caitlyn. The fact they saved her and so quickly along with providing the entire country with updates is just outstanding. I am in total awe.
Charleston Animal Society	244240	1	/users/profile/331135	brittanyelizabeth	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	My fianc and I moved to the area last year and I stumbled upon Charleston Animal Society on Facebook. BEST LIKE EVER. I have never seen a shelter be so Involved with the animals and keeping the community in the loop. Even though some stories that they share are sad and unfortunate regarding abused animals, it really does shine a light on the local animal lovers and help raise an incredible amount of awareness on animal abuse. I really don't think the Charleston area would be the same without them! Animals deserve the same respect humans do, if not more. The  Charleston Animal Society embraces that more than any other organization I have ever seen. We can't WAIT to adopt from here in the near future.  To the staff- what you're doing is such a beautiful thing; putting so much hope and love back into the community. We have so much respect for you all. Xoxox

My hope this will get the word out to punish the animal abusers with jail time, just like they would for hurting a person.  All these beautiful creatures want is the same unconditional love they give.

Charleston Animal Society	244195		/users/profile/331085	AlyBar	Client Served	5	06/01/2015	I am from PA. I found CAS while on vacation in Charleston in 2010. They had a adoptions set up in the park and we fell in love with our dog, Mandie. Since then we have made many donations and planned our trips around visiting CAS.  They help so many animals. I can not say enough great things about them. They do things in the south, where the stray animal population is so much higher, that I have never seen a shelter attempt in the North. Thank you CAS for never giving up on any one. You are an amazing example of what we should all strive to be. 
Charleston Animal Society	244194		/users/profile/331084	simplejoys7	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	So proud of all you have done for Caitlyn.

Charleston Animal Society	244192		/users/profile/331082	Edna S.	General Member of the Public	5	06/01/2015	The Charleston Animal Society along with North Charleston Animal Control has really done a splendid job with the cats on our street. They instigated a tag and release program which curtailed the population growth by spaying and neutering the cats we could catch, and then releasing them back into the area. They did not take them and put them down, but helped to save lives for which we are very thankful. Awesome work and great programs! Keep it up guys and gals! Kudos to the Vets for their care and love.

Charleston Animal Society	244189		/users/profile/331079	Tannerman	Volunteer	5	06/01/2015	It is so heartwarming when an agency not only takes in an animal on a temporary basis but is willing to work with the injured and heartbroken ones and allows them to learn to love humans again without fear. I truly believe animals sense when they are in a kill shelter and express that fear and anger in behaviors that frequently prevents them from being able to be adopted. In a no kill shelter, they begin to relax and heal their hearts and souls as well as physical injuries when in a facility such as yours. Thank you so much!

As our societies slowly change and begin to realize that having opposable thumbs doesn't give us the right to inflict damage on the earth and its inhabitants, places like the Animal Society shine through as leaders. They walk the walk and talk the talk and the animals are the better off for them. Kudos CAS!!

I take my hat off to you all!I am Mum to 4 ex-puppy farm breeding girlies who are now living the kind of life all dogs should expect.

Charleston Animal Society	204695		/users/profile/266732	Cindy132	Volunteer	5	06/30/2014	I have been volunteering at the shelter for over four years and have enjoyed every minute of it. I have learned more information while volunteerting on the medical care of animals then I ever thought possible. All the staff members are so friendly and helpful in answering customer's quesions. It is great to see the community step forward and help the animals in finding new home and just by fostering. I also enjoy doing the off shelter adoption events and spreading the word out to the community about what the shelter does.
Charleston Animal Society	204594		/users/profile/266621	Sabrina9	Volunteer	5	06/29/2014	I just recently started volunteering here when I had to move to SC for the navy and I LOVE it. It's so great to work with all the animals. All the animals are treated so well and the shelter works so hard to adopt as many animals as possible. They're extremely clean and the staff is so sweet and helpful. Love volunteering here!
Charleston Animal Society	204510		/users/profile/266529	jndyckman	Volunteer	5	06/28/2014	I have been volunteering at CAS for over two years.  It is a modern, clean facility where both staff and volunteers take their mission of caring for the animals seriously.  They go way beyond keeping the animals fed, watered, and the areas clean.  They also make sure they have good human interaction and enrichment to keep them busy.  All volunteers must take a 3 hour class on dog interaction which promotes safety.  Beyond this, they operate bark camp at the shelter for middle school  children during the summer, and a summer program for older children who may be interested in a veterinary career.  Last year they also developed a training class that was attended by people from South Carolina as well as other states and provided enough training materials so that the attendees could go back and give this class to others.  CAS is recognized nationally as one of the best organizations of its kind.  Best of all, I found my constant companion, a two year old miniature poodle there!
Charleston Animal Society	204503		/users/profile/266522	simbo	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2014	As the only No Kill shelter in the Southeast, the job the CAS is doing is absolutely amazing!!
Charleston Animal Society	204192		/users/profile/266215	dogfish29464	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	If you would like a truly rewarding experience, try volunteering at the CAS. The programs, staff, and fellow volunteers are outstanding. I assist in the veterinary dept by caring for the patients (dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens, and even one rabbit) after their spay or neuter surgery. The vets and vet techs are excellent technically but also show great care and concern for any medical issue they may find. I've observed full amputations, eye surgery, hernia repairs, and many other procedures provided to strays or unwanted pets which then led to a healthy life and adoption. This is a very deserving nonprofit with all the right goals.
Charleston Animal Society	204149		/users/profile/266170	SheKoe	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	I began volunteering for CAS last October after reading about the progress CAS had made toward becoming a "No Kill" shelter. I have participated in several events: dog walking at the shelter, sharing hurricane preparedness information with the community, an outreach to the North Charleston community with free rabies and distemper vaccines and the Summer Slam.  The staff has been most kind and helpful to me. Their dedication to the homeless animals is amazing. The remain courteous and cheerful no matter how busy they are. And I have thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the volunteers. I can't enter high kill shelters. It is too depressing. No so at CAS. There is an air of optimism here even though there is much work left to do. CAS does an amazing job for the Charleston, SC community.
Charleston Animal Society	204121		/users/profile/266143	shurd001	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	The best part of my day is volunteering at CAS! The facility is far superior than any other I've seen, with great staff. Just the fact that CAS is no kill makes me want to support them.  They care for and adopt out THOUSANDS of animals per year. Even as a volunteer, you have to go through orientation and an interview. I can't even begin to express how much I believe in Charleston Animal Society! 
Charleston Animal Society	204001		/users/profile/266031	Jln70	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	I have only been volunteering at Charleston Animal Society for a short while, but I cannot begin to express how  many hard working and compassionate  staff members I have met.  I have volunteered at other shelters and this  one exceeds every one in so many ways.  It is the highlight of my week to help out there and see these precious babies get adopted because of all of the hard work everyone is doing.  They all deserve a chance!
Charleston Animal Society	203980		/users/profile/266014	Stephanie151	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	Working as a Voleenteer (Foster Parent) at the Charleston Animal Society has been one of the most rewarding things I have ever done.  There is no doubt that animals come first at this shelter.  The amazing group of people that work here go far beyond any expectations in helping out in any way possible to save lives and make a no kill shelter possible.  After over a year of being a foster voleenteer I have noticed the staff listens openly to any suggestions, go to any extreme to help provide answers, and will even cry along beside you if you lose a pet.  I have never seen a place more dedicated and loving to each animal in the community. It is an honor to be apart of CAS and watch the amazing effect it has had on all the animals that come through the door.  If you want to help just one rescue out this is the place to come to...it will not only save that animal but make it a continued reality that all animals are worth saving!
Charleston Animal Society	203951		/users/profile/265988	Robin104	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	I have been involved with several nonprofits in my life and have never seen one with the dedication to mission and outcomes as the Charleston Animal Society. Their determination to become a No Kill shelter is amazing. They have an amazing presence in our community and deserve every recognition available, not only for the services they provide to deserving pets, but as an example to all nonprofits, whatever their mission.

As a long time pet owner, I love being able to help CAS in any way I can! I walk dogs, bring supplies and spread the word of the great work being done at the CAS. I hope more shelters around the country join the No Kill way, it can be done!
Charleston Animal Society	203851		/users/profile/265894	Iloveanimals12345	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	I have been volunteering with the Charleston Animal Society and coming here is always the highlight of my week. I love seeing the dogs light up with joy when the volunteers interact with them. I love how every day the dogs get one one one interaction with a volunteer. Our volunteers go outside with them and play fetch.   I love how this organization takes the time to train these dogs.  I was also very pleased that they treated my dog for heartworms before i adopted her.  I was very impressed by how put together this organization is. When they make you go through the process of adopting one of their pets, they make sure you have a vet.  These workers do a great job of caring for their pets before and after they get adopted. The thing i admire most about this organization is that they keep a room stocked of pet food, and if any pet owner is having trouble financially and can't pay for pet food they will give you a free bag of dog/cat food.  I can't stress enough the amount of love these volunteers give towards these dogs.
Charleston Animal Society	203815		/users/profile/265861	Nachbar	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	I don't understand why all animal shelters and/or societies don't emulate the Charleston Animal Society. It would not only be great for all the animals, but it would be great for the psyche of all the humans involved. 
Charleston Animal Society	203790		/users/profile/265839	courtneystearn	Volunteer	5	06/26/2014	The Charleston Animal Society is one of the most unique and rewarding experience I have ever had the pleasure to be a part!   They serve such a large area of our community and impact the lives of some many animals and families.  They are really the front-runner in making our area a NO KILL COMMUNITY and are extremely dedicated to helping each and every animal they bring in.  I am so excited and honored to be a part of such a great organization! :)
Charleston Animal Society	203764		/users/profile/265814	kristennotchristian	Donor	5	06/26/2014	I've adopted one dog and one cat from Charleston Animal Society. They were both given second chances and a new life because of the efforts of Charleston Animal Society. My two year old hound mix, Strawberry , came into CAS with 6 other dogs and was terrified of people, one of the dogs that she arrived with had burns down his back. The staff of Charleston Animal Society treated her sibling's burns and worked to socialize her with people, after she would finally open up to people they placed her in a foster home to continue her socialization, lucky for me, that foster home was my home.  Everyday CAS works to improve the lives of animals through their spay/neuter clinic, adoption center, free roaming cat initiative, and more.  I now work at CAS, and donate my extra time and money to helping to make sure that Charleston will stay a No Kill Community! There is nothing better than watching a new adopter go home with a pet that is being given a second chance. 
Charleston Animal Society	203738		/users/profile/265784	Dan_62	Donor	5	06/26/2014	Charleston Animal Society is one of the most progressive animal rescue organizations in the South and the country.  Their 9-point program to keep Charleston a No Kill Community is inspiring.  Some of these programs are the free-roaming cats initiative, their high volume (12,000/yr) spay-neuter clinic,  and their 500-member foster network across Charleston County.  All of the programs are research-based programs that have been proven to save animal lives.  Amazing group! 
Charleston Animal Society	203737		/users/profile/265783	cwh1	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2014	The staff is very knowledgeable and courteous.  They truly care about the animals and the community they serve. 
Charleston Animal Society	182826		/users/profile/226851	Veniceman	Donor	5	10/27/2013	FREE ROAMING CAT INITIATIVE BOTH SUCCESSFUL AND MISUNDERSTOOD  Charleston County, including the City of Charleston, has one of the most successful free-roaming cat initiatives in the world. This effort was launched in 2010 and implemented in 2010 by Charleston Animal Society and other animal organizations comprising Humane Net, a coalition of animal organizations in the lowcountry.  The purpose was to reduce the population of free roaming cats because the past strategy of trapping-and-euthanizing simply was not working as the population continued to increase each year. After approximately 18 months of implementation and widespread community support, the growing population of stray animals began to decline for the first time. Charleston County is one of only a handful of communities nationwide that is effectively managing down the population of free roaming cats. Communities from across the nation and oversees, including France and Australia, have reached out to us about our success in decreasing the intake of cats.  The Free-Roaming Cat Initiative is based on the Jacksonville, Floridas Feral Freedom Program, a nationally recognized model, and is comprised of 6 strategies ranging from trap-vaccinate-alter-return (TVAR) to adoption and fostering. It is also based on the most recent scientific research and best practices in the animal welfare field forwarded by the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine Maddies Shelter Medicine Program, University of Califorina Davis School of Veterinary Medicine Koret Shelter Medicine Program, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), PetSmart Charities and others. We are in touch with veterinarians and scientists from these organizations on a regular basis. Most importantly, we have begun to solve the problem of free roaming cats by reducing their population, but we have a long way to go as a community.  Since 2009, the baseline year for the Initiative, we realized a 15% decrease in the number of feline kittens and neonates through 2012, in spite of activities to increase the trapping of free roaming cats. When attempting to manage the population of a species, this achievement was remarkable.  The Free Roaming Cat Initiative is a sterilization intervention and is not intended to treat other issues that might exist, unless they are life-threatening. That is all. If a free-roaming cat is in stable health and is sustaining itself, meaning finding food and shelter, it is sterilized, vaccinated, ear-tipped and micro-chipped, then returned the next day to the neighborhood where it was trapped. It will not be able to reproduce and the population of a colony, if he belongs to one, eventually declines.  Prior to this strategy, many citizens were feeding community cats but were not willing to trap them or have them trapped for fear that the cats would be euthanized, thus, this contributed to a paradigm of incubation and propagation of free-roaming unsterilized and unvaccinated cats. Now that citizens know free-roaming cats in stable health will be returned to the neighborhood, they are participating in great numbers.  The Initiative is working.  Cats have been living successfully alongside human society for over 10,000 years and may be the only species to domesticate themselves. They are also the most popular pet in the United States. Making cats indoor pets became popular in the U.S. post- World War II, with the advent of cat litter. This is primarily a practice in the U.S. That said, the vast majority of cats, including in our community, spend time outdoors, many of which are considered neighborhood or community cats. Between 74 and 86 million pet are living among U.S. households. Of those, 80% - 85% are sterilized, which is a very successful rate. However, there are approximately 90 million un-owned or free-roaming community cats, of which, only 2% are sterilized. In Charleston County, there are between 24,344 and 60,860 of these cats. There are between 12,652 and 31,630 in Berkeley County and between 9,530 and 23,824 in Dorchester County. Attempting to decrease the number of free roaming cats in addition to owned cats who are given up is extremely challenging.  Common assumptions about animal rescue organizations who shelter cats are:  Owners will come looking for them.  Animals could be adopted if not reclaimed.  Spay/neuter efforts targeted at owners and pets will reduce intake.  Reunite cats with owners?  Only 2% of cats are reclaimed nationally. In Charleston County, our reclaim rate is over twice the national average but still only 5%.  Cats or almost 3 times as likely as dogs to disappear from households.  Cats are more than 13 times more likely to return home by non-shelter than by shelter means.  66% of lost cats found because they return home. Only 7% found via call or visit to shelter.  Where do people get their cats? 41% Friend or relative  34% Stray 29% Adopted  Charleston Animal Society is the leading adoption provider, and spay/neuter provider, in South Carolina, and is projected to adopt out between 4,500 and 5,000 animals this year alone, of which, 2,500 are cats. Currently, the Animal Society is caring for nearly 500 cats in its sheltering system, of which, almost 300 are being cared for in the homes of foster volunteers, a remarkable group of guardian angels. However, most folks obtain their cats elsewhere, with the high probability that most cats wonder into peoples yards and are cared for by a family or neighborhood. We also know that only 25% of cat owners or caretakers visit their vet annually versus 63% of dog owners.  When free-roaming cats, often called feral cats, are trapped and enter a spay/neuter clinic, they are frightened and, most of the time, exhibit aggressive behaviors because they are out of their natural surroundings. With the thousands of cats that enter the Animal Society each year, it is not possible to hold the cats to see if they might calm down and move toward the adoption path.  There is no standard definition or determination of what a feral cat is and the animal welfare sector is moving away from using that term, opting instead for free-roaming cat, whether it is feral, stray, an outdoor pet, or simply a community or neighborhood cat. Many perceived feral cats are not wild or crazy. In fact, there are several colonies of free roaming cats on the Animal Society campus, comprised of cats displaying a variety of behaviors, some of which will now approach humans with ease.  Ear-tipping is a standard identification of free-roaming cats so that they are easily recognizable from a distance, such as across the street in the dark hours of the early morning when most trapping takes place. Charleston Animal Society is a Humane Alliance certified spay/neuter clinic and offers a teaching/internship program to veterinary students from across the U.S. and overseas. Medical protocols and standards as published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (JAVMA) are closely followed and taught to veterinary students in our internship program.  When we spay or neuter a free roaming cat, we keep it overnight prior to releasing it to ensure it is in stable health. Free-roaming cats are fine outdoors. The heat is not going to adversely affect them. They, like humans, remove themselves from it. In fact, they are thriving in Charleston.  The Jacksonville Feral Freedom Program works closely with the City of Jacksonvilles Animal Care and Protective Services and has been returning free-roaming cats, both sociable and not, to where they were trapped with success for some time now. Although not the case in Charleston, most likely, the local strategy will move in that direction.  As is the case across the country, free-roaming cats brought into the communitys sheltering system have a higher likelihood of reuniting with whomever is providing their sustenance by returning them to that area.  Our efforts to reduce the population of free-roaming cats in Charleston County are working and is a model for other communities, and, it saves taxpayer dollars. Were grateful for this incredible community that came together in 2010 to launch this innovative approach at solving a community problem. Our community leaders, elected officials, animal organizations, animal control agencies and citizens have worked hard at addressing the issue of free-roaming cats in an effective way based on research and best practices.  Most importantly, were grateful for the hundreds of foster volunteers who nurture the neonates and juvenile kittens, along with other special needs animals, until they are ready for homes. In addition, we are especially grateful for citizens who offer a home for animals.  Indeed, this is a very special community and Charleston Animal Society is a very special organization.  Sincerely, Joe Elmore, CAWA, CFRE, PHR	 Chief Executive Officer	  Lucy Fuller, DVM	 Director of Public Health & Spay/Neuter Initiatives

Charleston Animal Society	178855	2	/users/profile/235483	alimc	General Member of the Public	1	10/17/2013	This week, I discovered that this facility dumps old animals out in the woods, rather than take care of the sick ones. I took a sick animal to the facility twice. The first time, the animal mysteriously returned to my house. I was confused so I took him back and dropped him off again. I then discovered the true owner of the animal, and attempted to get him back from the facility, but several employees gave me the run around and told me that the animal was being returned to my home. I waited all day, and the animal never arrived. I eventually had to contact the Director and go meet her and the vet in person, still trying to find out what happened to this animal. The Director was quite rude and threw her pen and walked out of the meeting. The vet confided in me that they "TNR" older animals that aren't considered adoptable. TNR means transport and release. And the vet said that the volunteer driver dropped the cat off in a wooded area near my home. I am completely disgusted and we still have not been able to find this poor animal.

It's sad that such an unfortunate incident had to occur to bring to light what a wonderful gem you have in the Charleston Animal Society. As our societies slowly change and begin to realize that having opposable thumbs doesn't give us the right to inflict damage on the earth and its inhabitants, places like the Animal Society shine through as leaders. They walk the walk and talk the talk and the animals are the better off for them. Kudos CAS!!

Charleston Animal Society	171828		/users/profile/227482	Tori I.	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	The Charleston Animal Society is a wonderful non-profit organization that does great things for the Charleston community. CAS's No Kill Charleston campaign is aimed at cutting down the amount of unwanted, homeless animals in our area.  CAS has taken the first step in truly rescuing helpless, homeless creatures and never turns away an animal in need - no matter how old or how sick. CAS's staff and volunteers are equally as wonderful as the shelter.  Everyone walks with a mission to save these animals. They are passionate, driven and deeply connected to each animal that walks in and out of their doors. The Charleston Animal Society is a spectacular example of the goodness and sincerity Charleston has to offer.  It was a pleasure working alongside both animals and people, and an experience I value tremendously.

It is the most fun, uplifting and hopeful animal rescue I've ever seen. They clearly love animals and people and want to bring them together. The cat area had fun sparkly toys for them to play with and a fun way for potential adopters to interact with them. The dog area wasn't just rows of depressing jail cells but comfortable pens for each dog in a calming layout.  I looked at a few dogs and the volunteers and staff were honest about how they thought each one would do in my home, based on my lifestyle and personality. I ended up with the greatest, cuddliest rescue hound I could ever hope for and the entire process was awesome. I had questions about the heartworm treatment they gave him a few weeks after I brought him home, and the vet who did the procedure personally talked to me and explained things clearly and patiently. And finally, firefighters with puppies for a fundraiser calendar? I bought two and already have Christmas gift plans for five more. This is the best animal rescue EVER!
Charleston Animal Society	171697		/users/profile/227343	berlins	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2013	Berlins Restaurant Supply wanted to share with you our recent experience with the Charleston Animal Society and their awesome staff. On Valentines Day a young pit-bull wandered into our warehouse; she had been hit by a car and was bleeding bad. Two members of our staff took her to the Charleston Animal Society for help and she was immediately seen by a vet for urgent care. During the dogs five day hold to see if she had an owner, she underwent surgery to clean and close her wounds, was fixed, micro chipped, and all of her shots updated. At the end of her five day hold, the staff from Berlins picked her up to begin her foster care so she could begin to heal in a caring environment. To our surprise we were never given a bill for all her medical treatment she received. Ginger, as she is now called, quickly became a favorite to all the staff and loved by everyone. We would like to say a special THANK you to the Animal Society for all of their awesome and selfless work.  Ginger was adopted by an employee at Berlins and now lives in a very happy family home. Thank you Charleston Animal Society

They offer great services to the community, and never turns anyone away without reaching out to all resources. I have now moved away, and no longer able to Volunteer my time, but I do still drop off needed things when I can and I am in town. I have also used their services as well for my fur baby, and I now when I take her there I can depend on them to take care of her as if she was their own.

I found their facility pleasant and clean.  They are very organized, knowledgeable and most importantly take EXCELLENT care of the animals in their care. Ron was clean, healthy, had all his vaccinations, no fleas, no worms, he was neutered and micro-chipped. My second experience with CAS was when I became a foster parent to some very little kittens. They made sure I knew exactly how to care for them, took a lot of time with me, and supplied me with everything I needed to care for the wee little creatures. When I was concerned about one kitten, they had me come right in for a vet check. Their staff is top notch, the facility is top notch, and they all work very hard for the animals.

Client Served	5	09/24/2013	2 years ago I walked into CAS and was impressed by not only the facility but the caring nature of the staff. While the first few times I did not find the pet was that meant for me, each time they encouraged me to come back. A few months later I found my soul pet in a black lab whom I have since named, "Cooper." What impressed me most was the fact that when I adopted him they included his first vet visit. The staff was amazing and shared in my excitement.  Since then I have become a big supporter of CAS. They do so much for homeless pets. They would rather give them away to a family that will love them and may not be able to afford a high adoption fee than put them down. They do the best they can to get animals adopted. They are constantly out in the community with adoptable pets. I can't go to a large community event without running into them.  My dog Cooper is such a big part of my life. I simply can't imagine not coming home to his waging tail. He was heart worm positive when they found him wondering the street of John's Island. Most places would have not let Cooper be adopted. I am so unbelievably happy they put the time and money in him so he could come and live a happy, spoiled life with me.

When there we wanted her to roam on her 30+ acres and enjoy the life we wanted for her. But once her roamings did not produce an immediate return. A wonderful soul picked her up (not noticing her collar with our phone number on it??) and too her all the way to the Charleston Animal Shelter.

As an "adult", the fee was waived, but we made the donation anyway - of course!  You do such great work. We named our new kitty CASSIE (Charleston Animal Shelter), and she brings joy to us every day.  Strangely enough, she was placed for adoption TWICE and returned, as well as having been dropped off in the first place!  It was the other families' loss.  Our beautiful medium haired tortie couldn't be a more charming, playful and loving member of our family.  We are grateful every day.

Charleston Animal Society	244594	4	/users/profile/331540	Wendy119,	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2015	I'm sure that you're being overwhelmed with responses after the world learning about Caitlyn. It's sad that such an unfortunate incident had to occur to bring to light what a wonderful gem you have in the Charleston Animal Society. As our societies slowly change and begin to realize that having opposable thumbs doesn't give us the right to inflict damage on the earth and its inhabitants, places like the Animal Society shine through as leaders. They walk the walk and talk the talk and the animals are the better off for them. Kudos CAS!!
Charleston Animal Society	171554		/users/profile/227156	Geneva787	Donor	5	09/24/2013	Randolph Pritchard and all the staff at CAS have worked tirelessly to make sure all of the animals are treated well and adopted to loving families. They especially do a great job with the feline adoption program! As a past donor, I have toured the facility and it is one of the nicest of its kind I have seen, with the most professional employees.

Charleston Animal Society	171519		/users/profile/227112	VA21	Donor	5	09/24/2013	Being animal lovers the staff and volunteers at the Edmondston-Alston House have donated to the Charleston Animal Society for several years.   This organization continues to make  improvements,  including Toby's medical fund which lowers the euthanasia rate for animals needing medical attention. Their ultimate goal, hopefully in the near future, is to become a no-kill shelter.
Charleston Animal Society	171508		/users/profile/227101	AmyR.	General Member of the Public	5	09/24/2013	I have donated to the shelter int he past and have a wonderful faithful companion that I was fortunate enough to have adopted when he was two.  The staff at the shelter (especially Kay Hyman) works tirelessly to insure they can properly care for (veterinary services, food) and can  find homes for ALL of its animals so that they can minimize euthenasia. People like Ms. Hyman and others are so committed to the shelter that they often work 24/7 to fulfill the shelter's mission. This runs the gamut from educating the public about the shelter's operations, soliciting donations (not just of money but also for food and other necessary items) and volunteers, and creatively trying to raise funds to maximize what the shelter is able to to for its residents (e.g., chili cookoff, Firemen's calendar, children's pet care camps in the summer). The shelter is also cooperative and supports legislation that was drafted to prosecute those who abuse animals which is simply another added responsiblity. No one person wears one hat. They are all involved in all aspects of insuring the success of the shelter. Unlike many other non-profit organizations, the Charleston Animal Society is very transparent in al that it does. We are fortunate not to just have this shelter in our community but more imporatantly, those that are employed and volunteer there that make it so wonderful. 
Charleston Animal Society	171501		/users/profile/227091	jlalarocks	Volunteer	5	09/24/2013	CAS was my first introduction to an open-admission shelter.  I had my biases against these types of shelters until I learned what they are about.  While CAS technically is Open-admission I have seen them, time and again, bend over backwards to rehome ALL adoptable pets.  Whether it be reaching out to an appropriate rescue, fee-waived adoption events or their Adoption Ambassador program.  They truly care about each animal that comes thought their doors and do a remarkable job of placing animals where they are best suited.  To prove they are making great strides they have gone from a 33% live release rate to over 70% in just a few short years.  By 2015 they plan to be a no-kill community, which is no small feat in this type of shelter.  They do such a great job by taking a holistic approach to sheltering.  They have an array of amazing programs: foster homes (over 400 homes last I heard); an adoption ambassador program, where the ambassador is entrusted with adopting out the animal they foster; a humane education department that teaches youth about humane issues and the community about animal care; a TNR program that is free to the public; a free rabies clinic which offer spay/neuter and microchipping in the package; low-cost spay/neuter to the community; and an openness to hear new ideas to advance their cause.  All of these, in addition, to the staff are what make this shelter a true asset to the Charleston community.  I have recently moved away for the area, but am constantly bragging about this shelter and sharing the ideas I've taken away with the current shelter I volunteer with.  CAS is truly a leader in the sheltering community and a benefit to the cause!
Charleston Animal Society	171473		/users/profile/227058	Wozzyusa	Donor	5	09/24/2013	I was introduced to Charleston Animal Society back in 2008 when they had just moved into their new amazing state of the art facility and at the start of their partnership with the ASPCA's Mission Orange project.   To see how the shelter has changed over the years is amazing and very rewarding for me as a volunteer and donor. CAS picked up the ball and ran and I'm now so proud of them for turning around the euthanasia  rate for Charleston and hopefully moving us to a No Kill Community in the coming months ahead. I urge people wanting to add a pet to their family to choose CAS.  The shelter is bright, clean, staff are friendly and very knowledgeable. They use the ASPCA's meet your match system which puts the right pet with the right owner.  I have friends who have used the low cost spay/neuter clinic and have all been very impressed with the care their furkids received. I also urge anyone wanting to volunteer their to do so, because of my new location i am not able to as much i would like but they do need help,  be it at one of their great special events, on the floor or working with and socializing the dogs, trust me if you do it you will not be disappointed. I also urge people to donate. They have a medical fund that you can donate to so animals that come into the shelter and need medical help are treated and not put down.  It's worth remembering that CAS has to take in every animal they receive, unlike some shelters and rescues that pick and choose who they save, that is why CAS needs all our help in what ever way we can. 
Charleston Animal Society	168872		/users/profile/223844	Rhonda864	Client Served	4	09/10/2013	A few years ago I came into the shelter looking for a small dog.  I really wanted a terrier or yorkie to be exact, but at the time they only had 1 small dog, a 4 year old chihuahua named Butterscotch.  I was never a big fan of chihuahuas, however, I stopped briefly at his cage and looked in.  He was so tiny and curled up on a blanket.  After a few minutes I stood and kept going, looking at all the other dogs up for adoption.  However, something kept pulling me back to the little chihuahua's cage.  He looked so scared and helpless.  After about 30 minutes, I went into his cage and picked him up.  I wanted to see how we interacted together, but of course he was a bit standoffish.  I was a stranger.   I put him back and continued to think about whether he was a good fit for me or not.  After about an hour, I decided that I just couldn't leave the little guy there.  When I went to the counter to let the staff members know that I wanted to adopt the little chihuahua, they were extremely helpful and got all the paperwork in order fairly quickly.  Charleston Animal Shelter is a wonderful organization and we are lucky to have them.  Butterscotch has been the light of my life since that day.  He's a sweet, smart and devoted little guy.  I love him with all my heart and soul. 
Charleston Animal Society	167843		/users/profile/222729	mattgamewellwatson	Board Member	5	09/06/2013	I've been a board member of 4-5 nonprofits in the Charleston, SC area.  I can easily say that the Charleston Animal Society (CAS) is easily the most well-run from both an operational standpoint and from a board standpoint.  In my opinion, the key to a successful business is having a passion for it.  A lot of people have a great passion for animals.   I'm certainly not an all-star board member; I'm somewhere around average.  I've been on the board for about a year.  Every single event  or meeting I go to I see the strong passion among ALL employees and volunteers affiliated with CAS.  That's right, every day.  This alone speaks wonders for the animals that come through the doors.  You can tell by this strong culture among the employees that the "tone at the top" is very good at CAS.  
Charleston Animal Society	167682		/users/profile/222548	Hilton S.	Board Member	5	09/05/2013	I have been involved with the Charleston Animal Society since 2008 and have seen it grow from a small run down trailer location, to a state of the art shelter saving thousands of lives.  The quality of life offerred to the animals in the shelter has improved and therefore the quality of animals that are adopted out has improved and it shows.   They are saving lives and are on a mission to make Charleston a No Kill community.  They need support as it has not been easy or inexpensive, but their employees and volunteers are simply amazing and love what they do for the abandoned and rescued animals in the community and that they bring in from major disasters, dog fighting breeders, and puppy mills.  I got one of our dogs from them that was a rescue from a puppy mill and can't imagine my life without our little Chio and our 2 1/2 year old daughter loves her more than anything.  Charleston Animal Society is an award winning organization in our community and prides itself in being a best in class organization.

I clean dog cages and kennels, walk dogs and prepare the "floor" for the opening of the shelter. I work along side kennel technicians and get a first hand view of the kind of treatment rendered to the dogs. I am very impressed by the level of care and committment shown by the floor kennel attendants. They do not cut corners and are truely committed to providing great care. It is a very busy shelter. It provides public care as well as private care and they work very hard keeping the facility in working order and the animals well cared for. The veterinarians provide caring and compassionate treatment.

I've known this organization almost since the beginning and seen them grow and do great things. Thanks to the work that is done, HH treatment and insurance coverage for it has come a long way. They're always in the know about upcoming treatments and work hard to facilitate progress in the field by interacting with scientists and companies that develop treatments for hyperhidrosis.

I just kept getting a diagnosis of the sweating but no clue to finding a solution to the problem. Kept searching and came across  the International Hyperhidrosis Society's site.I have to congratulate them on giving more answers than I had been able to find with all my other searching I had done. I found this to be a thorough, friendly and helpful place to look for answers. I was sent the latest information regarding this condition with names of professionals to contact here in Australia.  I hope this Society gets all the support they deserve to continue their excellent work. Thanks from a very grateful Aussie.

International Hyperhidrosis Society	322157	1	/users/profile/415808	cait50	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/26/2017	I first learned about hyperhidrosis through a client I worked with at a behavioral clinic.  I saw the debilitating effects of hyperhidrosis on a child worked with first hand. Daily, the child would struggle to hold utensils, writing tools and even simple toys that required assembly were difficult tasks. More heartbreaking not only as a therapist, but as a parent, was the constant teasing from classmates when they were required to sit near or hold the child's hands for a group activities. Comments were frequently made about how "wet" and"gross" the child was. The parents sought treatment options, and were given the "first line of defense",  Botox to reduce the symptoms of her excessive sweating. Unfortunately it was not effective and they declined further treatment due to side effects. If only they had they had known of the many options that are available, perhaps the outcome would have been different.Being introduced to the International Hyperhidrosis Society has given me that opportunity and the tools to provide options for those seeking treatments. Not a size fits all options for those suffering hyperhidrosis! Not only has the organization further informed me about hyperhidrosis,  the available treatments, awareness for patients and doctors, and provided invaluable information regarding studies that can help provided treatments for those suffering with the many forms of hyperhidrosis. Thanks to the work and dedication of Lisa Pieretti, and her medical friends, countless volunteers, advocates those suffering with hyperhidrosis,  they now have hope and options with the International Hyperhidrosis Society.

I did not realize the numbers of people who suffer from this embarrassing and limiting condition until I became educated on hyperhidrosis by chatting with individuals who suffer.  The IHHS website SweatHelp.org offers the most up to date education, informational programs and opportunities to participate in clinical trials with investigational drugs which will hopefully make a difference.  Lisa Pieretti is one of the highly dedicated and professional individuals who make this organization tick!  I totally recommend the expertise and assistance of this nonprofit group.

The organization has tackled a large array of issues in a relatively short amount of time-- from research to support to education to treatment--all in an extremely compassionate manner. The organization, its work, and especially its well-organized and updated website serve as a place where someone suffering from this condition can truly "one-stop shop" for all the information they need to learn about living with excessive sweat, understanding that they are NOT alone, and options for potentially improving their struggle with this condition.

They continue researching and always share any help they can to hyperhydrosis sufferers. I've had this condition since I was a teenager... now 38 and I've tried everything over the counter and many prescriptions. Over the counter products do not work and most prescription solutions have nasty side effects. There are medical solutions out there but many are temporary and not covered by insurance. Without the International Hyperhydrosis Society - we wouldn't be getting anywhere and the information wouldn't be out there in the world letting everyone know - THIS IS A REAL CONDITION and those who are suffering ... you are NOT ALONE.

International Hyperhidrosis Society	296840	7	/users/profile/387616	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	07/17/2016	I have been suffering with hyperhidrosis for the past few years. It just came out of nowhere for me. I don't know if it was because i got older or because of my hypothyroidism. I, of course, at first didn't know anything about this problem or that anyone else suffered from it, like me. When I went to my primary doctor I don't think he knew that much about it either. He referred me to a dermatologist and they gave me this prescription spray that burned my underarms and made them worse. I went back and told them of the burning and they told me to keep using it but also prescribed a hydrocortisone cream. The hydrocortisone cream worked to take away the rash that came from the burning but the spray kept burning my skin. I finally stopped using the spray and went out on my own to find something that works. Through a google search I found the hyperhidrosis Society website and got some samples. I also got something called pit paste and tried out and am still using a number of things just to make it through the day at work so people won't smell me and I won't feel uncomfortable wet. On the Hyperhidrosis website Christine Fleckenstein got in touch with me and kept in touch with me to link me with different websites and tell me about the Botox seminar coming up. Unfortunately, the seminar has been cancelled but I felt like I gained a friend in hyperhidrosid through Christine.

They go to great lengths to get the word out about hyperhidrosis and raise awareness about this disorder. I've known this organization almost since the beginning and seen them grow and do great things. Thanks to the work that is done, HH treatment and insurance coverage for it has come a long way. They're always in the know about upcoming treatments and work hard to facilitate progress in the field by interacting with scientists and companies that develop treatments for hyperhidrosis. There really is no other organization like this in the world.
International Hyperhidrosis Society	129625	9	/users/profile/175002	ltguy11	Client Served	5	10/26/2012	I am currently an undergraduate student with palmar hyperhidrosis who have tried many treatments to manage it, such as antiperspirants, traditional Chinese medicine, and Robinul, but they were ineffective at stopping the sweat or had major side effects. The people at the IHHS enabled me to get a free Botox treatment that finally helped me have dry hands! With my current income, there would have been no way that I could of have this treatment done so soon if it wasn't for them. The staff all are amazing people and the work they do is life-changing for so many. Thank you so much for everything!

As a company developing a potential new topical therapeutic  for HH, we've had the unique opportunity to work with the IHHS on several occasions and have witnessed first hand how much of a positive impact they've had on the lives of those impacted with this condition.  This organization is run by an individual that is seasoned, motivated, organized and truly passionate about creating awareness for HH and helping out those who are affected on a daily basis by HH.  For all these reasons, we are and will continue to be a proud supporter of the IHHS .

International Hyperhidrosis Society	257560	7	/users/profile/345999	SureshP	Volunteer	5	09/15/2015	I was extremely happy to be part of the Seattle event. Thanks a lot for conducting such a great event and helping the people like me. I got Botox injections and I spent whole summer without sweaty palms. I still remember how much I struggled every summer here in US and every day when I was in India. There, I used to get sweating (palms and feet) all around the year, due to hot weather. I never be able to go out with normal slippers. I felt so much shy if I have to walk on a clean marble floor when I went outside. I still remember the tough times I faced while writing exams, writing notes and condition of my text books after my use. I still remember the jokes played on me by the classmates and friends.  I really appreciate your efforts on helping us and fighting to change our fate. You will be next to the god in our opinion. Hoping soon you will be able to find simple and permanent solution for this annoying sweating problem.

A pleasure to work with the IHHS!

The botox treatment that I received in Seattle through International Hyperhidrosis Society really works. I just had to give one week to kick in. I am enjoying living without sweaty palms. I recently visited Florida with my family and was feeling truly blessed to enjoy without sweating. I have never visited that hot countries in my life. I was always worried how would I enjoy sweating continuously. I look forward to participate as patient volunteer again for their master class conference in order for me to receive this treatment. Once again I would like to thank to the organizers, donors, physicians, the society for providing us the opportunity of this treatment. I can openly tell people I do suffer from hyperhidrosis and your society is there to make a difference in our lives. Thank you Lisa from bottom of my heart.

Volunteer	5	04/16/2015	I would like to thank International Hyperhidrosis Society and all the organizers and donors who made it possible to give us an opportunity to try out a free treatment and attend a workshop as volunteer patients. Receiving a botox treatment was amazing experience. I never thought something like botox would stop my sweating for few months. Having been suffering all my years with type 4 excessive sweating on my palms and feet and learning about the research  scientist and the organization are doing was an amazing experience. I look forward to attend again given an opportunity once again. It was a dream come true being free from suffering. I hope there is more and more research on this. People like us suffer silently. No one can know our suffering unless you are in that situation. I truly hope and pray that there will be cure that is available for all the people suffering. Thank you once again for changing our lives even though it's for short time of period.
International Hyperhidrosis Society	250564	5	/users/profile/338432	Suzanna3	Volunteer	5	07/29/2015	IHHS has given me a life that I thought I would never be able to live. I thought I would have sweaty palms, hand and feet forever. How I came upon this organization was one day I was fed up so I googled sweaty palms, hands and feet and their organization was one of the links. I never knew there was a name for it. I just called it what it really was. So I reached out andgave them my stories and my concerns because at that te I was a performer who used microphones and other electrical objects in my hand. I was worried with the way my hands sweated that I would get electrocuted. I was so self conscious about every thing. From the type of shoes to wear because of sweaty feet, they type of clothes to wear because of sweaty underarms, and whose hand I couldn't shake due to sweaty palms. My life was restricted until I came across this organization. They educated me and helped me with treatment. For that I am so grateful. With the help of their information I was able to go to my dermatologist and she diagnosed me with hyperhidrosis and treated me for it. It's been 6 years and I've been sweat free. Thank you so much. I am now more confident than I ever was and I can wear what I want. 
International Hyperhidrosis Society	250447	8	/users/profile/338291	lauramaryolga	Volunteer	5	07/28/2015	This organization has been a life saver for me. They are truly an AMAZING and dedicated group of people! Not only are these medical professionals "models" for the rest of their profession, but they were also clearly dedicated to compassionate and QUALITY PATIENT CARE! I was honestly blown away this past weekend at the Hyperhydrosis Master Class in Seattle, WA. I was a patient volunteer on Saturday 7/25/15, who flew across the country from Raleigh, NC to be able to take advantage of the generous treatments from all of these wonderful people. After I left the event that day, I honestly COULDN'T get over how authentic and transparent this non-profit truly is. Their zealous advocation of patient care/treatment for all the people who suffer from this (and get denied necessary treatments by their insurance companies) is a rare, but wonderful needle in a haystack of medical "resources" that exist today. The organization really lives by it's mission statement: "It is our mission to promote hyperhidrosis research, educate physicians in optimal diagnosis and care, raise awareness about the condition's emotional and economic impacts, and advocate for patient access to effective treatments. As part of our mission, we continuously build programs that connect those who suffer from hyperhidrosis with those who provide care, while increasing public understanding of this debilitating medical condition."  (www.sweathelp.org)....And I am beyond thankful that I was able to take part in this event opportunity that was full of teaching and treatment. I would fly across the country over and over each year, if it meant that I could receive such life changing help.  THANK YOU IHS!! My quality of life will be so much better and more manageable for the next 8-10 months as a result of the Botox injections you all helped provide for me at this master class in Seattle. I want to be a part of this forever!!! 
International Hyperhidrosis Society	250068	7	/users/profile/337896	Adrian7	Volunteer	5	07/26/2015	This was my first time participating in an event by IHS and it was outstanding! I was part of the Seattle event and met some fantastic people at our table that REALLY made a difference in discussing the interesting  challenges that only someone with this condition can understand.....truly understand.  The stories, the challenges, the real life strategy you have to take each day to hide, minimize, avoid, talk your way out of that will cause your condition to be exposed to others was truly awesome to talk to others about for a few hours. To live with something like this is such a tricky strategy to work into your life that to imagine what it's like to have dry hands(or other areas) seems like a dream after doing for your whole life. I was really impressed at the situations people have to deal with and how they do it every day. The discussion at our table for me was inspiring to overcome this challenge! As they say there is always someone that has it worse than you and I learned that today in a personal way. The staff that administered the treatments today were top notch and it was nice to know that they were getting first hand education of this condition from a group of people that deal with it and were not trying to down play the impact it has on our life. Lisa was a fantastic facilitator and made us all feel comfortable and has a contagious smile creating an energy of hope for a possible solution to one day be able to proactively reach my hand out and introduce myself with a firm full grip hand shake and not get that face or reaction that we're all familiar with when that human contact factor is inevitable:)  Thanks to the awesome people at our table today- your stories were  inspiring to learn there's a possible solution that can help us change the course of our life by being able to-  shake hands, wear slippers in public, present in front of a group confidently, wear clothing without sweat consideration, and engage with others in the way we always imagined it would be like not having to hide from hyperhydrosis! Thank you for what you're doing! AdrianVancouver, WA, USA
International Hyperhidrosis Society	250064	8	/users/profile/337890	bleher77	Client Served	5	07/25/2015	 International Hyperhidrosis Society has literally answered every question that I've had since I was young about a serious medical condition that many doctors that I went to did not know how to treat. Hyperhidrosis negatively affects EVERY person who is affected by it in a negative way. I has affected the way that I went outside(night time to prevent unsightly sweat strains and drenched face), my job, school, and personal life(lack thereof). IHS has allowed me to finally learn and manage hyperhidrosis. I even direct my physicians to their website to be informed of the condition, and we use it to manage and plan treatments to battle it. I cannot praise them ENOUGH!!! Best organization hands down. They respond to emails promptly, sends out newsletters that aren't spam but provide actual information and scientific advancements, and provide treatment to individuals who battle with the condition for FREE in return of educating other health care practitioners of the condition. Every effort needs to be made to help IHS to expand to further serve the ill and educate the healthcare providers.

I've battled with hyperhidrosis for many years and just last year began to find ways to share  my story on a broader scale. That's also when I reached out to www.Sweathelp.org for advice on how to do that and without hesitation they were so helpful.  A list of suggestions were given on what I could do to be involved and so that's what I'm doing now. As a fashion designer I share my story in hopes of helping others come out and share theirs too. It doesn't matter what you're dealing with, but it does matter what you choose to do with it.  For years I allowed this condition to isolate me, but not anymore. Thank you for the opportunity to share and I hope this inspires you to use your voice to speak up about hyperhidrosis.

During each event, I learn something new through the patients testimonies.  These are memories I carry with me during my journey of caring for patients on a daily basis. Thank you IHHS for all you do!

All my life I've perspired profusely but didn't realize that it was an actual condition and that there were treatment options available. The IHS not only identified the problem, but has offered solutions in which to help. Through their online newsletters and notifications to their website, the organization offers solutions and advice on how to deal with my problem. They also schedule annual sessions for medical professionals who desire to become  better educated on the topic of hyperhidrosis. I've had the opportunity to serve as a volunteer for several sessions and greatly benefited from the experience. It is my sincere hope that they are able to continue their work in the field of hyperhidrosis prevention. Kevin T.

It was such a challenging thing to deal with growing up, I wish I had this available to me as a child. Even after having ETS, it was good to read through some of the information to help me deal with the compensatory sweating. I also feel blessed that my side effects from the surgery were not as severe as many who have had it. People who do not suffer from Hyperhidrosis often give me funny looks when I say I had a surgery for my sweating. "That's a bit extreme, isn't it?" It really is something that only those who suffer from the condition can understand. This organization is getting the word out and also helping educate, comfort and walk along those who are experiencing it.

In talking to students about hygiene, it has been useful to be able to give out deodorant samples with instruction in taking proper care of their bodies.  It also "softens the blow" while telling them "how NOT to stink"!  I hung up two posters outside of my office and the students have gotten a real kick out of them, especially the "I am sweaty all day long..." poster.  While waiting their turn to see me, I often catch them reading the poster out loud and they then come in to see me with a smile on their face declaring, "I have hyperhidrosis!"  Thank you for helping to educate my students (and adults) in a fun and friendly manner.

Armed with the latest research and the brightest physicians,  I knew I wanted to get involved to help spread the word.  As an advocate for the society I have seen first hand the good works this nonprofit does.  Coast to coast they promote awareness, treat the condition, and educate.  The IHHS improves the quality of lives for sufferers.  Lives are changed.  I have seen it.   Thank you IHHS and keep up the great work!

They stay on top of the latest treatments and even train doctors to be sure patients are informed and get the treatment they need.  There are many people suffering with hyperhidroisis and I know they will continue to do as much as they can to help those who reach out to them.
International Hyperhidrosis Society	193539	2	/users/profile/252787	Zack2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/30/2014	Hyperhidrosis is a little known condition that is seen as "no big deal" to those who don't have it.  However, it can be socially devastating to those who do have it.  The International Hyperhidrosis Society is by far the best resource for those suffering from this condition.  They do an amazing job of educating sufferers on the causes and treatments of this horrible condition.  
International Hyperhidrosis Society	190398	1	/users/profile/248589	MeganP	Client Served	5	12/11/2013	I have struggled with excessive sweating of the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet since infancy. It has affected almost all aspects of my life, including body image, career choices, social interactions, and intimate relationships; it affects what I touch, who I touch, and how I touch. Hyperhidrosis is something that I have coped with, often on my own, for 34 years.  The IHHS has been my primary source for medically-accurate information on treatment for hyperhidrosis, which has helped me become an informed patient and advocate for myself. IHHS has increased my hope that things can be better for myself and others. Through website, telephone, and in-person resources, they have helped patients find clinicians that provide treatment, and helped patients find ways to pay for their treatment, a barrier to care that often increases the hopelessness of this condition.  IHHS has helped increase access to care for patients of all financial means. Many exuberant and dry-handed thank-you's to my Pennsylvania-based IHHS. You have made my life so much better.Con carino,Megan P.

It wasn't until my daughter also showed signs of excessive sweating that I looked up the symptoms on the Internet. The International Hyperhidrosis Society site answered many questions that I had. I felt encouraged to seek medical treatment that could be covered by our insurance. I am so relieved and happy that my daughter and son can do presentations at school, play in the band, go out on dates, etc. without having to worry about sweaty underarms any more (thank you, Botox!). I think about what a different person I might have turned out to be if I hadn't been held back by embarrassing sweat stains. This organization helps many others like me to learn how to alleviate their sweating and lead their best lives.

We live in a very low-wealth county and a large percentage of our students are unable to purchase even basic hygiene items.  After providing IHHS with a picture of our hyperhydrosis posters (that are located in our Student Health office) and explaining the needs of our students,  they graciously supplied us with deodorant samples. Our students are extremely appreciative of being given the deodorant.  One said the other day "I can keep the whole thing??  Thank you!"  That pretty much says it all.  My thanks to IHHS!

The most rewarding part of my day is hearing the testimony of the patients.  I sometimes feel  I leave with a more rewarding experience than the patient.  When I took my own, then teenage daughter, to the pediatrician with hyperhydrosis of the hands he said it was part of adolecence.  We need every speciality to be educated that there is help for these patients.  When you assist in treatment for a patient who has to alter their daily activities due to sweating and they call you back to say they are dry and how much their lives have changed with the help they have been given, that busy day all becomes worth it!  There has been the police officer who could not pull his gun from the holster due to wet hands, the public speaker who had forehead sweating so bad it dripped in his eyes, the teacher who could not use chalk, the student who could not do projects with markers because the ink would smudge, the hair dresser who could not hold the curling iron with wet hands, the stories are endless but I am sure space here is limited and others need to post.

International Hyperhidrosis Society	138595	1	/users/profile/184667	tita	General Member of the Public	5	11/13/2012	Like most people, I didn't realize excessive sweating was a medical condition. I thought those that suffered with it were people with poor hygiene habits or 'nervous types' who showed their high levels of anxiety through profuse sweating. I hate to admit this negative prejudice but that was the way I felt. Then, I learned more about hyperhidrosis and was completely ashamed of how uneducated I was. The saddest part is that people who have this condition sometimes don't understand it themselves. Sadder still, they often feel that perhaps they deserve to be shunned or ridiculed. They feel there is no hope, that they alone suffer and that they just have to 'live with it.' Without IHHS, this would be true. I can't express how truly life-changing the IHHS mission is to people with hyperhidrosis. The IHHS website, outreach programs and counseling help bring together a community where there wasn't one before. For the millions of people with the condition, and the millions of friends and families that help them cope, IHHS is a beacon of help.

To those not personally affected by hyperhidrosis or not in direct contact with someone who is, it is impossible to understand its immensely debilitating effects.  But through the dedication and professional perseverance of the International Hyperhidrosis Society, individuals are not only being given real and effective treatments -- they are being given long-lost self confidence, normalcy and the chance to be the mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, life-loving teenagers and accepted members of society that they so deserve to be.

I could finally sit in a room and sweat without any worries, while at the same time listen to experts who are pioneers in the field and who offer treatments of hope.  When I left the symposium that day, I felt like a million bucks. A palpable shift occurred within me that was rather unexpected. As a result of my interactions with Executive Director Lisa Pieretti, I was inspired to launch a blog called My Life as a Puddle to create hope and awareness one drop at a time. The care, attention, and understanding of those at the IHHS is astounding. They GET IT.  That day was more than just a CME symposium and an opportunity for treatment. It was about validation, courage, strength, and being seen and physically touched by all of the IHHS staff without having to worry about what they thought of my sweating. I can be changed by my circumstances, but not reduced by them. Maya Angelou once said, Beauty and strength can be found in adversity. I thank the IHHS deeply for helping me on my way to find mine.

I found CPR after having dismal experiences with other rescues who didnt even respond to my emails and multipage applications.  CPR responded within 24 hours to my application.  Im now the proud owner of a dog who was a stray in Tennessee and found her way to CPR.  Blind due to cataracts, CPR funded her cataract surgery before she was adopted.  CPR often takes the hard cases  dogs who have medical or behavioral issues and gives them a home, whether through adoption or in their sanctuary.  Highly recommend if youre looking for a responsible, responsive rescue agency.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320862		/users/profile/413838	mjogodwin	Donor	5	01/05/2017	Carolina Poodle Rescue (CPR) is an exemplary organization that saves lives both canine and human.  Through the hard work of staff and a broad network of volunteers, CPR rescues strays, dogs in kill shelters, and from owners who can no longer care for their pets up and down the eastern U.S.  My husband and I learned first hand of CPR's fine work when we adopted a "senior" standard poodle a year and a half ago. We were impressed with the very thorough application process and the quality of questions the adoption counselor asked us.  After meeting the staff and seeing several dogs that they matched us with, it was obvious that CPR understood exactly the type of dog we needed and would be a good fit for our home and lifestyle.  Since adopting we have voluteered at adoption events and assisted with transports and learned even more about the extraordinary work of CPR.  Through social media and their website we have access to a network of very knowledgable pet owners and caregivers who are ready to give advice and assistance if we encounter problems with our dog's health or behavior.  The love and care the CPR organization gives their dogs and adopters fosters a true sense of community and caring.  It is without reservation that I recommend CPR to anyone seeking a pet or an animal rescue organization to endow.

They take such great care of their dogs and really screen the forever homes these dogs go to. I got to help place 12 dogs that Sunday. We had to turn some adopters away because either they didn't bring their current furry babies with them or their furry pets were not neutered or spayed but the matches we made were so blessed. One dog sat all day and didn't respond to anyone until an hour before closing and then fell in love with this couple rolling on her stomach for belly rubs. I love CPR and their mission and the integrity behind them. Can't wait to do it again!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320825	1	/users/profile/413765	gretchen1958	Volunteer	5	01/04/2017	I have not adopted from Carolina Poodle Rescue however, I am an approved adopter and during that process I realized that I would truly love to be a part of this organization. Just as the adoption process is a very strict and in depth approval process so is the process to become a volunteer.  Donna Ezzell, her staff and volunteers invest an enormous amount of time, compassion and money in the dogs (and very often cats) that are placed in their care. They do not take the lives or health of these animals lightly. Very often thousands of dollars are invested in returning these animals to good health (medically, emotionally and behaviorally) before even making them available for adoption.  Most of the rescues they take in have many issues that have to taken care of.  So many of these animals come from deplorable situations and it can take months or even years to heal them.  This does not deter her from taking these animals and assuming that enormous responsibility.  Donna would never place these dogs in a home where there is even the slightest possibility they would be jeopardized again and be allowed to be subjected to the suffering they have been rescued from. It speaks volumes that an adopter must agree that if at anytime during the life of that dog problems arise or they can no longer care for that animal then it must be returned to Carolina Poodle Rescue.  I do want to add that my daughter adopted a beautiful American bulldog from CPR.  There have been a couple of issues with him and Donna was immediately available to help my daughter address these issues with great success.  He is undoubtedly a family member for life now.  Donna is committed to any animal that is adopted from her for the life of that animal. I would never recommend anyone to adopt from any rescue except Carolina Poodle Rescues. There are not enough stars to rate this rescue.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320823	1	/users/profile/413761	Writer	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	I have adopted two dogs from Carolina Poodle Rescue. It is about a three hour drive from my house one way, but I would go back again and again. Everything the dogs (and cats) need is attended to, from affection to food and water to medical attention and everything in between. You will find realistic and thorough descriptions of the pets' personalities, what background is known, and what kind of home might be suitable. They place hundreds of pets in well-matched and loving homes every year. CPR is nothing short of amazing.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320822	1	/users/profile/413760	Cyndie R.	Donor	5	01/03/2017	CPR is the most amazing place! They are the true definition of a 'rescue', and every fur-baby that is blessed enough to get to CPR is truly loved, cared-for, and matched to just the right adoptive family. The angels at CPR work very hard giving each and every dog individual time and attention. Their adoption process is thorough, as it should be, in order to protect the precious animals in their care. They are a dream-come-true for animal-lovers and the homeless animals that are lucky enough to find Carolina Poodle Rescue! 
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320818	1	/users/profile/413750	Lee_65	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	We lost our beloved 14 year old Griffon last spring and we were left with holes in our hearts.  In early December, it felt like the time had come to fill those holes. I knew that as older adopters, we didn't want a puppy.  We wanted a sort of scruffy terrier looking dog.  I started searching online, and a photo came up of a dog at Carolina Poodle Rescue.  First, let me say that the information they list online is very honest!  They tell you the absolute truth about every dog...temperament, special needs, anything you might need to know.  In our case, they clearly stated that the dog we were interested in was shy with strangers.  And they also caution every potential adopter NOT to fall in love with a picture posted online. Others have described the adoption process, which is extensive, proving that these folks truly care about the dogs and will not let them go to just anyone.  Once we cleared the interview process, it was later in the evening on a Friday night.  Our adoption counselor knew how very interested I was in this particular dog, and she somehow managed to arrange for us to meet him at 9:00 am the next morning!  As "advertised", he was indeed very shy.   We were allowed as long as we wanted to decide whether or not to take him home.  After nearly two hours, we did feel that he could learn to love and trust.  Then, we went outside with him.  There he saw people he knew....he had been with them for five months, since he was only 4-6 months old when CPR rescued him.  He had been found as a stray in NC, and happily for us, made it to the farm.  The joy he showed upon seeing "his" people made us realize that we had made the right decision.   This dog has brought new love and life Iife into our family!!! He is now perfectly trusting and extraordinarily loving with us.  Over the holidays, we discovered that he also likes to play with children as well...4 of our grandchildren ranging from 4.5 to 16 years old.  Did it take him a while to warm up to them, yes.  It took about a week for him to really feel comfortable in our home.  Was it worth it?  Oh my, yes indeed!  He has come so far because CPR took the time to teach him love and trust.  We can't thank everyone there enough! Not only did they keep him for 5 months, that time gave him the chance to mature so that he came to us crate trained and housebroken.  And time to get past that destructive puppy stage.  He is exactly the dog we were looking for, there just aren't enough superlatives to describe what a wonderful, caring place CPR is!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320811	2	/users/profile/413746	luvpoodles	Volunteer	5	01/03/2017	WE adopted Sammy from this caring group and have supported its work since that day. It is operated by amazing people who truly care about the animal. They also are very careful with the adoptions so that once a dog is rehomed, it will be a lasting and loving experience for the adopter and the dog.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320808		/users/profile/244058	Regina11	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	We had a wonderful experience adopting our Daisy from CPR.  The fact that they take such care in their adoption process shows that they truly want the best home for their dogs.  I filled out an application, had a phone interview and provided information about my groomer and vet office.  We were approved and drove several hours to meet our Daisy and she was a perfect fit for our family which included our older poodle Lily.  Daisy is a poodle yorkie mix and brought much joy and energy to our Lily who has sense passed.  I've referred several friends to CPR and they too have had happy and successful adoptions.  CPR is top notch.  
Carolina Poodle Rescue	187058	1	/users/profile/244058	Regina11	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	We adopted our Daisy earlier this year from CPR.  The experience proved that CPR is highly committed to the highest good of the dogs.  The adoption process was very thorough, professional and organized. I highly recommend anyone seeking a new family pet member to consider adopting through CPR.  They are also highly deserving of any support you may be able to provide.  
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320805	1	/users/profile/413735	Jodi41	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2017	When we were looking to expand our family last summer, we knew we wanted a rescue pup. After researching area dog rescues, we came across CPR. We completed their application and interview process. We appreciated the volunteers who took the time to thoroughly vet us to make sure we would be a good fit for a forever home!  We were matched with Wally, an apricot poodle who'd been neglected and abandoned at a groomer's shop. We were amazed at how accurately we were matched by the adoption counselor with Wally (a benefit of the somewhat lengthy application and interview process- but hey, adopting a dog is a BIG deal!) He has been the best addition to our family. His big brother Pete loves having a companion. We are part of the CPR Facebook group and love keeping in touch with Donna, the director, and other adoptive families. This group of people is so generous with their time and advice for poodles and non poodles alike. When it is time for us to bring another dog in need into our home, CPR is the first place we will go!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320802	1	/users/profile/413732	salshay	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	We adopted Shay in December 2016. We were very impressed with CPR vetting process. This group is obviously dedicated to being 100% sure the pets go to the best possible homes! The day we met staff and saw the property we were amazed! So much open space, various sheltered ares, fencing, grassy areas; and immaculate! 
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320801		/users/profile/413713	sberry	Volunteer	5	01/03/2017	I have volunteered with Carolina Poodle Rescue for over 4 years, fostered several over this period, and have spent many weekends, holidays, and vacation days working with dogs at the farm who need extra attention.  I tried volunteering at many rescues before finding CPR, and I will never forget the first time I visited.  I turned into the dirt driveway and immediately saw a dozen or more big dogs out in one of the big grass fields.   Some were playing ball, others sunbathing/napping, and a few were self-designated "greeters" to everyone who drove in, and there was always one that notified everyone on site that a new arrival just pulled in.  The sense of peace and tranquility were far beyond anything I had hoped to find, and I knew my search was over.   Much growth has happened in the last four years.  Now in addition to the big building/kennel, there are half a dozen or so smaller cottages that each house a grouping of dogs, be it littles, seniors, special needs, and others.  Every dog gets several hours outside and off leash to either wear themselves out playing, socializing with others, or just quietly enjoying the day.  For those that get looked over each time an adopter comes, there is a whole staff of loving caregivers to remind them that are special and highly loved and valued.  And the dogs know it, truly.  We have a few that can't be adopted out due to issues that were established and reinforced long before they came to CPR.  These few will live happily at the farm for the rest of their lives; safe, well-cared for, and so very loved.  They do have their own family, and between the caregivers and the volunteers - the size of their family is just much larger than those who are adopted!   Many volunteers live too far away to volunteer at the farm, and because of them we are able to transport dogs that need us from many other states thanks to these dedicated people.   Many donate monthly year after year to allow CPR to continue growing - saving and changing even more precious lives.  Many sponsor those who remain at the farm to cover care and all medical needs, ensuring the quality of life of these sweet babies are always met. The staff at CPR are remarkable with the love and affection they manage to give on top of the daily hard work required to maintain the environment for so many.  Several days are dedicated each week to take those in need to the vet.  Many unexpected, heart-wrenching trips also take place.  Many pull through but not all, and the few not able to be saved are remembered with many tears and comforting words and stories about how they touched certain caregiver's life - even those who had only been at the farm a few days were grieved over and celebrated for having given something special and unique that only they could give. The director and her husband have the hardest job of all, as they live onsite and never have a true day off (those who need special care and monitoring live with them and their own dogs.  A "day off" just means taking care of 30 or so dogs with special needs be it insulin shots, seizure meds and monitoring, the list goes on and on.  The board members and adoption counselors work tirelessly as well, either making sure the ongoing day to day expenses are met or to screen potential adopters and do their best to be sure they meet dogs that fit the family's environment and lifestyle.  Several dogs get introduced when the family arrives, and more likely than not, the dog chooses the family and the family falls for the one who picked them :) I just adopted my very first CPR dog recently as when I started volunteering, I was not in a place to be able to provide the lifetime of care that comes with adopting your own.   When I was ready and able to do so, they started looking and not long after found me the sweetest goldendoodle ever, who truly makes my heart sing.  (Even at 5:15 am with rain pouring down - we put on our raingear and take off for our morning exercise as she thinks I am the best every and could care less that I haven't showered or put on makeup or combed my hair!) No matter what the condition, every dog is worth fighting for.  Be it heartworms or blindness or three legs or malnourished and truly physically impaired (or all the above), room is somehow found, care and expenses are always asked for and met, and another life is changed forever.  Watching the process is a gift I never get tired of and never stop appreciating, and constantly surprises me with new and different wonders I see take place.  If you are looking for a place where love is never turned away and the rewards are always greater than the effort given, I suggest getting involved with this great rescue organization.   I am a volunteer, a donor, and a client served, and I highly recommend CPR to all. Happy New Year and thanks to all the great organizations that work so hard to change the lives of so many in need.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320796	3	/users/profile/413717	Elismom	Donor	5	01/03/2017	I have adopted from CPR 3 times. They are one of the most responsable and proactive rescue groups that I have ever had the pleasure to get to learn about and adopt from.  My male poodle was a rescue from a large overwhelmed and neglectful backyard breeder. CPR took a large number of dogs when the authorities shut this operation down. Without CPR, my boy would have surely died from neglect and hunger. He was unsocialized and tremendously under weight. CPR kept him in a foster home to help socialize him so that he would be adoptable. I adopted my little girl poodle from them next to be a companion for me and my boy. She was a retired breeding dog. After birthing numerous of litters for the profit of a breeder, at the age of 7, she was surrendered/abandoned. He was in poor condition and required not only the normal spay/neuter procedure but a full dental with full extractions. That costs an arm and a leg, but CPR was there to get her in shape so that they could find her a good home. She was also nurtured in a foster home. My 3rd dog from them is a 5yr old Portuguese water dog whose owner passed away. After relatives could not care for him, CPR took him, had him neutered and then offered him for adoption. Their care and adoption standards ensure that these beautiful creatures will never be neglected or I'll cared for again. I respect the organization and their heroic efforts.  I show this by trust that they always have the best interest of the animals at heart. I also show this trust with monthly donations to assist in caring for the animals in their care that they know may never have a home due to age or illness. These sos dogs have love and care the rest of their lives even if they are never adopted.

Carolina Poodle Rescue	320786	3	/users/profile/413700	wvgirl	Donor	5	01/03/2017	Oh that Carolina Poodle Rescue, what a fantastic group it is. I was looking for a small poodle to be my own, we had one, but she is a Daddy's girl. Thankfully I found Carolina Poodle Rescue on the internet. Looking at the dogs I found my baby. I filled out a long very precise application asking all kinds of questions and wanting references from friends and my vet. And these people were called.I was called and interviewed for over an hour. And finally told that I could adopt my girl who was in Raleigh in a foster home, IF my girl approved me. We made a ten hour round trip from WV to Raleigh and back. We spent several hours with her in the foster home and brought her home with us almost four years ago. My girl had been a puppy mill producer for several years along with four other dogs. The others had been adopted. Jazzy received probably her first dental while in the care of CPR and had been checked over, micro chipped and spayed. I tell people about Carolina Poodle Rescue all of the time. I have so much confidence in this group, I contribute money and volunteer my time sewing, as I am pretty far away. I have visited and have been impressed by the care the dogs are given and the cleanliness of the dog surroundings. I would recommend Carolina Poodle Rescue to anyone, but you have to pass the test of being a caring loving dog person.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320785	2	/users/profile/413696	Jenni.Floyd	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	My husband and I found out about CPR from a women I met through a Sheepadoodle group we had joined out of interest in buying or adopting a Sheepadoodle. She informed me that there was a Sheepadoodle in need of a home at a Poodle rescue organization in South Carolina. I immediately contacted the organization and began the application for adoption process. Once my husband and I underwent the application process and passed all stages, we received the call that we had been approved to adopt a standard sized dog. During the interview process, we realized that the temperament and past history of the Sheepadoodle we were interested in would not fit well with our lives, but we decided to go to SC and just meet some of the dogs and see what happened. We traveled to Pacolet, SC to meet the dogs and one by one, Donna began bringing them in to meet us. The first boy we met was a black Labradoodle who my husband really liked, but we weren't sold on. We knew that we wouldn't be leaving with a new fur baby unless we found THE ONE and just absolutely couldn't leave it behind. After meeting two more dogs after the first, Donna brought in a shaggy white purebred Poodle (if you had told me before this that I would ever own a Purebred Poodle, I would have laughed at you.) We both immediately fell in love. Donna said our eyes actually lit up when we saw him walk through the door. We got along with him beautifully, played with him, gave him commands, and quickly realized we had found the dog who wouldn't allow us to leave the farm without him in the car with us! Being stubborn and not wanting to give anything away too quickly, we told Donna we needed a moment alone to discuss what we wanted to do. She took the dog and stepped outside and not even 3 minutes later, we walked outside and said "Let's do it!" CPR gave him a bath and a cut and we took our boy home. That was a year and 8 months ago. Wow, time flies! Odie is the best dog we could have ever asked for and I cannot believe we got as lucky as we did. We keep in touch with CPR and have agreed that we will continue to adopt from them as long as we are able. This is a fantastic organization with truly wonderful people behind it. They genuinely care about these dogs and that shows in their selection process. It's not "easy" to be approved, but it is that way for a reason. They see so many dogs being adopted and then going back into a shelter and when CPR says they are looking for a FOREVER home for a dog, they mean FOREVER. They do not take that word lightly and they have a passion for what they are doing. I thank God for Odie and for CPR. We love you guys!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320784	2	/users/profile/413698	Spaniellover	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	I have adopted three dogs over the years each from a different rescue group. Carolina Poodle Rescue is by far the most thorough group in their vetting of potential adopters. I had an opportunity to visit them and ask as many questions as I wanted in return.   Their knowledge of dogs (not just poodles) helped to insure a successful selection of a new family member.  And, once adopted, they do a great job of keeping up with the pets. While located in South Carolina, they have members in many states that volunteer to match dogs with owners, foster, transport and whatever else is necessary to ensure loving homes. I would wholeheartedly recommend this group to anyone looking for a new four legged member of the family.

They treated us and the animals all like family.  We left with a wonderful poodle we call Sweet Pepper.  He was a wonderful fit for our home and lifestyle.  CPR has also been great with following up on Peppers progress.  Asking if we need advice and just general concern of his well being.  Upon his post adoption vet check up,  the vet said he was up to date on all his vaccinationas were were told and gave the supporting paperwork by CPR.

Although I've recently moved from South Carolina to Ohio I'd go there and adopt again should anything happen to my babies and I decide to adopt again. I've visited on several occasions and think they're a great organization. The facilities are clean and well organized as is the adoption process.

Carolina Poodle Rescue	320773	1	/users/profile/413684	Leslie107	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	My family had already had acquired a beautiful female puppy when I spotted photos of Dawson last summer on the Carolina Poodle Rescues Facebook page. A shy, well-behaved 5-year-old male, Dawson had been used for stud and then discarded. The moment I saw his photos, I knew I had to reach out to CPRs founder, Donna Ezzell, to see if we had a chance at adopting this beautiful boy.Donna and her team of volunteers and caregivers on staff are extremely thorough when it comes to vetting potential adopters. They know the animals they go to great lengths to save have often come from places where they werent appreciated or even worse. They always keep the welfare of the animals at the top of their priority list, and I for one cant thank Donna and all those who work with her enough for everything they do. If someone was turned down during the application process, there was a good reason for doing so. As another reviewer said, this isnt an organization where you pop in and point to an animal you want. Carolina Poodle Rescue has an in-depth interview process that not everyone will pass. Then, theres an in-person meet-and-greet at the rescue farm. If the team doesnt think theres a good fit, you wont get an animal from them. We successfully navigated the adoption process, and I'm delighted to say that Dawson (now named Lenny) is a beloved member of our family  well cared-for and so grateful for the love he receives. I cant say enough positive things about CPR. I am so proud to be affiliated with such a wonderful, well-run organization. 
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320772	1	/users/profile/413676	AuntSherry	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2017	Best rescue group for the true dog lover. Carolina Poodle Rescue takes in many dogs that are too old or too sick to be considered adoptable. All dogs are rehabilitated to the highest possible level. Dogs are adopted only after careful screening by volunteer adoption counselors.  My husband and I have adopted three Poodles from this group, and we were amazed at the number and commitment of the volunteers.  Carolina Poodle Rescue's (a no-kill organization) mission is to place dogs in homes that cherish animals, so that the animal can live out its life with a loving family. 
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320771	1	/users/profile/413683	Faye4	Client Served	5	01/03/2017	I have adopted two standard poodles from CPR, one eight years ago, the other three years ago.  They are a rescue that is all about the DOG, fully checking out prospective adopters and requiring a site visit to the farm to make the match.  The adoption contract provides that if the placement fails, the DOG comes back to CPR.  I was so impressed by their attitude and operations that I became a donor and  then a volunteer.  Whether you are in a situation where you must rehome a much loved pet or looking to add a fur baby to your family, Carolina Poodle Rescue may be the right place for you.  You may find their process too much, but it helps if you keep in mind that they have a commitment to each animal to find a great, loving, permanent placement.  This organization is committed to stopping irresponsible breeding and overpopulation of pet quality animals.  Their  motto is "One by one, until there are none."  My dogs and I think they're the greatest!

We could not be happier with everything CPR did to make sure that my mom's home was in fact a good home for a rescue dog as well as making sure they matched my mom with the dog that was perfect for her! My father passed this year as well has my mom's last rescue dog. My mother has a few limitations in mobility after suffering a stroke, and desperately wanted a companion. Princess Moxie is a calm, gentle senior dog who loves nothing more than  to snuggle in my mom's lap. What a blessing she is to us!! Thank you CPR, Donna Ezzell and Merrie Likes!

CPR does an excellent job of vetting prospective owners to ensure you are adopting the right dog for your situation. Although I have poodles, CPR pretty much takes any dog in need regardless of breed. They are a no kill facility and have dozens of SOS dogs that are unadoptable and live on the farm. I  think very highly of the Director, Donna Ezzell, the staff and the work they do. Over 580 dogs were placed this year.  CPR has a Facebook presence and that page provides support from other adopters and staff; you don't just adopt, you join the CPR family. I am proud to be associated with them.

Both of our adoptions were of dogs with issues (resource guarding/bite history on first and heart problems on second). CPR was thorough in the adoption process and follow up. The community of adopters that we follow online is like family to us. Being part of the extended CPR family renews my faith in humanity as they all pull together to rescue, transport, care for and find homes for these dogs. 
Carolina Poodle Rescue	320764	4	/users/profile/413675	poodlecamper	Donor	5	01/03/2017	I regularly donate to Carolina Poodle Rescue because their philosophy fits in with mine. I love dogs and especially poodles. They are a no kill shelter who rescue and nurse back to health dogs who need a home whether it's due to abandonment or an owners change of circumstance, etc. Health needs are addressed, and a dogs emotional needs are addressed, until a dog is transformed and the right home is found.  They are transparent in their actions and are like a gigantic dog loving family whether you become an adopter, an active volunteer or a sponsor. 
Carolina Poodle Rescue	319776	3	/users/profile/411616	Writer	Client Served	1	12/04/2016	I tried to adopt a poodle five years ago, but despite having owned three standards, all living to ripe old ages, I was told I "did not qualify." The reason? I had not neutered them (I had hoped to breed the oldest, and did just once, and the other had health issues that precluded the need or stress for the surgery -- but CPR did not care for the reason). I was also told it was inappropriate that we sometimes let them run around in our fenced yard (we have four acres in the mountains). I found their attitude perplexing, as well as patronizing and condescending. I ended up buying another puppy, as our eldest passed away, and am very happy to love another poodle for its whole life, but we would have given a loving and safe home home to an adopted poodle, had CPR not been so benighted and backwards in their views.

We chose CPR over other rescue organizations because of the ethical and loving care they provide to their rescued dogs and because of the life-long commitment they offer to all of the dogs that are welcomed to their sanctuary. They willingly take-on difficult to place dogs and provide the love and care that these dogs need to find their forever-homes including the option of permanent sanctuary at Dreamweaver Farm or in foster care. I follow this organization through their newsletter and website and am heartened by the the stories of the loving matches that have occurred and the compassion and dignity that is shown to the dogs that are difficult to place.

They are an extraordinary organization. Not only do they do an excellent job matching dogs with familes but they also raise money to get dogs who have special needs the surgery or treatment that they need. Most recently they did a campaign to get cataract surgery for 17 dogs who were blind. Many of these dogs wouldn't have been able to find a home without the surgery. That is just one of many stories of how Carolina Poodle Rescue has helped dogs in need and gotten them the care they required so that they could find homes and live happy lives. They are also a haven for elderly dogs or dogs who have very little chance of being adopted. They are committed to giving these dogs the best life possible and seek out sponsor for these special needs dogs. Can't adopt? Virtually adopt and help a special needs dog have a safe and cared for life at Dreamweaver Farms.

Carolina Poodle Rescue	245571	5	/users/profile/243884	SecretMagnolia	Donor	5	06/18/2015	Every once in a while, someone like the recent critical reviewer appears. I have volunteered at CPR for years now, and yes, I put my money where my mouth is. I have adopted and fostered from CPR over the years, and I have seen two have a happy end-of-life experience in my home before they crossed the Rainbow Bridge; both had been abandoned by their previous owners on busy highways before CPR saved them from a certainly horrible death. I've had two who were toothless, and one of my current herd of five is blind and deaf and crippled.  So, I think I have some experience with CPR that far outweighs the occasional pot-shot from some disgruntled person. The practices and policies at CPR are professional and extensive. Our rescues are not given away on a whim or without an extensive application process. I've often said that the adoption policies for international children from third world nations could benefit from the lessons of the thorough adoption policies at CPR. The network of volunteers, the caregivers on staff, and the director herself give daily of themselves with a goal of putting these animals as our first priority. And, I certainly don't see any of us getting wealthy in currency for our efforts. But I assure you, we are richer and happier as human beings, unlike the sad person who just wasted time on an unfounded and undeserved negative review from an organization that certainly earns its respect in the animal rescue community nationally as a model for excellence.

It is CLEAN and properly managed and organized. The kennel-based rescue is situated in a rural area on a massive, double-fenced farm of pastures and gentle rolling hills. CPR, also known as Dreamweaver Farm, has outstanding business and animal practices AND committed well-done, experienced policies for adoption, rehabilitation, fostering and sanctuary/covenant care for the rescues. CPR is a place to respect and honor with its trained director, all-volunteer board of directors, caregivers and volunteers. The rescue has an excellent reputation that has been earned since inception. In the past two years, I have adopted three pets from CPR, and I both foster and transport for CPR. In addition, I have worked for animal care in SC for 40 years, and I lead a movement that changed state laws assuring humane ways to destroy unwanted ones. So, I speak from a position of experience about this rescue.

The only helpful thing about her review is, it shows how someone with no knowledge of an organization can write anything, even nasty outright lies, and have it published online. We have adopted two dogs from CPR over the past five years. We have several friends who have adopted from CPR. We have seen how the staff and volunteers have taken in seemingly hopeless, abandoned dogs AND prepared them to find homes. Not just homes, but homes where a dog will thrive. Hoarders? I think not. I donate to CPR and am proud to do so. I can only assume that Doggiemama tried to adopt from CPR and was turned down, for good reason.

Let me tell you my experiences with CPR. Our standard poodle, Angel, was born with two bad hips. At only two years Angel needed total hip replacement. CPR raised over five thousand dollars and she got her new hip. Now she runs like the wind. In total we have adopted five standard poodles. I love this organization. Several others like myself are leaving their estates to CPR. I think that speaks volumes.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	245520	6	/users/profile/332697	JenChenette	Volunteer	5	06/17/2015	I am writing in response to the negative comment by DoggieMomma - have you ever actually visited the farm?  I am a two time adopter from CPR - two crazy, loving standard poodles.  I am the 3rd and FINAL home for my 1st CPR dog.  My 2nd CPR dog came to the farm heartworm positive - they started treatment and after I adopted him I brought him back for his final treatment - I didn't have to pay a dime.   I also volunteered at CPR on several occasions before moving out of state.  I now help with adoptions remotely - because I wanted to continue to work with this organization who has made my life so much richer.  Donna is one of the most amazing women I know and has selflessly dedicated her LIFE to these dogs.   To call her a hoarder is a DISGRACE.  This is a NO KILL shelter.  This is a SANCTUARY for dogs who cannot be placed due to medical or behavioral issues.  Donna is an amazing matchmaker.   When I applied for my 1st CPR dog I had about a 45 minute phone interview with an adoptions counselor.  This isn't a local shelter where you pop in and pick out a dog and leave an hour later.  CPR has a very thorough screening process - which greatly benefits the adopters and ESPECIALLY the dogs themselves.   This process helps weed out the people who may not be a good fit or who may not truly be ready for the big task of dog ownership.    The staff at CPR is also amazing - they work long hours and are rewarded with love and kisses from these animals who had no where else to go.    And should I mention the Family and Friends Facebook page that is by invite only for new adopters?  It is composed of an amazing group of people who are with you every step of the way in caring for your new dog - or your old dog you have had for 10 years.  The advice and warmth is PRICELESS.    So in closing - anyone else who is reading this - beware of anonymous comments - people don't have the courage to say who they are and why they are complaining.  They are just trying to slander a wonderful organization and it's a shame.

This is an incredibly fine organization that does the right thing for adopters, people that foster and, most importantly, for the dogs. They are completely transparent - nothing to hide. They give animal rescue a good name. Maybe Doggiemama was turned down, or has some other ax to grind, but whatever the reason, please note that unlike others who have written reviews, "Doggiemama"  is anonymous and as such obviously has no facts to support their absurd claim.

I have never met a group of people that care more about the animals than this one. This is not a hoarding situation.  The farm is big and Donna (the director) has set it up as a wonderful place for dogs -- some that are not adoptable will live out their lives at a wonderful place --with great people that play with them, feed them, and let them romp around in big fenced in fields. And other lucky dogs are adopted out  -- but the process is very particular. It is important to ensure that the dogs are going to a good home.  A forever home.  I challenge you to find a better rescue with better people than this one.

I would be glad to discuss any of your concerns directly.  Please feel free to email me at donna@carolinapoodlerescue.org.   For your allegations, please note that year to date we have placed over 200 dogs and I believe we will finalize 2015 with around 500 adoptions total.  We will come very close to the 5,000 total adopted mark this year, counting back to our inception in 2000.   I would think these numbers speak for themselves.  It is hard to be a hoarder when you're placing them as quickly as prudent screening will allow.  Last week alone, 20 dogs went to forever homes from our farm.   Each home is screened and there is a set of criteria that we use that has worked for us for many years.  We do not adopt to just anyone who walks in and can not be everything to all people.   We also offer a long term sanctuary program to dogs that are unadoptable due to age, temperament or health.  No dog is euthanized at our farm for space.  Hence, yes I do a good bit of fundraising.  Caregiving for as many as we have is not cheap.   For all of our dogs, we offer a safe place to wait until the perfect home can be found no matter how long that may take.   I welcome you to come and be part of the solution to Save Them All.  It can be done if we all work together.

Carolina Poodle Rescue	236967	5	/users/profile/321211	Karen-Marie A.	Volunteer	5	01/17/2015	The issue reviewer wc0476 raises has proponents in both camps. Ive read of some shelters that do permit a trial period for all the reasons the reviewer has stated.  Others focus less on the adopters and more on the dogs who have often been moved numerous times and are waiting for someone to make a permanent commitment to them. The staff at Carolina Poodle Rescue spends significant time and effort getting to know their dogs before listing them for adoption. Medical and/or behavioral problems are addressed before a dog is placed. The trained volunteers fostering some of the dogs evaluate their charges and the dog's individual issues (if any). As someone who has fostered dogs for them, Ive been expected to let staff know how my foster dogs are doing in a multi-dog household and the type of permanent situation I would recommend for them. The time involved in getting to know the dogs is balanced by the time spent by potential adopters in completing the adoption process and by the adoption counselors who work with them. Despite the effort that is made to make a perfect match, peoples circumstances change and Carolina Poodle Rescue will assume the responsibility of finding another home or providing sanctuary for dogs that are returned. As an aside, I am the mother of three adopted children. For none of them were we offered a trial period of adoption.  My youngest daughter was four-years-old at the time of her adoption. We had seen her picture but not even met her. Part of the process of adoption is the commitment the adopter is willing to make.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	203565	3	/users/profile/265545	wc0476	Client Served	1	06/24/2014	On June 21, 2014, I filled out the on-line application with CPR to adopt a dog. CPR sent me an e-mail that they received my application and were reviewing it. I responded that I would like to take the dog on a trial adoption for a week or two and visit their facility. CPR responded that they would not do trial adoptions. This was not acceptable to me for the following reasons:-	I think I would be extremely foolish to adopt any pet without having a trial period. This is a 15 year investment and I must thoroughly check out any dog that is going to live with me that long. I at least need to take the dog to my vetinarian and let her examine the dog and be able to return the dog if serious problems are found. Adopting a dog is a huge financial and emotional investment and commitment.-	The dog is not a child. Even these adoption agencies allow for a trial period. Adopting a child is much more serious than adopting a dog.-	I have worked with pet adoption agencies before and they were all much friendlier than CPR and more willing to work with me. The other agencies were more focused on finding a good home for their animals than on their personal convenience as CPR seems to be. I would think that CPRs focus would be on finding a good home for their animals but apparently CPR has other ideas in mind. I can only wonder how many animals CPR has placed where the adoption did not work out very well and the owner would like to have returned the pet but could not because they were not allowed a trial period and to return the pet.-	I wish I had known CPRs policy before I spent so much time on their application and contacting my neighbors. I suggest that CPR clearly write their no return policy at the beginning of their application to better inform future people who may think of applying with them. -	I found the CPR staff to be very demanding and uncompromising in their dealings with me. Its their way or the highway. I sent them an e-mail stating that their conditions were not acceptable and asked them to destroy my application which they said they did.  No, I do not recommend this adoption agency.

We got our first standard 10 years ago from a different rehoming site (and he is a wonderful 15-1/2 year old dog). We have searched CPR website intermittently for the past 3 years and submitted an application finally a year ago.  The volunteer adoption specialist was amazing back in January.   We weren't ready then, but we kept checking the website.   Then in august we were ready, but only if there was a perfect fit for our elder dog, our kids and family.  CPR is great with thus.  They want 100% fit.  On the website we fell in love with a certain dog but the volunteers told us with our busy family this dog had separation anxiety and not a good fit.  I appreciate the honesty and respect and love they have for their dogs for proper placement.   Once at the farm the volunteers were amazing to let us (elder dog and kids and all) meet many standard poodles.  We found our perfect fit to complete our family.  We will definitely be donating to this organization and will definitely go through them in the future.

Carolina Poodle Rescue	187588	2	/users/profile/192917	Earline Phillips	Volunteer	5	11/02/2013	Shortly after my first adoption from Carolina Poodle Rescue I wrote a review from an adopters point of view.  Now I would like others to know this organization from my roll as a volunteer. There have been those that have made applications that were not approved and I am sure some of those have been disappointed. Any time there is a question the applicants always get an opportunity to explain and work through the problem.  This is done because some of these dogs come from deplorable conditions and no one wants them to go into a home where they will not thrive. That is not good for the family or the dog. We also do not want them returned as it is not good for the dog to be bounced around. The dog and the family are matched as to family conditions and temperament of the dog as best as possible. The people that foster or run the kennel try to get an understanding of the dog and do the best that they can to inform the adopter of any problem the dog has. We have counselors that screen the applications and converse with the applicant, there are people that foster dogs until the right home is found, people are scattered all over that pull dogs from shelters that are on the kill list and transport them to a proper place, a person that keeps track of information and distributes this to the proper volunteers, so many other jobs that are needed to keep this organization going. All of these people are non paid and have only one goal.  That is to rescue and find good homes for these dogs. Training is given to those that volunteer and have to be approved. Dogs are not put up for adoption just to get rid of them, in fact dogs that are not adoptable have a home for life with proper care. I work along several other rescue groups and they do the best they can but their method of securing homes for their animals can not compare to Carolina Poodle Rescue.  The interest of the dog is primary otherwise why would someone like myself spend thousands of dollars and devote all the time I can give to help? For a person to appreciate what Carolina Poodle Rescue does they have to see the whole picture as I do. I will work and help this organization as long as possible.

I had always purchased my poodles as pups, but since we are very much older seniors, I did not want a puppy but had to have another poodle.  I found the process this organization has to qualify adopters was much superior than most.  The care they give their dogs and other animals is excellent and loving.  I can't tell you how many volunteers work with this group  giving their time and money.  I glady give my time and money when needed.  Once you start helping you can not stop if you care about animals.  I can not praise this organization and the volunteers enough. I have adopted a Yorkie and taken a 14 year old toy poodle that needed a home also have fostered two poodles. I would do more if possible as this organization holds my heart.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	187565	1	/users/profile/244588	Libby3	Client Served	5	11/02/2013	I have adopted two toy poodles from CPR and both experiences have been excellent.  CPR is very careful to assure that adopters are throughly vetted to assure each dog goes to a home that will care for them for the rest of their life.  They don't put dogs in just any home to get rid of them.  During my first adoption I was impressed that my little one would always be a CPR dog and have a home for life if something happened and I could no longer care for her.  As an older, single person that means a lot that my best friend will be cared for with love if I am no longer able to do that.Not every dog is adoptable but they all have a home for their natural life through CPRs Sanctuary Care.I have recommended CPR to anyone I meet looking for a special dog looking for a good home.  The adoption counselors are skilled in matching the right dog with the right family for the best possible outcome.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	187562	1	/users/profile/244585	Kim_115	Client Served	5	11/02/2013	I did not adopt a poodle, but what I found at CPR was a big, sweet, 130 lb. St Bernard!  After being declined by several rescue organizations after I told them I needed a large dog to train for mobility service, CPR was the ONLY one who had the courage and heart to take a chance on me.  I thank God every day that they did, because my big Zak has rescued ME as much as I did him.  Rescue and rehab dogs come with their own baggage, and all it takes is love and patience to help them shed it to become the wonderful dog that is hiding inside.  After 5 months of being together, we are still learning about each other, but he is now my best friend and constant mobility companion, and also volunteers once a month to visit developmentally disabled kids. CPR is very thorough before allowing adoption, so I can only guess that any disgruntled reviewers must have been declined for some reason, and were upset.  YES CPR does rehome dogs....as many times as needed to find that forever match.  They DO try very hard to make it work the first time, but even they can't predict some things.   IF it doesn't work out, you are under contract to return the dog to them so they can re-evaluate it and begin screening a new family that would be a better fit.  Thankfully they have one of the LOWEST returned animal rates in the country!  And if they don't feel the dog can be safely rehomed, then it is placed into the sanctuary area there, where it can live out its life in love and comfort. I started as an adopter... but because I received such great treatment from them, and I wanted to give back some way, I also became a temp foster home for them, and now also volunteer with the team.  CPR has been wonderful to partner with, by screening dogs for our service and therapy dog programs.  We provide free evaluations on any CPR dogs that they believe may take well to service or therapy work.  Together as a team, we will continue to help our communities and keep more dogs out of the shelters!

Of course we were screened first. They called the vet, groomer, and references to make sure we would be good parents. As we were looking around. Daisy (an older white poodle) came up to my daughter and jumped up on her. It was like she chose us!  We talked to Donna and she warned us that Daisy could get a little aggressive at times, especially if backed into a corner.   We still decided to adopt her. She fit in amazingly well with our family and 2 other pets (a cocka-poo and terri-doodle). We were patient and loving and any aggressive signs were no longer present. I think she felt at home and settled in.  I felt like all the bases were covered before our adoption and can't believe that someone would say that CPR would adopt out problem pets without informing perspective pet parents. Donna was very upfront and honest with us.  Adopting from CPR was a great experience and I encourage anyone who is looking for a pet to contact them!

We still had a standard that was  my husband's baby but I was ready for my new furbaby. After filling out the application I recieved a call from one of their "caseworkers" and we talked for about one and a half hours. Sue asked me many questions that would affect the dog's health and happiness as well as that of our current poodle and my husband and myself. Then we waited to see if they thought  they had a poodle that was right for our family. We finally got a call and an appointment to visit the farm. We were shown around the entire farm and introduced to any of the dogs we particularly showed an interest in. After our tour we were asked if there was anyone that we wanted more time with and they also suggested Kyle as having the personality like I was looking for. (I was interested in a poodle that could be trained as a therapy dog.) There was a beautifully groomed poodle named Ginger that I was also interested in. We went in a small enclosed porch with Ginger and Kyle and Kyle chose me. We had been encouraged to bring our dog with us and brought her on the porch with Kyle and they got along like littermates. Kyle came home with us that day and I could not be happier. He stays at my heels, passed obedience and therapy tests.          Carolina Poodle Rescue not only got us the dog we wanted, but Sue had made sure with her questions that our place was right for their standard poodle. We saw with our tour that they care for the wellbeing of the animals in their care. We first found out about this rescue two and a half years ago when we got Kyle. We think highly enough of the volunteers there that we donate monthly and give extra as we feel we can. They asked for Pack N Plays for their puppies and for seniors so I have gotten several at yard sales along with other supplies. They are a no kill shelter so they use the Pack N Plays for the little blind seniors to sleep together when they are not out.           This is a firstclass non-profit organization and in my opinion, if anyone has a problem with them it is because they were not accepted by the "caseworker," they didn't take the time and patience that is required with any new animal  coming into your home, or didn't understand that some of these furbabies have been through a horrible existence in the first part of their life and need special acceptance to understand that they now have their own people that are going to teach them to love.        A group of volunteers at the rescue that frequently are forgotten are the transporters. Kyle was found in Virginia and after looking for the owners, transporters use their time and money to pass the dogs from one volunteer to another as they drive the many miles to safely and lovingly care for the dogs  to get them to the farm.                I will definitely adopt again from Carolina Poodle Rescue. They care!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	187422	2	/users/profile/244436	willywaylon	Client Served	5	11/01/2013	When my rescue toy poodle passed away, I was not ready to adopt another so I volunteered at the Carolina Poodle Rescue. I wanted to be "around" poodles but not necessarily adopt one. I saw that it was a nice, clean facility and that every person who worked there was really nice to the animals. They didn't just work there because there was no other place to work in that particular city out in the countryside. I did what I could cleaning this and that, food bowls, water bowls, hugging scared dogs, throwing balls to the more active dogs etc. I did this for a few weeks and then my family asked when I was going to adopt another dog. This time they wanted a "real" dog, as in, not a toy poodle. I referred them to the webpage of adoptable dogs and told them to tell me which ones they were interested. They chose a brother pair of dogs that would only be adopted out together as they were "bonded." I sought the dogs the next time I went up there and one was much more outgoing than the other. I tried to be cool and not just fall in love with them so I told the CPR person that I wanted to drive home and bring back my stepson to see how they got along. This is a two hour roundtrip for me. So I drove home, picked up the kiddy, brought him up to the farm and we spent time with the dogs in a private adoption room and experimented with having a cat in the room since we have cats too. I sat with a toy poodle in my lap and the two other bigger "half poodle/half terrier" dogs were just so happy and curious but not barky, nervous or scared. We decided to take them home and the rest is history. They are the best dogs, friends, pals, pets ever. The CPR people were professional and have provided a lot of resources for being a responsible owner and share info with all the adopters about animal welfare and how to make the most of your pet ownership.  I would adopt from them again if I had room to!

Approved!  We took our time making the appt and one early cold Feb Saturday we arrived to a bust center with smiling faces! Our poodle picked us out immediately, we still looked at 5 others, but Pawley was OURS - she told us so!Now every time we see another available, I want them all, But I know that CPR is taking such good care of all their charges and we even help sponsor a fellow who will never leave CPR do to behavior issues, but I know he'll have a good , long, fun and most of all loving life!I have recommended all by friends to adopt here, and I hope if you are reading this review, you will too!

Carolina Poodle Rescue	187398	2	/users/profile/244409	Carol130	Donor	5	11/01/2013	I first got involved with Carolina Poodle Rescue in July of 2010. At that time, I was looking for a standard poodle. I had just lost my Lab of 14 years. I had always had littles, but wanted to try a standard...Donna matched me up with my dear "Rico." Since then I have been an adoption counselor, donor, foster parent and I spread the word at our PetSmart in Wilmington NC. We go thru a very involved adoption process. Our goal in doing this is to make sure the dog gets to its forever home, the first time that we place them. This works, our return rate is slim to none. Some people who are not use to being interviewed like this for a dog, may think its a bit overkill...we find this works for us and the numbers prove it. I recommend CPR to everyone.....They will always be a part of my life....
Carolina Poodle Rescue	187388		/users/profile/244395	churchpilot	Client Served	5	11/01/2013	When we lost our Standard Poodle to cancer, I started looking for a dog charity thinking I could channel some of my grief by volunteering.  I came across Carolina Poodle Rescue and found myself looking at their website everyday and reading about their dogs and their adoption stories.  Then I started looking deeper at the people involved...these are animal lovers, not just poodle lovers.  I was so taken at the different breeds of dogs that they willingly rescued.  When it finally felt right, we contacted CPR, passed the rigorous adoption pre-approval process and drove to Greer to meet and  hopefully bring home a Standard Poodle that would magically pick us as their parents.  When we got there, we were not bonding with any of the Standards, but we were drawn to two Labradoodles that had recently come in.  It was a bonded pair (brother and sister), but we only wanted one dog.  We tried separating them, but they went bonkers.  Donna in all her wisdom never told us that they would not allow the dogs to be separated...instead she let us come to the conclusion that these were our dogs and we left with both of them.  They are magnificent dogs and we love them so....separating them would have been cruel and CPR did what was right for these dogs.  
Carolina Poodle Rescue	187365		/users/profile/244364	Denise75	Client Served	5	11/01/2013	our family adopted two dogs from Carolina Poodle Rescue. We could not have been more pleased with the entire experience, and with the dogs. They work hard to ensure a good match with the family. They provide excellent support after adoption. They provide extensive screening before the adoption. It is so evident that these folks do what they do out of love for the dogs. One of the dogs we adopted is a special needs dog, as he's blind. We know that he was the perfect dog for us, yet we know that he would have had a forever home at Dreamweaver farm if no perfect home had been found for him. The care they provide for the dogs is impeccable, and includes extensive medical care when necessary. I look forward to the day when I can support this organization financially. In the meantime, I tell everyone I know about them and how proud I am to have dogs that came from there.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	187354	1	/users/profile/192849	Tracie P.	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	I have been volunteering on a weekly basis for more than a year and I have seen this organization from the inside.  I have been so impressed with the dedication of the staff, volunteers and supporters.  Many employees take dogs home with them on a regular basis and almost all of them have adopted from CPR.  Adoption counselors do a great job of matching dogs with adopters, taking into consideration the entire family and the needs of the dogs being placed.  On the rare occasion that it's not the right fit, they have a policy of always providing support including taking the dog back to be placed with another family if necessary.  I would highly recommend CPR to anyone looking to add a canine companion to their home.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	146157		/users/profile/192849	Tracie P.	Volunteer	5	12/07/2012	My 10 year old daughter, Kimberly got me into the Caroling Poodle Rescue family. Kimberly began volunteering this past summer, and because of her age, she needed me to stay by her side for safety. What I have witnessed has truly been a blessing.  Kimberly has a mild anxiety dissorder that sometimes makes it difficult to relate to those of us 2-legged animals. But we have discovered that she is right at home with the 4-legged folks. She has been to therapy and is medicated for her condition, but the biggest improvement has come over the past few months since she discovered CPR. I sincerely thank every CPR friend and family member and the wonderful staff at Dreamweaver Farm. The staff does a perfect job of making her feel "useful" by giving her a great blend of puppy playtime and meaningful chores.  I see first-hand how well these animals are loved and cared for.  I've watched them carefully screen adopters to look for just the right match.  I've seen them hold, hug and kiss the animals as if they are the most precious gift.  CPR doesn't just rescue and rehabilitate dogs. They do so much more.

My parents adopted a miniature poodle in 2009,and Petey is the light of my 88 year old father's life-and mom's too! Petey was rescued from a puppy mill ,and the care given to this little fellow by CPR was so compassionate. He was a scared, fearful , dirty and matted mess when he arrived at the rescue. My mom chose "Curley Bill" -his first name-because she said he needed her! I am convinced that this little dog has extended their lives as they take him to the beach, for rides in the car, to the bank for a cookie, and he has a massage before going to sleep in dad's chair.

They are not just interested in adopting out as many rescues as they can....they go the extra mile to make sure the pet and owner are a good match.

Most were older adults and gave us years of love and left a void after their deaths.  At present I have 3 younger dogs adopted from Carolina Poodle Rescue.  When I decided to adopt other dogs, my dog of choice was My Dog Of Choice....no one steered me to a particular dog.  I was free to visit all and make the choice of the one that would go home with me.   One of these 3 poodles I have at this time , one is a breeder 's retired female.  I was totally informed of the challenge she might be in rehabIng but I chose her in spite the challenge and I must admit it has been tough but it's working.  Thank you CPR for rescuing her for me to adopt her.  She is a jewel.  If not for CPR my life would be void of so much joy.I totally recommend Carolina Poodle Rescue to everyone I know and many I don't know personally.  If you adopt from Carolina Poodle Rescue you get as much history on you new family member as possible.  I am totally committed to this organization and it is the non profit organization of my choice above all others of which I have knowledge...bar none.  Go CPR, making dreams come true for others.

She had been rescued from a mobile home along with 20 other poodles and poodle mixes.  CPR took her in and cared for her until we completed the "adopter" application  and passed the test as an approved adopter...they just don't give pets to anyone...CPR makes sure they are placing a pet in a loving home and caring family.  Loretta was the most wonderful dog in the years she spent with us.  Next, we got Patsy who was turned in after having been adopted before.  You see, when you adopt from CPR you are required to return your pet to them in the event you release them...another requirement you must fulfill as an adopter.  We lost Loretta and Patsy last year.  Again we turned to CPR to fill the void in our home.  Now we have wonderful Emmie Lou...neglected by her previous owner.  Emmie Lou will not be my last adopted dog...when there is a another void in our family I will turn to CPR to fill the void.  I know any dog I get from them has been thoroughly checked for diseases, spayed or neutered and fully checked by a veterinarian.  I know what I am getting be cause Carolina Poodle Rescue does their absolute best in matching people and pets.  Carolina Poodle Rescue is at the top of my charity list and we support them.

Having adopted 2 puppy mill dogs from there, I can not say enough about the blessing these two guys have been for me.  Not only were they mistreated by human kind, they came with a lot of baggage.  Never had they seen grass, played with toys or even been bathed and groomed on a regular basis.  CPR changed that after a seizure of their former home by police and animal care and control experts.  CPR made a difference.  Sure, I had to fill out an application, have a counseling session and meet with the director before they came home with me.  All well worth it.  This is NOT an average rescue.  These people are committed to making a match to find forever homes for some dogs this is their last chance.  People must be truthful about the dog they want, just because they are cute read ALL the info posted about them.  Ask a lot of questions and make the commitment to be that dogs forever home.  They may not all be perfect dogs, but they sure are perfect for someone who will love them unconditionally.

All three of our CPR dogs are treasured members of our family.  When we adopted, CPR was very open about providing as much information about the dogs' past as possible-- including that one of the dogs was rehomed twice before, and the reason why.  This information has helped us with making the dog's transition smoother, and he has fully adjusted to our family.

Wasn't ready to get another one yet, but needed to do something in her memory.  What an operation!!  I've honestly never seen so many dedicated, knowledgeable, and caring people in my life as Director Donna Ezzell and her tireless team of associates.  They are amazing - doing absolutely whatever it takes to ensure as many furbabies as possible are saved, cared for, healed, and unconditionally loved.   Of course, it wasn't long before we adopted one of their rescues, a sweet little girl who had been abused by her original owners.  While she was still somewhat fearful when we got her, she had already improved by leaps and bounds while under CPR's care.  Now, about 3 yrs later, this little one loves all people, all animals, and absolutely cannot ever give enough kisses!   We, like many of the volunteers, are honored to donate monthly to CPR.  And the quality and kindness of those volunteers we've been fortunate enough to get to know are just an added bonus.  Wherever we go, I ALWAYS let folks know about Carolina Poodle Rescue - you simply could not ask for a better group to be associated with and to adopt from.

Carolina Poodle Rescue	147222		/users/profile/194475	Decoecho2000	Client Served	5	12/24/2012	My husband and I have adopted three dogs over the past years from CPR.  Each time, we drove from St. Louis, MO to South Carolina.  Our first was Olivia,  a Standard Poodle who was rescued from a puppy mill.  I had the joy of watching her grow into a self-assured, happy member of the family.  The second (Elsie)  was a Standard Poodle puppy who was born at the shelter (Momma dog was pregnant when she arrived).  Elsie was given the love, attention and training to make her a healthy, happy addition to our home.  Our third, Anni, was a rescue from a hoarding or puppy mill situation.  She was nursed back to health by Dreamweaver staff.  We are privileged to have her in our home and be able to watch her as she grows more confident in herself and her role in our "pack."  I have watched this organization grow and develop over the years.  The staff and volunteers are exceptional.  Each dog is evaluated, provided with necessary medical care, housed in appropriate quarters at Dreamweaver Farm, socialized, loved, and prepared for the time when they find their "forever home."   I have the greatest admiration and respect for Donna Ezell and the staff (both paid and unpaid) who go so far beyond expectations to rescue, rehabilitate and re-home the furbabies who need their help so desperately.  A first-class organization that deserves our support.
Carolina Poodle Rescue	146243		/users/profile/192959	Joan30	Client Served	5	12/08/2012	I am an international fan of Carolina Poodle rescue and have twice driven about 700 miles each way from Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, to adopt. In June 2010, I met a young woman at a local street festival called Woofstock, in Toronto with my two old black standard poodles in tow. She had the most gorgeous two-year black boy called Dante - calm and relaxed ever with the crowds, he looked just like my Simon. When I asked about the kennel she got him from she said, "no, I got him from Carolina Poodle Rescue in South Carolina two months ago"!!!! She described the thorough vetting and caring approach to the adoption - a good fit for a forever relationship between human and dog was the major outcome. In September, I decided to apply as Simon and Gypsy were 15 years old and I wanted to bring a new family member home while they were still able to help him adjust. When I was approved (through an interview with a marvellous volunteer in Florida! and checking my references) I started the drive south. Throughout the process, I kept mentioning that my preference was a black male because Simon was already living with two divas (Gypsy and me) - but at one point on the journey, I called Donna, the Director, and told the story of adopting Simon. All the other puppies were jumping all over me the way puppies do; he looked at me, sat under the kitchen table as I played with the others and finally came over to kiss my hand before returning to sit under the table. He had chosen me - and he was my best friend for the rest of his life. So when I arrived late one Friday night, Donna brought out the first dog - a female black and white parti! She hopped up on the chair, crossed her paws and analysed me from across the room. When I offered a treat, she came over, took the treat and went back to the chair. I saw a couple of other dogs, but when Donna told me that she had never done that before, I knew that SHE had picked me and we came home together. Fast forward eight months: Gypsy and Simon were both failing and I knew that I would be lucky to have them another six months. I went on the CPR website and saw a gorgeous sandy red giant teddy bear of a poodle. In May, we all drove down again (this time with my niece). Again it was love at first sight. We stayed a few days to volunteer at Dreamweaver Farm - caring for new puppies, cleaning up poop in the pouring rain, all the fun things that volunteers at shelters do to help these wonderful creatures that depend on us. When Simon became very ill, we headed home so that he could see his special park one last time. He rested his head on Rowan (the new redhead) all the way home. The people at CPR are some of the finest in my world at least - and in the world's of the hundreds of dogs they help every year. As I live in Canada, I cannot claim a tax receipt, but I donate to CPR anyway. I will be returning over the years just because I feel so at home there. CPR is an outstanding organization, thanks to the leadership of Donna Ezzell. It's motto is one that should define how we deal with all of the vulnerable creatures we meet through life: One by one until there are none. 
Carolina Poodle Rescue	146193	2	/users/profile/192894	Tina McNee	Client Served	5	12/07/2012	My first experience with Carolina Poodle Rescue began in January 2012. We drove 750 miles through 8 states with my 7 little special needs geriatrics in tow. This is when we met our Max, a two year old apricot Standard Poodle that was an owner surrender with a request for euthanasia because he was special needs. In April we adopted Jake, a 5 year old Chocolate Standard Poodle with the same special need as Max. They both have Addison's. Jake's family tearfully surrendered him to CPR. Both of our boys have had extreme reductions in medications and are now at very low doses. They are so happy and healthy that you'd never even be able to tell that they had medical conditions! We didn't stop at two Standards. in July, Fitzgerald, a 5 year old White Standard joined our family and as a surprise, Double, a 6 year old Red Standard came along too! They are Beautiful and a joy. CPR, it's staff, members and volunteers are all top notch and priority one is the dogs. It is more than an organization, it truly is a family!!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	146188	1	/users/profile/192888	Catherine27	Client Served	5	12/07/2012	What really drew my boyfriend and I to Carolina Poodle Rescue (other than the poodles) is the fact that their animals live on a farm with plenty of space to run and play.  Besides sleeping in crates, they are not confined to small spaces almost 24/7.  They are also well-socialized and temperament tested.  I was a nervous first-time adopter, especially since the process can be very daunting with rescues...but CPR enthusiastically and quickly got me through the screening process.  They didn't make me feel like I was incompetent or some psycho trying to get a hold of one of their dogs.  I had such a great feeling about the CPR staff that, once approved, my boyfriend and I traveled over 7 hours to CPR from Virginia to meet with their sweet poodles.  Instead of having to look and ask to meet some of the animals, they got to know what we were looking for in a pet and brought in LOTS of dogs for us to, well, play with!  I was unsure I was going to find the right dog that day, but they brought in a former stray they had only had for about two weeks to help socialize her...and we knew she was the one.  I continue to keep in touch with this wonderful rescue and its large family via Facebook and know that my next poodle will most likely come from CPR.  Thank you CPR for my sweet Winnie!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	146168		/users/profile/192866	redrider513	Client Served	5	12/07/2012	Carolina Poodle Rescue has brought me two Poodles who other wise might have been destroyed.  These dogs have changed my life. Carolina Poodle Rescue rescues dogs from all over the East coast and beyond from shelters who cannot keep the dogs for whatever reason and might have been put down. When they get the dogs (at their own expense) they have them looked at by their vet and make sure they are in good health.  If not, they will care for the dog until it is well.  They also have the dog neutered. At that time they will attempt  to find a forever home for the dog.  They are very particular in where the dogs go.  Their adoption process is very strict as they desire the dogs  are going to the very best possible place for them to thrive in a loving atmosphere, sometimes for the first time in their lives.

Carolina Poodle Rescue	146153		/users/profile/192844	moda	Volunteer	5	12/07/2012	When I was looking at several rescue organizations for a poodle to adopt, this group responded immediately. I went through what I thought was a thorough adoption application process. When I drove 3 states away for the first meeting, all went as had been explained. They took into consideration my expectations, desires, household activity level and brought out 4 or 5 dogs to sniff and mingle with us. What turned out to be a wonderful standard poodle chose my 9 yr old lab, my husband and me for his home. We returned (after the labrador died) so we could maintain the 2 dog household and a dear female those to leave with us. Donna Ezzell is phenomenal and she gathers volunteers who are just as invested as she. I only wish I I felt like my dog capacity was unlimited and could take more off her hands right now!!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	146150	1	/users/profile/192840	Karen150	Client Served	5	12/07/2012	Louise had lived in four places before me. She was only 20 months old, skinny and timid. But I could see a young girl who was waiting for the transformation of a lifetime. Not only was Louise in a desperate situation, so was her sister LuLu. Thanks to Carolina Poodle Rescue (CPR) in Pacolet, South Carolina, Louise and LuLu found their "fur-ever homes." Today, Louise travels wtih me to help promote reading and writing to students as part of my "author life." LuLu is a service dog for the lovely lady who adopted her. Without CPR, these beautiful, smart poodles likely would have died. In fact, a CPR volunteer took them from another shelter because the people working there feared that both would die. When they were given up for adoption, they quit eating, drinking, and would only lie on the floor -- totally bereft and scared. Their story is just one of the hundreds of happy stories that emerge from CPR each day, each month, each year. The staff and volunteers with CPR are angels on Earth who literally go the extra mile to help dogs and people in need. Louise has brought so much joy to me and the thousands of students whom we visit every year. We also take Canine Freestyle Dancing, and Louise and I visit an area nursing home regularly where the elderly residents adore her. Without CPR, my life would be dull indeed ... and, for Louise -- I can't begin to imagine what would have happened to her. She is a blessing in my life and in the lives of many others!
Carolina Poodle Rescue	146145		/users/profile/192837	purplejupo	Volunteer	5	12/07/2012	I have been fostering poodles and donating to this group for years.  They do the best job at screening potential adopters, making sure the poodle will have a safe, loving home. They do great care to make sure the personality of the poodle will fit with the family's lifestyle.  My boyfriend and I visited there recently.  He wanted a small poodle he could carry around and who would play fetch and tug with him.  We adopted Ziva, who is exactly what we wanted.  She loves to be held and carried.  But she also loves to play with toys and run and play with my standard poodle.  She plays fetch and tug like we wanted.     If CPR finds out about a homeless poodle, even if it's far away, they find a way to get it to their Dreamweaver Farm to prepare it for adoption.  They also provide a sanctuary for poodles who can't be adopted.  None are ever euthanized.  They can live out the rest of their lives there.  
Carolina Poodle Rescue	68930		/users/profile/75319	Shasher	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	This charity is absolutely amazing. I am the proud dad or 2 poodles.

The people care for the animals it's not just a job it's a love and you can tell in the way the dogs love people back.  Donna Ezzell the Director can take a thin shy puppy mill throw away and turn it into a great family pet!!! I tell everyone how much Carolina Poodle Rescue means to me and that if they want a dog (or cat they have a few of those too) or have donations or just want to play with the dogs to go to the FARM that's right acres of dogs playing and having fun...

The work this club does is incredible and incredibly important. What stood out most to me about this particular Boys and Girls Club was how completely dedicated the staff members were to what matters the most--the kids. Every thing this club does is for the kids. They genuinely went above and beyond to provide this service to Florence, SC, and I could tell even during one short week there that the afternoons the boys and girls spent at the club were truly impactful and formative. I learned a ton from everyone I met here that week--The Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area are truly a great nonprofit.

The clubs serve as a safe place for children to learn and play.  The staff serves as role models that many of the children do not have at home.  My first experience with this organization was 12 years ago when I was volunteering for the Junior League of Florence.  After talking to a 2nd grade club member I learned he was hungry because he was one of 6 children that lived with an unemployed single mother and he was being bullied at school (kids were taking his free breakfast and lunch).  The club was the only place he was being fed and felt truly safe.  Every child deserves to be fed and feel safe in order to excel in life, and B&GC of the Pee Dee is leading the way in our area to fulfill this need.

This is evident in all of the after-hours time they put in, the dollars they donate and most of all the accolades from the kids.  As a board we often hear moving testimony from the youth served and it always involves at least one staff member that the child really felt was a mentor to them.

Boys & Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area, Inc.	231129	2	/users/profile/294732	meaghan9310	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	What an incredible experience working with the Boys and Girls Club of Pee Dee. Not only do the staff members care so much about the kids, but they make volunteering there a great experience as well. Our group was coming to the Boys and Girls Club for a spring break service trip, and while we knew we would be staying the week at the Boys and Girls Club we had no idea how above and beyond the board of directors, site administrators, and staff members would go to make us feel at home. We all brought sleeping bags with an understanding that we would be sleeping each night on the floor, but upon arriving the board members and site administrators told us they had rounded up cots and blow up mattresses for us to sleep on-- along with more snacks and food than we knew what to do with! Each day we would help around the club (painting, cleaning up, etc) and then when the kids would arrive we would get to play with them and it was wonderful. Often, when volunteering at various organizations, volunteers are given little direction or are given small, menial tasks  to stay occupied. The Boys and Girls Club was not like this at all as they fully integrated us with their program and fundraising efforts-- like a BBQ fundraiser where we helped to cook and distribute food. The Club has made an incredible impact in these kids lives-- in giving them mentors to look up to, educational direction, access to healthy food every day, and a place that is safe and fun for them to grow as youth.

The children that attend this Boys and Girls Club location are so smart and wonderful to be around. It is clear that these children benefit from their time at the organization and that the staff works their hardest to help each individual child reach their full potential. The Boys and Girls Club of the Pee Dee Area is an admirable organization and I send them all of my best wishes!
Boys & Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area, Inc.	229581	2	/users/profile/293231	Nicole110	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	The Boys and Girls Club of the Pee Dee Area is truly a remarkable place. I had the wonderful opportunity of leading a trip of Boston College volunteers during the spring break of 2013. During this week, we were able to volunteer at  the BGC and assist with landscaping, cleaning and planning activities for the children. When it was our time to leave at the end of the week, I can honestly say that there were tears in my eyes. The interactions between the staff and children were so nurturing and compassionate. The individuals at the BGC truly care about one another in a way that I believe is unique to this specific club. I was able to speak with and get to know Susan, Neal, Decar, Michael and Justin, to name a few, and I have the utmost respect for them all. They were all so hospitable to the BC students and made us feel welcomed into their community. I am eager to get back to Florence to see the club again, but it brings me great happiness to keep in touch with the club. I cannot speak highly enough of this organization and the work that they do for the children of the Pee Dee area.

Their programming focuses on growing the whole child, not just an educational or physical program.  This organization puts every hard earned dollar (donations and grants) to good use and continues to grow.  I started as a volunteer 10 years ago through the Junior League of Florence when we helped once a month with Birthday parties and continued as we built the healthy eating programming.  I am proud to be a part of such a well run and deserving non-profit.

Staff members work with the young adults through a variety of programs that help prepare them for future school and employment endeavors.  Most impressive is one of the High School youths speak to the Board in segments at the meetings.  Also, learning or experiencing some of the success stories of the youth that return from college and they actually state how much they appreciated the BGCPD and what a difference it made in their lives!   Testimonies are the best!

Constantly amazed at the commitment that all staff members have for the kids that are served.  Without the BGC, many of these kids would not be touched or influenced by such high role models.  It makes a difference and is seen when Alumni come back to the Pee Dee area to live their adult lives and in turn make a contribution back to the community in which they grew up in!
Boys & Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area, Inc.	133675	1	/users/profile/179419	wjhjr	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	The Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area make a difference.  Without this stellar organization, there are thousands of kids that would have no where to go after school or during the summer.  It is not a "Baby Sitting" service.  Instead the BGC mentors these kids.  They are helped with basic eduational skills as well as very valuable life/social skills that are instrumental in the world today.  The staff at all the clubs are positive role models.  In fact, several of the Pee Dee Area Clubs have former Boys and Girls club members now on staff.  What a testament to the continuation of providing service to the area which you live within.  What a difference the club and its staff make!

I have judged their Youth of the Year contest and have been impressed by the confidence the contestants have had in front of people who they have never met. I have seen them perform at our community events with a self-confidence my own children did not show at that age. The Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee are making a difference in each child's live that attend regularly.

The staff is excellent and reinforces to the club kids that they are respected and valued and have  a contribution to make to society and they are encouraged to find their gifts and talents and to persue goals for the future.   Kids lives are transformed as they participate.  The Board is striving to enable the club to expand its reach in Florence and the surrounding community in the future.  Help us with this vision by volunteering and come visit the club to see it in action!
Boys & Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area, Inc.	133734		/users/profile/179487	Erik4	Board Member	5	11/05/2012	 The Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area impacts the lives of hundreds of children in our community year -round.  Adult mentors form relationships with the kids based on  level of respect and accountibility and a desire to grow and to mature.  Male staff are particularly important to our children that need a "father figure" role model in their lives.  A small donation goes a long way to transforming childrens' lives.  Once you visit the club and see the face of the kids, you will realize the critical importance of the club.  Go, visit and you may be transformed into a vounteer of financile supporter of the club.

They serve a portion of our Florence community that need assistance in the worst way.  Over 70% of the households have one parent or less, and are considered to be living below the poverty line.  Without the positive influence of the Clubs in our member lives, I'm not sure where these children would end up in society. The good news is that because of the staff and the solid educational programs they provide, these children have a fighting chance to better their lives and the lives of those around them.  To my knowledge there is not an organization that is more influential in children's lives than our Boys and Girls Clubs.

I've also been on numerous other non-profit boards during the same time period.  By far, The Boys and Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee is the most outstanding organization that I've been involved in.  The staff and the programs that they provide are second to none.  Most importantly, the Clubs are life changing and life saving in a number of situations.  They provide an environment that is safe, educational, and non-judgmental.  The majority of the children that attend the Clubs need a positive influence in their lives and that's exactly what the Clubs accomplish. The impact on these children is immeasureable.  There is nothing more incredible to hear than when we get an opportunity to listen to one of the members explain what the organization means to them and their family.   I will remain on the Board as long as they will have me and I can try to help them achieve their mission.

Boys & Girls Clubs of the Pee Dee Area, Inc.	131555		/users/profile/177119	Robert62	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	This is the greatest secret in non-profits in the Greater Pee Dee area of South Carolina.   As a board member for more than 5 years, I have seen first hand the good that is being done. Not only in Florence but in the other clubs coming under the Pee Dee banner.  Kids from Florence, Darlington, Timmonsville, Pamplico, Hemmingway, and Marion benefit from the leadership of Pee Dee organization. Most of these towns are small with little help for at risk children.   The Boys and Girls Clubs provide a stable experience where the kids are followed for their grades and school attendance.   The kids are provided programs to enhance their lives and would not be available to them through any other source in their community.  One such program this year was the opportunity for about 20 of the youth to learn to play golf.  This program was through the PGA's golf outreach program.  The 20 sets of clubs were given to the Club for use by other kids. One of many programs brought to at risk kids by the Boys and Girls Clubs.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260729	8	/users/profile/349315	debikittle,	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I have done quite a bit of volunteering for various animal/pet causes, and I have to say Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary is amazing!  Mac Curry, the founder, has such a passion for wildlife that it is contagious--of course, those of us who volunteer are already dedicated animal lovers.  Mac's number one priority is the safety of the animals, and makes sure volunteers understand the importance in keeping the stress level as low as possible for the wild creatures in her care.  No one is "turned loose" and told to do a task that they have not been thoroughly, hands on and supervised, trained to do.  This protects our safety as volunteers, but also protects the animals from injury and undue stress.  I began volunteering with Paws about 2 years ago, as a face painter to help with fundraising at our booths for events.  I make handmade jewelry and sell some at our booths to help with fundraising as well.  I have learned so much just from listening to Mac and our more experienced volunteers talk about the animals and what Paws does to help them, answering questions asked by the public.  We bring only non-releasable animals to public events, and Mac pays close attention to their body language to assure that no one is kept on display too long to tire the animals or stress them too much.  Volunteers are trained how to properly handle the animals, and we keep the animals out of reach of the public.As I have learned more and become comfortable with the wildlife in our care, and Mac has become more trusting of me--and she has learned I can follow instructions--I have gotten to experience the thrill of holding Emmett, our screech owl, and two of our hawks  for public events.  I live too far from the sanctuary to be able to help out there as often as I'd like, but love spending the day out there doing whatever I can do to help.  I've helped with cleaning projects and organizing materials, laundry and feeding.  I love getting to see the animals that are just coming in and hear their stories and learning of their progress.  Of course not all the stories have happy endings, but so many do!  It really is a bright spot in my life to be a part of this awesome organization!

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	307796	1	/users/profile/399142	Pam_128	Client Served	5	10/03/2016	I recently had a hummingbird trying to feed from my feeders but always flew back to the ground where he was attacked by other birds.  When I walked toward him, he would flitter about 20 feet away, just far away and fast enough that I could not catch him.  I contacted PAWS and was told how to safely catch him.  Something was very obviously wrong with this hummingbird and by the next morning, I was able to catch him using the technique I was told.  I fixed a box and feeder for him, but had to feed him by eye dropper until I could get him to PAWS.  The volunteer from PAWS accepted this little bird for possible rehab and release.  I was so relieved to find someone who knew way more than I did about helping hummingbirds.  Keep up the good work PAWS!  I am glad there are people like you who are doing this work.

They help ALL animals. The way they love and care for the sick and injured is truly amazing to me. Such a tremendous credit to their profession! Keep on Rockin' Paws!!!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	307714	1	/users/profile/150097	lettelier	Donor	5	10/03/2016	I have been following Paws for quite some time.Mac and her volunteers have always impressed me with their Knowledge and the way they treat our wildlife.They spend long hours helping injured orphaned and displaced wildlife.They spend sleepless nights on an animal that needs close observation,and will drive hours to get the animal the help it needs.Thank you Mac and all your volunteers for all the hard work and hours you put in to help our wildlife.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	307685	1	/users/profile/149275	Lynn17	Donor	5	10/03/2016	I have been a supporter, contributor, and fan of Paws for several years now.  I am so impressed with the good they do.  I have learned a lot from Paws...from "rescuing" baby squirrels whose nest fell from a tree (Mama Squirrel will usually come get them) to rescuing an "abandoned" fawn (it's probably not abandoned).  Mac has posted a number of times on FaceBook about the commitment needed to raise those little ducklings, chicks, and bunnies bought like "toys" at Easter.  She has also explained what happens to them when they outgrow their "cuteness" and are "discarded" to "survive" on their own and it's not pretty.   I share her posts with others to help get the information out there.  I root for all of the creatures that are taken to Paws and are helped and those that, sadly, don't make it.  I admire the knowledge, work, and dedication put in by Mac and her small group of volunteers.  If you are looking for a group to support, this is a good one.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	222129	5	/users/profile/149275	Lynn17	Donor	5	10/12/2014	This is one of two wildlife organizations I donate to.  The care for the animals is excellent; the funds are used in an appropriate manner; and I love the way the organization does it's best to  make sure the wildlife are rehabbed to  go back into the wild.  I would donate more to them if I had it!  Excellent management, excellent facility.  I am forever glad I found them.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159579	5	/users/profile/149275	Lynn17	Donor	5	06/05/2013	I can't say enough good about this organization.  It was first brought to my attention by my daughter-in-law who volunteers for Carolina Wildlife Care.  The work done by PAWS is outstanding.  I know of nowhere else in the State where fawns, raptors, and other wildlife can be cared for so well.  The goal of this organization is to return the animals back to the wild where they can live wild and free.  They do great work.  Many animals that would have died horrible deaths have been nursed back to health and released in protected areas.  When it is impossible to save one, it is assisted in crossing the "rainbow bridge" with the smallest amount of trauma and pain possible.  They manage their finances well.  Paws keeps all of it's fans/donors well informed about the status of the animals and the organization at all times.   I know when I donate funds to PAWS, it will be put to the best use possible. This is truly a GREAT nonprofit organization.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	123334	7	/users/profile/149275	Lynn17	Donor	5	09/26/2012	I am a donor to this organization because I believe in the work it does.  They are a wonderful resource in that part of the state.  Their finances are always in order.  They use every dollar they receive in the most efficient way possible.  It is a compasionate, caring, organization that strives to help injured wildlife to survive and thrive once returned to the wild.  They provide updates on the different animals and their progress, with picture as well as words.  We have many organizations that help domestic pets (and they are needed) but few can do the extremely difficult and important wildlife rehabilitation done in this area.   This is an example of wonderful work that could be expanded if enough funds were available.   
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	307683	1	/users/profile/168013	Kathleen25	Donor	5	10/03/2016	PAWS goal is always to rehabilitate wildlife and return them to the life they were made to live. They do it with love, care, compassion, and concern, all the while working to educate humans about how they can help reduce harm and improve the chances for rehabilitation. AND, they squeeze more good out of a penny than seems possible!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260767	7	/users/profile/168013	Kathleen25	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I've been aware of this organization through its Facebook page for several years.  In the past year, I have become involved as a volunteer!  I really can't say anything more than I've already said in my previous reviews, because I already gave them 5 stars.  My evaluation of PAWS has not changed in the least since I began volunteering.  I get a more up close view as a volunteer, and what I see up close is an organization that puts animals first and that squeezes more value from a penny than I thought possible.  In addition, I see an organization that believes in education, and avails itself of EVERY opportunity to help the public learn what THEY can do to help wildlife.  First class organization - IN EVERY ASPECT!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	123369	8	/users/profile/168013	Kathleen25	General Member of the Public	5	09/26/2012	PAWS is a well run organization that gets the most out of every donated dollar.  They provide top notch and wildlife-sensitive rehabilitation, always looking to do what's best for the animal in the long run.  Sometimes that means euthnasia, but most often it means care given in such a way that the animal can return to the wild with a high probability of success.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	307666	1	/users/profile/399019	Anne144	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2016	I found Paws on Facebook, and have been following and sharing ever since. I have referred a number of people to them that have found injured wildlife that needed help. It's nice to have someone to turn to.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	307640	1	/users/profile/398992	Megan134	General Member of the Public	5	10/03/2016	I follow Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary on Facebook and love them. I have learned a lot from their post about what and what not to do. I always try to share their informational post so that it can reach others and teach them. When we found a baby squirrel last year I contacted them on what to do. After we tried to get the mother to take it back it didn't work so I had to take it to Paws.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260729	8	/users/profile/349315	debikittle,	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I have done quite a bit of volunteering for various animal/pet causes, and I have to say Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary is amazing!  Mac Curry, the founder, has such a passion for wildlife that it is contagious--of course, those of us who volunteer are already dedicated animal lovers.  Mac's number one priority is the safety of the animals, and makes sure volunteers understand the importance in keeping the stress level as low as possible for the wild creatures in her care.  No one is "turned loose" and told to do a task that they have not been thoroughly, hands on and supervised, trained to do.  This protects our safety as volunteers, but also protects the animals from injury and undue stress.  I began volunteering with Paws about 2 years ago, as a face painter to help with fundraising at our booths for events.  I make handmade jewelry and sell some at our booths to help with fundraising as well.  I have learned so much just from listening to Mac and our more experienced volunteers talk about the animals and what Paws does to help them, answering questions asked by the public.  We bring only non-releasable animals to public events, and Mac pays close attention to their body language to assure that no one is kept on display too long to tire the animals or stress them too much.  Volunteers are trained how to properly handle the animals, and we keep the animals out of reach of the public.As I have learned more and become comfortable with the wildlife in our care, and Mac has become more trusting of me--and she has learned I can follow instructions--I have gotten to experience the thrill of holding Emmett, our screech owl, and two of our hawks  for public events.  I live too far from the sanctuary to be able to help out there as often as I'd like, but love spending the day out there doing whatever I can do to help.  I've helped with cleaning projects and organizing materials, laundry and feeding.  I love getting to see the animals that are just coming in and hear their stories and learning of their progress.  Of course not all the stories have happy endings, but so many do!  It really is a bright spot in my life to be a part of this awesome organization!

Always have lived in the country and love all animals wild and tame.  Since I started following PAwS I have learned so much.  Things I might have done in the past for love of animals may not have always been in the best interest of the animal.  Now I am sharing that knowledge with others who find injured wildlife.  I will always reach out to PAWS now for assistance and guidance.  I am so grateful for this group of dedicated, knowlegable and caring people who dedicate so much energy in saving the wild life and showing compassion when life is not viable!

I thought it would die, but when it was still alive an hour later, I found Paws.  They told me what to do with the bat and at 10:00 in the evening a nice woman drove to my house to pick up the bat and take him to a facility that could help bats.  I was impressed with the caring women who helped this poor little guy.Sadly, the little guy didn't make it, but they were great about keeping me posted.Also, their site had information on what to do if you find a bat.   That information literally saved the life of another bat who fell in our pool.  I now enjoy reading about their sanctuaries.

The process that the Director goes through in order to heal, rehabilitate and hopefully re-release the animals is very diligent.  She goes to great lengths to do what is best for the animal while balancing the restraints of a budget.  She understands the need to outsource if she lacks expertise in an area.  The organization attempts to handle resources efficiently utilizing social media to successfully communicate needs.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	288823	5	/users/profile/379026	KatieMiller1196	Client Served	5	05/06/2016	Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc helped me tremendously this past July while my family and I were vacationing in Myrtle Beach for a week, and I've been wanting to thank them ever since! I had found a baby songbird on the pavement outside of our condo, and was told to just let it be. I didn't have it in me to do so, and Paws'  number popped up on my google search. Come to find out, I was located nowhere near them after I called, but a very very kind lady took the time to help me anyways (Late in the evening at at home from her couch might I add). Thanks to her advice, assistance, and kind heart, it lived AND continued to thrive throughout the rest of our week there! In a few short days, it grew from a helpless nestling to a fledgling in its make-shift Wal Mart Nest;) I'll never forget how awesome it felt to finally see baby and momma reunite, thanks to Paws! They're  amazing, Ilearned so much and I will never forget my experience with them!  Below are photos in order of The First night and Last Night we were there. Look how much she grew! -Katie Miller

Animal lovers want to do what they can to help but most of us are doing some things we shouldn't. Mac teaches us and the public how we can help and how everyone can help out in the public. I can't say enough about Paws, Mac and all the volunteers who help out! It was so eye opening to see first hand Mac saving a fawn. Mac and the volunteers work tirelessly to provide for the wildlife and sometimes domestic animals who are fortunate to come through the doors at Paws! I had no idea how much work goes into running the sanctuary. The wildlife are the priority but there is so much more behind the scenes that need to be done! ALL THIS WITH NO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE! Paws relies on private donations and will stretch every penny! A blessing right here in SC! 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260741	7	/users/profile/349329	Jennifer476	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	Several years ago I wanted to get into animal rehab. I went and visited a dog rehab first and it was awful. Then I contacted PAWS. I decided to go out and volunteer to clean cages. On my way there I found two kittens on the side of the road. They were in really bad shape health wise. Both were covered in maggot eggs. When I got to PAWS Mac came out and helped me with the kittens even though they were not allowed around the other animals due to possible diseases. I raised those two kittens and gave one away and still have the other one. Since then I have taken the squirrel rehab class and have rehabbed and released several litters of squirrels. Mac is such an inspiration to me. She has a heart like no other for animals and will do whatever it takes to help them. I love PAWS and its volunteers. 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260730	7	/users/profile/349317	jennabows	General Member of the Public	5	10/01/2015	The goal for the organization is to release wild life back out into the wild and to educate people on how mankind effects wildlife.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260706	6	/users/profile/349289	bdrake28	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I stumbled upon this group at a home and garden show in Greenville. I joined the group immediately because I am constantly finding little animals in need and NOT knowing how to help them. They offered to help me by providing free classes and lots of different resources to refer to if I needed information or supplies. The most important thing is that they never say "no". They will help the public with any question and if there is an animal in need they WILL take it or tell you where to go to get the help you need! I have been able to save numerous animals! Its been such a blessing to be able to properly rehabilate and release possums, squirrels, flying squirrels, etc. They reach out to the public, inform and provide classes to those that are interested, and they don't turn away animals! Could not be happier with them. So glad we have this group in our area! 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	239247	6	/users/profile/324947	MB1645	Donor	5	03/15/2015	I absolutely love the work done by Paws.  I am a monthly donor and would gladly give more if I could.  The care they give to wildlife is outstanding.  The educational information offered is great too.  It is difficult to know what to do when faced with  hurt or abandoned wildlife.  Mac, the rehabber at Paws has provided lots of information on determining if an animal has been abandoned or not and what to do if one is hurt.  Recently, I had the opportunity to put some of that educational information to use.  We were in Leesville, SC,  when a tree fell in the woods behind our house.  I heard the tree fall and went to investigate.  There were three baby squirrels in the remains of the nest on the ground. Thankfully, they did not appear to be hurt.  I called and got instructions on how to reunite the babies with the mama but after 4 hours she had not returned. I then took them to Carolina Wildlife Care in Columbia.  Because of the information offered by Paws, I knew not to feed them and where to get instructions for a attempt to reunite them with their Mom.  Thanks to Paws, I knew what to do and these babies will have a good chance of growing up!

Sometimes the news is happy, sometimes sad. But knowing that this wonderful rehabber and group of volunteers is there doing their best to save and rehabilitate these creatures is comforting. Not long ago, my dog found a baby racoon in the yard. It was a weekend and I tried connecting with rehabbers in my area, to no avail. I finally reached out to Mac at Paws for advice. Not only did she guide me, but in the end, because I was so desperate, she arranged for a transport for me to connect with to bring the racoon to her. There is no animal rescue group in South Carolina who is more dedicated and deserving of respect than Mac Mercedes, Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary and volunteers. 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	222052	5	/users/profile/285742	PeaceMine	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2014	Having volunteered for several years, at another wildlife facility, I easily recognize the superior skills demonstrated through what happens at Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary. Taking time to keep the public informed (for me, through facebook posts), the "Paws" facility has described care regimens and issued enough animal progress reports to yield evidence of consistent and conscientious care. Further posts by this facility focus on awareness education valuable to the general public, who are most often the first people to come across wild animals in distress and need the information so that wildlife caregivers might achieve best outcome for sick, orphaned, and/or displaced wildlife, and to prevent unnecessary admissions of animals. Wildlife rehabilitation is  time-consuming, with few breaks and long hours. It's grueling work and deeply rewarding, and it encompasses amazing  rehabilitation victories at the same time as it delivers heartbreaking experiences. As soon as she finds the time, the director of the "Paws" facility writes summaries for her new admissions and disseminates them to the public, with follow-up reports and relevant education items--all essential, if we are to learn and realize how significant is the work of keeping our wildlife healthy. For several years I have been an avid reader of all that has been posted, and I highly commend the folks at Paws Wildlife Animal Sanctuary. They perform a needed service during an era when wildlife is rapidly vanishing and needs all skills available to meet their needs during compromise.

Mac & the good people at PAWS are always available. They are always willing to take animals that I don't handle.The time and care they put into their sanctuary is awesome. Even with the number of animals in their care, they manage to provide specialized treatment for all.I am amazed that they do it all on donations and their own out of pocket. I would definitely recommend this group if you ever find orphaned/injured wildlife. You won't find a more dedicated group.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	222047	4	/users/profile/285738	Brenda67	General Member of the Public	5	10/12/2014	I do not know how PAWS manages to do all that they do.  Every penny donated goes directly to the care of the wildlife they take in. The operators and management work tirelessly, often around the clock to provide needed medical assistance. Volunteers are treated with respect and know that they are valued and all donations whether in kind or monetary are put to use. The owner/operator posts regular updates on the animals which allows those of us living far away to track the progress of these beautiful creatures both great and small.

I live within 30 miles of their physical location.  Sadly, in this area, wildlife is considered expendable.  I love that they take in, mend, and release wildlife; or permanently house the animals that are non- releasable. All lives are precious, despite the species!

Not just with the huge amount of wildlife they aid every year but because of the fact that even with all of that there still is time to post pictures and stories - both good and bad - to educate, elighten, amuse and sadden us. From Mac and her band of Pawsians I have learned so many things about wild animals that I never knew before, knowledge that led me to tell a friend that thought they would adopt a wild critter that it was a bad idea and to contact her local rehabber. Mac has a great writing style that makes her daily adventures come alive and I wish I could do more to help!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	216921	3	/users/profile/280448	Dorinda C.	General Member of the Public	5	09/24/2014	Although I live in a city far from Paws, I look forward to the stories and pictures.  I have never seen most of the animals helped by Paws, so it is very educational and often entertaining to read the posts,  Sometimes I laugh and sometimes I cry.  It is so encouraging to see such a dedicated group of people making a difference.  Keep up the inspirational work.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	192310	4	/users/profile/211717	Kim_77	Volunteer	5	01/09/2014	Throughout my life I have been involved with several non-profit organizations and I have to say that Mac and PAWS has touched my heart more deeply than anything I've ever been involved with. The passion that Mac has for the animals is indescribable, it's something that has to be seen. I am so glad that I decided to make that first trip to PAWS to paint raptor houses in the rain and to wash feed buckets... I was awe struck from the very first day. I continue to give as much as I can to PAWS: my time, my labor, my money, my respect and mostly my love. I feel everything that Mac feels when she updates us on FB about animals that have been rescued, if she's happy because they're doing good - I'm happy, if she's worried because they should be doing better - I'm worried, if she's sad because despite everything she has tried the animal lost the battle - I'm sad... it's almost like she's my soul sister! :)  I have watched this woman work until her body has given out, I have seen her go with out so that an animals WILL have. She is one of the most unselfish, most devoted, most compassionate women I have ever had the pleasure of working beside. I'm proud to say I'm a PAWS volunteer!! And love the fact that I can call Mac my friend! 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159543	4	/users/profile/211717	Kim_77	Volunteer	5	06/05/2013	Unfortunately I have only been to PAWS once to volunteer my time, but I promise to get back as soon as things settle down a bit. I had a wonderful experience while there. Mac is a down to earth compassionate woman and loves to talk about her rescues. I could have listened to her stories all day long but there was work to be done! I painted, as much as I could even tho it was drizzling rain in one of the rapture houses and it was too cool to be surrounded by birds, some who were inquisitive and some who were very quiet. The only animals I got to meet other than King Fido were the educational birds, which I understood completely. You can't rehab animals if they are too use to people, so even though I wanted to see the babies I knew better than to ask. I washed feed tubs and even though I'm not big into washing dishes I enjoyed the experience because I knew these tubs were used for a saving lives! I just can't say enough good things about Mac and PAWS.... you need to experience it yourself to understand. Thank you Mac for having me and I WILL be back!!!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	188096	3	/users/profile/245345	Michelle195	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2013	It's hard to find the right words to describe this sanctuary and the people who care for these animals. It's simply AMAZING what they do! They pour their blood, sweat, tears, heart and soul into ALL the animals that come through their doors! EVERY animal that comes in here is important! No matter how large or how small, no matter how serious or how minor the injury or sickness is, every means possible is put to use in trying to save them and make them as comfortable and at ease as possible. I follow them on facebook, and i've laughed and cried right along with Mac, who runs Paws, is the primary caregiver, and keeps us up to date on the animals that are brought in. You cant help but get wrapped up in the animals with her wonderful way of telling their stories! I thank God that these sweet babies have a place like this to go to for help!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260729	8	/users/profile/349315	debikittle,	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I have done quite a bit of volunteering for various animal/pet causes, and I have to say Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary is amazing!  Mac Curry, the founder, has such a passion for wildlife that it is contagious--of course, those of us who volunteer are already dedicated animal lovers.  Mac's number one priority is the safety of the animals, and makes sure volunteers understand the importance in keeping the stress level as low as possible for the wild creatures in her care.  No one is "turned loose" and told to do a task that they have not been thoroughly, hands on and supervised, trained to do.  This protects our safety as volunteers, but also protects the animals from injury and undue stress.  I began volunteering with Paws about 2 years ago, as a face painter to help with fundraising at our booths for events.  I make handmade jewelry and sell some at our booths to help with fundraising as well.  I have learned so much just from listening to Mac and our more experienced volunteers talk about the animals and what Paws does to help them, answering questions asked by the public.  We bring only non-releasable animals to public events, and Mac pays close attention to their body language to assure that no one is kept on display too long to tire the animals or stress them too much.  Volunteers are trained how to properly handle the animals, and we keep the animals out of reach of the public.As I have learned more and become comfortable with the wildlife in our care, and Mac has become more trusting of me--and she has learned I can follow instructions--I have gotten to experience the thrill of holding Emmett, our screech owl, and two of our hawks  for public events.  I live too far from the sanctuary to be able to help out there as often as I'd like, but love spending the day out there doing whatever I can do to help.  I've helped with cleaning projects and organizing materials, laundry and feeding.  I love getting to see the animals that are just coming in and hear their stories and learning of their progress.  Of course not all the stories have happy endings, but so many do!  It really is a bright spot in my life to be a part of this awesome organization!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	173300	2	/users/profile/212181	janet parker	Donor	5	10/04/2013	Best Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Sanctuary in the world!    So much I could say, but instead, I suggest you just follow them on Facebook for two weeks (or even day or two) and I know your heart and mind will be so touched and filled with so much love and admiration and a sense of dedication -- that most of you, will probably, be brought to the point of tears.  Very simply put, I have so much love and respect for this organization, and after your time with them of Facebook, I guarantee, you will share in that same love and admiration and amazement that such an organization as PAWS even exists.    Paws is in constant need of your assistance for rehab and rescue --- and so if looking for the best place to put your dollars, with the greatest reward imaginable -- well, HERE IT IS!!!    Look no further and please consider a financial contribution -- with every penny going directly towards the rescue, welfare, and extensive medical care of the various animals it serves (as there is no paid staff).  So, give a dollar or two, save a life, rehab an animal, and then watch as the money you have given results in, (just one example of many), a rehabilitated owl or hawk set off to fly freely into the sky.   For what could be more moving than that?   How could anyone's dollar go further than that?   Sincerely, Janet Parker
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159981	2	/users/profile/212181	janet parker	General Member of the Public	5	06/07/2013	The Heart and Dedication of the Paws Wildlife Sanctuary is staggering.   I follow their countless efforts and love of the animals they rehab via Facebook.   I will be donating to PAWS in the future because I know that every penny they get is greatly needed and put to good use.    I am in awe of the endless work they perform on a daily basis in order to make the world a better place.   PAWS deserves all the good press, accolades, and donations they receive -- for it is called, Karma...
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	173184	2	/users/profile/206818	Joandean	Donor	5	10/04/2013	Paws is such a blessing for all the sick and injuried animals.  No one works harder to save them than Mac.  She works from morning to night with no pay and relies solely  on donations to feed, vet. bills, transportation, and all the things it takes to save the animals and return them to the wild.  Mac has given her life to helping the animals that are in trouble.  If you love animals please consider donating so she can continue this work.  I can assure you that every dime you give will go to the animals.  She is my Hero.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	155852	3	/users/profile/206818	Joandean	Donor	5	04/23/2013	I am so thankful for this sanctuary.  So many animals are being saved that otherwise would be left to suffer and die alone.  Mac is a wonderful person that spends her life saving God's little creatures.    If I ever win the lottery most of the money would go to her as she has to survive on donations.  She is my hero.  The animals get wonderful care and when they are healed they get to go back to the wild.  
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	160370	2	/users/profile/212644	checkulatergirl	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2013	Mac and her volunteers do an amazing job.....some of the stories of success will warm you heart after all the countless hours she puts in to save these animals but others will make you cry after you have followed their progress and they don't survive. Mac is so good to post progress reports and we get so involved with each animal. There are times when she needs so much like a freezer to put food in for the animals because hers has died or a washing machine to wash the linens and the public rallys to provide what they can ....There definitely is a special place in heaven for one that does this kind of rescue work. The joy of releasing one back into the wild in indescribable. 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	160366	1	/users/profile/212641	pat howe	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2013	I became aware of this organization via Facebook, and am so glad I did.  I have done wildlife rehabilitation since the early 1980's and am very familiar with the hard work and dedication it takes to take care of orphaned and injured wildlife.  It is expensive, there are many late nights and early mornings.  There is heartbreak and joy.  Mac Mercedes not only gives excellent, expert care to the wildlife that come to her, but she still finds time to keep the public informed and educated via Facebook and public appearances.  The professionalism, perserverance, patience and compassion displayed through the work of this sanctuary makes me happy to donate funds when I can, and to share their site and information every chance I get.  (I also signed up for iGive- every little bit helps!)
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159971	1	/users/profile/212168	happyhoovespigs	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/07/2013	Mac is absolutely AMAZING!! We run a pig rescue and have learned so much from her. We have visited her facility and have never met someone with so much heart for these animals. Not only do she rescue these precious animals but works tirelessly to educate the public on wildlife. She put these animals first and does whatever it takes to put their health and safety first!! Please support this amazing organization!! 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159924	2	/users/profile/212122	Serenity D.	Donor	5	06/07/2013	Not only is this cause worthy, it is vital and noble. I have met Mac on a couple of occasions, one fund raiser and I have donated used lumber. I now make my online purchases through the igive program to keep a steady trickle of cash flow going to PAWS. I follow the Facebook page daily. My heart thrills at the success stories and breaks when an animal doesn't make it. What I have observed, Mac apparently is tireless and does not need the same amount of sleep my own body requires. Her love of wildlife and her bottomless well of compassion are extremely moving and totally necessary to the work she had commit herself to do. She educates frequently the "do's and do not's" of what to do when finding a wild animal either in distress or just seemingly lost. (i.e. fawn alone, no mother in view, baby birds hopping on the ground, nest of baby bunnies, no parent in view) This information serves the general public very well! How many fawns do you suppose are removed from the areas their mothers left them in due to ignorance? Too many! I will continue to donate money and building materials when I have them. I also encourage my friends to do the same through sharing information on my own Facebook wall. This is a very well run organization with the emphasis where it should be ... on the wildlife. I have submitted an application to help transport animals as needed.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159913	1	/users/profile/212104	Vickie R.	General Member of the Public	5	06/07/2013	Where does one begin about Mac.  First of all she has a heart of gold.  She is truly one that 'TALKS TO THE ANIMALS".   Mac's love of animals is evident when you look in her eyes and when you listen to her talk to one of her  animals as she begins to release it back into the wild where it belongs and with that release a part of heart goes with it. What you don't see is her silent tears as she tries to save the llfe of an animal that she knows may not make it over night, but she does not and will not give up.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159876	1	/users/profile/212057	Kathylynn	General Member of the Public	5	06/06/2013	The lady that runs this sanctuary has so much passion and love for all the animals that she takes in. I don't even think she sleeps! She has so much knowledge on how to treat the injured, or how to take care of the tiniest of animals.  You can tell just by her face book posts how much she cares for every animal that comes in. When she says she cried, it makes me want to cry. I wish I had as much passion for my job as she does. She truly is a great lady! She has changed all of these animals lives!
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159815	1	/users/profile/211996	Kathleen48	General Member of the Public	5	06/06/2013	I found out about PAWS when I recently moved to the area and was looking for a group which shared my  deep interest in preserving the wildlife of the area.  I was fortunate enough to find them via Facebook and have been intensely impressed by their efforts.  Not only do they do their work passionately and on a shoestring budget, they are superb in their work to educate the general public on the many ways we can protect nature's creatures.  I am hopeful that I will soon be able to volunteer with the group and help them in any way I can because they certainly are making a positive influence.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159606	2	/users/profile/211780	Cathy55	Donor	5	06/05/2013	I have donated to paws before and only WISH that I had the resources to send money regularly. Why do I feel this way? Because of the heart and soul that is poured in to this organization for the welfare of wildlife.  If more of the human species felt as connected and caring to wildlife as this organization does...well then we probably wouldn't need them, or rather the wildlife wouldn't. But until that day comes, the role PAWS plays is essential to the healing of wildlife and to the soul of humanity through education.  Thank you PAWS for all you do!!!!!

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	159574	1	/users/profile/211749	Adams2	Donor	5	06/05/2013	My first contact with Mac was when I accidentally trapped a skunk and she talked me through how to release it and not get sprayed. And she was 100% right and I was successful thank God lol.   Then she posted she ans other volunteers where putting up netting on the pens and I had an electric stapler and extention cord so I asked her if she could use it. She did time saver.  and it was a big time saver.She posted one day she had a call for a fawn that had been hit and she needed someone to transport it. So my husband and I picked it up. always keeps all the followers of Paws up to date on what is going on and of any needs she has. She is a true inspiration and has helped alot of animals that would have surely died without Paws. 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	157639	1	/users/profile/209065	David152	General Member of the Public	5	05/11/2013	I took some donations out to PAWS and was well impressed with what all they do with what they have. Mac runs an excellent facility on what must be 1-1/2 shoestrings and a whole bunch of prayer.  I hope to become a regular volunteer to help with all she does for several communities around her.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	157622	1	/users/profile/209038	soldbycassie	Client Served	5	05/11/2013	We saw a red tailed hawk get hit by truck and it couldn't get back up.  Mate was screaming from above so we made note of exact location with hopes of full recovery so she could be released.   Her injuries were extensive and it was touch and go for awhile.   It took several months for her to get better but we finally got the call that she was ready to be released.  Thanks Mac for taking such great care of her.  What a amazing day it was seeing he fly.  
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	157618	2	/users/profile/209029	grandmafran	Volunteer	5	05/10/2013	Great organization that provides special care to any wildlife that needs rehab.  I help transport injured and/or orphaned wildlife to PAWS.  After a few months of care, the animal is returned to be free.  It's an awesome organization that helps preserve our wildlife.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	123854	1	/users/profile/168597	Donna Conley	Client Served	5	09/29/2012	Last summer, after finding a female hummingbird desperately trying to feed from one of my several feeders then falling under the feeder i found that she had a broken lower beak.  Having been Facebook friends with PAWS I immediately called them then took the bird to Mac for help,  While the bird did not survive the night I know that all effort was made to help her.  I appreciated the caring and I appreciated being informed of the outcome.  Thanks again PAWS!

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	123432	2	/users/profile/168089	Stush	Volunteer	4	09/27/2012	As a licensed wildlife rehabilitator in Virginia, I worked with an outstanding organization.  When I moved to South Carolina, I contacted two wildlife organizations, neither of which I was willing to donate my time or money to as they just didn't seem to be well organized.  After speaking with PAWS several months ago and attending two classes, it reminded me of the great organization I had worked with in Virginia, that I still stay in touch with.  I decided to offer PAWS my property as a release site for native wildlife ready for return to nature.  I have been releasing squirrels so far, but plan to release other species as release cages are built.  It takes a special person to do wildlife rehabilitation and a special person to organize, motivate, and lead a non-profit at the same time.  PAWS is that organization worth committing to.

And Mrs. Curry gets nothing back except to see the animals released back to the wild, healthy and full of life. I love to watch her facebook page on all the great and some sad stories. But she does keep you inform on the progress of the animals.  I am so proud to have her in my community and great honor to know her. 
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	123350	2	/users/profile/167993	Ann_25	Volunteer	5	09/26/2012	PAWS is run by one very dedicated woman (MAC) and lot of volunteers. I first met MAC in Greenville at a fundraiser where she was handing out flyers with information about wildlife to passers-by. Since then, I've picked up a batch of orphaned opossums to care for, and am hoping to do more when time allows. I highly recommend her organization. If you have time, take a class with her and raise of batch of squirrels or opossums yourself! It's rewarding, and she could use the help! If you can't do that, please consider sending a donation for food.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	123337	3	/users/profile/167978	Bonnie22	Volunteer	5	09/26/2012	I have been trained by PAWS to transport injured wildlife, and to care for baby squirrels.  I have witnessed the care, love, and focus to rehabilitate wildlife and return them to their natural state. MAC makes use of every bit of help that she can. I have helped at an expo,  Her posts also educate all of us in the proper care of wildlife (when they need help and when they don't!)   I have picked up injured wildlife and brought to PAWS. picked up wildlife from another rehab center to transport to PAWS, helped pick up cages and a freezer that were being discarded.  I personally have donated money to help in the care of these animals.  This organization is truly dedicate to rehabbing wildlife.  I look forward to volunteering more when I retire at the end of this school year.

Because of PAWS, they will be able to grow into Possum adults and once again be released into the wild.

Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	110214	2	/users/profile/150080	luvsqrls	Donor	5	04/19/2012	PAWS is staffed by wonderful people...all volunteers donating their own time and resources to help animals in need. Need more people in the world who have such big caring hearts. I'm so grateful for the work they do.
Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary Inc	260729	8	/users/profile/349315	debikittle,	Volunteer	5	10/01/2015	I have done quite a bit of volunteering for various animal/pet causes, and I have to say Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary is amazing!  Mac Curry, the founder, has such a passion for wildlife that it is contagious--of course, those of us who volunteer are already dedicated animal lovers.  Mac's number one priority is the safety of the animals, and makes sure volunteers understand the importance in keeping the stress level as low as possible for the wild creatures in her care.  No one is "turned loose" and told to do a task that they have not been thoroughly, hands on and supervised, trained to do.  This protects our safety as volunteers, but also protects the animals from injury and undue stress.  I began volunteering with Paws about 2 years ago, as a face painter to help with fundraising at our booths for events.  I make handmade jewelry and sell some at our booths to help with fundraising as well.  I have learned so much just from listening to Mac and our more experienced volunteers talk about the animals and what Paws does to help them, answering questions asked by the public.  We bring only non-releasable animals to public events, and Mac pays close attention to their body language to assure that no one is kept on display too long to tire the animals or stress them too much.  Volunteers are trained how to properly handle the animals, and we keep the animals out of reach of the public.As I have learned more and become comfortable with the wildlife in our care, and Mac has become more trusting of me--and she has learned I can follow instructions--I have gotten to experience the thrill of holding Emmett, our screech owl, and two of our hawks  for public events.  I live too far from the sanctuary to be able to help out there as often as I'd like, but love spending the day out there doing whatever I can do to help.  I've helped with cleaning projects and organizing materials, laundry and feeding.  I love getting to see the animals that are just coming in and hear their stories and learning of their progress.  Of course not all the stories have happy endings, but so many do!  It really is a bright spot in my life to be a part of this awesome organization!

Donor	5	04/19/2012	PAWS is one of the few organizations out there that actually use 100 percent of the donations toward their cause.   This group is dedicated to caring for wildlife and go beyond the call of duty to help a creature in need.  Amazing organization! I believe in the work they do and the moral ethic behind it.
Paramedics For Children Inc	318205		/users/profile/409351	merynr	General Member of the Public	5	11/03/2016	I learned about Paramedics for Children through my coworker - and we have since stayed there at least twice while working in and around Copan. We've had the pleasure to meet and talk with Rodger and Suyapa and learn a bit about the mission of the organization and the effort that Rodger puts forth to ensure  the organization is serving its beneficiaries. Every day we headed out to work in the morning we would pass the clinic with a line out the door, and many people waiting in the sunny yard outside. Rodger told us about driving up into the hills to visit the towns and deliver goods to the children and families that live up away from the town and clinic. The organization works hard to ensure that all the resources people are donating are being used to directly serve the clinic and the efforts of the organizations, and I both admire and trust Paramedics for Children and all the work they do!
Paramedics For Children Inc	317404		/users/profile/408571	Robert212	Donor	5	10/31/2016	Paramedics for Children is a fantastic organization which is addressing a vital need for the children of Honduras. Through the clinic's work,as well as the school projects, they are insuring that the children have a healthy and productive future both for themselves and the general population of this extremely poor area. What this organization accomplishes with limited funds, is amazing beyond description. I will continue to be  a regular donor, as well as a contributor to their special needs projects, and will continue to do so with great pride, and without hesitation. Paramedics for Children gets the job done !!!

Paramedics For Children Inc	315403	1	/users/profile/406730	Writer	Donor	5	10/27/2016	Paramedics for Children is an organization where any donations are instantly turned into action and aid for very needy people.  Dedicated volunteers and some generous professionals have built a place of refuge and care where that care is needed most.  Having visited and seen for myself how this groups operates, I'm proud to be a part of their support system.
Paramedics For Children Inc	315375	1	/users/profile/353640	Teresa78	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I volunteered with Paramedics for Children on 2 separate occasions. It is the most incredible experience one can have.People go crazy to build schools in poor countries, but what they miss is that it takes sustainability! That is part of what PFC does... it sustains the education in the local region! Anyone can build a school, but if the children don't have school supplies and the teachers have no pay or equipment ... those fancy new buildings sit empty.PFC not only provides medical care but the greatest gift for anyone... education! From the medical clinic to the milk programs to the school supply runs into the mountain villages; this  is one of THE best organizations to volunteer for or donate to! Your money isn't eaten up in corporate salaries like so many children's charities.I am proud to have met and worked with such great people. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	264912	1	/users/profile/353640	Teresa78	Volunteer	5	10/18/2015	I went and volunteered on 2 separate trips with Paramedics for Children.Each trip was incredible. The work that is done there to provide health care and education to the Children in that area is nothing short of a true labour of love. Many charities build a school in a region, but the school doesn't survive without a teacher and supplies! This is ONE of the many things PFC does.. Sustains the schools in the local area with supplies throughout the year. The medical clinic is there for everyone to have the opportunity to access care. PFC does not limit itself to the Copan region, it is far reaching and a VERY worthwhile NPC to support !

Paramedics For Children Inc	315189		/users/profile/240793	Rebecca92	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	I worked twice in Honduras with PFC.  Started with a vision, commitment and lots of heart something big is happening in a small place in the world. People in the mountains in poverty are discovering that someone cares.   Children are given second chances. Schools receive supplies.  Refurbished ambulances find their way into communities. And so much more happens because one man saw a need and responded. I respect, support and admire the work and the people who run the program with integrity and compassion. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	183880		/users/profile/240793	Rebecca92	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Because I am a paramedic, I went searching for an organization to share my gifts.  What I found was Paramedics for Children, an incredible organization.   It is well organized,  with so little overhead and yet with an incredible reach.  It touches children and even adults in a small corner of the world, Copan, Honduras where there is so much poverty.   Rodger, the creator and director of this organization started with one small vision and just let it grow and evolve, involving aid to school children and medical help.  His heart is so big and he walks the walk, parenting, loving and adopting a young girl who struggles with seizures to keep her from being forgotten and lost due to her problems.  Now she knows about love, safety and clean sheets.  He has inspired so many people with his capacity for helping others, especially children that many of us return to help him in his work. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	315159		/users/profile/237340	Jim_78	Donor	5	10/26/2016	As a parent I cannot imagine the desperation Rodger goes through daily to help provide services for the people in his area. I met Rodger through a friend, Rodney Ward, who I used to work with. The successes Rodger and his selfless group is second to none. Paramedics for Children is a true life changing charity. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	180653		/users/profile/237340	Jim_78	Donor	5	10/21/2013	I first became aware of this amazing project while I was a paramedic, in Vancouver, BC. Rodney Ward, who I worked with was always talking about driving from Vancouver to San pedro sula, Honduras!!! In his Volkswagen golf I must add. As a father of 3 children I started to awaken to how lucky we truly are in Canada, it was my turn to start giving back. I asked "what can I do?" and as being quite handy, Rod had said the children had "worn the chain out on the swing sets". I didn't think this was possible, but Rodger sent pics of the chain worn through...I constructed 12 swing sets for Rod to take down on his next trip.  The satisfaction I got knowing these very disadvantaged children could at least play again warmed my heart. I had the pleasure of meeting Rodger and Pam on one of our Houseboat trips, here in Canada and I was convinced this is such a worthwhile charity, making a daily difference in so many lives.  Once I finish my RN degree I will be making a trip down there to see what kind of a difference I can make. I implore everyone to take $5 out of your wallet and donate to this cause. We can stop poverty $5 at a time.

The work they do is definitely "grassroots" but also has so much far reaching positive implications and influence that I put it on my bucket list of things I wanted to do (be a part of) before I die.  March 2017 this is going to happen!  Rodger and his team in Honduras and back in the USA have shown me that small things can have huge impacts.  Rodger has touched base with me personally multiple times to say thank you for thinking of us with your donation.  I know what I send is actually getting to the cause it was sent for.  To me, that is what is important when I donate.  Volunteering March I will get to see what my donations have done first hand.  I cannot thank Paramedics for Children enough for allowing me to be part of the bigger picture!  Warmest blessings,Sherry KlemmensenWhite Lake, BC   CANADA

PFC does not just give handouts they give a hand up to the poorest of the poor by helping them get an education, clean drinking water and nutrition through there vitamin program. PFC is very in touch with the needs of the people and so the help is delivered where it is most needed.

Paramedics For Children Inc	265607	2	/users/profile/354344	chrisdk	Volunteer	5	10/20/2015	I had the great privilege of working with PFC on a large project that culminated in Guatemala and Honduras a couple years ago. Throughout the 3-year duration of the project, Rodger & PFC were instrumentally helpful and supportive, and ultimately vital to our success in delivering and donating a modern ambulance to the bomberos of Retalhuleu, Guatemala. Finally meeting the PFC team on the ground after much long-distance collaboration was an inspiring experience. I can only describe this organization in terms of the passion and dedication that stems directly from the individuals that make its wheels turn. PFC has a large enough presence, reach, and local acceptance to make a real difference, yet is small enough to be focused, adaptable, personal, and efficient. Sadly, its abilities and ambitions are limited only by its funding.
Paramedics For Children Inc	265068	1	/users/profile/353807	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/19/2015	Paramedics for Children is built on the love of one man for a people in a country far from his own who touched his heart years ago and left him with the desire to stay and help them  when he could have lived a very comfortable life at home.  These people have very little in the way of health care, education, supplies and compassion from the outside world. PFC through his leadership has made a difference and continues to grow.  Building not on political or religious beliefs but on love for these people this is surely the summit of aid they could ever hope for.
Paramedics For Children Inc	264183	1	/users/profile/352893	Writer	Donor	4	10/14/2015	I facilitate my church's prayer community for select missions in Central America so that we have many people praying daily for them. Paramedics for Children is a wonderful mission team that serves the poor and hurting people in the area, and is one of the missions we cover with our prayers. They operate in and around in Copan Ruinas, Honduras with a clinic and emergency vehicles.  They do amazing work considering their limited resources. The only thing standing between my 4-star rating and a 5-star rating is significantly increased donations of cash, fever/dehydration medicines, and a ten liter/minute oxygen concentrator.
Paramedics For Children Inc	264179		/users/profile/352889	Writer	Donor	5	10/14/2015	Paramedics for Children is a small non-profit organization providing education services and healthcare to the poor in the high mountains of Honduras.   PFC continues to do a lot with a little. The John and Susan Dewan Foundation has supported PFC's school supply program since 2002.  This program provides basic school supplies (and vitamins) four times per year to 25 remote mountain villages overlooking the Copan Valley.   For the cost of about $9.00 per child per year, PFC makes the difference in a child being able to attend school.  This program has been operating continuously since 1997.  Local teachers relate that over time, school attendance has been increasing and dropouts are declining in part due to PFC assistance. The Clinica Esperanza is a low-cost health service providing increased access to care for the poor.  It has operated since 2005.  The clinic treats up to 750 patients monthly.  Participating local doctors agree to charge patients a reduced rate for their normal consultation fee, and in return, get full use of the clinic, all equipment and donated medications free of charge. The ambulance donation and volunteer training program relies on generous donations from paramedic units across the USA.  There are now 22 ambulances in services with 300 paramedic volunteers trained by PFC in eight PFC member chapters both in Honduras and Guatemala.  In the last few years, PFC  has taken on partial financial support of the 35 children at the La Casita Orphanage in Copan Ruinas. Paramedics for Children has managed several significant accomplishments on a shoestring budget.  They save lives, bring hope, open opportunity and restore dignity to thousands of the very poor in the Copan region of Honduras and Guatemala.
Paramedics For Children Inc	264135		/users/profile/99686	MichelleP.	Volunteer	5	10/14/2015	I have been involved with the charity since the life-changing trip to Indonesia. PFC fielded a medical team to travel to Indonesia after the tsunami.Since then I have visited the Honduran site in Copan Ruinas, one of the most beautiful houses I have seen, several times. I have participated in their medical clinic program, school supplies distribution,  vitamins program, orphanage sponsorship, and other social programs. This is truly remarkable charity, run by some of the most dedicated people who literally turn every donated penny into an amazing  array of programs and services. Those serve some of the poorest of the poor and give them hope for better life. All donations are used extremely judiciously, with maximum impact on the communities they serve.I volunteer with a number of different organizations but Paramedics for Children is one of the best in terms of value and efficiency, dedication, and effectiveness. I cannot recommend them enough.
Paramedics For Children Inc	179630		/users/profile/99686	MichelleP.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I have traveled to Indonesia after the tsunami in 2004 with PFC as a part of medical relief team. The organization sponsored and paid for the trip and the mission treated over 400 refugees who up to then had no access to medical care. In addition, our team set up a forward medical clinic in one of the refugee areas and donated a massive amount of medical supplies.I have been involved with PFC ever since, as a volunteer, contributor, fundraiser, and occasional helper and visitor.I have seen the work of this charity over eight years. Every penny donated goes to its primary mission of helping the poorest of the poor in Copan, Honduras. The charity runs the only medical clinic in a very large area, supports orphanage, donates school supplies and vitamins, brings in donated medical and fire/rescue supplies and provides training, and aids a desperately poor area in so many other ways. It is indeed a lifeline for so many.Rodger Harrison, the founder and president of the charity, is one of the most honest, generous people I have been privileged to meet. I know for fact that all donations go directly to care for the some of the most neediest people.
Paramedics For Children Inc	106531		/users/profile/99686	MichelleP.	Volunteer	5	02/15/2012	It is hard to describe the impact this little charity had on the refugees in Indonesia after the tsunami of December 2004.  The charity founders, Pam and Rodger, accomplished an incredible feat of organizing 16 medical professionals to respond to the critical conditions in Indonesia. Paramedics for Children provided an unbelievable amount of logistics, financing, planning, and just plain hard work to send the group on a medical relief mission half way across the world. Our group assisted over 400 hundred desperately needy Indonesians who were left with nothing after one of the greatest natural disasters in human history. We brought over several hundred pounds of medical and technical supplies and treated people who had no other access to the most basic medical care. Even aspirin was a treasure in those primitive field conditions. Our group, despite incredible odds, set up a forward medical clinic in one of the refugee camps, ran a medical clinic for several days, and left behind a framework and supplies for our relief medical team. Not only did we bring medical supplies and expertise, but hope. Most of the people had never seen anyone outside of their community. To know that the world was supporting them and that people all across the world cared about what happened to them was priceless. Everyone of them will forever remember the group of Americans and Canadians, and one New Zealander and Czech, and the fact that they came literally half way across the world and lived and worked in the most primitive conditions and brought hope.

I donate every year through my employer and take time to share with my friends and coworkers so they have the chance to donate to something that really gives more than they receive..

Paramedics For Children Inc	263691	1	/users/profile/352397	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/13/2015	I had the privilege of volunteering with Paramedics for Children. I think was struck me the most is that by giving people the opportunity for education and some basic health care, individuals can create a better world fir themselves. It was truly an honour to be involved with this organization and I would highly recommend them for any opportunity that will help them to create more opportunity for some if the poorest people in Central America.

Paramedics For Children Inc	186056	2	/users/profile/243038	jaxonhunter	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I had the wonderful opportunity to go Honduras in late August . I can tell you that paramedics for children is a great charity and is one of the best run charity that I know. Rodger has a unique way to stretch every dollar and maximize the donations for Gods glory. I look forward to seeing the entire team in march
Paramedics For Children Inc	263519	2	/users/profile/352221	Neale	Board Member	5	10/13/2015	I'll tell you upfront: I am the President of Paramedics for Children, so I might be somewhat biased when I talk about us. I wasn't always the President, though. I started as a volunteer on an educational support mission years ago, and became one of the "true believers" over a long period as a donor and volunteer, watching a truly remarkable bunch of people do an amazing job with few resources. We take great pride in our origins as a disaster relief organization,  but while continuing in that  mission, we have grown and expanded our operations to include providing clinical medical care and educational support to the poor and indigenous peoples of Honduras and Guatemala.  This year has seen us not only provide disaster relief in Guatemala in response to the El Cambray II landslide, but also providing 600 patients a month with quality medical care at our clinic in Honduras, supplying hundreds of students with the basic educational supplies they need to attend school and providing training and equipment to firefighters across both Honduras and Guatemala. I urge you to get involved, volunteer and donate and join us in a really incredible journey.

Volunteer	5	10/12/2015	PFC is an incredible organization run by dedicated people who are working selflessly to improve the lives of the poor in Honduras and Guatemala. Volunteering with them has been an incredible experience for me and my 13 year old son. Taking my son to Honduras to participate in their school program was a life changing experience. To see first hand how poverty effects children has taught him so much. I'm very grateful for this experience and will be going again with my son. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	256079	1	/users/profile/344470	Sarah264	Board Member	5	09/10/2015	I've volunteered with PFC twice now, and absolutely loved both experiences! While I don't have any kind of medical or disaster response background, I was able to help the team deliver school supplies and clothing to schools and a women's village in Honduras and Guatemala. The Paramedics for Children team truly loves what they do and they care deeply about the people they work with - and they're just super cool people to hang out with. I felt completely safe on both trips, and Rodger and Neale have been incredibly helpful answering all my questions and giving travel advice - like when to arrive to the airport, what to wear in the villages, etc. - and touring fellow volunteers and travelers around, translating, and really making all of us feel welcome and useful. I'm very glad to be part of such a great organization and can't wait to visit Copan again!

PFC is a great organization and Roger does an awesome job at keeping that way. The work they do is truly amazing and I am so happy that they continue to work hard. Ever since I left, I have been getting consistent emails from Roger and I am always impressed with the work they are doing. I hope I can go back and visit again.

I had the opportunity to visit Copan and see some of the people who benefit directly from their great work. They have very little overhead, giving me the confidence that what I'm able to send them will directly benefit those most in need. PFC is an innovative, creative team that integrates volunteers' expertise to maximize the efficacy of the organization. I am a proud supporter.
Paramedics For Children Inc	184037		/users/profile/240973	Mrybth	Donor	5	10/29/2013	I am so impressed with the work this organization does to truly make a difference that I donate on a monthly basis.  My daughter has done volunteer work for PFC and the work helped her blossom and gave her many gifts and blessings as well as she giving her gifts and blessings to the children in Honduras. The most brilliant program was the Multivitamin Program.  In a country where malnutrition is a part of everyday life PFC found that giveng each child a MultiVitamin everyday by their teacher during the school year enhanced their overall school performance as well as their  general health and well being.  How simple yet profound!  I am also impressed that they give lollipops but only in exchange for something such as a tiny rock a child has found.  This way the children do learn not to beg for handouts.  they learn that they can give something that is perceived as value by another and in return they too will receive. What a great lesson for all!  Their are Real Life Heros and Rodger Harrisoon is my Real LIfe Hero!
Paramedics For Children Inc	183989	1	/users/profile/240910	Jennifer285	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I have been amazed at the work Rodger Harrison has accomplished for the Children in Honduras and Guatemala and in Indonesia. He started when he had been studying Spanish in Copan Riunas, Honduras. When Hurricane Mitch hit he learned that many of the friends he had made there were greatly devastated by mud slides and flooding. He went back to see the horrible devastation first hand and realized that there would be no medical help from the government. Not even nurses were there to help and certainly no doctors. It was then that he started Paramedics for Children. Being a paramedic in the states he started his one man charity helping the children in Copan Ruinas. He started small by bringing school supplies to the schools in the area. He had to ride horseback and travel in rivers and up mountains to reach them. Then he started bringing them vitamins. Then he started training paramedics in many towns across Honduras and Guatemala and then shipped in donated ambulances. Finally there was medical care and transportation to the hospital that was hours away. He then built a medical clinic with a doctor on staff. Families walk for miles over mountainous terrain to reach him. He has many volunteers from time to time but mostly he has done it all on his own. I had the honor to be his Point of Contact in the states when the international team he formed went to Indonesia after the great tsunami. There he helped hundreds of children in the remotest and hardest hit region Bonda Ache.  He and his team had to endure many hardships with death all around them but they didn't complain. They were honored to help the children. Rodger has been faithful in his pursuit to help the families in Honduras. He thinks only of helping the people and the children. It only proves that one person can make a difference.
Paramedics For Children Inc	183950		/users/profile/240864	LindsayH	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2013	I came to know Paramedics for Children, Rodger Harrison and his team, while was I working for another non-profit organization in the same town of Copan Ruinas in Honduras, where Paramedics for Children runs a clinic, equipped, staffed and operated an ambulance service and rural medical and nutrition services. I saw firsthand the difficulties and logistics of procuring the old ambulances and importing them to Honduras, the daily battles treating the mainly rural population for a range of tropical diseases, accidents, childbirth, problems caused by malnutrition, tangentally dealing with social problems and their impact on children. I remember the periodic trips undertaken by horseback by Rodger and his staff into the mountains to bring vitamins to the Maya Chorti children. Watched as the clinic rose from the ground by the river. It's a difficult environment, at times a frustrating one, but Rodger has persevered and created/provided an absolutely essential service in Copan. It's hard to praise this organization highly enough. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	183938		/users/profile/240851	Lisa306	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	My husband, daughter, and I volunteered with PFC last year. This was our first time both volunteering for a nonprofit and visiting a third world country. We had the heart to volunteer, but not much education or experience. PFC exceeded all hopes and gifted us with a more compassionate and healthier world-view. Their extraordinary hospitality combined with the genuine humanitarian effort they do make them the true example of a nonprofit. If they expected profit for themselves the organization would never have been founded in the first place. Their constant focus is on the well-being of the people they serve. They give and give and teach that level of glad servitude. I have never known an organization to be so purely-motivated. Doesn't everything these days have an agenda? Not for PFC. They seek to love, to care, to serve. They seek to embody kindness and educate and help the people they encounter learn to sustain themselves. They are not a hand-out, but they offer a hand-up in this frightening world of poverty and disease. And yet, during our time with PFC and the people who guided us around, we saw hope and life in the middle of the worst circumstances. That should be the litmus test that ought to be used to pick the best nonprofit. Hope and life in what would have been despair and death. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	183930		/users/profile/240808	Bajacaptain	Donor	5	10/29/2013	I know that there are many great charities in need of your support. All of them do good work however most are run like Mega Corporation by a board directors who seldom get in the trenches and do the real work. I know everyone at Paramedics for children and they are always there in the trenches fighting. Weather to save a childs life or providing books and school supplies to give them hope in the future. The hard working people that make up P.F.C. are always on call when help is needed. Every dollar goes to helping these children. They risk their lives every day going into areas that you and I would never venture. This type of unending dedication and commitment deserves our support. I know that every dollar I give goes to the children and that makes all the difference.
Paramedics For Children Inc	183902		/users/profile/240816	Neale B.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2013	I have been a donor and volunteer with PFC for years now,  as have 3 of my children and my wife. After many trips to Copan with Rodger, I can honestly say I have never seen much accomplished by one small group with so little  in the way of material and financial resources. Between the clinic, the school programs and the myriad little tasks they take upon themselves, they have become part of the communities that they serve.
Paramedics For Children Inc	183897		/users/profile/240812	Goombaygtr	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I stumbled upon Paramedics for Children in September, 2008.  Little did I realize my work with them would lead to a 5 year relationship.  In the spring of 2008, I was in Honduras for a WHO training.  Just by chance I took a 2 day trip to Copan Ruinas....One night, and I was in love. I ama Nurse Practitioner in Family Practice, and I knew I had a lot of skills and knowledge that would help the people, as well as myself.  I went home and started planning my return, and not wanting to be part of a giant brigade, I came across Paramedics for Children.  I worked in the clinic in the morning and studied Spanish in the afternoon.  Some of the time I spent in the Aldeas delivering school supplies to hundreds of small children.  I loved my experience so much I would go at least twice a year.  During that time, I met Silvana Ayuso, Vice President of Paramedics for Children, Guatemala.  I began to expand into Guatemala where I began a one woman brigade to provide PAP smears to the under-served indigenous women in the high, rural mountains. With the generous donations of all the necessary equipment, along with Silvana, a nurse and a few women from the area, I was able to provide this service to more than 100 women.  Some of these women had had 15 children, but had never had a PAP Smear.  I have to say this experience was one of the best of my lifetime.  Additionally, I had the pleasure of working alongside the REDS Team from North Carolina doing a week specialty rescue training with the Guatemalan Military and volunteer Bomberos from around the country.This year I have been able to fulfill a 40 year dream of serving in the Peace Corps, and I am currently a Peace Corps Volunteer for the next 27 months in Belize.  Before I left,  I was able to enhance the services Paramedics for Children will be providing in both countries.  The Doctor I had worked for over the last 7 years was retiring and I was able to get her to donate the entire office to Paramedics for Children.  Her extremely generous donation will allow Paramedics for Children to place small clinics, like the one in Copan, all over impoverished areas of Guatemala and enhance the services in Copan.Without a doubt, once I complete my Peace Corps service, I will return to my, "volunteer roots" and Paramedics for Children.  Because Paramedics for Children is a small organization, you have a huge chance to make a memorable impact, not only to those you serve, but for yourself.  It is a life changing experience.  
Paramedics For Children Inc	183872		/users/profile/240785	Samantha36	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I had an amazing time with Roger and PFC last year during my summer break from college. My school typically goes to Honduras every year, when I decided to go I had no idea what to expect. Little did I know my whole life would change from the week I spent working with the organization.  Everyday we experienced a new aspect of the culture and we got to really see Copan and help others. I would recommend this organization to anyone looking to volunteer in Central America
Paramedics For Children Inc	183871		/users/profile/240783	Gege_sug	Donor	5	10/28/2013	I have followed paramedics for children since their inception. I have seen the trouble and tribulations of mr.

Paramedics For Children Inc	183848		/users/profile/240764	Manasi K.	Donor	5	10/28/2013	It was by pure chance that I stumbled upon this charity. Looking up places to stay in Copan, back in 2010, I read the excellent reviews of the bed & bath establishment run by Rodger Harrison & his team. Their website mentioned that the proceeds from our stay would be used solely to fund the clinic & school projects run by Paramedics for Children. Needless to say, I was impressed &  booked up to stay for 2 nights & we were there a few weeks later.As luck would have it, we arrived in Copan from Antigua, Guatemala, late evening by shuttle bus & were dropped off at the center of town. We hailed a cab & the guy immediately knew the "clinic" and our hosts, even though he knew no more English & we knew no Spanish.. "Clinic La Esperanza" we asked..he immediately smiled &  nodded & we were delivered safely there. It was obvious that the clinic & Rodger have earned the respect of the locals-that respect leading us to be delivered safely, in the middle of the night, in a strange land ;)We were very impressed by what we saw during our stay. The clinic is primarily funded from the money from tourist bookings. School projects are run year round to take school supplies to the local kids. And the President, Rodger has a big heart..having just adopted a little Honduran girl with a disability, just a few months before our arrival. It was apparent that his heart & mind are dedicated to the people of Honduras. We had a great 2 day stay. .watching him interact with the locals, the clinic in action & sitting with him to discuss his dreams & plans for the future & for Paramedics for children.We came away with a great respect for the organization. So much so, that we have become monthly contributors for the last couple of years. If you want to contribute to a charity, where the proceeds go 100% back to the people it was meant for, this is one charity for you;)
Paramedics For Children Inc	183847		/users/profile/240763	Sandra51	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I've been a supporter of Paramedics for Children for many years because of the work they do and because of the way they talk about that work and the people they work with. I made a small regular donation and as I followed the organization I became even more impressed.  in 2011 I had the opportunity to bring a group of 12 college students to Copan to work directly with the organization. We had been volunteering with children's homes in several locations in Honduras for over a decade and finally decided to seek out a new community partner for our group. I suggested Paramedics for Children, and we were approved for travel thanks to the details and information provided by the Director Rodger Harrison. It was an amazing trip and we were so impressed we returned the next year.  They have a bed & breakfast in a walled compound--with a beautiful garden--so visitors and volunteers alike are safe and well cared for. Best of all, profits from the B&B support the organization. On both of our trips we found the team members to be organized, knowledgeable, and dedicated to helping volunteers help the local community, recognizing that the volunteers are changed even more than the people we work with and gently helping the students work through their experiences.  They used our talents and desire to work hard, and between physical work and school visit we felt our time was very well spent.  I would recommend this volunteer location and organization 100%.
Paramedics For Children Inc	183846		/users/profile/240762	Teresa Durdle	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I  volunteered with Paramedics for Children for 2 years in a row.. each time was an incredible experience and left me wanting to do more for the children of this world! Roger Harrison is an incredible man! I met him through Rod Ward a fellow paramedic with British Columbia ambulance service.  I was interested in doing the volunteer work from the day i met rod and spoke to him about what he and Roger were doing.. sadly it took me until 2011 to get there... Well I haven't stopped! These people ar in it for the long haul.. there is no flash in the pan lets build a school and smile and go home! these people are KEEPING the schools going with their continuos supply of donated school supplies... medical check ups and providing a medical clinic for the people in the Copan Ruinas region! If you want to find your heart and refresh your soul... go work witht them and watch the love for the community and care for its children... all while keeping the future of the wonderful country of Honduras.. educated healthy and in it's own country!
Paramedics For Children Inc	180641		/users/profile/237330	JSJS	Donor	4	10/21/2013	Through mutual friends and our love of music, I first met Rodger Harrison in 1975. Even then, as a younger man, he had a big heart and seemed to enjoy helping people. Too soon our path's went different ways, so I was extremely happy to learn of Rodger's faith and his involvement in this wonderful missionary work, something he'd been doing since the late '90's. What Rodger and his associates have apparently been faithful in pursuing is of the utmost importance. It's the highest example on earth of portraying the example of our Savior and the 'Cause of Christ.'Jim Stover, Asheville, NC
Paramedics For Children Inc	180627		/users/profile/237315	Carol123	Donor	5	10/21/2013	TI discovered Paramedics for Children when I was browsing through websites of NGO's in Honduras.  they looked good, so I thought I'd take a chance.  This is a great organization.  I visited their headquarters in Copan Ruinas twice, and I found that my donations were being used in wonderful ways.  Almost the entire amount of any donation goes directly to the people to be helped, and the dedication of the people involved with PFC assures that the money is being used in the wisest and most effective ways.    Any amount of help you can give to this organization will be well spent.
Paramedics For Children Inc	180354		/users/profile/237017	abinger	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	I worked with Rodger in May of 2012. In college I was a member of a group that travels to Honduras annually to do volunteer and service work ('the Honduras Project'). There was a bit of turbulence scheduling a trip because some of our previous sites were deemed unsafe for various reasons. When the group found out that the sites we intended to  work at were no longer an option it was something of a scramble finding Paramedics for Children. I was somewhat wary of the place going into the trip, simply because we hadn't worked with this organization. I must say this trip exceeded my expectations and stands out as my favorite volunteering experience when compared to the other trips I've made with my college group. Just being there I could see that the clinic itself was well organized. Rodger was very hospitable and truly made our group of 12 feel welcomed. The staff was also very welcoming and friendly.  The actual work we did was exactly what the Honduras Project was hoping for. The group aims to be immersed in the life of the community as best we can. We don't aim to simply pass through or to be tourists. While Rodger was somewhat wary about giving us too much work, he graciously yielded to our requests. As a result our group really had the chance to provide some aid to a family in need.  Additionally the Honduras Project likes to work with children, and Rodger gave us plenty of opportunities to interact with kids. He accompanied us to almost a dozen different schools where we played with kids and handed out supplies. We had a chance to truly engage with young people and get some insight into the culture.  Overall I think this is a top-notch nonprofit organization. They have plenty of structured activities that could meet all of their volunteers' needs. Additionally there is flexibility; room to wiggle around; room that Rodger used to cater to each group's unique needs and concerns. It was moving to see all of the good things this clinic and Rodger is doing in the community. I would highly recommend anyone to seek this clinic out if they are looking for a meaningful/ significant experience. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	179814		/users/profile/236456	Annie26	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I had the privilege to go to Honduras to volunteer with Paramedics for Children in 2009. It is hard to remember the poverty the children consider to be normal but it is easy to remember the absolute joy the children demonstrated when PFC arrived in the village to give away school supplies. What a wonderful gift PFC provides these children by helping them go to school. They also provide medical care through their clinic, solicit donations of medical supplies and ambulances as well as training opportunities to endure the ambulances can be staffed. All of this is done on a very small budget. I have continued to donate to PFC since I went to Honduras and wish I could do more. Please help Paramedics for Children help the children.
Paramedics For Children Inc	179757		/users/profile/236394	kstew	Donor	5	10/18/2013	I traveled to Honduras in 2005 for the first time for Spanish school, and was deeply touched by both the poverty, as well as the openness and warmth of the people. Every day when we walked to class, we passed by an orphanage teeming with adorable children, and we wanted to help. We found out that Paramedics for Children did a lot for the children and families there -- when I did some more research, I found out that it's run completely by volunteers, and that all the money and supplies donated go directly on to the people in need. No overhead! Ever since, I've been happy to be a supporter. I'm so impressed by how much they do with even small donations. I'm thrilled to give whenever I can, and comforted to know that my ten or twenty dollars has five times the impact it would in another organization. Rodger, his crew, and the volunteers are doing worlds of good in these very needy villages. Rodger continues to amaze me with his heart and his actions every day. 
Paramedics For Children Inc	179665		/users/profile/236311	Gustavo P.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I met Rodger about 17 years ago when he first visit Honduras, He saw a lot of the needs in Copan Ruins, and talking to a group of friends especially to Hector Cardona (Muco) who became Rodger best friend, they both live to help and view copan with very different eyes,I remember the long nights conversations talking about the different needs and what could be done. Before I knew Rodger, came back with the first ambulance and they stared Paramedic For Children, that was the first real ambulance that the people of town ever seem fully equip, not the back of the land cruiser with someone with a few hours training. Muco and Rodger stared to talk to the locals to become part of the team, Hondurans are very hard working people and with the right lead we can go very far, and thats one of the things that he brought to town. in a few months later there blue uniforms were ready to help their people making runs at all times, this made a huge difference on their health due that after dark most of the doctors could not be contacted. Then Rodger and Muco were always thinking in others, and they both love horses so they went to the mountains to ride and saw more need up on the top the mountains, in the schools, school supplies, clean water, stoves etc. so thats how the school and vitamins program got stared. I remember once Rodger was telling me about a teacher that wanted out the vitamin program. I thought is this teacher crazy, but them he mention that the teacher was having trouble with the kids because they had a lot more energy that he was used to. Up to today PFC steel in helping Honduras and expanded to Guatemala too.

The way that donations are utilized, the lack of salaries paid out, the dedication of the staff are exemplory and beyond reproach. I have no idea how they do what they do. After only being in business for 13 years, this charity has made great strides in education, healthcare, children's issues as well as stimulating the local economy. Paramedics For Children subscribes to the  notion of "teaching a man to fish". Bravo, as this approach has made all of their programs, with the exception of school supplis, self-sustaining.

Low (no?) overhead, everything goes to those in need in impoverished communities.  Lives have been saved, literacy rates have been increased, school dropout rates have been reduced.  The organization has established EMT services in many communities; they've built a very necessary, and popular, medical clinic; they provide important school supplies to more than 2,000 children in 25+ remote Mayan communities in the mountains of western Honduras.  All of this with little funding, and no endowment or reserves.

The Humane Society of McCormick County	322973		/users/profile/261514	bethfirce1	Volunteer	5	02/10/2017	For 11 years I've fostered for this wonderful group of volunteers. They provided food, toys, and other assorted accessories and all I had to provide was the love.  All of the volunteers I've been involved with are kind and loving, not just to the animals but to their foster parents.  You have to be a loving person to be able to do what they do every single day. The cat barn ladies show up first thing in the morning to clean, and feed all the cats and kittens, then stick around to play with them awhile. All of this is on their own time, which really impressed me. It always makes me sad when I have to let go of one of my fosters so I can't imagine how bittersweet it is for these people when they have to let go of another pampered dog or cat to it's forever home. There is a special place in Heaven for each one of them.

We began assisting with rescuing puppies, fostering them, and helping with adoptions. I have enjoyed every second in fostering their puppies and mama dogs. They provided food, paid for the vet visits, and I got to do all the fun stuff! I've noticed a huge drop in puppies being left by the side of the road since the spay and neuter program took off. Barbara, one of their longtime volunteers, goes to the elementary school to teach the kids about proper care of their pets. The McCormick Humane Society has changed this town for the better and continues to push forward. One day there will be no more homeless, abandoned or mistreated pets in McCormick.

Second, after being in a home, they are house trained and crate trained so they get adopted faster.  I love knowing I helped a homeless dog find their forever home!
The Humane Society of McCormick County	207021		/users/profile/60364	Judy H.	Client Served	5	07/23/2014	I am a proud failed foster home. We fostered a shy, loving dog named Barrett and after a couple of months, we realized that he fit in perfect in our home and with our other dog. We made it official and adopted him. After he gets settled, we plan on fostering more dogs for the HSMC. It is very rewarding and fostering first is a great way to know if a dog is going to fit into your household.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	141953	4	/users/profile/60364	Judy H.	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	Many people love animals and want to help in some way. The great thing about this organization is that people can volunteer every day, once a week, or just during special events and we need both hands-on volunteers and behind the scenes help. I live an hour from McCormick but I can still help by taking pictures at adoption events, sharing adoptable animals on Facebook, and helping to find grant opportunities online. Of course, if I wanted to walk dogs or trap cats, I would be welcome and someday I might move back and help them this way too. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	57267	2	/users/profile/60364	Judy H.	Volunteer	5	11/18/2010	I have been volunteering with the Humane Society of McCormick County for 9 years. I have participated in a variety of activities but the most enjoyable moments are when I am hands on with the dogs and cats. I like to help at our adoption events whenever I can. Adoption events are good for the animals because they get socialized, they get some training, and they get lots of attention. And, they might find a forever home! It is the best feeling in the whole world when you know a dog will get to sleep on someone's bed that night because you volunteered that day. And for me, I get to play with puppies, dogs, kittens and cats. I love animals but I can't take them all home with me. My husband says I get my "puppy fix" when I help at adoption events. For every person that helps, one more animal can be shown off and possibly find a home that day.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	294887	2	/users/profile/385657	mjjones	General Member of the Public	5	07/07/2016	We cannot speak more highly of the Humane Society of McCormick County.  The staff who helped us with our adoptions took the time to get to know us and that made it possible for them to help recommend a dog that would be a good fit for us.  We are deeply impressed with the dedication and caring attitude of all the volunteers we have met.  We often visit them on adoption day just to say hi.  They are the best!
The Humane Society of McCormick County	294506	3	/users/profile/385244	RMeyer	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	I have never met a group of people with bigger hearts than the volunteers at HSMC. Their love and dedication for animals is truly genuine and inspiring. I am so glad that I am able to be a part of this organization, and I have loved every minute of it!
The Humane Society of McCormick County	294475	2	/users/profile/385213	LucysStaff	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	I moved to McCormick County in 2010.  Within 2 years my husband of 47 years passed away.  I was alone and recalled how I had enjoyed having a cat in my life over the years.  I started looking at PetFinder and fell for the picture of Jesse.  She was available through the  Humane Society of McCormickj County (HSMC).    They are devoted to not only the animals but to the adopters and potential adopters.  They made me as a new "parent" feel like I was part of their family and if I had any question/probems, I could just give a call.  Which I had to do early on because Ms Lucy was nearly a year old and had socialization problems.  The HSMC volunteer worked with Lucy and me and we are now very happy together.  After enjoying her for several months and following some of the HSMC activity on social media, etc, I realized that I could give back to this wonderful all-volunteer organization as a volunteer myself.  
The Humane Society of McCormick County	288470	2	/users/profile/378666	HarleeMom	Donor	4	05/04/2016	I have lived in McCormick for over 20 years and have watched the HSMC grow from a very small group of volunteers into the organization that it is today -- a group of committed dedicated people who love animals and give of their time and talents to protect and provide for the dogs and cats of the county.  There is some heartbreak but a lot of joy associated with this work and I stand in awe of their dedication.  They have gone from a group that housed dogs in pens behind a fire station to one that has acquired land and built a bricks-and-mortar dog shelter and a temporary cat shelter, while they work toward something more substantial for the kitties.  I adopted a kitten from them last summer, feeling it was the least I could do to help them and the animals.  Harlee has been a joy and I love her dearly.  Thanks go to all of the volunteers, dedicated and underappreciated.  You are my heroes.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	288341	2	/users/profile/336949	ownedbyacat	General Member of the Public	5	05/04/2016	We are now fostering a dog for the Humane Society of McCormick County and it is so rewarding. We know that we now know more about his personality which means we can be more helpful in finding him the right home. And he is playing with our dog which is good exercise for her. It is a win-win!
The Humane Society of McCormick County	249115	3	/users/profile/336949	ownedbyacat	General Member of the Public	5	07/22/2015	This is a great group. They really care about their animals and they stay in touch with the people that adopt from them. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	286906	3	/users/profile/376977	Jan_B2	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	(http://www.mccormickcounty.petfinder.com)Joy When I retired I moved to a very rural area of the south. I learned there was a small, all volunteer group of retirees who formed an animal rescue. They did this because there is no animal control, no veterinary services and no county help for unwanted or lost pets. I began by walking dogs, cleaning up after them and playing with them. They gave me so much joy from the tiniest puppy to the biggest goofball. I soon began volunteering my Saturday's to travel by caravan with all the dogs. It takes us just under an hour and a half to reach a decent sized pet store. There we wait in anticipation to see who would find their forever home. Nothing brings me more satisfaction to follow an animal from a skinny, flea ridden and often times shy, mangy dog, to a warm and happy home. We have endless hours of fundraising and when necessary pitch in to buy gas, food and veterinary supplies to make ends meet.This is a meaningful way to spend my time and gives me an opportunity to give back to those who were lost. Im glad I found the Humane Society of McCormick County.

The volunteers feel like family. They were so kind and welcoming to me the first time I volunteered. They have the cutest and sweetest dogs and kitties. If you're considering adding a furbaby to your home, I HIGHLY recommend checking out HSMC's adotable babies! Pictured below is one of their sweet pups that was adopted out a while ago! :)

I have been involved with the walk and feed of the pets and foster mom also.  They are a wonderful group of caring and kind people whose 1st interest is safety for the dogs and cats. We are a non profit group so many fundraisers are necessary to keep the group going.  I am proud to be a part of this organization Kathy Az.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	284187	2	/users/profile/374218	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/31/2016	I have volunteered for adoptions for the past year.  The people I work with during adoption events are the most caring people I know.  Everyone cares about the dogs and they all get lots of loving.  If I were on the market for another dog I would definitely use McCormick County! I know their dogs and cats are healthy and get a lot of loving and interaction.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	271693	3	/users/profile/184408	SVoigt	Volunteer	5	11/10/2015	As the reflective Thanksgiving season approaches, and this little foster kitty at my feet attempts to climb my legs in search of a warm lap, I want to thank the Humane Society of McCormick County not only for the rescue of this little guy but also for giving me the chance to share in his future. The HSMC doesn't just rescue and shelter their animals. They make them a part of their family, each animal receiving love helping them begin the process of being the best pet an adopter can hope to find.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	138344	6	/users/profile/184408	SVoigt	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I too am a volunteer for the HSMC and reading the other reviews I can only agree with all comments! What I did not realize when I began volunteering 3 years ago was how in need of a rescue shelter, spay & neuter program, medical care for lost (mulitple state parks w/camping) and abandoned animals and an adoption campaign the county is. As stated by many, there is no animal control officer in this rural county where animals are not always treated as they deserve. Too many sad stories to share. All we can do is rescue, care for, love and ready them for a forever home. We cannot change the animal control situation in our area but we can change the lives of those lucky animals we rescue.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	259510	2	/users/profile/348028	Nallygirl1	Volunteer	5	09/25/2015	I have been a volunteer for the last twelve years since the minute I relocated to the South from Long Island, NY.  It was a dream of mine, to volunteer to help animals in my retirement. I found my calling immediately on visiting the little outdoor facility which housed approxmitely eight outdoor kennels which sometimes held doubled up dogs or full litters in very small quarters. With the work and energy of a small town, we managed to build a shelter for unwanted, abused, and uncared for dogs. We have been operating our shelter for two years and are busting at the seams. We are hoping to generate enough funds through donations to build a cat barn to house the overwhelming number of cats of McCormick County. Our dream continues..........................
The Humane Society of McCormick County	249102	2	/users/profile/336936	Carol_S	Volunteer	5	07/22/2015	I have been a volunteer from Aiken for five years at Aiken PetSmart adoptions.  Every Saturday this group of amazing and dedicated people at HSMC fill two vans with dogs and cats and drive over an hour (one way) to the PetSmart in Aiken with hopes of finding forever homes for them.  And that's only a small part of what they do for our furry friends.  Every day they lovingly care for them, socialize and provide obedience training, run a successful spay/neuter program, hold fundraisers and go to local schools to educate our youth on the importance of responsibly caring for their pets.  This is all done with only volunteers, donations and fundraisers...pretty remarkable!!!  I feel extremely privileged to be a very small part of this exceptional organization.

The Humane Society of McCormick County	249033	2	/users/profile/221641	Yvonne D.	Volunteer	5	07/21/2015	I volunteer at the Aiken PetSmart adoptions Saturdays for the Humane Society of McCormick County and also a dog foster mom.  I met this group in Aiken and started volunteering almost two (2) years ago.  They are a very dedicated  group of people that does everything possible to help find fur-ever homes for all the dogs and cats.  They are a NO KILL shelter and made up of 100% volunteers so the funds raised goes to helping the animals.  I enjoy going to the adoptions, spending time with the dogs, being there when one finds their new family and meeting people.  You can't go wrong with the Humane Society of McCormick County.    
The Humane Society of McCormick County	166830	5	/users/profile/221641	Yvonne D.	Volunteer	5	09/03/2013	HSMC is a wonderful organization and is made up of a great group of volunteers that have the interest of the animals at heart.  I have been thinking about volunteering to help an animal shelter and wasn't able to decide on one.  Two weeks ago I spoke to some of the HSMC volunteers at the Aiken PetSmart Adoption and decided I'd like to help out.  If I lived closer I'd help out more than at the pet adoptions in Aiken.  The next pet I adopt will be from them.  You couldn't ask for a better group of people. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	249013	2	/users/profile/336829	Bebemac	Volunteer	5	07/21/2015	Volunteering with HSMC has been a very rewarding experience. Every animal that comes through is well loved and cared for. The volunteers don't stop until an animal has found a loving, forever home.

The Humane Society of McCormick County	246672	4	/users/profile/334078	woodwidgeon	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2015	In one of the smallest, poorest rural counties, with no laws or county personnel to back them up, this group of all volunteers with little experience have educated themselves and their community and changed the entire dynamic of animal care in this county.  I am a wildlife biologist involved in  animal rehabilitation and dog rescue my whole life, and I have never encountered a group so ready to adapt to each situation and each citizen while keeping the welfare of the animal front and center.  Every penny of your support will be maximized, and the need is still so great.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	246578	4	/users/profile/333954	Jody34	Client Served	5	06/28/2015	A wonderful place, run by great people that put the animals health and care above everything else. The people at The Humane Society of McCormick County go above and beyond to find good, loving safe homes for animals in need. Very clean and well run, not only going the extra mile for the animals, but also taking the time to get to know and educate the adopter. If you need your faith restored in the goodness of humanity, then visit The Human Society of McCormick County.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	246575	3	/users/profile/333951	Teach123	Volunteer	5	06/28/2015	This is one NO KILL shelter that does whatever it takes to give animals a chance.  They are always on social media posting opportunities just like this one for people to come along aside and be a part of helping animals.  They never stop looking for means to educate and inspire people to advocate for animals.  Enough said.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	239212	4	/users/profile/324804	pstrat	Client Served	5	03/13/2015	It was around 7pm late September and my significant other and I were just about to turn down our street and head home, after a 4 mile run we squeezed in between rain storms. We noticed something on the side of the road about 200 yards past our street. Curiosity got the best of us and we went to investigate. We searched where we though we saw something and soon heard some whimpering. We found a small 6 week old pup hiding behind a tree, soaking wet. We scooped him up and hurried home,  somehow along the way he got the name Taco. As luck would have it we are neighbors with with a volunteer at HSMC who provided us with food and sound advice that first night we had Taco (with plenty advice more to come). We took Taco to the vet at 8am the next day. About an hour after we got back from the vet our neighbor visited us again to check on Taco and let us know that the Humane Society was going to allow us to foster Taco, and they would provide food and cover his vaccinations.  That lasted until Thanksgiving, when we signed the paperwork to bring Taco into our family. It was because of the selflessness of that volunteer, who stopped what they were doing to help us and this animal, that we started volunteering. As time progressed while we volunteered, it became apparent that all of the volunteers at this no kill shelter are as committed to the animals as the volunteer that helped us that cold wet September night.

He is a great dog and I have the HSMC to thank. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	71562	5	/users/profile/78259	Charles	Volunteer	5	02/19/2011	I volunteered to foster a dog over Christmas in 2006. I was given this small, thin, timid, but very sweet pitbull mix. She gained weight and gained confidence after the first month. I didn't realize how difficult it would be too find a home for a pitbull. She was so well behaved and so sweet and I knew she would make someone a great companion. They took her on many adoption events before she finally found her forever home. I feel very good that I helped this sweet dog become more adoptable because she was housebroken and healthy.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	233113	5	/users/profile/296787	Vicki57	Volunteer	5	11/06/2014	My 13 years with HSMC NO KILL SHELTER has been so rewarding, not just because of the incredible people I have met, but the feeling of giving & helping all the unwanted furbabies that come in all shapes & sizes & need us to love them & make them feel they are wanted...I started volunteering when we had a low small shed we stored the food in & when it was raining the only part of you that was covered was your head. It would be cold & wet, very miserable I might say, but when you saw the faces looking at you so appreciatively & lovingly, it made it all worth it. The ALL volunteer effort is beyond words & I love them ALL...also am enjoying our newly built shelter...warm & cool...I will also add that most of the volunteers are not spring chickens,no offense guys,you are great...!  
The Humane Society of McCormick County	232797	5	/users/profile/296389	jakejake	Volunteer	5	11/03/2014	I have been a volunteer for 14 years at this rescue.  I was a volunteer from its inception.  I have adopted 3 dogs in the last 14 years.  I walked and fed and cleaned pens for 11 years.  I no longer volunteer weekly, but as a sub, since I am getting on in years.  I have never worked with an organization that is so caring and so committed to saving animals as this organization.  The volunteers are passionate about saving the dogs and cats of our county.  We have no animal control in  our county and without the Humane Society of McCormick County with their spay/neuter program the amount of dogs and cats not being under control, due to not spaying or neutering and just being let out into the wild would be in the thousands.  I am proud to be a part of this organization.Karen Hoyt

The Humane Society of McCormick County	232494	5	/users/profile/296034	GrandmaDeeDee	Volunteer	5	11/01/2014	As a resident of McCormick County for three and a half years and a "dog walker" for the Humane Society of McCormick County for a little over a year, I'd like everyone to know that this organization is full of the most dedicated volunteers ever.  Because we receive no government support, the volunteers work constantly to raise the funds to care for our abandoned or homeless dogs and cats.  This is a major effort.  No fund-raising event (yard sale, dinner, nut sale, etc.) is over before another one takes its place.  This requires hours of selfless dedication to our animals.  We have no paid staff.  Through the support of our community and these volunteers, we are able to provide veterinary care, food and shelter for our animals.  We are a no-kill shelter that even has a very successful trap-neuter-release (& feed) our feral cats.  It never ceases to amaze me what this group accomplishes.  And we are so successful at finding forever homes for our animals as well.  I can't tell you how much I admire what the HSMC does.  It is a truly great organization.

Thank goodness for the hard working individuals of the Humane Society of McCormick County who give untiringly of their time and energy to provide for the homeless animals in our community.  I am continually amazed at the efforts by these volunteers to provide homes and shelter for so many poor animals who would otherwise starve.  When the shelter is full, they find neighbors who are willing to provide foster care until the animals are adopted.  On Saturdays, they drive to other towns to spend the day making efforts to find good homes for these sweet animals.  The volunteers have wonderful fundraising efforts as well, creating fun events that the entire community enjoys.  I can heartily commend this organization for their hard work.

Through vigorous, non-stop fundrasing they have built a modest cat and dog shelter, aggressive spay and neuter program and high success with rehoming hundreds of dogs and cats. Can't think of a better way to contribute back to society and advocate for those who share our planet.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	232424	2	/users/profile/295959	momtotwo	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2014	!st I have to ask the reader of this review if you can imagine living where there is no animal control officer, no shelter funded by your municipality or one that gets any monetary support what so ever other than the money that is raised by the 100% all volunteer effort that is the ONLY help in the county for abandoned or unwanted animals? That is the situation in McCormick County, SC. I live in this county and  can tell you that without this group of volunteers we'd be inundated with animals unwanted and suffering. They have saved literally thousands of animals from being born unwanted through their spay/neuter program which allows for those who have bigger hearts than they do pocketbooks to get their animals altered so they stop producing unwanted animals. They've managed in only 15 years from start to finish to build both a dog and cat shelter and they've done this by raising money through fundraising efforts, some grants, and donations from the general public. Additionally, they have found forever homes for many animals and have done this through their no-kill policy. This humane effort is truly an incredible group of folks who work tirelessly to educate, rescue, rehabilitate when needed through their nurturing ways, and place in loving homes all those animals from within our county who have needed help.  I thank God for them all every day & pray they will continue to stay strong.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	207072	3	/users/profile/269620	libby1961	Client Served	5	07/23/2014	I can't say enough great things about the McCormick County Humane Society.  Everyone I've met has a passion for giving all animals good health and a good home.  My neighbor and now friend, has been a volunteer with them for over 10 years.  She devotes herself above and beyond what most people would ever consider doing in order to help ANY animal.  Every Sat. she volunteers at the pet adoptions, 45 minutes away from her home.  She fosters animals, she has paid out of her pocket for medical care for neighborhood animals, she helps friends/neighbors when they need assistance with their pets, she helps fund raise and she stays involved in community issues relating to pets.  She is just ONE of their volunteers. When I mentioned that I was ready for another dog, she immediately had one in mind that she thought would be a great fit for us both.  BELLA was brought into the shelter after being found by another animal lover who wasn't able to take on a fourth dog.  Bella had more energy than I knew how to handle.  My friend/volunteer not only gave me suggestions, she gave me many toys, loaned a crate to me and frequently followed up on me.  Most impressive was that she came over in the evenings to take Bella for a walk when I was working.  This was far and above what I could have ever hoped for in a friend or volunteer.  Again, she is just ONE of their volunteers.    From her stories, all the volunteers sound just a dedicated as she it.   I've had Bella now for 2  1/2 months.  She is the light of my life and makes me smile more than I can say.  She goes to day care while I'm at work and we both come home exhausted.  She's allowed on the sofa now and thinks she is in heaven.  Thank you so much Judy for being a great person and thanks also to Lisa for making sure Bella wouldn't remain a stray by bringing her in.

The Humane Society of McCormick County	205872	2	/users/profile/268137	Kathy167	Volunteer	5	07/13/2014	I don't know where to begin.  We live in the woods in McCormick.  One day my husband was mowing the lawn and he heard the sound of an animal in pain.  He went walking through a forestry path and a dog came running up to him, he put his paws and my husband's shoulders and starts giving kisses.  We don't know where he came from, but he was approximately 3 yrs. old, black Shepard with light brown socks, his eyes were the same light brown color.  He brought him back to the house and we noticed metal things hanging off him.  I called the police department and it turned out he has been tasered .  I called the president of the humane society and he quickly put us in touch with a vet to surgically remove these things.  All the while the volunteers stayed in touch with us and after a week or so they took him under their wings and found him a furever home.  While doing this for any pet, the volunteers are VERY thorough with potential adopters to be sure the pets are going to a safe home.  Homes inspections are done. Because of this my husband and I volunteer by feeding and walking the dogs and going to adoptions on Saturdays.  I am continually amazed by the commitment and caring of the volunteers from fundraising to adoptions to spay neuter and most important educating the community about pet care.

And so enters the 100% ALL volunteer, no-kill effort called the Humane Society of McCormick County, Inc.  These volunteers are fully responsible for not only helping these animals but also raising all the money needed to care for them! They are remarkable!!! They receive not one single penny from city, county or state yet in 16 years of effort they have managed to only recently move the cats and dogs from outside pens to a cat and a dog shelter they've built in the past two years. They have not lost site of what no-kill is as their spay/neuter program remains a priority and they managed to alter apx 500 animals just last year. It's an on going process and this organization, it's volunteers and its leadership could be used as a standard for other no-kill efforts. They are truly selfless going out in rain, snow,utterly ugly conditions to tend to these animals, they'll drop social commitments to help an animal in distress, and they literally plan their lives around the needs of this organization. There truly are no words to adequately express the good they do for the county and its animals.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	147528	5	/users/profile/113372	seekingsix	Volunteer	5	01/01/2013	Can you imagine living in a county where there is no animal control or shelter for abandoned & unwanted animals for the entire county in which you live? When we retired to McCormick County 13 years ago it never occured to us to ask about such things but we soon learned that for anyone who truly cared about animals it would be a shock to find those things for which we took for granted where we'd lived previously did not exist for us any longer. Over the years I have found the people who work for this effort are some of the smartest most caring individuals I've ever had the pleasure of volunteering with bar none! They are not ego-centered in any way and exhibit such a concern for animals that they have for the greater part spent much of their free time focused upon the development and growth of caring for animals in a pro-active way (meaning through thier low cost spay/neuter program thus stopping the flow of unwanted animals at its source) as well as hands on. They aggressively pursue ways to raise funding for their expenses as they get not a penny from city county or state. It's a constant battle but they are determined to fulfill their dream of ending the needless suffering animals endure when abandoned. Watching this group work is like watching a colony of ants! All hardworking, focused, and determined to make it work.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	204231	2	/users/profile/266253	Jeanne A.	Volunteer	5	06/27/2014	This organization stands out and above all others. I have recently retired and was looking for an avenue for my time. This is the most organized and passionate group of volunteers that all keep their focus on a single goal, to help the animals. A no-kill shelter that is totally self-sufficient with 100% volunteers and run by donations alone.  I find I am excitedly trying to help the cause because the commitment of these people is contagious.  The impact made on McCormick County is impressive and a godsend to homeless animals. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	200657	1	/users/profile/261963	Martyz	General Member of the Public	5	05/21/2014	McCormick Humane society is a no kill shelter.The volunteers are very nice and also hard workers.The place is very clean and all the animals are up to date with shots and heartworm treatments.I was very impressed at what I saw the day I visited them..I have rescued several dogs myself and I hate to see animals that people dump on the side of the road or in someones front yard.I know when anyone takes a dog to them they research anyone that wants to adopt that pet before they release them.I really feel good about this place..
The Humane Society of McCormick County	200328		/users/profile/261487	Lisa349	Client Served	5	05/14/2014	I would like to say how thankful I am for The Humane Society Of McCormick, South Carolina. Someone had came through my neighborhood and dropped of a beautiful young female dog. I took her in and kept her for several weeks trying to figure out how I was going to care for another dog. I have three myself and really couldn't afford it. My mother and I took Bella to the vet to have her checked for health issues as well as shots. She was in perfect health. I emailed  the HS of McCormick and they quickly responded. They stepped up to the plate by taking Bella, having her spayed and gave her lots of love and attention, until they found her forever home. I was very impressed because the staff were so caring and they reassured me that she would do great. They have the cleanest facility that I've ever visited, along with excellent care, love and affection for the animals there. I know if I ever need help again, they will be the only shelter I'll call. Thank you HS of McCormick for everything you do!!! You have the best staff and volunteers I've ever met!!! Lisa Stanley

The Humane Society of McCormick County	172413	3	/users/profile/228312	becb325	Volunteer	5	09/30/2013	I love being a part of this all volunteer organization.  The HS of McCormick County has made amazing progress in this small, rural community toward educating residents about the importance of spay and neuter.  I help out at the pens and as a foster home for dogs and I have had overwhelmingly good experiences.  Other volunteers are just a phone call away, and always quick to help solve any problems.   The recently opened cat barn is a new part of my childrens' and my week- what a great experience for them to be able to volunteer and take responsibility for creatures in need.  I am proud to have this organization as part of my community!
The Humane Society of McCormick County	172332	2	/users/profile/228086	Michelle171	General Member of the Public	5	09/28/2013	 My mom and daughter both help out with hsmc.  They LOVE it!!  They stay busy walking the dogs and have even fostered. I live in Michigan and stay on top of all the events that go on.  My son has helped with the dogs when he goes to visit his grandma and grandpa.  He loves spending time with the dogs walking and playing with them.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	171990	3	/users/profile/227684	Tom_50	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	When we moved to McCormick in 2008, I knew that the one organization I wanted to be involved with was the Humane Society.  It was a great decision.  I've been on rescues, gone to adoption events and walk the dogs every week. (Fostering Bridget was a blessing and because our adoption team is so caring, I know that she found the perfect home.)  The volunteers of Humane Society of McCormick County in SC are a remarkable group of men and women.  All volunteers who give generously of time and money.  I am proud to be a small part of this group. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	171941	2	/users/profile/227635	HelenJ	Volunteer	5	09/26/2013	I started volunteering at the McCormick Humane Society Shelter about a year ago when we first moved to SLV.  Unfortunately, my back problems have kept me away from the pens for awhile and I miss all the dogs terribly.  I have never met such a dedicated group of people from the people at the top who run the daily work of the organization to the volunteers who help with the animals.  They are so caring and love the animals like they were their own (and some of them have become their own).  This is a very worthy cause and thank God for the people who run the McCormick Shelter because if not for them, there would be too many dogs and cats out there who would not have a chance to find loving, caring homes were it not for these volunteers.  They work hard to help and protect all the animals in their care and I would hate to see what it would be like if they were not here to do this, sometimes unappreciated job.  Thank all  of you dedicated volunteers who love our animals in McCormick.  Keep up the wonderful work that you are doing.  It is truly appreciated! Helen J
The Humane Society of McCormick County	171937	3	/users/profile/227631	Billiejett	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/26/2013	Having worked with the HSMC for several years now, I am truly honored to do so.  The totally volunteer organization has accomplished amazing tasks (TNR, Spay/neuter program, adoptions an hour away every Saturday, organizing volunteers, writing grants, fostering, and the list goes on) and they are still getting better and growing.  New facility in the works!  There couldn't be any other county the size of McCormick that comes even close to being so fortunate as to have an HSMC!
The Humane Society of McCormick County	171893	5	/users/profile/171110	Nallygirl	Board Member	5	09/25/2013	It has been a busy year at the shelter. Our current Pres. is a hands on get it done kind of guy. With his persistence we were able to begin construction on our cat and dog shelters.  In March, 2013 we opened our doors to a newly built cat shelter.  We have a wonderful, bright facility with lots of light, cat scratching posts, wooden boxes with ladders for them to cozy up in.  The volunteers also love the happy atmosphere.  We also just broke ground at the same location to erect our dog shelter.  It will have dog runs where they can play which is not possible at our current outdoor kennel situation.  We are actively holding fundraisers to obtain the funds needed to complete the building.  It is a very exciting time for our small, volunteer run, with private funding only.  I have been working for ten years and I hope I can double the volunteer hours.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	125978	5	/users/profile/171110	Nallygirl	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I have been working hands on with the animals for nine years. We are an aging group, and always looking for new, younger people to commit to caring for our homeless animals.  It is my passion to help God's animals be well fed, rehabilitated, find homes and live happy lives. Fostering is a fun way to help the dogs and cats be ready for their forever home.  I work with the volunteers in many capacities, bake sales, fundraising by selling chicken dinners, to lavish parties.  We help those animals that are discarded, although they are all precious in our eyes. The Humane Society of McCormick County, Inc. is solely supported by private funds.  We get no assistance from the County or City.  It makes for a huge challenge, but we are working through it with very dedicated people.

The Humane Society of McCormick County	171805	2	/users/profile/227463	slv01	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	While working with this organization I have witness many acts of kindness, and charity for this small community.  They have helped many dogs and cats, that have been left to fend for themselves or starved or mistreated.  When I first came here, I saw a starving horse...I called them even though they did not work with horses, they went out of there way to help get this animal taken care of.  There truly are angels outthere that walk among us.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	171780	2	/users/profile/227435	timothy48	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	Amazeing organization...they do it all with volunteer help and funraising projects...no government money of anykind.  Weekly adoption trips, monthly Spay and Neuter program open to the community....24/7 loving care of dogs and cats in the program.  I have been involved with many community organizations in my life but this group tops them all.This organization's effct on McCormick County for the past 13 years has been enormous.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	162839	5	/users/profile/216148	catfish	General Member of the Public	5	07/17/2013	A wonderful organization, with truly dedicated members.  They to a marvelous job helping the community and more importantly the Animals.  A loving group of people, with the interest of the animals at heart.  I am especially pleased they are "A No Kill" society. Fair weather or foul weather they never ignore their animals. If I lived there I would be a Foster Home or help anyway I could, alas I live in Mississippi. I have personal knowledge of the organization.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	162834	4	/users/profile/216142	Wazzy22	Client Served	5	07/17/2013	On Saturdays, the Humane Society of McCormick County brings animals that are up for adoption to our local PetSmart. I have been multiple times to the adoption events and everyone from HMSC is very friendly and knowledgeable. They helped me find a cat that worked for me. Each Saturday that I went, they let me hold the cats they had brought and told me about their history and their personality. One Saturday I went, and they had just brought a cat, Leo, who was an owner surrender. I was able to meet him and I fell in love. The adoption process was smooth and we brought him home the next day! I am forever grateful for HMSC for recommending Leo to me! 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	157090	7	/users/profile/208326	Kay T.	Client Served	5	05/04/2013	We are the proud new parents of Charlie!  Charlie is a sweet loveable hound mix from the Humane Society of McCormick County that we fell in love with when we visited Petsmart.  He captured our hearts immediately.  All the people from the Mc Cormick group were so helpful and worked with us to be sure Charlie was going to a good home.  His foster parents gave us alot of information about Charlie and all they had been doing with him...you could certainly tell they loved him and had taken such good care of him.  The Humane Society of McCormick County does so much good with minimal resources.  Their volunteers have hearts of gold and do eveything they can to save the lives of as many animals as possible and make sure they get forever homes!  They took adoption pictures of Charlie that day and made it a "family picture"...me, my husband, Emma (our 8 year old dog) and Charlie!  What a good memory to have of that day!  Charlie has been with us a week now and is a wonderful addition to our family!  Our many thanks go to everyone involved with the McCormick group!  
The Humane Society of McCormick County	151223	4	/users/profile/201827	Judy68	Volunteer	5	03/18/2013	We have volunteered with HSMC for 12 years.  I have never met such a loving group of people.  They not only care about the aniamals....they care about each other.  My husband, Ron, is the Adoption Chair and has been diagnosed with a disabling disease.  He goes on adoption each and every Saturday and the volunteers who accompany him help him loading his walker in and out of the van each and every Saturday. I appreciate them so much....and so does he. Judy C. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	149567	6	/users/profile/199378	LoveAllDogs89	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2013	This group is one of the few that wrote back to me with open hearts and open minds when I e-mailed about a situation that we were in. We had saved a dog from a kill shelter and needed to find him a safe place. They were so understanding, so kind, so caring and so willing to help in any possible way. They didn't discriminate or push us away. They offered their advice, ideas and thoughts on what we could do to get the dog a home. We exchanged countless e-mails, each one from them just as full of advice and understanding as the last one. Many other rescues turned us away or wrote back to us with spiteful, negative comments, but not HSMC. They love and care for these animals and I am totally convinced that their rescue could run on their pure love alone! Thank you, thank you, thank you HSMC for being so awesome, especially when others weren't. I appreciate and support this rescue with every fiber of my being :)
The Humane Society of McCormick County	139016	7	/users/profile/185110	TWright	Client Served	5	11/14/2012	We happened to stop by PetSmart when HSOMC was having one of their adoption events.  We were just taking our dog (Blade) for some socialization with people and animals.  They were set-up in the front of the store, where everyone could see their BABIES!!!  When I say babies, I mean that they treat every one of their animals as if they were part of their own family.  All of the ladies and gentlemen that are involved with HSOMC are so loving, caring, helpful and compassionate for what they do.  We walked over to let Blade see their animals.  We ended up falling in love with a 12 week old puppy by the name of Tandi (now named Marlee) and adopted her that day.  Ms. Barbara said that when it was time for her to be fixed, she would get in touch with me to set up her surgery at the Aiken SPCA because it was closer to where we live.  A couple of days after Marlee turned 4 months old Ms. Barbara called and had everything set up for us.  On occasion, we stop in at PetSmart when HSOMC is there so they can see how Marlee is doing.  They know it is her time she walks in the door.  These ladies and gentlemen go above and beyond for the sake of animals.  We love them so much for changing our lives with our Sweet Marlee! 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	138968	6	/users/profile/185060	MacVean	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	This is such a kind group of individuals who really have a heart and devotion for the work.  They are great to their volunteers, entirely understanding, not demanding but appreciative.  Once I moved I was unable to continue volunteering as easily with them but I know that I'd be welcomed anytime.   I have some great and some awful volunteer experiences and this by far ranked among the best!   I strongly suggest supporting this agency in any fashion you can - they do great work for animals with great people!
The Humane Society of McCormick County	138696	3	/users/profile/184773	pswhip	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Hard work, rainy days, cold and blustry winds or hot sultry days, animals that have no manners, working in the dark, but dogs that need that basic and loving care that will save their lives.  Have you ever looked into an animal's eyes that show you the abuse someone has done to them?  Have you ever walked up to their kennel in the morning and they are jumping for joy you are there?  Or stayed to honor a dog as it is put down due to injury or disease?  Or how about chasing down a dog that someone dumped, alone and afraid, out in the woods.   This is the opportunity for saving lives, theirs, yours.   It IS sometimes hard, sometimes fun, sometimes you just can't tell, but it is always meaningful...it is always real life.   This is the place life happens.  Get yours today!  
The Humane Society of McCormick County	131560	6	/users/profile/177125	Jackie27	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	In an economically challenged rural county in SC with no city or county aid for the homeless, neglected, and abused animals, this group of dedicated volunteers do an amazing job!  With a network of foster homes and small, limited, outdoor, but well maintained, shelter facility, this society manages to be a no kill organization and provide low fee spay/neutering as well as adoption opportunities.  For anyone who has been involved in rescue for any period of time, it is apparent that those accomplishments are outstanding as they stand, but they have even larger goals.  HSMC has also managed to acquire land and is working toward the construction of a shelter with indoor facilities, additional exercise areas, and much more.  When supporting this group you can count on your monies and time being well spent and well managed.  I live in a neighboring county and have done only a little volunteering for this organization, but I have many years of experience with rescue efforts, and these people are exceptional in their efforts.

This is the best job I have ever had.  Everyone involved are volunteers. Our care with all dogs begins with a visit to the vet for shots and any other medical care needed.  The dog go to the pens or to a foster home.  We have adoption every Saturday.  All our funds are through donaton.  We received no money from any governmemt agenies.
The Humane Society of McCormick County	107556	2	/users/profile/145756	jar2745	Board Member	5	03/05/2012	I answered the call for a substitute for someone for Monday Mornings.  That was 2 1/2 years ago. I never thought I would be picking up poop when I retired.  I clean up after my furry friend, walk them, rescue them.  My own dog 13 years old passed away in July 2011. My wife and decided not have another dog. We did decide to foster dogs until  they got adopted.  We fostered a dog I helped rescue.  That was 6 months ago and Carly is still here (forever).  Second to the dogs, is the people I have met and worked with.   You never see sad people when working with the dogs.  Many people help in different ways.  A better group you will never meet.

The Humane Society of McCormick County	120964	4	/users/profile/164588	mere33189	Client Served	5	08/18/2012	We adopted our dog from HSOMC.  All of the volunteers at the Petsmart Adoption Event were so kind and helpful.  While we were shopping for our new dog, they offered to watch her.  They also sent us home with her dog food and her favorite bed.  You can tell they truly cared for all of the pets and their well being.  I was simply amazed at all of these incredible individuals who are working so hard to find the pets homes and bring awareness to responsible pet ownership.  I would recommend anyone looking to get a dog or cat to check out HSOMC.  They are a great organization doing a wonderful thing! 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	120843	5	/users/profile/164422	Vicki H.	General Member of the Public	5	08/16/2012	I am a teacher in the rural county served by HSOMC.  For over 12 years, volunteers from the Society have come into the schoo  to share information to our students on proper animal care.  HSOMC has worked hard to develop this education program, and has certainly changed the lives of many of the pets owned by our students.  Many of our students have even convinced their parents to have their pets altered - a truly amazing accomplishment considering the lack of resources and education regarding animal welfare in this county.  There is no animal control or shelter in this county, and the HSOMC does all it can to help these animals who otherwise would have nowhere to go, and no one to care for them.  Given the fact that they have no facility and the "staff" is entirely made up of volunteers, they have done an incredible job.  I am so thankful for the work they do every day. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	96987	4	/users/profile/113369	JannyB	Volunteer	5	08/31/2011	Nothing makes me feel better than to see an animal rescued and then follow it through to a loving adoptive family. We need to travel 3 hours every Saturday to our adoption event because we live in such a rural community. It is worth every hour in the van to give our animals the exposure they need to find the right home. 
The Humane Society of McCormick County	68762	3	/users/profile/75138	AnnetteJ60	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2011	I often find myself at the adoptions over weekends, every time I go across to say hello to the volunteers I am met with friendliness and get a few hugs too.  They never tire of telling the stories of the dogs and cats that are looking for homes, treat them with such love and devotion it usually brings me to tears.  I have volunteered for many organizations over many years and usually there is a sour apple in the mix, but these folks are the real deal.  Too many volunteers are burnt out and don't make it pleasant at all but not the HS of McCormick.  I wish I could help more other than admire them and their dogs.

A Chihuahua and a beautiful blue and white Pit Bull.  Our bulldog, Chunga, is my husbands constant companion and is in his truck everytime he is ready to roll.  He even wears shades and loves the photos people take of him.  Chunga has a beautiful nature and lives quite peacefully with the two Chihuahuas also in my home.  The staff knows each of the personalities of the dogs in their care and try to match their pets with the home.  Even after adopting, I was invited to call if I had any questions about my new babies.  You feel like family when you adopt from this rescue.  You also know you will receive a healthy, happy pet.    I recommend them to anyone wanting to adopt a rescue dog or make a donation.  The rescue is a clean, happy place for the pets in their care and they make all donations count.

All of their animals are  very well taken care of with misting systems, pools and beds. They have a open area for the dogs to have play time and get out and about and relax outside. They recently have moved into their new building which is absolutely stunning. Tons of room for adoption families and visiting appointments. A excellent area with crates inside for the animals as well. They have all ages,breeds, and sizes at the rescue and they all need loving homes.  I highly recommend adopting one of their orphans, They take there time to make sure that each pet is going to a good home, and to the right family. I admire what they do.

I have watched this business first  handed and seen the love  for  these animals. I  was  so  impressed with  the way  of the adoption being  more like a baby than a pup  or  kitty...They truly  follow policy, health, love  , and cleanliness when it comes  to these   animals. You walk  thru and  u just  want  to take them all and love  them. Kudo's to RR for huge  hearts and hard   work!!!! If---  THEY DON'T SEE  Love in your heart, you  will see them  in  your rear  view  mirror  as  you drive  away  without a loving pet.!!! Thanks for caring Richardson Rescue!!!
Richardson Rescue	249648	4	/users/profile/337478	VSKNC	Client Served	5	07/23/2015	We have adopted twice from Richardson Rescue, and we have three rescues, (dogs) total.  Richardson is one of the best, certainly most caring pet rescue groups we've ever dealt with.  They know and love their animals, taking care to make the perfect match for the animal and the adopter.  They do not take the process lightly, wanting each and every adoption to be a success.  When on the rare occasion that it is not, they take back the animal, loving and caring for it until the right person does come along.  We will always support Richardson Rescue and our future adoptions will come from them!

I had just lost my very best friend, my pitbull Reese. My home and heart seemed empty without her in them, and I won't lie, they still do as she was irreplaceable.  But, the staff at Richardson made me feel very welcome and really understood what I was going through! With Reese being my first rescue, I felt that the only way to honor her appropriately was to adopt another dog and give that dog the same loving home that I had given Reese! I actually ended up falling in love with and adopting 2 sweet boys from Richardson, and they are my whole world!! Anyone who has ever loved a dog knows how special that bond is, and I have Richardson Rescue to thank for my sweet babies that are cuddling with me right now!!

I have taken a couple of strays there over the years and they have treated them well and found forever homes for them.  A few weeks ago, there was a sweet lab mix wandering the road, no collar, no info.  He followed my car and I took him to Richardson.  There was no chip, but they took him in and posted pictures and Yay! The sweet boy's owner came in and picked him up.  Although they were full, Janet did not turn this good little pup away. Consider a donation to help feed and keep these pups healthy while they await the new pawrents.  You can easily drop ship food, treats and supplies from Amazon - their web site has a wish list. After the recent fire, they are rebuilding and just as dedicated to saving these lives as before.  Hats off to Janet and her wonderful team of volunteers!

Richardson Rescue	248413	4	/users/profile/336134	lcourtneymom	Client Served	5	07/14/2015	Last Christmas we decided to get a dog for our family. Although we looked around at people selling pets or giving away puppies, we really wanted to adopt. So we started putting out feelers for a pet adoption agency. I submitted applications to several, but the process seemed to take forever! There was always a long wait between submitting my information and actually being approved to come look at a pet. I found Richardson Rescue online, and I called for more information. As soon as I submitted an application, I heard back that very afternoon, and we were invited to come an look at dogs the next day. I know they were thorough in checking because they called our current veterinarian, and they asked relevant questions. But they were also interested in getting us out and actually picking a pet quickly. We were very impressed at how well the staff seemed to treat the animals and how well they knew each one. When we found our sweet girl, it was obvious that she loved them and that they had taken good care of her. Since our adoption, we've gone to volunteer a few times. I'm impressed by how well they keep the animals pens cleaned and keep the animals clean and fed and watered. I'm especially impressed by how they seek to learn each animal's needs and help them become more adoptable by working with them. Even though they are extremely busy, they take the time to know what every animal's temperament is and what they need. I know we've been blessed with a sweet, sweet dog that is the perfect fit for our family. And much of the credit for that goes to Richardson- for the care they took of her before we got her. I'm very thankful!

I went to the Pet Smart in Rock Hill, SC to ask the people more questions about adopting and ended up with Buster!  An amazing dog!  I saw some other dogs, they were nice, the team at Richardson Rescue answered my many questions - newbie - and I was set to leave.  Then I saw Buster and said hello - fell in love.  The first few weeks together were a learning experience for me.  But he was perfect.  A lover, well-trained and likes anyone or anything that passes him by - except squirrels.  I had gotten many compliments on how sweet and well behaved he was and I always wanted to reach out to the organization - and his foster home to THANK THEM!  You can tell he was well-treated there. He loves attention, but if I open my laptop - he walks away.  He does not get on the furniture, he sits when needed and he is 100% house-trained.  I kept preparing myself for an accident or 2 at the beginning, but he is awesome.  Working full-time I knew house-training was not a realistic option for me.  So that was a requirement - but I realize there are no guarantees.So thanks again to the Richardson Rescue folks for helping me and being an amazing middle step for Buster to find his furever home.  Continue the great work.Celia

Richardson Rescue	221960	5	/users/profile/285656	Rolandbones	Volunteer	5	10/11/2014	Having been both volunteer and adopter for a number of years now, I've seen the many facets of fine care, both medical and emotional, given to homeless or unwanted "friends" that have rightfully given Richardson Rescue the five stars above.  Our latest addition at home, Dotty, is an aged  tiny Beagle, who was found wandering, in a parking lot in Rock Hill.  She has a slight limp, and is terrified by unexpected noises.  Yet when outside (or even inside!), should she hear a shot in the woods ring out,  sharp barks from a once noble little hunting dog come alive once more.  We've found that her greatest desire in life is  simply to have a safe, quiet little space to lay down in.  There are precious few of those in parking lots.    Dotty is only one example of the many stories of a loving second chance provided at Richardson Rescue.  Well done and God Bless!!

I came across Richardson Rescue in the search for a dog. I don't remember if it was on Petfinder or Facebook. After seeing Luca, a 5 yr old toy Australian Shepard, I filled out the application for him. My husband works a lot and he was also leaving to go out of town. They were very patient with us on getting down to see him. Once we got there we saw all the dogs they had rescued from Georgia as well as others. 41 Aussies were trusted to them by a breeder in GA who was shutting down. She only trusted RR and with good reasons. They were all very kind, they had bathed Luca for our visit. We have had him for four months now and he's adjusted very well. We have referred friends to them who've adopted and are pleased as well. Thank you RR for all that you do! Steve and Wendy Brown

He is a blond chi & "only the Lord knows" mix and we love him dearly.  We then adopted Pebbles late last year ... also a Chi mix & she is the sweetest, energetic and loving little girl.  Janet's rescue also helped me save the life of a starving blue female pit that my husband & I found wandering our neighborhood with her ribs showing and there was melting snow on the ground.  She was very gentle but shy & it turned out she heart-worm positive.  We already had a pack of dogs in our home so we had to find her a new home.  I contacted Janet & she came to our rescue putting out a Richardson Rescue 911 Alert.  That very same day I got a call & a young lady named Amber immediately drove from York to Charlotte, NC to give Grayce her forever home.  We agreed to fund Grayce's continued heart-worm treatments and she is now negative & healthy!!!   Amber & I are now FB friends and I see wonderful pictures of Grayce and her male pit Tate living the good life and being best buds.  If not for Janet and Richardson Rescue, she would not have the wonderful life she now has.   I respect Janet's rescue and admire Janet greatly for the loving, caring environment she provides to all her pets as they search for the forever homes.

Frank was an older shepherd (sable) adorable.. but Miss Delilah.. looked EXACTLY like the girl I just lost.. I emailed both rescues.. Franks rescue did not respond but someone from Richardson's did.. giving me instructions on how to meet this amazing creature. I applied, we got approved and I can't even begin to tell you how excited and happy we are with our girl Delilah! She is the awesomest dog!! Everyone at Richardson's was so nice when we went to meet and get her. So pleased with the whole expeirence. We took our Delilah to our vet who said, "this dog was well taken care of".. she was clean, well behaved and just amazing. She has been an instant member of my family since the second we met! Can't say enough about Richardson's Rescue and the life saver that rescued me from my saddness of losing my girl to canine degenerative myelopathy before her.

Of the two one was a super handsome guy, and the other was a scrappy guy who had been found nearly starved to death. Upon listening to my stories about my female the staff recommended the scrappy guy because of his personality. They were spot on and he fit in perfectly.  At many rescues they wouldn't take as much time to learn about you and your home go determine the right fit, and my guy was not a looker at the time so he may have been overlooked. Everyone he meets loves him and he has no enemies. Many rescues would have turned him away because of the starved state he was in, but Richardson put the effort into saving him and he's turned into a gorgeous guy. The folks at Richardson love the dogs and cats, love what they do and listen to the folks that come in.  I can't say enough great things about this rescue. I keep in contact, provide updated photos, and they treat my guy like he's still part of their family.

We found our love Bruin (aka) Dallas as a beautiful puppy. We began emailing Richardson Rescue and received an immediate response. We paid a deposit over the web to ensure he would be our precious addition to our family. That was at the beginning of May. We moved to SC on May 14 and simply could not wait to get our boy 4 days earlier than anticipated. When I arrived the area was secluded which I believe is perfect for a rescue. The state in which the animals were cared for you could tell the staff actually cared for them. Bruin is a white Doberman Pinscher, his paws were perfectly pink, coat was excellent they explained all the care he did and would need such as sun block for his big pink nose. He came chipped with a part of the adoption fee and had the shots he had needed up until his age of 10 & 1/2 weeks. The rescue also had no issues with me calling and asking questions or giving them updates of my special boy. I'm so so grateful they helped give me the most important member of my husband & I's family. We do everything with Bruin from hiking to vacations in Massachusetts  and Florida. Thanks again for absolutely everything I appreciate rescues like Richardson Rescue and I highly recommend saving an animal from them and making your home their forever home

We just lost our little girl and were heartbroken. I looked at her picture called my husband over and said what do you think, he said we have to get her. We called went through the adoption process and went to meet her. She stayed inside with them in their office, she was a little skiddish at first but within a few minutes while we were filling out paperwork she relized then she was ours. Her name was Queenie but we changed it to Sammy. She is truly the love of our lives. She is the only child and is a little spoiled but that is was she is for. She is the most loving baby I have ever seen. We have had her a little over a year. I support Richardson Rescue every month and think they are doing such a wonderful job, and it truly shows with all the kids they have for adoption and how well they take care of them. Please support these rescue they are doing a great service for stray and unwanted pets. I hope they are in buisness for a long long time. thanks for all you do.Cheryl S. (Sammys mom)

She had been dropped off the weekend before, left in a cardboard box without food and water over the weekend.  The wonderful folks at Richardson had taken her for vet treatment and helped her relax after what I suspect was a traumatic life.  My grandson bonded with her instantly, she is a beautiful dog.  It is a blessing to have a shelter like this in the area, what a tragedy it would have been if Ruby had not ended up there.  The facilities and staff are very nice.

That statement could not be more true, which is why we continue to donate to them. Each and every time we visit, the pets are running and playing, interacting with visitors, and are genuinely happy. We love coming to visit and have been loyal supporters of the rescue for many years, because of the work they do. This Rescue operates on a shoe string budget and still manages to make magic happen. We have seen pets come in that were terrified, left on the side of the road, abandoned and lonely and with the care and compassion the Staff has, be adopted out as healthy, happy, well socialized family pets. The Staff is truly amazing!! We would encourage everyone to support Richardson Rescue's excellent work by donating. They work very hard and need donations. We will always be there to help them and hope you will too!! GREAT JOB!!!

As we were driving up to the shelter, which is in the middle of nowhere, I was wondering what we were in for, but the old adage applies, "don't judge a book by it's cover". Yes, there are lots of animals and it's chaotic, and it certainly is not a fancy new facility, but the people are awesome! If anyone deserves a new facility it's the great folks at RR. They take the time to research the prospective pet owners and they want to make sure that they are placing these dogs and cats in great households. We recently lost our shepherd due to cancer and we searched high and low for a new addition to the family. We found Coltrane a beautiful lab-shepherd mix and we were excited to hear that all his littermates were adopted as well! We will go back to RR in the future should we decide to expand the family again, and we are sending them pics of Coltrane as he grows up. I am also recommending to all of our dog loving friends, that they donate to RR to help them keep up their wonderful work!

At the time we were new to being "dog" parents and the kind folks at Richardson Rescue were very helpful.  They allowed us time to play and visit with a couple of the dogs to ensure that both the puppy and the family were a good fit.   We thank you for this extra time, as we could not have selected a better pet to bring into our home.    She has brought so much joy to our lives and makes us laugh every day.  She is well behaved and was easy to potty train.   (Although we have to admit that she is a little spoiled!!)   She loves to fetch and play and has learned several tricks which she enjoys showing off when company visits.    We are VERY grateful to Richardson Rescue and thank you for your hard work.

Most Marines present served together in Mogadishu, Somalia(Operation Continue Hope) and Haiti(Operation Support Democracy).  Some of us had not seen each other in over 20 years and came in from all over the nation including Oregon, Texas, Ohio, Florida, Illinois, and New York.This event was incredibly important and impactful in that it brought brothers-in-arms back together after so many years to share in experiences that have profoundly affected our lives. It was in this rare setting and brief period of time that we could hold conversations in which we could not have had with any other and feel perfectly comfortable doing so.  The experience was heart-felt, therapeutic, and rejuvenating to those long held, highly valued friendships. We came together because of all this and we came together, some with personal financial hardship, with no expectations of assistance.This is where organizations like Operation Vet Fit are so critically important.  OVF founder, Dan Gaita, proactively and intentionally saw the opportunity to assist this event.  And it's because of OVF's logistical, financial, and VA benefit educational/awareness support that the reunion was such a tremendous success. Even Hurricane Hermine couldn't undermine this event as it rolled over us.So, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to MGySgt Michael Garcia for donating his home for this event and to OVF and its founders Dan & Erin Gaita for seizing this opportunity to positively impact our Marine veteran community.  They truly demonstrate the value of taking care of our own.Semper Fi and God Bless,Jon Power

Before joining, I had gotten up to 240lbs, was out of shape, unmotivated, and on the road to being booted out of the military. Dan Gaita gave me a few swift boots to the butt, and pushed me to the point that in 2014 I completed my 1st Spartan Race. Since then I have run several 5Ks and 2 10Ks. Without the motivation, camaraderie, and support of the members, I honestly don't know where I would be now. I have let myself slip in recent months, but I will remain in contact with Dan and continue my hard work at OVF. My current plan is to do another Spartan Race this year, if not complete my Spartan Trifecta. With the help of OVF the sky's the limit! Thank you Dan, and thank you OVF!!

I am honored to have been part of Operation Vet-Fit at its inception. It is a genuine grass-roots veterans community helping local veterans. Dan Gaita has gone to extraordinary lengths to make Op Vet-Fit the best not-for-profit for veterans that he can. He and his wife Erin are sustained by their passion and sense of community and camaraderie with our local veterans. This is definitely a worth-while not-for-profit doing important work that goes beyond just a gym. The gym usage is simply a gateway to more extensive services for the important transition work of reintegrating veterans into a post-combat, post-military civilian role, through work-force re-entry opportunities and access to education benefits.
Operation Vet Fit	218452		/users/profile/282016	Ktp7	Volunteer	5	09/30/2014	I must give Operation Vet Fit a 5 because it has been a vehicle for my development as aproductive member of society. I have attended many functions and spend a decent amount if time with various members and have left each event with valuable experiences and life lessons. Being able to "check in" to the gym without actually checking in with anyone when I don't want to be bothered so I can relieve whatever frustrations has also be helpful towards my personal growth. To be a part  of an organization in which the CEO takes personal time to help other veterans to ensure that they don't have to handle their struggles -whatever they may be- alone is reason enough for me to give this a 5/5 rating.  However, I would like to see the members of OVF participate  more with the functions - varying from events to volunteer work aimed to help  others wiki need some sort if assistance. I look forward to more experiences with OVF. Thank you.

Operation Vet Fit	218224	1	/users/profile/281780	crazy-horse	Client Served	5	09/29/2014	When I went to Operation Vet Fit I was a heavy drinker and over 300 pounds.  The PTSD from serving in Viet Nam seriously impacted my life.  Then I met Dan Gaita and started at Operation Vet Fit.  I am now down to my 240's and no longer a heavy drinker.   I can truly say that this is all due to Dan's training methods and patience.  He understands that personal training is not a one size fits all.  He is concerned about the whole person, not just the exercise.  He was able to design a training program that I could, and can, stick to. But it's not just how good I feel physically now that I exercise regularly at Operation Vet Fit.  The camaraderie and emotional support that I get there I could not find elsewhere.  The PTSD won't go away but it doesn't rule my life thanks to all that Dan has put into place for the combat veteran.

Operation Vet Fit	217415	1	/users/profile/280940	rwelch53	General Member of the Public	5	09/25/2014	I cannot begin to let everyone know just how valuable Operation Vet Fit is.  My husband is one of the vets who has benefited in more ways than I can list from his association with Operation Vet Fit in general and Dan Gaita in particular.   Physically, my husband has lost over 60 pounds since starting at the gym under Dan's guidance.  He has gone from being winded walking up the driveway to exercising 5-6 days a week and feeling great.  He was actually considering knee replacement surgery because he could barely walk and now he can walk for hours. But that is only part of the story.  He has done so well because Operation Vet Fit provides our veterans with a place that says "we honor, respect and thank you" for all the sacrifices that you have made on our behalf.  The support that Dan provides in every aspect that the veteran needs cannot be overstated.  If all charities were as dedicated and true as Operation Vet Fit is, there would be so many more people helped.

Operation Vet Fit	217337	1	/users/profile/280860	John276	Client Served	5	09/25/2014	Operation Vet Fit makes tangible the concept of "support for the veterans community". While many can say the right words, Dan Gaita has made those words come alive. The facility itself reflects "pride" and I often wonder about how many people have been touched in various ways as they walk by the window. Certainly those with husbands, wives, sons, daughter, grandsons and granddaughters on active duty have to be moved by this facility and what it represents. Dan Gaita is passionate about what he is doing and this is evidenced in the way he approaches Operation Vet Fit.  In my experience veterans have learned not to expect too much. Dan and Vet Fit break that mold. He makes the members feel that their service to our country is valued.  He makes the world a better place by what he is doing and I just wish other towns and states could clone him because he is really making a difference here in the Bethel community. JohnS
Operation Vet Fit	217313	4	/users/profile/280836	SgtMajE	Advisor	5	09/25/2014	The driving force behind Operation Vet Fit is Danny Gaita, a man who goes out of his way to make others feel important. He is generous with his time and resources and genuine to the organization's purpose.  He is man of principle who truly places the needs and concerns of others ahead of his own.  His efforts set an example for leaders in the community to emulate and keeps veteran's issues relevant in a contemporary society where the armed services are at war while the rest of America is at the mall.  Operation Vet Fit does more with minimal resources than any organization of its kind that I know of.   Seeking sustainable solutions to the myriad problems plaguing our combat veterans is no easy task.  I applaud the courage and tenacity of this organization and admire the way that Danny knows everyone personally by name and can tell you about each veteran's service as well.  His give a damn meter is pegged. That is a leader.  
Operation Vet Fit	217287	3	/users/profile/280809	Bradley N.	Volunteer	5	09/25/2014	Operation Vet-Fit provides a great service to the community of Veterans not only in the Bethel area but around the country. This is achieved by building a community of like minded veterans who will assist and be there for each other. Vet Fit offers a number of different services to veterans, such as ; free access to a gym with supplements abound, free fitness classes, free and discounted outdoor trips where te healing power of nature comes into play, a veterans lounge with full facilities (kitchen, internet, etc.), a "bunker" where vets can get together and watch sporting events in a comfortable and judgement free environment (well as much as possible with a group of veterans ;-p). All in all operation Vet Fit has found a niche to fill for veterans who have seen little community support from townships and government. Keep up the good work OVF!

Our passion and mission is to make sure combat veterans returning home and have returned home from prior wars, know they are appreciated and  have access to what they have earned by way of benefits, education etc.  We also created a place for them to come and exercise and meet not only other combat veterans, but supportive community donors.

Cathy Trope approaches behavioral concerns with the question "Where does this horse hurt?" and together with her team of volunteers, vets and other therapists, they develop a plan to improve the quality of life and quality of movement: Polo Pony Rescue works relentlessly to educate adopters on horse care and horsemanship.  The follow up on adopted horses is excellent and Cathy knows not only where the placed horses are but also HOW they are thriving! I highly recommend this group as a resource for adoption and as a deserving charity. They give all the horses the chance to become the best versions  of themselves.

Within two months I'd more than doubled my knowledge!  At PPR, the horses come first, first and first. I've seen lame, grouchy, unfriendly mares transform into sound, friendly, competitive jumpers. I've seen starvation cases turn into fat, happy trail horses. I've seen ancient, toothless, skinny stallions transformed into fat, shiny, retired pets. I've made friends with kind, hardworking, generous volunteers.  I've been with Polo Pony Rescue for over 4 1/2 years and I'm so grateful for the opportunity and am impressed with the integrity of this amazing charity.

I started helping out as a working student with the trainer there when they were in California and I ended up falling in love with one of the rescues and adopted her. Poptart is the best little horse and just babysits anyone that's on her, definitely worth having a second horse ;) I would highly recommend adopting from them if interested in a horse the owner is extremely knowledgeable and won't let her horses go to just anyone. They are always vetted and cared for properly, no such thing as a skinny horse there!

We saw his picture on vacation , and it said "someone that can afford to feed him." I pointed that out to my husband but he could only see the horse, I was swept up in it when I met him, a truly remarkable horse you could have coffee with. Two weeks after we got him, it became apparent that Cathy was not exaggerating . Polo Pony Rescue took him back, with me crying before they got there. I stopped by this rescue many times, sometimes unannounced , and everything was always perfect . Very happy, well taken care of horses. We have the same farrier, and we discuss how we could help this rescue, because each horse is treated like a 6million dollar horse. If you are looking for a smart, kind rescue, look no further, you just found Polo Pony Rescue!
Polo Pony Rescue	299259	3	/users/profile/390172	Alexandra20	Donor	5	08/04/2016	This organization should be the base model for all rescues. It is professionally managed with all attention and focus given to the horses in their care. The most important attribute, in my opinion, is that they are financially responsible and only admit what they can properly care for. The horses are priority number one and their best interest is always at heart. This organization will always be a go to for future donations and I will hopefully someday to a proud adopter of a polo pony rescue!

I sent an inquiry when I was looking to adopt a horse and Cathy was extremely transparent in how they operated and that at the moment they didn't have a match for me. Our paths crossed again later when I adopted a horse from a different rescue. Through this crossing, I did come up and see their facility and WOW! It was impeccably clean, all the horses were fat and happy and each of them got an ample amount of turn out time. Extremely impressed with both their transparency along with how the horses are treated. Hell, I wish I was a horse there!
Polo Pony Rescue	296845	2	/users/profile/286133	Responsible_Donor	Donor	5	07/17/2016	If I could award 6 stars, I would...Polo ponies spend their playing years working hard and being a good part of a team.  Once those days are over, they are useful in less-stressful private homes.  Their readjustment care at the hands of experienced, compassionate Cathy Trope is a model for other rescues.  It really is ALL about the horses.  You can donate here - and adopt - knowing the ethics are as good as the knowledge.

In every visit I have observed every horse is cared for on an individual basis according to their needs and preferences.  Plus excellent judgement on the level of veterinary care.  I highly recommend this rescue with its very unusual niche specialty - polo ponies transform into good riding horses with the right training, and have many good qualities normally overlooked.

Polo Pony Rescue	258408	2	/users/profile/346900	Rita-AnimalScouts	Volunteer	5	09/19/2015	Polo Pony Rescue is a top notch operation. It is clean and well managed and is run by a knowledgeable and caring staff. Cathy Trope has her heart in the right place and it shows. She works day and night to ensure the quality care the horses receive... from the young ones to the older retirees. I have never seen older horses (20-40 years) in such amazing condition and maintaining such hearty, healthy weight. It is truly an achievement and speaks volumes to Cathy's knowledge and commitment. Their trainer, Danica, is another example of why this rescue is amazing. She has the gift of knowledge and a way with horses. Her gentle, patient way is effective. I have seen her take horses that were aggressive and change them into gentle animals. So for me, being a small part of this rescue as a volunteer is also learning experience. They welcome all help and are friendly and supportive. I feel lucky to be a part of what they do.

Polo Pony Rescue	255617	2	/users/profile/344001	Marie2121	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	Volunteering for the Polo Pony Rescue has been nothing but a fantastic experience. Facilities are kept clean and are well maintained (not to mention quite beautiful). It's always amazing to see the horses that come in with poor health, and are extremely under weight, becoming happy and healthy within a matter of a few months. After returning to health, they then go into training so that they can find a new  home where they can thrive. Cathy and Danica are very knowledgeable and friendly.  They work very hard to keep the barn and horses in awesome condition. The success they have had with bringing these horses into good condition and adopting them out to stable homes, is a direct reflection of the amount of hard work that they put into this rescue. It is that dedication and commitment that makes it an absolute joy to volunteer for the Polo Pony Rescue. 
Polo Pony Rescue	255604	2	/users/profile/343989	Deanna22	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	I just happen to stumble across PPR looking to adopt a horse. Little did I know, Kathy was about to educate me on horse ownership and the hours of hard work and constant around the clock care a horse required. I realized that horse ownership was not for me but leasing and volunteering was, it helped me understand and perform required care and maintenance one needs to own a horse. Kathy does a fabulous job running PPR and the horses she cares for are super lucky to have her and every volunteer!! I love PPR and everything they do. Thank you PPR!!

Polo Pony Rescue	255578	2	/users/profile/343967	Tamara29	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	This rescue is phenomenal! The horses are treated with the utmost compassion and respect. Cathy & Danica are a wealth of knowledge and the barn and horses are immaculate. I cherish my time with the horses, they are wonderful. If you are looking for a great volunteer opportunity get in touch with Cathy!
Polo Pony Rescue	255532	1	/users/profile/343915	Cad0900cad	Volunteer	5	09/09/2015	I have the privilege of working with this great organization. I got involved after I adopted my current horse from another nonprofit rescue.  Their knowledge and care for their horses and the networking and resourcing to help those they cannot take in is inexhaustible. The horses get plenty of turn out daily, and exercised regularly. The facilities are kept clean and you won't find a more fun loving group if people that care so deeply for horses. I love coming to help with any chores needing done! 
Polo Pony Rescue	237168		/users/profile/148548	sunnie	Client Served	5	01/22/2015	Cathy Trope and Polo Pony Rescue go the extra distance to help whenever they can.  I have been an equestrian my entire life and have also, in my younger years been a rescuer, rehabber and re-homer.. I currently have 3 geriatric seniors (30, 31 and 32) that have special needs and that I have had most their lives.  I also have 3 rideable horses.  Recently I was sent a horse that was not what it was shared to be and it needed more than I could offer it.  In order to continue to provide what the geriatrics in my care needed, and keep them in my care, I had to reach out for help.  I called a dozen rescues and rehab facilities.  Only a few even gave me the courtesy of a reply to say they were full.  Cathy not only replied to me, but consulted and advised.  She also saw potential in this horse and went above and beyond to reach out to some of her resources that had the means to provide him the treatment he needed to become a great candidate for rehomeing.  She indeed found him an exemplary place. I am forever grateful for her candor and passion and will support PPR endeavors as much as I am able
Polo Pony Rescue	223370		/users/profile/287122	Michelle266	Client Served	5	10/16/2014	When we were looking for our first ever horse, we came across Polo Pony Rescue, and were immediately impressed by the care that Cathy takes in placing her horses in the best homes for their individual needs.  She interviewed us and made sure that we were educated on what is required to keep and care for a horse before approving us for adoption.  She also checked our references, and the barn where we are boarding our horse.  When we met her, she had my daughter ride several of her horses, to see which would be the best fit for beginners.  Since we adopted our horse, Cathy has been there 24/7 to answer any questions we have.  She also enjoys hearing my stories about our horse, because she sincerely cares for him, and all of her horses. On that note, it is evident by Cathy's interactions with each of her horses that she truly values them for who they are as individuals.  She loves and respects them, no matter how young or old they are, and she looks for the strengths in each one.  She is also committed to working with them to solve any problems they may have.  Her attention to their daily care is excellent, and she knows what she is doing.  To her, they are all special and valuable, and it shows.   I could not recommend Polo Pony Rescue more highly, and am so glad that we adopted our first horse from such a solid, reputable rescue.  
Polo Pony Rescue	223227		/users/profile/286969	33RanchoRemuda	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/15/2014	Cathy Trope and Polo Pony Rescue are my heroes, they always put the best interests of the horses first and the standards of care are very high. Cathy truly cares about the horses she rescues, she goes to great lengths to make them happy and healthy, also following up on those that get adopted out. If I didn't have my own little rescue in the desert I would definately donate some of my hard earned dollars to Polo Pony Rescue!
Polo Pony Rescue	222898		/users/profile/140947	blackgold	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2014	I've known Cathy for years. She has never failed to fully support the horses no matter where they are. She's  extremely honest and one of few in whom I have complete trust. This is one organization in which you can believe and support. She's in this for the horses, not for the fame.
Polo Pony Rescue	222886		/users/profile/286634	PoloPonyGirls	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2014	Cathy goes out of her way to care for these amazing Polo Ponies and gives them a place to call home when others have turned a blind eye! She should be commended. We greatly appreciate all she has done for these horses that are truly deserving of care and love. Keep up the great work! We know just how hard you work and we are truly grateful for people like you! 
Polo Pony Rescue	222824		/users/profile/286567	Diana74	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2014	This rescue has been a priceless advocate that I have used time and again. Cathy has never failed to help. She is responsible for me getting the history on my beloved rescue pony that was abandoned and starving. It has turned into a marvelous story of a horse brought here from Argentina, a real champion who won everything she ever did. Cathy helped me connect with the groom who cared for my mare during her career, and he informed me what a special horse she is......and she Is.  Thank you Polo Pony rescue for giving me the time and effort to help track her brand also. I am so grateful.
Polo Pony Rescue	222801		/users/profile/286543	Joan54	Client Served	5	10/14/2014	Polo Pony rescue is an invaluable organization!  Cathy puts her heart & soul into this, and is the eyes and ears of what happens to  a ton of polo ponies once they are done being able to play. She is highly respected and it is not only comforting but important to have someone doing what she is doing.  Thank you so much. Our horses thank you as well.
Polo Pony Rescue	222790		/users/profile/286532	Vickie S.	Donor	5	10/14/2014	I have known the woman behind Polo Pony Rescue since 2006 when she helped me  rescue a horse from being put on a slaughter truck. She knows horses and horse care inside and out and treats every horse like it was her very own.  To take in unwanted horses because of age or injury or that "my daughter went off to college and isn't interested in horses anymore" Polo Pony Rescue is able to usually rehab the horses so they can continue to live a fulfilled and active life!  They're not just put in a pasture or a barn and forgotten. They are tended to all the time!  With quality food, air, exercise and social interactions both with people and other horses.  I have been involved with a lot of rescue organizations (both horse and dog/cat) and Polo Pony Rescue is the top in my opinion. I wish all rescues could take a lesson from Polo Pony Rescue! We'd have less "backyard breeders" and less horses ending up on a truck to Mexico if they knew how to successfully rehab old and/or thin horses!  Every one of them gets a chance at a better life. Including the people who benefit from rehabbed and fit horses! 
Polo Pony Rescue	222782		/users/profile/286526	Summerhawk01	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2014	This rescue is always trying to help these horses.  They do a great job.  
Polo Pony Rescue	222487		/users/profile/279769	irked	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2014	Polo Pony Rescue is run with honesty, integrity and non-stop photographic up-dates on the horses in their care, a rare gem. Best of all, horses are the first, last and middle priority.I got to know Cathy Trope through our mutual interest in fair and humane treatment for animals. She is funny, smart, direct, passionate and driven. Lucky is the forgotten red broodie who ends up in her care.
Polo Pony Rescue	222475		/users/profile/286182	tristanjade	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/14/2014	Excellent rescue with qualified, experienced staff knowledgeable in equine care, health (mental and physical) and placement. They understand all aspects of rehabilitating horses and finding appropriate follow up careers or retirement homes. 
Polo Pony Rescue	222435	1	/users/profile/286142	Jen_M	General Member of the Public	5	10/13/2014	I am very careful about where I donate my hard earned dollars because there is so much fraud in the rescue business.    PPR is a rescue that should be applauded for setting such a high standard and showing rescue can be done correctly and honestly.  Everyone from the founders to the volunteers puts the needs of the horses first. They don't think twice about giving up personal time if something requires immediate attention.  Their knowledge of all things equine is amazing and any horse taken in by them has it made. While their main focus is polo ponies, they don't restrict their intake to only polo ponies.   Any horse they take in will be given the best of care and training, and the staff is so very careful about who they select to adopt them, as it should be.    As a former Board of Director for another horse rescue, I will say if the rescue were even half as good as PPR, it would be in good shape.   They have raised the rescue bar and are to be commended for being an example of horse (or animal) rescue done right. Kudos to all involved with this wonderful rescue. 
Polo Pony Rescue	222426	1	/users/profile/50289	icer	Donor	5	10/13/2014	I support this rescue primarily because of their honesty and candor regarding donations and the uses to which monies are put. I cannot afford much but feel as though my efforts are both noticed and appreciated. I especially love the additional time and training this rescue puts into the animals to make them more adoptable! I also love the time she takes to educate horse owners such as myself.
Polo Pony Rescue	222425		/users/profile/286132	Noraw	General Member of the Public	5	10/13/2014	Polo Pony Rescue is a rescue with incredible dedication for helping polo ponies and non polo ponies alike. They spend time and effort insuring that the horses they adopt out go to appropriate homes as well as ensuring every horse that gets dropped with them receives appropriate care and treatment.
Polo Pony Rescue	222423		/users/profile/286129	Karen298	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2014	Polo pony rescue has been a much needed entity for the sport I love for a long while. It is managed by professionals who understand the process of retrieving, feeding, caring for, retraining  of, maintaining and matching up ex polo ponies who were at risk after a lifetime of training in the sport with prospective horsemen who are interested in reaping the benefits of a well trained horse. I would say PPR exercises due diligence in finding and networking at risk horoses and reaching out to the polo community for history, information and previous ownership in order to better serve the horse and their next human companion as well as letting the community know there are options available rather than a KB sale pen. Kudos to PPR for doing something for the horses that make the sport of polo what it is! Would be wonderful to see the USPA involved as a support system.
Polo Pony Rescue	222421		/users/profile/286127	Hannah29	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2014	I have known PPR since their inception, and can't say enough good things about them.  They spend endless amounts of time learning all they can about their rescues, and are always extremely careful about where they place their horses.  Their willingness to take back any adoptee for any reason is also amazing.  But what really makes PPR special is the people.  Cathy and her volunteers are so incredibly dedicated to their cause, and so knowledgeable about horses in general, and polo ponies specifically.  Thank you PPR for all you do!
Polo Pony Rescue	222420		/users/profile/286126	DownCenterlineDressage	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/13/2014	Polo Pony Rescue is a very well run rescue. They take fantastic care of their horses - not only their health, but they also invest in training. They are reasonable about which horses they can help and manage their finances responsibly. The Board of PPR brings decades of experience in horsemanship, rescue and marketing.  
Polo Pony Rescue	203209	1	/users/profile/265046	Stacy38	Volunteer	5	06/18/2014	Polo Pony Rescue is a rescue that does it right!  The horses are always well fed, and content.  The barn is always clean and the horses have quality food.   Before they are adopted out they are evaluated for training abilities and if they have any medical issues.    My son has volunteered for service hours and always has greatly enjoyed his time there.  As do I.  I just wish more rescues would mirror Polo Pony's guidelines. 
Polo Pony Rescue	203046	1	/users/profile/264834	rochelle55	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/17/2014	This is a Amazing place! The Rescue is always clean, stalls,walkway, and turnouts. The hay barn has always top quality hay and supplements.  The facility is staffed with volunteers and the kind ladies who run the Rescue. Unlike some Rescues they really want the horses to find homes.. The turn around is fairly brisk..Yet the horses and people are carefully matched. If the horse does not work out they are welcomed back... Kathy Trope is in it for all the right reasons. I have stopped by to look at a horse on a Saturday with out a appointment and always found the place spotless and the horses happy. Truly a wonderful spot for a horse in need to land..  
Polo Pony Rescue	203037	1	/users/profile/264821	BrassRingSunFarms	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/16/2014	I am a local horse trainer who works with Polo Pony Rescue.  The board is knowledgeable and realistic, and they follow through with every aspect of the rescue - from helping horses truly in need, to great care while the horses are with the rescue, and then finding a great adoptive home or retirement situation and keeping track of their horses once they leave the facility.A horse that comes through PPR is truly safe for life. They take all the right steps and get great people involved at every possible point in the process. The volunteer network is small but hardworking, and every aspect of the rescue is professionally maintained, from the facility itself to their web presence.
Polo Pony Rescue	203033	1	/users/profile/264817	Jelena W.	Volunteer	5	06/16/2014	Great place for equestrians to volunteer. The facility is small but is kept up properly with all horses receiving everything they need, including chiropractor and massage. Volunteers are appreciated and given many ways to help out according to their skills and interests. I love knowing there is no drama, no cutting corners with horse care, and no BS! I can relax and enjoy volunteering knowing the organization has everything in order to do a great job.

Polo Pony Rescue	171769	1	/users/profile/227421	Bridget7	Volunteer	5	09/25/2013	I volunteer at PPR when I have time inbetween my own two horses.  She has brought horses back to life from starvation / neglect / abuse.  She always posts updates on the horses she has, she actively works on finding them the right home and she walks her talk.  Her doors are always open to whoever wants to drop in for a visit.  There is nothing ever to hide and she is always honest.  This is the real deal folks.
Polo Pony Rescue	160114	1	/users/profile/212344	Rachel88	Client Served	5	06/09/2013	I had the most wonderful experience with PPR when I adopted by 17 year old OTTB mare from them last year. Cathy was absolutely wonderful to work with and was very attentive to ensure the proper home was found for the mare.  I send her progress reports on how the mare is coming along in her dressage career.  I would highly recommend PPR as an organization to adopt from as they take the time to get to know you and ensure that you get a horse that will suit your needs.

They also provided an excellent boarding location, perfect for my quarantine needs for a few weeks.  I highly recommend them, they are excellent horsewomen in every way! 
Polo Pony Rescue	159996	1	/users/profile/212201	Rhea R.	Client Served	5	06/07/2013	We adopted our most recent rescue from PPR and am blessed with an awesome horse that is even more then I expected. Cathy has a way of knowing what horse will be a good fit for you. She's realistic and doesn't sugar coat so if you desire straight forward, contact PPR. If they doesn't have what you're looking for, Cathy can probably find it. I've watched her rescue horses privately for the past 8 years that I've known her. The organization may be new but the person behind it is very experienced. PPR doesn't just work to support their own rescue but also works diligently to assist many others in finding homes for horses. Stepping up to assist the horses before they have a life altering experience at an auction is an honorable task and often the most financially draining. Donors often respond to starved horses as opposed to the early interventions. I wish more people supported this process before our horses wear an auction tag. PPR is a reputable org that holds themselves to the highest of standards. There are only four rescue's I will donate to and they are at the top of my list. 
Polo Pony Rescue	159888	2	/users/profile/212077	Karen175	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/06/2013	The selection of choices doesn't include Foster Farm, but really, that is what I am.  I currently board three horses that belong to Polo Pony Rescue and I have to say that my experience has been a pleasant one.  I look forward to continuing my dealings with them.   One of the many things that I like about PPR is that they have such high expectations for the quality of care for their horses.  They are constantly checking on them, requesting current photos which I believe is important.  I send emails and texts, sharing the goofy or funny things that the horses do and they take delight in each!  I routinely see photos of their horses on Facebook, talking about good they look, which is really a "shout out" for me.  I treat each horse as if they were my own and it's good to know that my efforts and care are appreciated.
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	310896		/users/profile/276095	Brooke10	Volunteer	5	10/14/2016	SC CARES founders Cindy and Skip changed my life while changing the lives of countless animals. 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	212984	2	/users/profile/276095	Brooke10	Volunteer	5	09/01/2014	When I first met Cindy and Skip I realized they were special human beings; humble and hopeful. They sold their homes, property, and forfeited their once normal and comfortable lives. They traded their lives for the sake of their beliefs. Not many of us are willing to do that. Not many humans believe so strongly in their principles to take such a large risk to move to a rural property and begin to set up a rescue, rehabilitation, and most importantly a sanctuary for so many living beings. I had the opportunity to volunteer frequently with Cindy and Skip (SC CARES founders) for a full year before moving out of SC. In that year I observed the compassion they showed for each animal whether with a shell, feathers, or fur. No animal was small enough to be discounted by Cindy. Many days when I showed up, Cindy was busy bottle feeding possums, an animal that most people find to be scary and a nuisance. She would stroke the tortoises shelsl making them dance under her hands. She would speak softly and calmly, whispering sweet nothings into Dennis the deer's ear. Despite her hectic and busy schedule taking care of the hundreds of animals daily, Cindy spends time each day showing every animal affection and love. One thing that is always poignant in my mind is that each animal that passes has a funeral, a burial, and a little plot in the front yard that unfortunately grows every year. Every animal matters and every animal deserves respect.  Cindy and Skip have given so many deserving animals a second chance and the opportunity to live out their lives in a safe, loving, and comfortable environment. I frequently think of the impact that SC CARES has on the animals who were irresponsibly purchased and/or attained. Cindy is constantly turning away animals in need not because she does not care, but because resources (food, space, shelter, and money) are scarce. This world needs more people like Cindy and Skip. Their wholesome compassion for life and the living is a testament to the type of people they are and the organization that they run.

These animals needed the very special safe place to survive and were taken in with loving open arms. The folks at SC-Cares are definitely angels who give their heart, sole and countless time to care for each and every animal and hours on end trying to raise funds to support the rescue. Please help support their wonderful organization for the sake of the animals who couldn't help themselves and would have likely perished without them.

It is a very rewarding place yo volunteer, as the animals here have a way of thanking you for just being there. They know they are in a loving place.We need more places like SC Cares, as they also work hard to educate people on animal abuse, the care required for exotics and the commitments and responsibilities required when owning an animal.

Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	302700		/users/profile/393858	MissMolly	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2016	Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary goes as far as humanly possible to care for a wide range of wild animals, promotes proper education to all ages, and helps the community when a wild animal needs medical care and placement.  While this all sounds routine it is far from that!  This husband and wife team has dedicated their life to these animals.  Even while the husband was newly diagnosed with cancer and undergoing treatment they both continued to put the animals and public first.  So much compassion just exudes from both of them and they need the financial assistance to keep the Sanctuary properly up and running.  The public needs to keep this Sanctuary going.   Factual and compassion is needed to be taught by the Sanctuary to the general public.  Please consider any amount of dollar assistance to this most WONDERFUL facility.   This place is a little gem of humanity, love, devotion, caring, compassion.  Thank you for your consideration,  Joan House
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	302688		/users/profile/393845	Nancy262	Volunteer	5	09/06/2016	SC-Cares is a much needed and often overlooked sanctuary in Georgetown County, SC. Cindy and staff treat each resident with more love and compassion than some people treat their elderly parents! As a part-time volunteer, I see the need for a donation that would be considered "pennies from heaven". It would enable the facility to complete the unfinished aviary giving a larger home for more than 75 large unwanted birds.Winning $20,000 would make a huge difference!!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	302641		/users/profile/393783	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2016	I knew the couple who started this great Wildlife Sanctuary before they did it.  I remember the hope they had for what they wanted to do. They sold everything they owned so they could set up a place to put exotic unwanted/neglected/orphaned/abused and any other reason an animal needed, and give sanctuary to them.  It truly is an animal sanctuary in every sense of the word, and they give each and every one of their rescues time and attention, medical care and love.  I toured their facility a few years ago and was astounded at how much they have accomplished even under great difficulties and setbacks.  They are always hoping to expand to help even more animals in need but need the funds to do it.  If anyone deserves a reward for all they do, SC-CARES does.
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	298619		/users/profile/389506	Bradley F.	Volunteer	5	07/30/2016	I was introduced to the founders of SC-CARES through my father, who performed pro-bono legal work for them when they moved to Georgetown, SC and opened up the sanctuary. Since that time I have experienced the pleasure of witnessing their unyielding commitment to not only those animals in their direct care, but to animals outside of the sanctuary. Skip and Cindy understand these precious and spiritual beings need love, comfort and stability, since most of them come from chaotic circumstances of which they had no choice. Cindy and Skip take measures to avoid placing undue stress on the animals and have made a lifelong commitment to providing a final home for these majestic beings.

Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	298298		/users/profile/389145	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/27/2016	I became interested in SC CARES when I moved here 5 years ago.  The owner would write such wonderful articles in The Sun paper and I decided I wanted to see this place for myself.  I had never seen many of her animals anywhere else except the zoo.  The amount of work that goes into caring for these animals on a day to day basis is staggering.  It's hard work and few volunteers are willing to do what it takes.  It would be great if they could hire someone to help on a full time basis.  Please provide them with as much financial support as possible.

I wish I could go everyday and give them a million dollars. They give all they got everyday and it is exhausting but they keep on plugging along. Even with Skips cancer and brutal chemo treatments  they kept this place going. 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	298172		/users/profile/389016	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	07/26/2016	Have a dear friend who volunteers on a regular basis and I hear wonderful stories about their good works and unending love and devotion for these rescued animals.  True love!  Her husband also builds tortoise homes for the rescued tortoises.  Attend their annual Dinner and raffle!  Good fun and benefits SC Cares!

Cindy, Skip & all the others do a wonderful job ensuring that these precious critters have a safe & healthy place to call home.
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	243986	2	/users/profile/330842	Melanie51	Volunteer	5	05/30/2015	Up until late February of this year, I had been a hands on, get down and dirty (and bitten...hehehe), volunteer for SC CARES for over 3 years. Unfortunately health issues have gotten in my way and I am no longer able to work intimately with the wonderful creatures who live there. I hate waking up on Saturday mornings now knowing I cannot go interact with my creature friends which was my stress relief after a long week at work. I now donate monthly, I am trying to do fund raising activities, and anything else I am able to do for them (like "Walk for a Dog" every day when I walk my pups and they then donate to SC CARES). SC CARES is awesome! They  do wonderful things for every creature until they close their eyes for the final time. Please help them however you can! Go to their webpage and donate! Thank you!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	225761	3	/users/profile/289516	wolfdogz	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	Skip and Cindy are amazing people and have dedicated so much time and effort into caring for these animals. It is beyond a full time job for them and I am envious of their dedication. I recently went on a service trip to volunteer at the sanctuary and it was one of the best experiences of my life! They somehow manage to run the sanctuary and an ice cream shop in town, where Skip hand makes all the flavors (and its amazing ice cream too!). They are so passionate about this cause and deserve a lot more recognition. 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	225260	3	/users/profile/289030	Kim_158	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2014	Over the summer, I, along with about 36 other individuals had a tour at SC-Cares. Cindy, Skip and all the volunteers were most knowledgeable, experienced and wonderful tour guides.  they showed how much they all cared about each animal at the center and have a vested interest in their well being.  I cannot speak highly enough of the wonderful things that are happening there and wish more people knew about this center and provided them with the needed support and means to provide for all the animals.  Kudos to all they do and here's to many more years of caring and compassion for those creatures that cannot speak for themselves.  I'm sure Pickles, the one bird there, would express it's gratitude and say "Thank you for caring for, rescuing, and loving me!" 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	225186	3	/users/profile/288957	KellyMauMar	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	Cindy and Skip work so hard all day long, every day, 365 days a year, feeding and caring for the animals for which they provide shelter.  They care for horses, pigs, deer, tortoises, goats, chickens....and even more! They provide a safe place for abused and neglected farm animals (for the most part they are farm animals).  I have volunteered in the past helping to feed and clean up after the animals. Currently I pick up meat and produce donations for the animals from our local grocery stores, and deliver those donations to the Sanctuary.   I must say, it is not easy caring for the animals. One is usually tromping through mud and poop to care for them!  Also, the water bowls are emptied and scrubbed every day and then filled up with fresh water. Cindy and Skip could very much use this grant money to help build the aviary that they are currently working on, and even to hire some part-time help!   They need the help!!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	224613	3	/users/profile/288367	Kathie5	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	A more passionate group of people you will not find anywhere. They have a heart for the animals and go above and beyond for them. Take some tome and go visit. You will be glad you did. There are so many ways to support this group. I use the app Walk for a Dog nearly every day, every little bit helps.
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	224584	4	/users/profile/288342	Betty67	Donor	5	10/20/2014	This organization does all it can for many animals that have no where else to turn! Cindy and Skip along with their volunteers take excellent care of these animals! I learned of this organization last year and do not live close enough to do more than donate. But from following them try Facebook I have understood their passion and commitment to those who cannot help themselves!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	224581	4	/users/profile/288339	Carrol U.	Donor	5	10/20/2014	My family has supported SC cares since it's inception with donations of car, money, visiting the sanctuary. We know how hard the owners and volunteers work by watching them in action. They truly love the animals as do the volunteers. It is good to see a non profit actually spend the monetary donations on the animals and not using for themselves. 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	224561	3	/users/profile/288319	newmustangsal	Donor	5	10/20/2014	I have supported SC Cares since a visit with my grandchildren 5 years ago. They are wonderful in every way. I feel comfortable that every dollar goes for the animals.

Cindy and Skip give so much of their lives to caring for these animals that otherwise would have no place to go. It is such an heart warming experience to get to volunteer and spend time with these wonderful creatures. 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	224336	1	/users/profile/288094	Paige8	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	I had the pleasure of going down to SC CARES with a group of fellow students from Appalachian State University during our fall break this weekend. I was absolutely blown away by the passion that Cindy and Skip have for each and every one of the animals that they have at their sanctuary. It was so amazing to be able to work with people who care so much about what they are doing. They definitely put the animals first, which was extremely important to me. The property is very well maintained and makes for a beautiful and tranquil environment for every animal that they have. I cannot wait to come back to SC CARES one day! 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	222156		/users/profile/285843	Deborah101	Donor	5	10/12/2014	I first heard of SC Cares when my husband and I were visiting my brother-in-law, who is a volunteer with this wonderful animal rescue/sanctuary. We have gone with him to visit the animals while he is working with them and have met Cindy and Skip as well as others of the dedicated volunteers that help out.  I really appreciate the open and loving hearts that Cindy,Skip and all the others have for all animals. I am so impressed with what they have done for the animals in their care and know that they would do more for others as money, room and manpower will permit. They have great care for the animals!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	222032		/users/profile/285724	Melanie64	Volunteer	5	10/12/2014	I have been a volunteer for SC CARES for almost 3 years. I fell in love with SC CARES on a visit and just felt I had to be a part of helping all of the animals. Cindy and Skip are two of the most awesome people you will ever meet and their 24/7 devotion to ALL of the animals is amazing! We always need donations and more volunteers, but we do what needs to be done to make sure the animals are cared for each and every day (sometimes it is even just Cindy by herself feeding 170+ animals, she has such devotion!). I love working with the animals and it has become my weekly "retreat" to keep myself grounded. Set up a tour, you will love meeting all the animals!!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	222030		/users/profile/285722	Sarah205	Volunteer	5	10/12/2014	I have been volunteering at SC CARES for about 5 years now.  Sometimes I just help at fundraisers, but if I am lucky, I have time to go to the sanctuary and help the animals directly by feeding, cleaning, and loving.  This is a top notch rescue sanctuary who needs your help!  Money works if you can't.Sarah
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	181496		/users/profile/238222	thompsonsl1	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	Volunteering with SC-CARES was such a great experience. I went with ASU for Fall Break, and it was truly wonderful, Skip and Cindy were so passionate and caring about all the animals, and I learned so much from just being around them. I hope they continue to do good work for animals in the future. 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	179658	1	/users/profile/236305	Ryan39	Donor	5	10/18/2013	SC-CARES is a organization that is built on the love of animals of all kinds.  I had the pleasure to visit this past summer and would encourage anyone locally to do so as well.  Sc-CARES survives on donations and every dollar donated really does make a difference.  I would encourage anyone that has a love for animals to get more information on the organization and make a donation to help save our furry friends!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	179602		/users/profile/236245	Jessica138	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2013	SC-CARES is truly a wonderful organization. Cindy and Skip are so passionate about caring for animals and it shows as soon as you drive onto the property. I was truly fascinated by their knowledge and love for the animals. It was amazing to see so many exotic animals being cared for by such a small organization. I would recommend this place for anyone to visit and volunteer. If I lived closer, I would be a committed volunteer. I love spreading the word of how wonderful they are and I hope they can continue to grow and people support them.
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	179105		/users/profile/235739	Kelsey6	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I volunteered at SC-CARES during spring break and was simply amazed by this organization.  Cindy and Skip are incredibly knowledgeable and clearly love what they do, and have made an outstanding home for the animals.The animals are beyond well taken care of.  I learned so much from the experience and have so much respect for what they do! It is a life-changing experience to volunteer with these amazing people and animals!

It is a wonderful place and they do incredible work with the animals.  I admired Cindy and Skip's dedication and hard work.I love it there.
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	178941		/users/profile/235567	SusanG.	Donor	5	10/17/2013	We first visited SC-Cares last summer and were blown away by the work being done there.  The animals are cared for and loved. Each animal is known by name and Cindy ensures that each not only get the nutrition they need, she works with a vet to identify the best supplements to keep the animals and birds healthy.  I have rarely met an organization that runs on love and passion and SC-Cares is definitely one of them. Last summer we adopted several of the animals and, even though we live in Canada and only visit this area once a year, we will continue to provide whatever support we can.  Cindy, Skip, and the volunteers should be so proud of what they have created and maintain. 
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	178909		/users/profile/235536	Carolmae	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	I have been at sc cares  several times and I have always been impressed with this very unique rescue. Who else would take in a calf with only three good legs or a deer with only three legs. The parrot building is amazing.  Great people!!
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	178829		/users/profile/235452	Amanda103	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	This is great charity run by 2 very caring, hardworking people.  These animals would literally have no place to go it they did not have the santuary.  Some are exotics and some are farm animals and other wildlife that could not be rehabilitated and put back in the wild.  Since the local rescue organizations usually only do cats and dogs, this is the only place for these animals to go and their last hope.  Being a volunteer there, you can't help but fall in love with them- the people and the animals.
Coastal Animal Rescue and Educational Sanctuary	178818		/users/profile/235441	phodges2	Donor	5	10/17/2013	SC-CARES has the animals in first place in everything they do.  The animals come first and then if there is any time left over during the day, maybe they get a little break.  But that doesn't happen too often.  They see that these animals are cared for as if they were their children and always show them their love.  The animals sense the love they receive from their caretakers.  I have been there many times and there is a great atmosphere around these animals.  Any help they can receive is very needful. Patricia HodgesLexington, North Carolina

Skip and Cindy wanted to start a zoo in SC but ran into major problems with some developers. As a result they were able to purchase the land in Georgetown SC and started SC Cares. It is a 501c3 non profit which survives off of donations from the public and businesses. The workers are all volunteer and give of their time and talents to insure the animals have a place of security and safety to live out their lives. Skip and Cindy are two individuals that are dedicated to animal survival and without the help and interest of the public it couldn't survive. Thanks to the dedication of Veterinarians and businesses many things and time have been donated for the interest of the animals. They are presently in the process of building a aviary for the birds of many different species. If you have not contributed, please take a moment and send a donation to this worthy cause.  Maurice HodgesLexington NC 27295

In my experience this Arts Council of Beaufort County is the very best so far! The dedication and energy that JW ,Jenny, Lisa plus the many members &  volunteers tirelessly bring to Beaufort County is  a full range or art endeavors. As a working artist , I depend  on the Art's News for information & events. It is times like this budget crunch that remind us to look at our priorities , culture defines a community. I believe this Art's Council is well deserving of the $5,000. Support of the arts  builds character & joy of living from the youth to the young at heart.
Arts Council Of Beaufort County	67534		/users/profile/73815	Lee Perry Bender	Donor	5	02/13/2011	I am so thankful to the Arts Council of Beaufort County.  They do not just speak to the arts community -- they create the community by offering opportunities to participate, appreciate and create.  In 2006, I heard about the Big Swim mermaid project.  What a fun way to reach the public art enthusiast.  My sister Charlene Dohmann and I created Miss Beaufort, the mermaid who lives on Bellamy Curve.  This opportunity has enriched our lives by bringing us into contact with the many individuals who have seen and admired her -- had their photos taken with her.  It has also brought us into contact with other artists in the area.  We were also able to participate in the Chalk on the Walk 2007 -- an exquisitely beautiful, sunny day in October, on which we created in a new medium, sold crafts, and mingled with many other citizens of the area -- all in a most enjoyable way.  My participation with the Arts Council has also brought me to the point of selling my art jewelry creations, Neck Rocks, at The Gallery on Bay Street.  These opportunities bring fulfillment on many levels, and I thank the Arts Council for presenting these to me and others in the community.

The renewed energy is almost palpable in the visibility, variety, and quality of its offerings to the public.  From the working art studios to the children's programs to the performances, there is excitement.  I had the pleasure last Saturday of attending Natalie Daise's one-woman play about Harriet Tubman.  It was not only a performance worthy of Broadway, but its impact on me and my friends has been profound and haunting.  This is a great asset to the community.
Arts Council Of Beaufort County	64936		/users/profile/70994	Mahoganee D.	Client Served	4	02/08/2011	I am a singer/songwriter and truly find it inspiring when I am in the Arts Council. Not only am I inspired by the artwork, black box theater, artists that commune on a daily basis but the ambiance is very reflective of what my life is about which is creativity. Let me just share a great story that recently transpired within the Arts Council.  As of recently I am in the process of recording my third album and was listening to some music to begin my writing process while at ARTworks (Arts Council of Beaufort) and just began looking around and the creative spirits began to flow very loudly and quickly. Needless to say the song was written in a very short amount of time. My concept for the video would require a dancer so I began asking around and made some phone calls, left messages and moved on to another song. Well as it would happen I was in the Arts Council again and was approached by a dancer whom I had left a message with, well she wanted to hear the song and was immediately inspired and wanted to do an improv, so they played the music in the theater and the dancer went onstage to do her improv which was beautiful and amazing.  We are now preparing to perform the song together and upcoming event. These are the amazing types of things that can happen at the Arts Council.

They nurture our community through programs & workshops for adults, children & their resident artists. Their advocacy and communications for the arts throughout Beaufort County is all-encompassing. Their commitment to fiscal responsibility for the organization and its donors remains solid. It's been an honor to serve on this board and work with the staff over many years.

Instead of trying to convince the public to conform to their views, this group is devoted to actually listening to your visions and helping you make it them happen.

Arts Council Of Beaufort County	63757		/users/profile/69698	Benji M.	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	The Arts Council of Beaufort has been a MAJOR part of my life since moving to the are in 2006. I speak as an artist (musician/actor) and and arts teacher (I teach K-5 music).  My students have been impacted by the Arts Council through providing visiting artists (J.W. and Jenny Rone as well as Lisa Rentz) to help us produce an arts integrated program about South Carolina history (in 2007). My students were then impacted the following year by being invited to perform our Veterans Day program as part of an evening art exhibit. Once again my school was impacted as the arts council provided funds, though a grant we had written, to help purchase stage lights to enhance our performances. J.W. was with me 100% of the time and helped to recommend the types of lights we should use and connected me with a local dealer who would be able to help me purchase and install all of the lighting. I couldn't have asked for more.  As a musican/actor I find it important for me to experience the arts in every way possible. The ACBC provides numerous opportunites for ANYONE to experience all forms of art. Their new black box theater is AMAZING and I have enjoyed every play I have seen there and am currently enjoying being a part of one of the plays being done there, right now. Unfortunately, I do not belive these opportunites, along with the MANY others that I have little time to mention, would not be made available to our communty.  Beaufort County is a very arts rich area of South Carolina and through the ACBC those in the community, as well as surrounding areas, are able to better experience the music, theater, visual art, dance, and creative writing opportunites the ACBC has to offer.

General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	The Arts Council of Beaufort County has brought performing arts, in particular, back to life and helped bring the arts community together at a time when every dollar spent by the arts consumer is more difficult to come by.  They provide low-cost space for artists to create and market their work, as well as instruction in a variety of arts for children and adults.  Their budding theater productions have filled a huge gap, and they bring both local and out of area talent to our attention at a price the average Beaufort citizen can afford.  I'm a huge fan and attend as many performances as I can.

I even considered moving back home because I didn't think that Beaufort was turning out to be a good match for me. All of that changed when I found ArtWorks. As soon as I walked into the gallery I felt welcomed and comfortable. Everyone was friendly and truly interested in meeting me and helping me along my journey. The artists are all wonderfully talented and truly kind people. The opportunities for the community to get involved are widely diverse, ranging from performing arts to visual arts for all ages. Thank you ArtWorks for making me a part of your community. I only hope that more people walk through the doors every day to become a part of the ArtWorks family!

Arts Council Of Beaufort County	63653		/users/profile/69592	mchenard	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	My husband and I are visitors in Beaufort county.  We purchased a house and are planning to move to the area in a few years.  As visitors we like to have a source of cultural and art information.  I searched the web for a good source for Beaufort county and identified this organization.  They have a wonderful newsletter with local information and a calendar of events.  It is very helpful to have an organization that consolidates this information and sends it out in a regular email.  Since I signed up, I have taken pottery classes at home, continue to make knitted items and participated in a number of craft fairs.   I have been able to identify pottery classes in Beaufort.  While we are visiting this year, we strolled around beautiful Beaufort and discovered a wonderful art supply and yarn stores.  We also visited Hunting Island State Park.  The Art Council of Beaufort does a wonderful job of attracting visitors to Beaufort and the sea islands and supplying information to visitors, artists, artisans and art lovers.
Arts Council Of Beaufort County	63490		/users/profile/69416	embiggenedsoul	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/04/2011	ARTworks literally changed my life last year, when I was in  play and got to know the space, the management, and the vision they had for the arts, particularly in my meidum of choice, theater. I then produced and directed a play there last summer that "success" doesn't begin to describe, especially to me, since I had struggled with little success to find a place to put up the shows I wanted to do for almost a decade. Now I consider it my second home, and I continue to be thrilled at watching people discover what ARTworks has to offer actors and audiences alike.The word is so overused, but ARworks really is AMAZING!

White	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	I was lucky enough to attend the opening of the Jonathan Green show in '10, and even luckier, I met him and had a lovely conversation with him!For 10 minutes! I have loved his work ever since my first lunch in Plum's in 2000 when his prints decorated the restaurant's walls, and Richard and I have a beautifully framed print of his in our house in Habersham. The ambiance at ARTworks was so relaxed and welcoming to all of us, and it was just a great treat to meet this fabulous person  as well as to hear him describe to all of us present how his art evolved and how he lives his life. What an unforgettable evening! Thank you for making that possible!

They organized a summit meeting and invited all interested parties concerned about the Arts in Beaufort County.  The purpose was to get ideas on the table, find a group of concerned citizens and art providers to work together, and to come up with a plan on how to keep Arts alive.  We have many problems with funding here and problems with communication about events.  So, hopefully with us working together we can find a way to keep art available to the public and our students.

They have come a long way in a very short time. The facility is very inviting and serves as a hub for artists of all mediums. The staff is always quick to welcome you and answer any questions regarding the exhibits or upcoming programming. Speaking of programming, they have it all! Beaufort has desperately needed an organization to help guide and foster the great arts community we have. That need is finally being met by the Rones and the first class organization they have helped create with the Arts Council of Beaufort County.

Center for Developmental Services	87855		/users/profile/98653	Lynn B.	Client Served	5	04/28/2011	We first walked in the door of CDS when our daughter was 5 months old.  We were there for a NICU clinic where developmental pediatric nurses and physical therapists evaluate children in an effort to catch developmental delays as early as possible. Over the next few years, CDS would become our home away from home, with Emma spending as much as 25-30 hours a week in speech, occupational and physical therapy and special education preschool settings.  We have benefited from the services provided by almost every partner agency in the almost 8 years since that first visit.  I am convinced that Emma has received the highest quality care and that her treatment is enhanced by the close cooperation from the various agencies. As the parent of a child who literally trembles whenever we go to a doctor's office, I love the way Emma lights up when we walk in the door, the way she asks to go to therapy and the way she walks around the facility with confidence - not fear.  Our entire family has been treated with respect, compassion and friendship. The therapists, teachers, physicians and support staff have been with us through the frustration when we didn't have a diagnosis and the questions we didn't have answers to when the diagnosis was made.  No one has ever assumed Emma couldn't do something based on her diagnosis. She's been challenged to reach her highest potential. And she's been loved. What more could any parent ask? 
Center for Developmental Services	87702		/users/profile/98446	Debbie S.	Client Served	4	04/27/2011	When the Center for Developmental Services first opened, I really didn't understand the concept.  My twins had been receiving services daily from several of the client partners.   Between the two of them we had at least 8 trips a week to various locations around Greenville.  When i was first told that all of the appointments would now be housed in a single location I thought that meant that we would be changing therapists and teachers.  Imagine my surprise when I realized that the consolidation was to make MY life easier.  Changes in our health care had until that point had usually made the providers life easier not the patients.  This was an amazing improvement.  I could now go to the same central point each day.  Wow.

We have been using kidnetics speech therapy for about a year and Baby Net for about 3 months. Both programs have been very succssful and benificial to my son's specific needs. They both are very knowlegdable in answering any questions that I have had. They are very quick to get back to me with setting up appointments for evaluation or therapy sessions or any questions or concerns I had. 
Center for Developmental Services	87466		/users/profile/98141	Ashley K.	Client Served	4	04/27/2011	My son was diagnosed with pplagiocephaly around 8 months old. We worked with several wonderful organizations after his diagnosis including Center for Developmental Services. Soon after diagnosis, he was evaluated by CDS to make sure he was not behind developmentally (both mentally and physically). He was then placed in physical therapy and was back up to speed in only a couple months. The staff was wonderful! They were professional, organized, and very thorough in answering any questions I had.
Center for Developmental Services	87289		/users/profile/97935	cstogner	Client Served	5	04/26/2011	I originially came to the CDC when my child was only 3 and not developing his language and motorskills as he should.  He was quickly diagnosed and appropriate services were started in speech and OT.  They then followed us through and helped place us in an approprirate 4k program with the school system.  Now that we are in school and having learning problems we have been able to again utilize the services through Clarity to get wonderful tutoring in an amazingly nurturing and caring atmosphere.  Everyone here has ALWALYS been friendly and helpful at every level.  I consistently recommend friends an colleagues to this Center.
Center for Developmental Services	87286		/users/profile/97930	hherdt	Professional with expertise in this field	4	04/26/2011	As an OT with Kidnetics, I enjoy working in such a unique setting.  My immediate co-workers in Kidnetics are knowledgable, professional, and always available for dynamic therapy brainstorming.  My CDS co-workers are just as wonderful to work with.  Everyone is always pleasant and willing to help with problem solving.  I love that we have access to such great resources right outside my office door.  
Center for Developmental Services	87285		/users/profile/97931	Judy	Client Served	5	04/26/2011	Every since my children started here (one is in speech and one in OT) they have improved so much over the course of 3 years.  The therapist here are wonderful and my kids really enjoy coming here. I remember when my son started. He wouldnt go anywhere without me. But since he's been coming to CDS, he's more independent and goes almost anywhere without me! CDS is the best!
Center for Developmental Services	87279		/users/profile/97923	Tamika V.	Client Served	4	04/26/2011	My son has been coming to CDS since he was three years old forspeech. I was lucky enough to have a place like CDS to bring my son too, to get the help he needs. The people here are nice and friendly, and very helpful to me and my son. Since my son has been coming here his speech has inproved greatly over the past seven years. His therapist is very intune with my son's needs and is so helpful in giving me information that will help my son at home. I am thankful for the help and support that CDS has given to my son and me.
Center for Developmental Services	85680		/users/profile/95666	Martina	Client Served	5	04/14/2011	Child Development Services have been a tremendous help to our family. My husband and I have 2 children that currently receive services at the CDS. One of our children sees 3 different therapist. All  four of the therapist have been helpful and worked with us. They are easy to talk to and understanding. As I am a homeschool mom they have been very helpful with letting me know how I as a mom can best help my  child achieve her full potential as well as things to look for in curriculum that would be good to help strengthen  areas that are week but not to the point of making the child discouraged. The check in staff are always so friendly and have gone out of their way to have my child seen by another therapist if the regular therapist in not available that day. This organization has truly made my life easier as a parent to help me know how to deal with my children with special needs more effectively .
Dining for Women	306432		/users/profile/397692	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/24/2016	Dining for Women inspires me!  Through our local monthly potlucks, I make new acquaintances who are both interesting themselves and interested in others.  Food, fun, companionship, and learning about another culture all wrapped up in one lovely evening.  It fills me in many ways.  And it is a joy to know that my individual contribution, combined with thousands of others, makes one large impact on the lives of women and girls around the world.  Come join us!
Dining for Women	301897		/users/profile/392978	helenhorland	Volunteer	5	08/30/2016	In addition to the wonderful potluck dinners I share with like-minded women each month, I have had the opportunity to participate in DFW sponsored trips to Nepal and Kenya to visit the women and girls who have benefited from our generosity and desire to create a better world. It is amazing to see the difference our gifts have made!  DFW runs on a shoe string budget; every dollar is well-spent and accounted for, and much of the work of running the organization is done by volunteers. The programs are well-vetted. I trust how they handle money and how they disperse it. 
Dining for Women	300985	2	/users/profile/391862	srstall	Volunteer	5	08/18/2016	A friend and I started a DFW chapter about 7 years ago and it is still THRIVING!  Every month we have a group of interesting and engaged women who gather to learn about conditions facing women and girls in the developing world and what we can do to help.  It is so simple to host a monthly meeting since it is a potluck.  Our members all agree it is the BEST meal we have all month.  We share a delicious meal, visit with interesting women from around our city, and learn about an organization that is working to make the world a better place for women and girls in the poorest communities in the world.  Then, we donate what we would have spent if we had dined out.  Simple, yet profound.  I have learned so much and am grateful to DFW for the opportunity to fund organizations that are making a difference for women and girls around the world.
Dining for Women	152483	4	/users/profile/186132	Patty K	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	A potluck with a purpose!!!  Each month we support a program that helps to empower women and girls in developing countries.  Find a local chapter, meet like minded women and take you dining out dollars and donate them to change the lives of women throughout the world.  We truly are making a difference, one dinner at a time!
Dining for Women	139980	1	/users/profile/186132	Patty K	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	Diining for Women is an organization that funds grassroots programs throughout the world., benefitting and aiding women and children.  Each month a different organization is feature which empowers women to better their lives and the lives of the children.  Monthly potluck dinners are held where the members share a meal with friends while learning and becoming educated about a group of women half way around the world.  You are asked to take your "dining out dollars" and donate thoses monies you would have spent to the the montly organization.
Dining for Women	147390	3	/users/profile/194763	DonnaBeth	Volunteer	5	12/28/2012	I have been involved with Dining for Women since January 2011.  I also write one of the educational documents for each month's program--Food for Thought.  The monthly meeting starts with great food and camaraderie, followed by a superb program led by a volunteer from the Chapter.   We average about 40 participants each month.  We have fun, but we learn so much from the charity we will be funding, its helping model, and its program.  I find the whole concept of Dining for Women to be inspired.  DFW finds wonderful, but little known, charities that make the lives of women and girls better.  Some of the helping models are inspired.  Because the programs we fund are limited in scope, it is easy to feel that you are making a significant contribution to the lives of real people.  And because DFW has a rigorous vetting process, you know your money will be used as promised.  
Dining for Women	145526	3	/users/profile/192024	Rita24	Volunteer	5	12/01/2012	Last night I hosted our new chapter's 2nd Dining for Women potluck. It has become the highlight of the month for me. Sharing a lovely, relaxed evening in the company of like minded, wonderful women, and accomplishing such tangible good at the same time is exhilarating.  Realizing that at 9,000 members strong, Dining for Women, is making a difference in the programs it supports.  I was able to show the beautiful scarves I purchased as holiday gifts from the Anchal Project.  We all had the same reaction.  Beyond the beauty of the scarves, tears came to our eyes and goosebumps on our arms, thinking about the women who made them and how DFW has helped them to escape from a life of prostitution to one of talented artisan.  Can't say enough!  Start a chapter today!!
Dining for Women	143572	4	/users/profile/135230	Lisa60	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	For years I had been looking for more purpose in my life.  I tried a bunch of different things.  But then I stumbled upon the Dining for Women website and my life was forever changed!  I became a chapter leader and started the very first chapter in our city, and was very nervous!  But DFW provided the best support!    Our members have said time and time again how awesome DFW is, and how much they absolutely love it!  We are Canadians so are not eligible for tax credits, but this does not matter to any of us as we are fully dedicated to Dining for Women and are continually blown away by the calibre of organizations we support and the educational resources we are provided for our meetings.  Dining for women is the best way to make a HUGE difference to women and girls around the world.  The charities we support are not huge mega-charities, they are truly hand selected grassroots organizations that we all resonate with and are proud to support!  I can honestly say that Dining for Women is not only changing the lives of women and girls around the world, they are changing the live of women and girls in North America as well!  My whole family has been greatly affected in every positive way by DFW, and even my 5 year old is becoming a change agent because of her exposure to this organization!  
Dining for Women	143163	2	/users/profile/189594	stellamat	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/27/2012	As a  retired  MSW  I was  looking  for  a  special   unique  way I could  help  bring peace to the world through  cultural understanding and  education.  A year  ago i started  the first  DFW chapter in southern oregon and  continue as its  chapter leader.  Why  this organization???   I  love the concept of  collective  giving  to make a  difference in  womens  lives all over the world  as  we  learn about a country, its people and a  unique  NGO  every  month.  Not  only  do  we  raise money ,  but  travel trips are offered to visit these  organizations to see the work they are doing, and  best of all is the  dvd and  packet of information  I receive   each month to educate  local women here  about what is  happening  in   female sexual  trade,  female  clitorectomy , microloans, educational resources,   and  domestic  violence   abroad. DFW also   is  set up  in  regions of the  USA and World  so  we have  regional leaders  and  instant help with our  local groups.....  And most of all  there is no pressure to  give a  certain dollar  amount  each month or year which is  very unique in my many decades of volunteering.  I hope others  reading these posts  will be moved to  join or  start their  own chapter.  Jeannie Matthews
Dining for Women	142922	1	/users/profile/189351	Sharon66	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	It is hard to make a difference, as one person, in a world where so much suffering and poverty exists. I am grateful that Dining for Women finds organizations that provide direct help to women and children in need, and combines the donation of each member to truly make a significant contribution, one that will create or fund sustainable projects of value. I can't, or don't plan to, travel to Thailand to rescue young girls in the sex trade, or travel to Africa to teach women the skills that allow them to feed and educate their children, or travel to Indonesia to deliver goats to widows who can then support themselves and their families. But my donation each month, contributed in the company of other caring women and over delicious meals, can travel in my stead, after being combined with donations from others in DFW. I would love to see many more chapters grow over the years so we can be part of so much more support and aid in the world, to those less fortunate. I highly recommend joining - or starting - a Dining for Women chapter!
Dining for Women	125897	1	/users/profile/39087	cynthia-sawtell	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I am a chapter leader in California.  I was impressed enough with Dining For Women after visiting a chapter meeting in San Francisco to start my own chapter.   This organization does SUCH an effective job of helping women organize in their own local "giving circles" to dine together while learning about a different important endeavor that changes the lives of women and girls each and every month.  Our rolled-up small donations make a HUGE difference in the Third World for these organizations and for the women they serve.  DFW is incredibly well-organized and transparent, and it has relatively little overhead cost due to an army of dedicated volunteers who work on everything from monthly program selection, to web site content to testing out recipes, and so much more.
Dining for Women	38204	1	/users/profile/39087	cynthia-sawtell	Volunteer	4	05/06/2010	As a chapter leader, I prepare the presentation on the organization of the month which is doing good for impoverished women in the 3rd world.  Each month, DFW raises over $25,000 to benefit a worthy organization.  So far this year, we have funded solar ovens for refugee camps in Darfur, maternity clinics in rural Peru, micro loans in India and Nepal.  At the same time, we get to learn about conditions on the ground in these places and what women are up against.  The education for us coupled with the benefit to these organizations is a Win-Win combination.
Dining for Women	106221	1	/users/profile/143095	woodsassoc	Volunteer	5	02/09/2012	Hello, I am a co-leader for a chapter for DC and MD and it has been one of the most powerful experiences of my life. Not only because of what this organization does to transform women's lives around the world but what it has done to transform my own. I have attended Leadership summits and been embraced and welcomed - warts and all. They truly want you to bring all of you to the organization. I have expanded my knowledge about about poverty, women and the world in this process. But most importantly I know our money is creating a difference in women's lives that face horrific circumstances. Peace, Denise Woods
Dining for Women	89132	2	/users/profile/38754	dmhansardlsw	Volunteer	5	05/24/2011	My experience with Dining For Women continues to be one of education, friendship and of course, good food! My chapter members and I are always impressed with the materials available, the informatione we learn about different cultures and about the amazing organizations that are assisting women and children living in extreme poverty. After more than 5 years, the Massill Ohio chapter continues to meet monthly and looks forward to what the next 5 years bring!
Dining for Women	37969	2	/users/profile/38754	dmhansardlsw	Volunteer	5	05/04/2010	As a Social Worker and a Minister, I am often in a position to help others. Most people are not offered those opportunities on a daily basis. I have been a chapter leader for Dining For Women since February 2006. The women who attend our dinners are offered opportunities to help women, to learn about different cultures and traditions and share some of who they are in order to make a real difference. This is an escellant organization.
Dining for Women	59257	2	/users/profile/61417	Anne C.	Volunteer	5	12/29/2010	I have been a Chapter Leader with DFW for almost 5 years! Our chapter has an average of 12-15 women attend each monthly meeting. Through the collective giving model of DFW, we feel we are making a real difference in women and children's lives all over the world. Each month through the educational materials that DFW provides, we learn about the country, culture and women's issues of the program we are funding that month. We see and hear the impact of the programs through the DVD that is provided to us each month. We are learning each month how this program targets one of the Millennium Development Goals that the United Nations have established and hope to reach by 2015. More and more women throughout the U.S. and world are finding out about the DFW movement and the strides we are making in assisting women and children in developing countries to reach their goals for education, improved health, and self-sustainable livelihoods. Our chapter members are promoting change, saving lives, and giving a voice to women who have been voiceless. We feel empowered that we know where our money is going, and what it will do. None of this would be possible without the excellent leadership, tenacity, compassion and humility of Marsha Wallace, Founder of DFW, the DFW Board of Directors and the many volunteers from DFW's chapter members that keep moving DFW forward. DFW members are getting the word out about this fabulous organization and it keeps growing! I believe that the knowledge that we have received since our membership with DFW is changing our own lives for the better. I feel that the support we give to other women all over the world can eventually impact everyone in our world and hopefully, in time, lead to more peace and stability throughout the world.
Dining for Women	57040		/users/profile/59863	Luc M.	Board Member	5	11/15/2010	Dining for Women's model of collective giving is so simple but yet, so powerful!   I've been part of the Board of Directors for almost 2 years now and I am also a member of the very first couples chapter. The couples chapter meets every month, every month a different couple hosts the dinner at their home and another couple does the presentation about the featured program that Dining for Women is supporting -- it is a fun, and inspiring evening with friends;  we are all learning so much about the global issues that impact us all and collectively we feel that we are making a positive difference in most desperate and impoverished places in the world.Marsha Wallace (Founder and President) and the board have put together a very exciting strategic plan for the organization and we are looking forward to the day when Dining for Women can help 10 times more women than it does today!
Dining for Women	50258	1	/users/profile/50813	maxwoo	Volunteer	2	08/11/2010	The idea behind Dining for Women is a really great one - meet, learn, share a meal and give to help women and girls in the developing world. It is fun, and enriching. However, there does not seem to be much support for the chapter leaders once they have started meeting. While I continue to hope that something will materialize, all I see is more and more about money and extreme growth, and less about how to be a successful chapter leader, and that someone is noticing.  I do not understand why an organization that seems to be growing at a very comfortable, manageable rate insists on pushing so hard. It seems that much of the focus on the programs and the education of members has been lost in the money shuffle, sadly. Most everything seems to be about raising more money and an unrealistic growth rate. So, in my estimation, Dining for Women is at risk of losing its soul and becoming like so many other non-profits - large, cold, impersonal and uncaring. A true shame and a lost opportunity.
Dining for Women	41661	13	/users/profile/42460	marinkamt01	Volunteer	5	05/28/2010	I started a local Dining For Women Chapter in April, 2006 after seeing it on a Good Morning America segment about charity giving circles in Dec., 2005.  Our Chapter hasn't missed a monthly meeting in the over 4 years we've been together! We meet at members' homes for a potluck dinner, educate ourselves about the monthly charity/region we are supporting for that month (with materials provided by DFW), and then each make a pesonal donation to that charity. Friendship, fun, and food with a purpose...it's always an inspiring and energizing evening!
Dining for Women	39573	10	/users/profile/40521	jodirochester	General Member of the Public	5	05/19/2010	Two years ago I started attending Dining for Women meetings.  For a brief time I was unable to attend, but the giving mentality of the organization and the women involved brought me back. I just attended my first CARE conference through Dining for Women and I consider it an experience of a life time. It taught me how I can be of service with my local chapter to do even more for the world. I hope to continue to be a big part of DFW as we lobby for women's rights around the world. This organization is a strong starting point for all to learn  no matter your age  of how you can help the world one dinner at a time.
Dining for Women	39216	12	/users/profile/40173	linda25	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/17/2010	I was introduced to Dining for Women (DFW) almost 2 years ago when I helped facilitate their first annual conference for their chapters.  Their idea is compelling!  have good friends "break bread together" through potluck dinners and donate the money they saved from local restaurants prices to a charity that DFW profiles each month.  What appeals to me as a person with a lot of expertise in the field of women's international organizations is how down to earth and scalable the idea is.  I think that the organization has been doing a great job both in terms of growing its chapters as well as bringing more money to worthwhile women's efforts around the globe.
Dining for Women	38771	9	/users/profile/39667	campbecs45	Volunteer	5	05/13/2010	I became interested in Dining for Women at a Peace Colloquy when I attended a workshop about sex trafficking and modern day slave trade and learned that families in poverty are vulnerable,  I had also read in Greg Mortenson's book, Three Cups of Tea that he found if he built schools for girls, they would grow up and use their education to improve their family's and community's level of medical care and education. I wanted to advocate for women in a community based way, and Dining for Women fit my needs and goals.  Dining for Women provides microloans to women in poverty so they can feed their families and better themselves economically.  I visited a chapter in Colorado and the chapter leader there encouraged me to start my own chapter.  When I returned home to Florida, I found there was not a chapter in my town so I started one with my friends.  The national organization provides wonderful support to chapters and it is easy to start and keep our chapter going.  We are all excited about supporting women in this way and we have doubled our membership in 2 meetings!
Dining for Women	38625	11	/users/profile/39509	jill2007	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	Dining for Women has been a positive experience for our chapter which is almost three years old.  Our members appreciate being able to make a difference in the lives of other women and children around the world.  Our lives have been enriched as we have learned about others.  Wonderful information is provided to chapters by the national office.  It is very easy to start a chapter and maintain it.
Dining for Women	38423	10	/users/profile/39294	steinm	Donor	5	05/09/2010	This nonprofit gives direct help to women and children all over the developing world monthly.  The research they do to find the constructive nonprofits and the oversight to ensure all the funding goes for the right uses is extraordinary.  In addition, the concept of the giving circle for me has brought together other women interested in these issues and educated all of us as to the terrible proverty and critical issues still facing women in the 21st century.  They are doing great work and having such an important impact.
Dining for Women	38399	6	/users/profile/39269	mapetite39	General Member of the Public	5	05/08/2010	Thanks to two great lady friends at my church, I was introduced to DFW and to Marsha about the second year of their existence. Marsha's dedication, as well as the charter members', has led DFW to grow unbelievably. This is the most meaningful free time activity that I participate in. I so love the concept of empowering women in desperate situations to become self sufficient and spread this marvelous example to their children and their neighbors in the villages. I am so proud of the many villages and women we have helped. I am not able to donate huge amounts but it is so reassuring to know that my donation's value increases greatly in these third world countries and has a powerful impact. My son who lives in NY was also very impressed and he donates quarterly to them.A proud member and mother,Anne Marie Currier
Dining for Women	38375	5	/users/profile/39246	ghjohnson	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	In 2006 I was looking for a way to enrich my social life and make a difference in the world.  An article about Dining for Women in my local paper struck a chord with me, and I sent in my chapter application.  I was amazed at how easy it was to start a chapter and at the amount of support and education that was provided to me.  The idea of getting together to eat with friends and pooling our resources to help our "sisters" around the world also resonated with my friends and we quickly formed a group that is still going strong four years later.  Dining for Women has given all of us the opportunity to strengthen our friendships with each other and educate ourselves about our fellow women in developing countries. And most importantly, it allows us to help fund programs that give these women a chance to do the things that all women yearn to do - feed and educate themselves and their families, have good health care in their communities and live free from violence and oppression.  The relatively small donation that each of us makes pooled collectively with donations from other chapters allows DFW to make a significant impact in the groups that it funds each month.  I love this model.  I love the time it allows me to be with my friends in a way that is deeper and more meaningful.  I love the education we are all receiving through the easily accessible and thoughtfully researched educational materials that are provided. I love to see the growth of the organization that has happened in the four years since I joined. But most of all I love to see the impact that the DFW donations have made in the lives of our sister women and their families around the world.
Dining for Women	38322	7	/users/profile/39209	julie-klaper	Volunteer	5	05/08/2010	If I were going to design a NFP, it would be Dining For Women.  Fortunately, for me, Marsha Wallace already did that and I just needed to sign up to help. It combines all of the things that are important to me, helping women, learning about new places and people, cooking, making new friends.  Plus, I am an artist and my work focuses on women's issues.  What a great connection for me with women all over the world.  I started by forming a chapter.  I didn't even know everyone at the first meeting but I knew it was going to be great. The room just buzzed as people quickly learned of so many things they had in common.  Marsha has an amazing vision about what this organization can do but she could not do everything herself and she solicited the membership for help.  I am a former marketing professional and I jumped at the chance and now serve on the national advisory council.  I had been so impressed with how well run DFW is, the impact it has had on so many people and how much more it will be able to do as it continues to grow.  Research has verified that empowered women have enormous impact in their countries and can change how a society functions as they are given the opportunity to sustain themselves and their families.  And that is exactly what the DFW donations do. Its unique concept no only benefits the recipients of its donations but also how it brings women together each month with a common, very worthwhile goal.
Dining for Women	38256	4	/users/profile/39147	cindy6	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	When I found DFW over a year ago I was amazed at the impact it was having. I'm fortunate to live in Greenville, SC where it originated and to get to know Marsha Wallace the founder. Her vision for the organization is SO inspiring and exciting. I have invited many of my friends to join as well. I am a woman of middle-income so participating and giving to DFW makes the small amount I am able to give join with others to create a large amount. I have learned so much about places in the world I never knew and about the many important organizations that are working first-hand to eradicate poverty. I am honored to be a member of DFW!Cindy Ballaro
Dining for Women	38232	10	/users/profile/39121	kshimada	Volunteer	5	05/07/2010	I lived abroad in developing countries for over 17 years, and had been looking for a way to both maintain a connection to the people and cultures of the world that I so highly valued, and also make a meaningful difference in their lives while living back in the U.S.  A mutual friend shared the 'model' of giving around which Dining for Women bases its educational and philanthropic activities.  Here's why its great:*It promotes the building of community here in the U.S. among women who share a desire to support other marginalized or underserved women around the globe. We enjoy coming together and talking about the countries, cultures, roles of women, as well as sharing our own experiences vis a vis that country... and feel connected to each other as well as the monthly country/organization. *It promotes a 'holistic' and 'mutually beneficial' model of philanthropy: This is not just about giving money; its about learning, having an impact, sharing stories, breaking bread together and growing ourselves from the lessons and stories the indigenous women share with us. We give to them in ways that we hope will make a difference. They give to us in ways they could never imagine make a difference to us --- by the strength of their commitment to their families, communities and ideals -- by their sheer will and hard work in unimaginable conditions -- by their support of one another so no one is successful unless they all are successful -- and their open sharing of emotion: the pain, joy and challenges of life. *The structure is exponentially successful. By creating a single, focused, approach, the founders have created a winning formula... to draw on the collective power of coming together in unified giving, so that there is a quality of investment in the women of a community, not just a quantity of dollars raised. Across the country, women in hundreds of communities are doing the same activities, and donating to the same organization, so the impact is significant and life-changing for the individuals and the community being served. So much more powerful and effective than taking collections and sending smaller amounts to a large number of organizations. This way, they work over time with valued and trusted organizations and liaisons to really create a powerful and lasting impact...not just a donation.*The central role that education plays in the organization is admirable. The website has lessons, resources, discussion questions, bibliographies about the country and organization chosen each month. The chapters are given videos and other media with first hand documentation of the organization that Dining for Women is supporting so that we each have a direct experience with the women of the organization. *Each of us is given a variety of ways to contribute: to the food we all share (based on the native country's cuisine); to the financial $$ donation we make (in the amount that we would have spent going out to eat with a girlfriend); to the role of leader in the educational section of the monthly program, etc. Its fun and keeps us all interested and invested.*I have met really inspirational, interesting, caring, smart women who want to make a difference. *Run completely by volunteers: incredible!! *I can't think of anything that would have me not give this organization a top rating. The sincerity, leadership, and commitment of the chapter founders is awesome. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share my positive, glowing, and appreciative comments about this worthwhile and inspirational and effective organization.  Every community or city in the world should have a Chapter of Dining for Women!!Karen Shimada*

It is a beautiful way to grow connections with women right where you live while helping women whom are less fortunate-realizing what a connection WE as humans all have to each other!! While gaining our own empowerment through acts of compassion....whewww every time I really think about it, it chokes me up!!! THANK YOU Dining For Women for facilitating this amazing experience!!!!!!!
Dining for Women	37948	9	/users/profile/38727	gclaiborne	Volunteer	5	05/04/2010	This organization has comforted, fed, educated, and inspired women and children all over the world whose outlook was very bleak before their coming together with Dining for Women. Their lives are safer, richer, fuller, healthier, more joyful than otherwise possible, and now they pass along to their own families and communities, who, in turn, will do the same. I've learned that governments can NOT be counted upon to provide basic resources to their citizens or even to protect those citizens and, certainly, not to educate or feed them, but Dining for Women tackles these jobs with its meager fiscal budget yet limitless spiritual force and will.
Dining for Women	37934	9	/users/profile/38713	amaddox	Volunteer	5	05/04/2010	I was drawn to this mission of Dining for Women two years ago when a girlfriend and I found Dining for Women while looking for a way to do something more to give back.  In June of 2008, we started the Seattle Chapter of Dining for Women with our first meeting of 5 ladies.  Our chapter has grown to a mailing list of approximately 60 ladies.  Little did I understand at the time we began our chapter the educational journey we were embarking on and how that journey would forever change me in a positive way.  Thanks to the resources provided by Dining for Women each month our chapter looks forward to learning about our sisters around the world, what struggles they face, the obstacles that they overcome, the similarities and differences in the lives we each lead.  We learn what it means to be a woman in the global community and how the empowerment of women changes the world!
Dining for Women	8877	14	/users/profile/10650	Laurie Flesher	Volunteer	5	08/08/2009	DFW empowers women and children living in extreme poverty by funding programs fostering good health, education, and economic self-sufficiency, and cultivates educational dinner circles inspiring individuals to make a difference through the power of collective giving. I joined DFW to bond with other like-minded women, to learn about extreme poverty in the world, and to make a difference. Each month, a chosen charity benefits when the DFW chapters throughout the country meet and donate money, purchase craft items, and learn about impoverished women who struggle to survive. DFW is growing rapidly, and has helped charities from Uganda, Vietnam, India, Tibet, Guatemala and Kenya, among others. It has struck a cord with many people who want to help, but don't know how their contributions can make a difference. It provides money to enable women and children to become independent earners, or to educate children, or to feed starving people.

Pawmetto Lifeline	278560	3	/users/profile/368523	Renee71	General Member of the Public	1	02/01/2016	This mission for this facility is to rescue homeless animals and place them in forever homes but in fact the opinions of staff or opinions of affiliates outweigh the main criteria...my dog is not neutered and is a purebred Bassett hound well taken care healthy happy shots up to date and bcuz hes not fixed some pet is deprived of a loving caring home. .instead a staff member started the speech on the benefits of neuter/ spayed animals ..every pet like people are different and my dog is fine...hes only 2 and i dont want him fixed.. my prerogative not theirs ...i wasnt there to adopt a female anyway. Just an application determined i was unfit...clearly the dogs placement took a back seat to some opinions... this place is the worst...u cant possibly make a well informed decisions without the facts and they knew nothing concerning my other dog..dont go there
Pawmetto Lifeline	252294	4	/users/profile/340356	M12221	Client Served	5	08/09/2015	On December 4, 2014 my cat Agatha Abigail had a stroke and had to be put down. She was 16. Then, in February, my other cat Fisher stopped eating. He also had to be put down. I was very sad and a bit lonely. My husband died a few years ago so I'd been living alone, but I'd had our two cats. Five days later I was going to return something to a store near Pawmetto Lifeline and I thought I'd just "stop in" to take a look. I filled out an application and I walked over to look into the cat room to wait for until someone to let me in. While standing there I noticed the back of a furry grey head in the top row of plexiglass cubicles. She turned around and looked at me, and that was that. Her name is Gracie, she's 2-3 years old and it is wonderful to have her here with me in her forever home. She did have intestinal worms, but Pawmetto Lifeline provides a month of free per insurance with each adoption, so I was reimbursed for that expense. Thank you to Pawmetto Lifeline for the wonderful service you provide--from me and the many loving pets you have saved.
Pawmetto Lifeline	250498	3	/users/profile/338352	kfish	General Member of the Public	1	07/29/2015	Absolutely the worse place to adopt an animal. The staff are rude and don't care about the animals. I had to return a kitten couple of years ago, and waited 30-45 minutes just for someone to take her. I guess it was one of the sorry managers who was very rude to me, and I think it's stupid that after one time of adopting and it doesn't work, you can't adopt from them again which is stupid. I think it's even stupid to make you pay after a certain period of time after you adopt. I'm thankful for the cat we have now who did NOT come from this horrible place. You people need to get your crap straight. 
Pawmetto Lifeline	233254	3	/users/profile/296975	wadams	Client Served	1	11/09/2014	We brought our dog to this organization to have a spay procedure performed. A month after the procedure she had some issues in which we took her to a specialist for at that time they found that she had an infection requiring immediate surgery and 24hr aftercare while performing the surgery to fix her the specialist stated there was no doubt the inflection was due to the improper spay procedure but he would not get involved his concern was to get the dog fixed. None the less $4700 later we now cannot get Pawmetto Lifeline to pay for their mistake since I wouldn't bring her to them where they nearly killed her the first time and they didn't have the proper facility to take care of her immediately. after countless emails and phone calls and reviews I have yet to hear from anyone other than their lawyer who tells me they will place lengthy and costly injunction against me for harming Pawmetto Lifelines economic advantage because I have written reviews everywhere to ensure no one else has the same experience. Since I put the sign on my truck I have found out of the avg 2 phoncalls a day 1 of them is usually a horror story similar to mine about this organization. HOW CAN I HARM THE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE OF A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION??? This organization is incompetent and irresponsible.
Pawmetto Lifeline	198077	3	/users/profile/258760	cricket6064	General Member of the Public	4	04/16/2014	My review is actually a comment in response to some of the reviews I've read on this website about this non-profit and others.   I think whoever decides to rescue a pet, does so with the understanding there will likely be expense involved for veterinary care, not just feeding the pet.  Many of the negative reviews have commented about the health of the adopted pet, and the unexpected veterinary expense.  People, when you adopt a rescue from either an animal rescue or humane society, you do so without knowing the pet's health.  You are not given a guarantee of health as you would from a reputable breeder.  All of our pets have been rescues with the exception of our last.  We have spent in excess of $70,000 in the last 9 years because we accepted the responsbility for providing our pets with a better life than they had before us.  I realize not everyone can afford to spend thousands of dollars on veterinary care, but you cannot expect to adopt a pet and have the expense end with the adoption fee.  We didn't have an extra $70,000 in our savings - we made sacrifices by not taking vacations, and driving cars that are 10 years old.   If you cannot afford to give your new family member a better life than he/shet previously had, or you are unwilling to make sacrifices for your new addition,  than don't rescue - buy a fish instead.
Pawmetto Lifeline	166050	2	/users/profile/220599	Kaceyr	Client Served	1	08/24/2013	We adopted a female cat about a year and a half ago.  Since we got her she has been sick so often, and right now we're starting to wonder if she was even spayed properly.  We cannot afford to keep taking her to the vet.  We feel that Pawmetto Lifeline lied about her health so she would get adopted. I would not adopt another animal from them.  When I emailed them about this they ignored my email.
Pawmetto Lifeline	126728	5	/users/profile/157049	Shellie T.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	Reading some of the comments here felt I had to  respond to some that were not as positive....Anything A volunteer can and will do saves $$ that go to the animals. I do not mind a bit doing that , in fact find great reward I can do something to help with my spare time... Perhaps some have had situations that have not been positive( or so it seems reading some of the comments) but there are always two sides and reasons for the way this organization is run..and yes some people are denied acess to our animals. The ANIMALS are the priority here.  I have met only one employee that is not ALWAYS smiling  . The rest  do so besides being  helpful , personable,and gives of their time so freely and unselfishly at Pawmetto...There may be some that have "decent" pay but I can assure you for all they do and the time they give for most that is not the case. The saddest thing is although everyone has a right to comment the negative ones hurt no one but those beautiful dogs and cats waiting for homes.. I will go up against any one to debate about the good Pawmetto does and I have been in every area there. I am extremely honest and would not back anything or anyone I felt did not  deserve the praise/respect  I give today...and by the way I am not paid a thing except the extreme pleasure of knowing I am helping some animal in some small way. But isnt that really the only goal any associated with Pawmetto should have?Thank you and good night!!
Pawmetto Lifeline	115299	2	/users/profile/157049	Shellie T.	Volunteer	5	06/14/2012	I am a volunteer at Pawmetto life line and have been very impressed with the efforts the staff and volunteers give each and every day for this great cause. I would think the pay is not outstanding but I have never heard a complaint for the very long hours and time each puts forth for these animals. These people work long hours each day weekends and holidays. They love the animals and that is their focus.  This is not a place anyone can be approved to adopt but only because  each animal becomes a part of their hearts. The goal is not ONLY to have them adopted but have them go to the very best matched family and they work hard to ensure that is the result for each and every animal . I had no idea how my own heart would soar when a animal is walked or carried out the door with a new home and how many there are still . I am proud to give my time and be a part of this organization and the people I have met at Pawmetto. My last comment is only be kind to animals ,PLEASE spay and neuter, and come by and see our beautiful family at Pawmetto!
Pawmetto Lifeline	126009	2	/users/profile/140032	Niki L.	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I volunteered with Pawmetto Lifeline (formerly Project Pet) for almost 3 years before moving to attend grad. School in FL.  I just have to say that there isn't another organization that cares so much about each and every animal they rescue more than the staff and volunteers here do.  Each animal is treated like a family member and when one finds their forever home it brings so much excitement and hope, it's amazing.  Great organization, staff, and such deserving pets!
Pawmetto Lifeline	125592	8	/users/profile/170811	SallyP	Donor	1	10/16/2012	Pawmetto lifeline is a scam. The numbers of pets adopted are shown but not the number of RETURNED PETS. I also found out that they get animals from different rescue organizations that have already treated the animals for any severe illness, get them back to health then, Pawmetto lifeline steps in and gets the rescue. They takes credit for the rescue in order to make the numbers they need to continue different grants which should be going to the groups that actually rescued and treated the sick animal. Had I known that their CEO make over $100,000. annually I would never have given a dime, I support animals not someones lifestyle. 
Pawmetto Lifeline	114545	7	/users/profile/156079	abbyabshire	Volunteer	1	06/11/2012	You're volunteering in positions that they should be paying someone to do, which is fine, that's how most volunteering works. However, the truth is that they have a paid staff and they pay their staff handsomely, think 70k+ a year. Why bother with paying someone to run the in-house pet-store, take proper care of the animals, ect. when they have spent hundreds of thousands (if not a million plus) dollars on publicity and marketing to you so you would volunteer and they wouldn't have to pay you salary/ benefits. I'm writing this because it's important that the public stop rolling over for organizations like these. Pawmetto Lifeline does not save all and any animals from kill shelters. Pawmetto Lifeline only saves the animals with no-very minimal health issues. Do you know how easy it is to 'save' a healthy animal from a shelter *for free* and then sell it to the public for $300 (which is their adoption fee for puppies). Just think, $150-300 per dog they sell. Another $100.00 plus for the cats and kittens. Then they have a store and tons of private & public funding/contributions. You'd have a decent amount of money by the end of the day and then to top it off you've a very small paid staff that's funded by the board of trustees-- trustees who are among the wealthiest in South Carolina.

Pawmetto Lifeline	112146	4	/users/profile/152603	RandomCitizen	General Member of the Public	1	05/15/2012	My experience with Pawmetto Lifeline was extremely disappointing.  I submitted an adoption application with them for a particular dog on their website.  I have several other dogs, and they were not on heartworm preventative at the time I filled out the application.  I foolishly told the truth about that on my application, even though I was in the process of having my dogs tested then placed on preventative.  After Pawmetto got my adoption application, I received a call from someone there informing me that my application was rejected due to the heartworm medication issue.  I told the person that I had already had one of my three dogs tested and put on preventative, and was about to have the other two tested and placed on it also.  SO, I asked the person if I brought in the paperwork for my dogs' negative heartworm tests and the receipts for the Heartgard I had purchased, would I then be allowed to adopt a dog from Pawmetto.  His answer?  "Well, probably not.  They would have to do a home visit and everything to make sure that our policies were being followed.  But you can go to the shelter out off Bluff Rd and find a dog there."  WHAT????    I mean, I totally understand them having a policy requiring that all pets be on heartworm preventative, but even if I brought in all paperwork proving that my dogs had been put on preventative, THEY STILL WOULDN"T ALLOW ME TO ADOPT????  UNBELIEVABLE!!!....  I could have easily lied and then probably moved smoothly through their adoption process......I didn't press the issue any further with the person on the phone because it was obvious to me that Pawmetto's main concern is not finding loving homes for their animals, and that is not the type of place I want to work with.  I went to Pets Inc who were TERRIFIC and adopted a dog who has become a wonderful part of our family.  Meanwhile, the little dog at Pawmetto that I wanted to adopt languishes in that shelter for who knows how long.  So sad!
Pawmetto Lifeline	104559	2	/users/profile/140216	Mandy6	Client Served	5	01/25/2012	The pressure was on and everyone in the home could feel it. The eldest son was about to turn 12 and we all knew what he wanted for his birthday.The librarians at the school knew what he wanted. He researched for it online and in books.The teachers and even the lunchroom staff at the school knew what he wanted. He polled other people about it.God knew what he wanted for his birthday. Our son prayed for it for months. Everyone, it seemed, knew what he wanted. It was not a fancy video game. It was not a cool pair of heelies.He wanted a dog.Did not have to be a fancy dog, or papered. Did not have to be photogenic.It just had to be a great dog.After weeks of scouring at the Humane Society and the internet, after visits to about 30 dogs who for some sad reason or another, just didnt seem to be able to fit into our family, we finally went to Petsmart for the Project Pet adopt-a-thon. On May 5th, just 2 days before he turned 12, my son practically drooled over every dog and cat in Petsmart. His dad and I read all the info on the dogs listed on the cages. At first, I scratched all the dogs behind the ears and then talked to them.There was one particular older dog who, as soon as I touched his fur,  leaned his graying muzzle into my hand and laid down.I called my husband over and asked him his opinion; however, my mind was made up. I called my son over and let him visit with the 8-year-old dog. Tail wagging, droopy eyed with one cataract forming, this red furred beagle basset hound mix fell in love with my son and vice versa. Even the fact that the dog had heartworms didnt deter us. Project Pet affirmed to us that they were treating the dog and he should be fine. With that in mind, Tundra became an integral part of our family. Tundra is such a laid-back dog, its almost comical. He doesnt chew on anything except his food and his tail. Always wags his tail happily, sleeps on the pillow with the self-confidence of one who knows his innate right to be there. Housebroken, though he isnt exactly excited about the crate, Tundra accepts the times we need to leave without him, and is excited when we come home. He loves to go for walks and explore. He enjoys meeting other people and dogs. He isnt aggressive, but neither is he a scaredy dog. Hes a self confident old man who doesn't look for trouble, just friendship and fun. Tundra gets along with cats, fish, birds, people, other dogsbut he does not like flies for some reason. Every night, when I check on my boys as they sleep, I find Tundra on one or the other boys beds, cuddled and happy in their arms, with his head firmly on the pillow. When I wake up in the morning, Tundra is at the foot of my bed, usually snoring. Hes a loyal companion who has made our hearts and home a happier place.  Tundras sunshine personality brightens my sons world and ours as well.We were a little nervous when we looked for dogs because our eldest son has autism, but our fears proved groundless. Tundra could not be a better dog for our son, who adores every hair on his dogs graying muzzle. They are inseparable, and it truly has made a lasting impact on our family life. We cannot thank Project Pet enough for helping us find the right one for us! We want to adopt again soon, now we have bought our first home.  Tundra enjoys his yard, and has recently made his presence known to all in the neighborhood. The kids adore him almost as much as we do, and the parents like him for being such a great playmate for the children. Tundra is now almost 15 and we have had some of the best years of our lives, thanks to Pawmetto lifeline and the great work they do. 
Pawmetto Lifeline	104550	1	/users/profile/140199	kittycatfriend	Volunteer	5	01/25/2012	I am trying to post a comment to Denise16, but can't seem to attach.  Anyway, I know the dog you are referring to, and she is one lucky dog now.  I was involved a little bit with the feeding of Churches (as a substitute for the folks who tirelessly day-after-day took care of her), and she would walk towards my car, but never came near me.  I am so glad she was rescued, and not having to live in the rain and the cold  or heat.  Now, if someone could just rescue the homeless man, James, who was her friend, it would be a nice ending to the story.

I found a cat at Pawmetto Lifeline, A Siamese, and we named her Jasmine. She has been the best cat I have ever had. I then decided to volunteer for Pawmetto Lifeline and have been a volunteer since 2009. This is one of the best no-kill shelters I have ever been too. I always recommend them to friends and family who wish to rescue and adopt either a cat or dog.

We took him to our vet and she gave him a clean bill of health and played with him a little bit because he's just so cute.  Thanks to all the good foster homes at Pawmetto Lifeline.

Pawmetto Lifeline	104348	1	/users/profile/139918	Denise16	Client Served	5	01/24/2012	I called Pawmetto Lifeline and asked them to rescue this beautiful dog that hug out at a local fast food restaurant across the street from our busy mall.  Seven months, Pawmetto Lifeline volunteers worked effortlessly to rescue Churches.  They bought her expensive deli meats, waited for her arrival around the clock, loved her --spoiled her.  It took them a total of Seven months to get her.  She now lives with her rescuers and their other rescue dogs.  I've seen pictures of Churches with her new family and she looks beautiful, happy, healthy, and rotten with love.  Blessings to Pawmetto Lifeline volunteers!

It's still shaped like a "Z" but all of our cats are fat, happy and well-loved in their forever hme.

Pawmetto Lifeline	104287	2	/users/profile/139810	mendycc2002	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	I have been volunteering with Pawmetto Lifeline for almost a year now and I absolutely love it!  The staff is phenomenal.  I am constantly amazed at the standard of medical care all the dogs and cats receive at Pawmetto Lifeline.  And what's even more imprtant to me is the love and attention each and every animal receives there.  They have not only saved thounsands of animal's lives but also through patience and love made many of those same animals adoptable.  I truly wish I could volunteer every day there because it is so good for my soul.      
Pawmetto Lifeline	104262		/users/profile/139781	k.mcewan	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	I volunteered many times with Pawmetto Lifeline. The organization leaves you wanting to help more than you ever thought possible. There was not a day that went by when I didn't think of how much I wanted to be there volunteering. The staff not only cares about the volunteers, but the amount of care they exude for the animals is truly heartwarming. Hands down, it was the best cause I have ever been involved in.
Pawmetto Lifeline	103374	1	/users/profile/137688	fowens	Volunteer	5	01/13/2012	I have worked with other rescues in the past and this one is amazing. They have a passion for animals that is truly unmatched. What i also admire about this group is that they have a goal that goes beyond the individual dog and they have a clear mission of how to accomplish that goal. They want to make the Columbia area a no kill community through educating the public and low cost spay and neuter. So many rescues do a wonderful job rescuing animals and I am thankful for all that they do, but I thank Pawmetto for having the vision to see beyond the today and working hard to do something about the problem of pet overpopulation. PROACTIVE, that is how you get it done!
Pawmetto Lifeline	103237	2	/users/profile/137337	Mary58	Volunteer	5	01/12/2012	Pawmetto Lifeline is an awesome organization that rescues animals from "death row" in the shelters and gets them ready to be adopted in a forever home. They have been working on building a no-kill shelter which will open this month! They will be offering clinics to spay and neuter. Wonderful group!
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	140328		/users/profile/186501	lsherrill	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I have volunteered as an RN for the Smith Clinic.  During my time there I was amazed and impressed by the level of skill of both the doctors and nurses.  Their knowledge and expertise were exceptional.  I was also most impressed by the compassion shown to the patients.  Everyone was treated professionally and with respect.  I haven't been able to volunteer lately but my husband and I are sponsors and will continue to be involved.  It is so wonderful to know that there is such a well-organized and much needed resource for people in our community.   I am also thankful that there are such caring people in our area.  The office staff is so helpful and able to keep things running despite busy days.  I really enjoyed my time there and hope to be able to return soon!
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	139229		/users/profile/185334	Dolores2	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	I never knew the work the clinic did until I volunteer. I was very impressed and blown away when I saw the professional Doctor & Nurses volunteering of their time in order that people with no insurance can get medical care. They were way ahead of themselves before there was ever Obama Care, they were providing this service to people in need. They are so caring from the professionals as well as the volunteers. God Bless the work they do , they are their brother keeper by doing .
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	137568		/users/profile/183556	scarlet2pa	Board Member	5	11/12/2012	I have been involved with Smith Medical Clinic since 1995 and am sure that my life and the lives of those the clinic serves has been totally enriched by this free medical clinic.  Mrs. Nancy and Dr. Cathcart Smith were an amazing team with a heart to help others when they retired from his busy medical practice in Conway, SC.  Dr. Smith never met a stranger and certainly the patients he saw never left the clinic as a stranger.  Patients still feel this way after 25 years of serving those folks without health insurance.  Sometimes the wait is long but it is almost guaranteed you will get the attention you need and deserve.  We all love what we do here and the folks served appreciate the time and energy spent.  What a blessing to staff, volunteers and patients.

Smith Medical Clinic Inc	135283		/users/profile/181146	adkinshg	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I have been volunteering with the Smith Medical Clinic for several months now.  The Smith Clinic helps fill a large need in our community for care for the uninsured.  With the excellent leadership of the director and nurses, along with the many volunteers who help with getting patients qualified for pharmaceutical assistance and food support, there are many patients at Smith Clinic who are better controlled on their blood pressure, diabetes, and other chronic conditions than the patients are who HAVE insurance.  In a tourism-dependent area, it is amazing how many of the people who make everyone's vacation possible are struggling to get the healthcare they need.  Smith Clinic helps fill this gap.
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	135232		/users/profile/181097	locasale	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Smith Medical Clinic works to improve the physical, mental and emotional health for the uninsured in Georgetown County.

While volunteering as a Registered Nurse, I notice efficiency, caring, teamwork, dedication to excellence and a very warm courteous respectful atmosphere. I recently started working full time again so my volunteer hours are very limited and I sure miss being able to be there!  This non profit is GREAT.
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	134704		/users/profile/180582	Kathy T.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	Oftentimes volunteers never have a chance to see results of our efforts.  That's not the case at Smith Medical Clinic.  Patients are openly appreciative of the services available. As a volunteer, i appreciate my interaction time with patients and fellow volunteers.  The environment at Smith Clinic is mutually satisfying.  What a great deal!
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	134628		/users/profile/180487	luciusfishburne	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I volunteer as a mental health counselor at Smith Medical Clinic and am always moved by the level of commitment I experience there on the part of staff for the underprivileged, the over-burdened and the misdirected. As tears came to my eyes this morning with the news of Obama's victory, my faith is strengthened that goodness operates intuitively in the wings and that its agenda will not be diced by the loudest or best heeled. Smith Clinic for me is a quiet and dedicated beacon of that challenge.
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	134618		/users/profile/180473	Aria1	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I finally was able to retire and do what I always wanted to do--volunteer on a weekly basis.  I have been volunteering at Smith Medical Clinic for over 6 years and have received more  than I ever thought about giving!!!   Smith is more than a free clinic, it is emotional stability to some.  I have seen patients who are so happy to finally get a little relief from their medical problems that they are crying when they leave.  Patients  at Smith receive the most wonderful care and are treated with respect.  I sometimes wish I could be a patient as these patients receive more attention that I get from my medical provider.  The volunteers are not there to receive a paycheck and to get their hours in, they are there because they want to help.    I am proud to be a volunteer at Smith Medical Clinic.
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	134529		/users/profile/180370	SRuark	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I have been  a volunteer at the Smith Medical Clinic for the past two years.   The clinic provides much needed help to so many in our area with no insurance.  As our patients arrive each week when I am working, they are so thankful for the quality medical assistance they receive from our providers.   The clinic is expanding the services for our patients at a time when more help is needed.  I am honored to be able to volunteer at the Smith Medical Clinic.
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	134522		/users/profile/180363	lsprance	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I have been a nurse for almost 30 years.  I work part time in an operating room close by and also at an aesthetics office and then I volunteer 2-4 days per month  at the clinic, when the volunteer surgeons are there.  I can honestly say, that Smith Medical Clinic gives our patients excellent, personalized care.  I really feel we give better care than we receive at our own private insurance-covered offices ourselves.  We love our patients and they depend on us for their primary care and assistance in more than medical problems.  Our doctors, PA's, nurse practitioners and volunteer nurses and office staff are so caring and compassionate and whether we are regulating diabetes or hypertension,  doing surgical procedures, GYN exams, or giving medications or vaccinations, our patients never cease to tell us how much they appreciate us and some even say that we have saved their lives or changed things for them that they never dreamed possible.  The surgeries Drs. Kramer and Hentz do range from removing small skin tags to dangerous skin cancers, draining infected wounds and evaluating problems that patients may have and then referring them to local surgeons who take some of our patients and do major procedures at the hospitals.  We removed a very large keloid from a patient's ear area and he had not been able to sleep on that side or even hold a phone to it for years before that.  We have removed fatty tumors, debrided infectious wounds,  etc. and have done things that would have cost them thousands of dollars that they don't have, and they would not have gotten taken care of, were it not for us. Our community is so supportive and we are well known here.   Being my 3rd job as mentioned earlier, I can honestly say that the satisfaction and rapport with my fellow staff and our patients are sometimes more rewarding than at my paying jobs.  Smiles, compassion, skilled care and dedication among my co-workers, as well as our patients' kindness and gratitude, are some of the many positives that are priceless in life.
Smith Medical Clinic Inc	134511		/users/profile/180352	Mary Kop	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	I volunteered in the office at Smith Clinic for about a year before having to leave for personal reasons.  My experience was extremely rewarding.  One of my jobs was to interview staff, volunteers and patients to write brief biographies for the website and newsletter.  In all three areas I encountered positive, often glowing, responses for all that the clinic does.   I was impressed!  The patients were extremely touched by the caring attitude of the staff and the staff was equally grateful for the opportunity to help people who truly needed them. Georgetown County is indeed fortunate to have such a facility.

Our patients truely appreciate the care they receive with thanks and hugs and at times tears.  Not only do we give and nanage care we educate with  diabetes educators, registerd dieticians and psychtherapists.  We have a pharmacy and a  food pantry which makes geting medications easier and help to feed those housholds who are unable to buy groceries weekly.

Smith Medical Clinic Inc	131066		/users/profile/176600	sjl01699	Volunteer	5	10/30/2012	One in three adults in Georgetown County are uninsured. Smith Medical Clinic helps serve over 2000 unique uninsured patients through over 6000 visits a year, and will continue to serve more residents with the help of volunteers. Our staff and volunteers are all drive and dedicated to provide the best possible care to our patients. I feel lucky to be part of an organization that is having such a great impact in the community. One of our patients described Smith Medical Clinic as follows, "There are people forgotten, struggling, thinking they don't matter. Smith Medical Clinic shows these people they do matter, they are not forgotten, and their health does matter... To the people who feel forgotten, there is a place where you and your health is of utmost importance-right at the Smith Medical Clinic."

In return they give us their gratitude and friendship and the satisfaction of seeing their health and quality of life improve.  It is an honor to be associated with an organization which is held in the highest esteem in the community.

I have never been associated with any organization which serves its clients with as much care, compassion and skill as Smith Clinic.

Meals on Wheels-Anderson	134670		/users/profile/180546	Barry10	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I volunteer to deliver Meals to the elderly and shut-ins in and around Williamston.  I am fortunate that I am able to carry middle school students with me to deliver these meals.  We deliver every Monday and the smiles and joys expressed on the faces of our recipients are so pleasing.  However, nothing can replace the comments the children make upon completing their volunteer session.  They constantly tell me: "That was awesome."  "I really like being able to help others."  "Thanks for taking me."  Its so sad, but I am glad I could bring a little joy to..."Meals on Wheels is a great organization and its volunteers deliver nutritious meals and smiles daily.

The people that I volunteer with are really great to work with. We always have a fun time and have developed into a very "speedy" group. Also, the management and staff at MOW in Anderson are very helpful, friendly, and a pleasure to work with. I really enjoy my time spent working, and it enables me to "give back" to our local community.

Meals on Wheels-Anderson	132011		/users/profile/177610	Larry16	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	I had the opportunity to volunteer in the role of bookkeeping for a couple of weeks and I was astounded at the amount of work that goes on with so little staff.  Fortunately, there are hundreds of volunteers that make this Organization unlike any I have seen and I have have seen a lot of them.  They have quite a large budget and 100% of the income is from their Fundraisers and contributions from the Community at large.  They do not receive any State or Federal funding and this is by choice of the local Board of Directors.  The vast majority of the income is spent on food purchases which are supplemented by local donations of food.  They currently serve between 400 and 500 meals per day, making sure that their client's needs are met such as those on special diets for diabetes, etc..  This is no easy task and my hat is off to the Director and her Staff for the great job that they do along with all of the dedicated volunteers that really make it work.
Meals on Wheels-Anderson	131985		/users/profile/177584	LindaSp	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Delivering meals to Meals on Wheels folks is a pleasure and a necessary service.  Talking to these people is a welcome opportunity to them and me, and a smile is the biggest reward.  In addtion, I get to help in other ways, such as working to get additional services provided where needed.  Getting the SC state program to provide recorded books to a person with limited vision is an example.  Anderson Meals on Wheels is a vital service to our community, and works well with other local organizations to get food to needy people at a low cost.

Meals on Wheels-Anderson	131817		/users/profile/177404	Patty Cleveland	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	Meals on Wheels not only does an unbelievable job serving hundreds of home bound people each day, it continues to recruit individuals of all ages from local residences, business', schools, etc. to volunteer on a daily basis to serve and deliver meals. You not only build a friendship amongst fellow volunteers but also with the individual's you deliver meals to. There is such a feeling of family among all. Meals on Wheels also takes the time to acknowledge its volunteers with an annual luncheon giving rewards to volunteers that have been giving so much of their time over the years. You really must visit the Meals on Wheels facility to appreciate the overall mechanics of this charitable operation and the people who work there daily to make it happen. They are to be commended. Thank You.

Having learned and watched the amount of time & work that she gives to this program is amazing and very rewarding to my heart.  It is her love for others, to go above and beyond her call of duty, many times, because she is decided to serving the clients as if each and every one is the only one she & her staff are preparing a meal for. The personal touch from Jeanie Cochran is unbelievable for the large amount of homebound requiring a hot meal.  Meals on Wheels-Anderson is a well greased wheel that keeps on running, getting those meals out to the ones in need.

Meals on Wheels-Anderson	101320		/users/profile/129184	karamchandani	Volunteer	5	11/29/2011	When my daughter who is now 22 years old was 2 years old I had an opportunity to volunteer at one of the local schools.  I volunteered till she graduated from the elementary school.  I also volunteered for Anmed health for few years.  But I have been volunteering for this organization since 2004. I really love doing this from the bottom of my heart.  If for some reason I need to go on vacation on the day I volunteer,  I feel sad because I will not be able to see my recipients.  I will keep on serving meals till I live in this area. Once I was delivering the meal and the recipient open the door in winter and the house temperature was very hot.  I was kind of burning, so I asked the recipient  if you want me to change the temperature because his eyesight was not good and couldn't see small numbers on thermostat and he said come on in and set it right.  I couldn't  believe my eyes because it was set on 85 degrees.  I asked him and set it on 74 degrees.  Recently couple weeks back one elderly recipient, who is by herself had a similar kind of problem.  I starting smelling gas as soon as she opened the door to get the meal from me and I asked is everything okay and then she asked me if I could come inside and look, then I saw she had a huge gas heater which was warming her cozy home.  She said when I turn on it smells for a little bit of time.This organization changes your route every now then because they get new recipients every day.  I do miss my old recipients, but I can see many new recipients.  These recipients love to talk to all volunteers and thank you so many times. In short, I am blessed with this opportunity to serve my community.

Although serving the recipients is the primary reason for my association with MOW, working with the staff is an unexpected bonus.  It is amazing how they go out of their way to accommodate any request.  These outstanding professionals truly bring the spirit of service to everything they do.  They have an often difficult and demanding job, but always maintain a cheerful and fraternal attitude.

This script was highly entertaining and the actors and actresses in the performance hit a home run in my opinion. I would highly recommend that anyone interested in seeing a truly wonderful comedy, yet with a message for everyone, see Perfectly Normal People.  Michael Kirk

My husband is from the former Soviet Union and has seen more versions of Chekhov's Three Sisters than he can count; yet, within minutes of watching Threshold's adaptation, he forgot he was watching Americans, forgot he was hearing the play in English and became utterly absorbed.

Threshold Repertory Theatre	166476		/users/profile/221150	Charlie9	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/29/2013	Threshold Rep Theatre is a relatively new community theatre in Charleston.   I have now seen more than nine shows there.   The performances are excellent with talented actors and knowledgeable directors representing a wide range of theatre..   The venue is small (90 - 100) so that there is a desirable closeness to the action.  The price is always reasonable, sometimes well below many other local theatres.    The location is  very handy and accessible with parking and restaurants nearby.  All things considered, Threshold represents one of the best theatre experiences in Charleston

Golden S Rescue Inc	308767		/users/profile/400140	brittb	Client Served	2	10/07/2016	I bought a dog from this rescue back in 2011. Like every other reviewer,  the delivery date had been delayed for almost a month after finalizing the adoption. The only person I communicated with was rodney.  I had been looking for a puggle and they had one. From what I was told, she had been in a kill shelter for a week and then sent to golden S rescue due to the fact that the kill shelter called them and asked to take her bc there was nothing wrong with her. Rodney told me that she was "slow to warm up"  but fine with people and other dogs. He also told me she had cherry eyes occasionally,  but seemed to only pop out when she was around newspaper,  which is what they kept in the crate with her as I was told, and would go back into place once massaged in. Finally I received her, after incessantly calling and questioning when I was to receive her. Rodney came by around midnight from South Carolina to New York. As he walked in with her I thought what did i just do. She was looking skinny to the extreme and her bug out cherry eyes weren't helping the situation. Rodney brought her in and she clung to him for the entire ten minutes he was in the house. She was more than just "shy to warm up" she was terrified and untrusting.  I was told they were not aware of any abuse in her past history before the kill shelter but didn't know the exact story. I was not prepared for the amount of time and effort that was to come. As Rodney left I had walked my new dog outside to walk him out, and as he drives off I cannot get the dog back inside. She was so skidderish and terrified that as I pick her up (which Rodney told me to do) she nips me in the neck. Rodney told me to calm her down say "it's ok dolly"  over and over again. So I did,  and finally got her to trust me about 2 hours later.  I had 2 other dogs at the time and was living with my parents and two younger brothers..so a big family with a terrified dog. I brought her to the vet and she checked out, was said to be about the age i was told , which was an estimation of about 1.5 years old. After a week of having her,  I called golden a rescue several times and left several messages without any reply. I wasn't sure if i wanted to send her back but I wanted to talk to them about her nipping and neuroticness and what I could do to help the situation. She was quite neurotic, to the point where she didn't pee or poop for almost 3 days of having her. She would nip at other people if they touched her without her seeing them or if they woke her up from sleep ( which she did to my 3 yr old cousin who was just gently petting her). She aggressively attacked my parents chicken. She didn't bark at all for the first few months I had her and she would follow me around all day long and was not comfortable being on her own.  I was terrified of her at times, scared to pick her up, and it was a hassle having people over. Once my beagle showed her it's ok to bark due to his constant howling, she would bark for hours at anyone who walked in the door or came to drop off packages or mail. For a while,  it was a nightmare having her and golden s rescue never responded to me after dropping her off. Long story short, its five years later now, and she is a completely different dog. She's still a bit homely looking and her cherry eyes never popped back into place like I was told but I love her to bits. She is the absolute sweetest little thing, playful, polite, extremely obedient, finally trusting of other people and great with other dogs.. but it took A LONG TIME.. and A LOT  of effort to get her to where she is now, with the help of my beagle. She learned a lot of good behavior from observing my beagle and learned how to trust people and interact with people from him (he's a social butterfly). I probably wouldn't have adopted her if I knew all of this from the start but I'm so glad I did bc she's a fantagstic dog now and keeps getting better. She's improved greatly just in this last year after moving with her and my beagle to Austin and getting an immense amount of socialization in the city as opposed to living in the suburbs. I actually wanted to contact the rescue to tell them about how great she is doing now and came across the article about Deborah's arrest and the seizure of the dogs from the rescue. It always seemed a little sketch to me so I am not surprised and I'm glad I got to save one dog from there who could have ended up suffering greatly.  Such a shame and disappointment on their behalf.

I adopted a "pomchi" from them in 2013 named Chicklet.  After paying the adoption fee and making a food donation Rodney brought her to me in MD about 7 days later.  He spent 2 mins in the house and he was gone.  I have MS and needed a small dog.  I took Chicklet to the Vet for a check and he says that is a beautiful Sheltie you have there!  Well 3 weeks later she was moving room size rugs had gained 14 pounds and was biting my grandchildren to heard them.  I called Rodney broken  with a broken hear and explained he needed to pick her up because I could not care for such a large dog. He swore she was a pomchi and reluctantly picked her up never offered an exchange and of course i saw nothing of my money. I often wonder what happened to that sweet little girl.
Golden S Rescue Inc	232621	3	/users/profile/296168	Amy_205	Client Served	4	11/02/2014	I am so sad to hear that Golden S turned into what it did. We adopted our dog through Golden S five years ago and had a terrific experience. We received our dog's full medical history, abuse and rescue story as well as a follow up story regarding the person who abused her. Rodney delivered her to us in MD within a week. The owner was responsive and Rodney was friendly. Our experience was so positive that my best friend also adopted from them...also a positive experience. Honestly, I would have given them five stars if it weren't for the fact that our pure bred Boxer puppy ended up being a Boxer/Rottie mix--however, that was the risk we took when choosing to rescue. They gave no guarantees regarding breed--just educated guesses. My experience, as well as my friend's isn't a gimmick or marketing post by Golden S insiders. It is real. That said, most of the positive posts are from several years ago. Perhaps Golden S experienced financial problems and just didn't know when to throw in the towel. Whatever it was, it's not OK to go from being the rescuer to being the problem. They should have known better than anyone if animals were malnourished or suffering. So sorry to see the demise of a once reputable group. Even sadder to learn that they prolonged the animal's suffering.
Golden S Rescue Inc	206701	5	/users/profile/269163	SweetDee23	Client Served	1	07/20/2014	Woah. So glad to hear this person was arrested. Dealing with this place was an absolute nightmare. I'm sure we must've done a little research before adopting, but apparently not enough! First of all, my husband and I were in the process of moving into a new house. We had an elderly jack russell terrier and were looking for a calm, friendly, docile dog to keep him company (between the age of 1-4). We fell in love with the photos of a few pups but decided on one in particular. We were assured that she was super friendly with adults, children and other dogs, house broken (which I took with a grain of salt) and most definitely crate trained. Yeah... Not so much. Like other reviewers mentioned, Rodney kept pushing the date of the delivery back. Something told me maybe we should just cancel it because it just started to give us an uneasy feeling. Finally, one day in July '12 he was making a few drop offs in the Northeast and was really scheduled to bring her to us (this time). MIDNIGHT. He showed up at MIDNIGHT. It was pitch black outside and he just handed us her leash, we gave him some leftover bbq, and he left. 10 min max. Imagine our surprise when the dog REFUSED TO WALK THE 5 STEPS UP TO OUR FRONT DOOR. We called him and told him she just wouldn't do it (mind you, she was way over the age of 1 that they told us she was and she was some kind of shepherd, rottie mix and enormous, not the lab mix they claimed).His suggestion was to just pull her up the steps. Thanks. We tried coaxing her with food and by 1 am, we wound up just pulling her up the steps. We called and spoke to them about her skittishness, her trouble with the stairs, and all other concerns and they were no help. She would jump on our window sills and bark day and night, she REFUSED to go in her crate, and she eventually bit our elderly dog. That of course was the last straw and called and demanded that they take her back. More excuses, more scheduling conflicts. The week it took for them to come get her was the longest week of our lives.    One day I was making coffee and let her in our yard. Alone for maybe 4 minutes, and she escaped. Luckily I left a collar and leash on her (because she had gotten off the leash once before) and was able to grab her leash before she got off our block. Problem was, her collar was a little loose and she still refused to go up our front steps (or go anywhere, very scared) so I was stuck outside with this dog for HOURS. I finally got a neighbor to hold her leash so I could run inside to get my phone to call my husband. I wanted the dog gone that day. We were prepared to board her until they finally came to get her. Instead, my husband called a local dog trainer to try to get her in the house. That didn't work and she got off the leash and ran. It took my husband, the dog trainer and animal control to grab her. Animal control took her and we called the woman from the rescue (she was on the phone for part of this nonsense and her fantastic advice was to put her on speakerphone so the dog could hear her and calm down. Thanks). She was furious that we gave the dog to animal control and we told her to just go get the dog and take it home LIKE SHE SAID SHE WOULD A WEEK PRIOR). We spoke to animal control and they spoke to her and she was all dramatic and hysterical saying we killed the dog by giving it to them. The guy from animal control basically told her if she wants the dog, then she needs to come get it. End of story. Apparently they did. Of course we were never returned our $200. They are NOT a rescue. They have no idea what they are doing with these dogs. That dog should never have been adopted out. After we had her, Rodney finally admitted she was not 1, but more like 3.5 and had been living in a field at the "rescue" since she was a pup. No wonder she was terrified of the stairs and our house - she'd never been in one! This review is long but doesn't even come close to explaining the terror we felt for ourselves and our other dog whilst living with that large, scared, aggressive dog.  I'm thankful that she's been arrested (Rodney was no better IMHO). Hopefully they'll never be allowed near animals again and will never be able to scam another innocent family. We wound up adopting from Sean Casey Animal Rescue in Brooklyn. We got a pup a few weeks after this whole thing happened. We could not be happier. I guess things happen for a reason :)
Golden S Rescue Inc	204576	1	/users/profile/266601	stidti	Client Served	1	06/29/2014	I tried to adopt a dog from Golden S and initially received great lip service about when the delivery would be. The date kept slipping and as time went by, Rodney became less and less helpful to the point of being rude and insulting when I finally asked for my $200 deposit back after almost one month passed without my getting my dog. I finally adopted out of state and had PETS LLC ship a dog up from Georgia on time and on schedule. Golden S Rescue being arrested for pet neglect somehow seems fitting. They are not what a rescue is supposed to be. 
Golden S Rescue Inc	202464	1	/users/profile/264159	kathleen.alexander09	Client Served	2	06/10/2014	I adopted a year old maltese poodle mix. Or so I thought. I started the adoption process in September of 2013 and didn't get my dog until October 31 2013. The date was delayed and delayed and of course Rodney was late on the day of the drop off. He arrived with my dog, who turned out to be a jack russell yorkie mix. The dog was sick with a cough and worms when I got her. I immediately took her to the vet and got medicine for her so thankfully she is OK but the vet said that she had not been sick for just a few days like Rodney claimed. When he arrived, Rodney didn't have any paperwork for the dog so she had to be re vaccinated. I kept asking Rodney for the paperwork. He kept claiming that it was on its way. But i still have yet to receive it.  I love my dog and I am so happy to have rescued her. But there is no surprise to hear about the conditions of the rescue and the arrest of the owner. 
Golden S Rescue Inc	200576	3	/users/profile/261852	svea	Client Served	1	05/20/2014	I adopted a pet from Golden S Rescue in 2011 and he was supposed to be 4 1/2 years old.  I made sure to adopt a pet that age as my prior dog had diabetes and without insurance it would have been costly.  Pet insurance requires a dog under 8 years old. Rodney and I had a discussion about picking up my dog on the New York State Thruway.  I drove to the site of the supposed pick up, a stop on the highway.  The destination and time kept changing and finally I ended up alone in a dark parking lot that seemed to be close to a state facility for criminals.  It felt unsafe and I went alone as a woman.  About 4 hours late, Rodney arrived and my dog was stuffed in a cat crate with 4 others dogs, crates on top of each other, in a compact car back seat. There were no papers along with the dog.  He was not fed or drank on the 17 hour trip as Rodney said he was unable to stop along the road.  He said my dog whined the whole way and that he was a pain.  I only received the dog, nothing else.  And he was in bad shape, needed a bath and to be cared for and he seemed hungry and thirsty. Rodney said he would send the papers and tags as soon as he got back.  He did not and I began to harass Golden S for his tags and papers.  A month later they arrived and the papers that were originally with the dog upon relinquishment stated that the dog was 9 years old.  I called and complained.  I was angry about the false statement.  Rodney said he would come and pick up the dog if I don't want it.  I said I would not let him near my dog.  Cut the losses.  His response to the fact the dog was 9 instead of 4 was, "Doesn't he look 4?". When I brought my dog to the vet, he was affirmed as 9 years old with congestive heart failure.  They were not honest with me.  My dog, Max, is the best dog in the whole world and I would not trade him for anything.  He is doing well.  Costly but I love him and I would never send him back.  His later years he will be well cared for.   I feel blessed that I saved him from the horrors of their rescue attempts.  Obviously, the intentions might have been honorable with the animals from the start, but when things started reeling out of control, both Owner and Rodney, should have sought help and gone public with their inability to care for the animals.   Deceit is never a good tactic for a business.  It does come to get you at some point and time.  I hope these rescued animals do not remain in the care of the shelter and the Judge releases them for good homes and love.  They deserve it.

This so called rescuer is nothing but a menace to elderly, sickly and shelter victims.  Yes the animals in her care are VICTIMS OF SLOW DEATH.  To rescue is not to take shelter animals from a bad situation only to place them in a worse situation.  RESCUE is much more than "pulling" an unwanted animal from a shelter only to be tossed outside in a kennel.  SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN FOR GOOD.  She literally robbed animals and adopters of money.  Shame shame.  March 31 2013 is her court appearance and I pray she does not get any animals back.

C. was busted on February 19th. The dogs and cats were living in a horrific situation. Animal Control took 11 of the sickest dogs the week before and came back on the 19th to remove the rest. They removed 92 dogs and 28 cats and the operator  was arrested. The dogs were sick, filthy, malnourished, sleeping in their own feces in a cold building. All of the animals were taken to Anderson County P.A.W.S. They need donations of dog food, Pedigree or Purina, cat food, puppy food, towels, blankets, puppy pads and monetary donations.

Some animals near death when seized.  Charged with multiple counts of animal cruelty.
Golden S Rescue Inc	194557	2	/users/profile/253088	Momof281605	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/20/2014	Just to let everyone know, the owner of this rescue was taken in to custody for mistreatment of animals. One died while the authorities were seizing the animals (almost 100). Those animals were covered in feces and very underfed. I also have some suspicion that my dog was stolen from my yard and then put on her page for adoption. I am happy that some of you have a good story, but there are a lot people and animals associated with this rescue that don't.  
Golden S Rescue Inc	194029		/users/profile/253472	SJ2010	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2014	I adopted both my babies from GSR about 4 years ago. Both Rodney and Debra were very responsive and my dogs were even delivered to my house with no extra charge. It was very obvious they received great care and love while at GSR. I would recommend this rescue group to anyone! My two dogs are by far the best dogs I have ever had, and make wonderful family pets. A friend of mine also adopted from them and also had a great experience with the whole process. This is a wonderful rescue!!!!!
Golden S Rescue Inc	193238	1	/users/profile/252411	breareeves	General Member of the Public	1	01/28/2014	When my dog was delivered I received only one sheet of paper with hand written dates of when she was vaccinated along with a date of when she was spayed and her microchip number. I took her to the vet two days later, come to find out she had no microchip and was not spayed. Both the vet and I doubted that she had any shots, so I had to get those taken care of as well. When she was delivered, Rodney (the man who runs Golden S Rescue) had the wrong rabies tag. He said he would get hers to me in the mail but I have yet to receive it and it has been almost two weeks. I have emailed him about it but there has been no response. I was first told the dog was 1 year old, then 9 months old, and then ten minutes before arriving to my house Rodney called and said she was only 5-6 months old. He was 2.5 hours late to delivering her which is understandable since he had 5 deliveries that day. However Rodney showed up in a small Mazda with only one medium sized dog crate. I do not see how he could fit five dogs in that little car and I really hope he did not have all five in the crate together. There was supposed to be one more delivery after mine but my dog was the only one in the car. During the interview process Rodney kept saying how sweet of a dog she was and how well behaved she was but then whe he told me she was only 5-6 months he said he had just met her that day when he picked her up from the foster house.  Rodney was very polite, responsive and informative during the interview, but once I made my donation he was non responsive and very hard to get a hold of. I literally thought I had been totally scammed since I was not hearing back from him. He also said he would send out the delivery itinerary either Tuesday or Wednesday but he did not send it out until Thurday afternoon and we were supposed to be getting the dog on Saturday.  This rescue is extremely unorganized, bad with responding to their customers, story was constantly changing (age of dog) and it seems as though they are scamming people. They claim that the $295.00 donation includes all of their shots, spaying/neutering and microchipping. I will spend what ever it takes to keep my dog healthy but I am putting in an extra 500 dollars that I was not expecting to have to pay for shots, spaying, and microchipping.  Myself and other people who are trying to do a good thing by rescuing an animal should not be taken advantage of and lied to. Something needs to be done. Had I trusted the word of the rescue that my dog was vaccinated and I not gotten the shots for her from my vet, who knows what could have happened to her health. It is simply not right to be lied to about something so serious as a living animal. I would rather have paid the $295 and the rescue be honest with me then be told false information. I do not reccomend this rescue and they should be taken off of adoptapet.com, they are giving them a very bad reputation. 
Golden S Rescue Inc	192945	2	/users/profile/251982	M.J.L.	Client Served	1	01/22/2014	I adopted a puppy in November of 2012. I did not receive the dog until January 2013. The dog looked nothing like the picture that was on adoptapet. After all the delays a third party transport met me and a few other behind a hotel to deliver the dog's dogs were uncrated and handed over with no paperwork. I took the dog home and within days it had viciously attacked a member of my family who was visiting. I followed the contract I had signed and requested the dog be taken back. I was told it would be a week before they could get him. I was also told I would be getting my adoption fee back. I stayed in touch trying to make sure this dog got sent to a home it would work out better with and I was then told I would not get the adoption fee back until the dog was readopted. Then golden s rescue stopped responding to my texts, emails or phone calls for almost a year. When I noticed the dog was not up for adoption anymore I tried to contact the 'rescue" again to hold them to their word. I was then sent a nasty email from Rodney threatening me with charging me for the transport  cost of picking the dog back up, over three times what I had paid for an adoption fee. I am not sure how a rescue can legally send a aggressive dog, demand it be sent back and then charge a transport fee for sending it back. I believe I was scammed from the beginning. The dog was put back up for adoption under different state and breed and even though it had been a year it was still listed as 10 months old. The "rescue' refuses to prove they still have the dog and have now taken it down off the adoption listing. I have contacted the attorney general but the "rescue' will not answer or return their phone calls either. I truly hope enough people complain about the way they are scammed by this place and it gets shut down. This is not a rescue organization. It is a scam! 
Golden S Rescue Inc	191232		/users/profile/249631	rr89	Client Served	1	12/19/2013	It is with great sadness that I write this review.  We were planning on rescuing a black pug (started the process in November, 2013) and we finally got the dog this past Sunday, December 15th.  Rodney and Debra were both very elusive about information on the dog.  Delays after delays and finally after waiting 4 hours, Rodney met us with the dog.  The dog arrived to us totally emaciated.  Literally skin and bones.  Debra told me that he scratched his eye the day prior but that wasn't the case.  On Monday I rushed the dog to the vet in tears and the vet was appalled that a rescue had him for over 3 weeks.  He was suffering from malnutrition.  He was blind in one eye and was suffering from a tumor (which she said just happened) the vet disagreed.  She sent amoxicillin (unmarked) which I believe was her's and not prescribed for the dog and expired eye drops!  The vet flat out told me that this dog either needed 3-4k in eye surgeries and hospitalization or had to be put down.  It was suffering so badly.  I contacted Debra who lied to me emphatically.  I asked for a refund and assured her that she would never get this dog back to abuse.  My vet helped me find a rescue/vet that was willing to try to help this poor dog.  This sweetheart dog was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  My daughter was absolutely devastated.  I do NOT recommend this rescue and am looking into reporting them for animal abuse.  My vet was appalled at his condition from a medical standpoint.  I did get my payment refunded but I didn't want the money... we wanted our dog.

Rodney delivered her to our home in New Jersey, for no additional charge, and we have been madly in love with our little girl ever since. Debra was always responsive to all of our concerns and questions, and we could'nt be happier. These people are true animal lovers. They are not in the business of lying to make a buck, or kissing up to someone so that they will buy a dog. They do what they do out of a deep love for the unwanted, unloved, 4 legged creatures of the world. We highly recommend Golden S Rescue to anyone who has room in their heart and home for a dog, and we would not hesitate to adopt a dog from them again.

They don't eat ,sleep, anything until the animals are safe.  It is amazing to see how they take in what other people don't want. Every dog I came in contact with there was happy, friendly, & ready to love you. The animals are loved & taken care of above all else. They are dedicated to saving animals of all situations & backgrounds. They do good work & are in constant need of support. 
Golden S Rescue Inc	120621	7	/users/profile/164070	doglovr	Client Served	1	08/14/2012	I adopted a puppy from this organization through PetFinder about a year ago.  I was told the dog would be about 10 lbs. full grown and that it would be brought to my home.  I asked questions about the disposition of the dog and was told, "it all depends what you put into the dog how it turns out; we do not know of any problems."  That was true because they had never seen the dog before they picked it up from a shelter or wherever it was in CT on the way to deliver it.  The dog was about 10-12 weeks old when we got it and already weighed 8 lbs.  I was shocked when I first saw the dog.  This has been a problem for us, since he now weighs 30 lbs. full grown.  I am unable to bring him with me places and have to put him in day care which is an added expense.  The dog is afflicted with fear aggression.  We have taken him to the vet regularly and also obedience classes.  We continue to work with him, but he is a very scared little guy.  I have no idea what he went through before we got him and chances are neither does Golden S.  On the day of the delivery, I ended up meeting Rodney at a spot 40 minutes from my home at midnight because he just wasn't coming to where we lived.  If you look at photos on their website, you see that the deliveries seem to be in parking lots--this is the reason.  They  do not come to your home!!  There was another couple there waiting as well and they asked me if I thought there was something "fishy" about the organization and I found it interesting that they thought this, as I did, too.  Rodney was rude, seldom returned phone calls and no one ever called later to see how the dog was doing or how we were doing.  The only recourse available is to return the dog, which is not an option since we love him. We will continue to incur expenses for individual training, and day care and will not be able to take him where there are people for quite a while, if ever.   If Golden S had represented themselves and the dog honestly, it might have been an entirely different experience and certainly better for the dog.

I can't tell you how many times I have seen her post videos of others breeds or other locations just trying to help save lives and improve quality of life.  As I said. I'm a past "client" and adopted my little buddy Bear from PomRescue.  He was blind and had been turned into a shelter after turning up on a porch in a rainstorm.  He was sadly never claimed and was pulled from the shelter by PomRescue, where I eventually found him.  I can never say thank you enough for the time that I had with him (he passed in March).

Shelter Animals Advocates	305782	4	/users/profile/397058	Merance A.	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	I have interacted with this non-profit group for over 2 years. I  have volunteered in the past to foster dogs for them, take dogs to vet appointments and transports, etc,. This is an incredibly hard-working group that rescues dogs that would have had NO chance of being saved without their intervention. This group specializes in dogs with Heartworm which normally would not be adopted out by our shelter (they choose to simply euthanize them, because of the high cost of treatment).  The hoops this group has to go to to save each dog is incredible - Heartworm treatment is time-consuming and expensive, so they must raise funds for every dog they want to save, find a place for it to stay while it undergoes treatment (which takes about a month), and once the dog is healthy and heartworm negative, find it a home. Our shelter (like many) has a lot of bully breeds and special needs dogs. Most rescues know these dogs can be hard to place. This group does not discriminate against these often misunderstood and overlooked dogs. While this is great, it often means it takes longer for them to find the perfect home adding to the expense and difficulty of rescuing these kinds of dogs.  They need ongoing support to continue to save and treat these dogs. I have fostered several heartworm positive dogs that were WONDERFUL dogs and went on to forever homes with families that love them. Here are a few cuties that they saved and I fostered.

They spoke to my references to ensure we would be a safe adoption for Ghost and I appreciate that so much. Ghost was a stray picked up and found to be heart worm positive. This organization rescued him, treated him, and helped him find the right home (with my family!) :)We were able to met Ghost and take him home with us after a few days from the adoption application. The shelter animals advocates will be following up with a home visit in the next few days. I am so happy to have found Ghost through the website, he has been an awesome addition to our family. 
Shelter Animals Advocates	305774	4	/users/profile/397051	NikkiFred42	Volunteer	5	09/20/2016	Shelter Animals Advocates The HeartBeat Goes On Campaign is an amazing rescue that does fantastic things for the heartworm positive dogs at the local shelter! I've been volunteering with them for over two years and can attest with first hand knowledge that every penny goes to the dogs and that every dog is loved and matched with the correct home.  This rescue really goes above and beyond to help these unwanted dogs!! In addition to volunteering, I also adopted a dog through this rescue. She was a 10 year old GSD that was severely underweight, afraid, sick, and HW positive. No other rescue would help her! I've now had her for two years and she has been an amazing addition to my family! She would never have made it out of the shelter alive without Shelter Animals Advocates.

Shelter Animals Advocates	305500	4	/users/profile/396752	Polly8	Volunteer	5	09/19/2016	Shelter Animals Advocates and the HeartBeat Goes On programs are really quite extraordinary. Started by two women, who saw the need and had the vision, they have gained strength and momentum over the past 3 years of being in the 'business' of saving dogs' lives. The leaders of these groups work tirelessly, against all odds, to network and save dogs while keeping 'normal' day jobs. They have recruited many local foster parents for the dogs. There are over one hundred rescues working with them to help fund and transport the dogs from the shelter to the veterinarians to the foster homes to the transport vehicles and finally, to the new adoptive homes. These ladies do all the fund raising themselves as well. If you ever need a reliable charity to whom you'd like to donate and you love dogs, these two really deserve it. They spend every penny received on the dogs' care. Below I've posted a "before and after". When this dog was found, chained up and abandoned, heart worm positive with a bloody neck from his collar, he weighed 39 pounds and was riddled with fleas and internal parasites. By the time he left his foster home, he was in perfect health and weighed 65 pounds. Shelter Animals Advocates is a wonderful and amazing organization for these dogs. They deserve all the recognition they can get!

Veronica was also helpful pointing me towards some YouTube videos that were indispensable in helping me to train Tanka, and to dispel some unreasonable expectations I had, about exactly how a Service-Dog should do it's job. In my mind Tanka would have to just about be able to balance on a beach-ball, while juggling my car-keys and cell-phone, AND be able to tell me when a cyclone was about to hit! (I know, I'm a bit nuts in my expectations!)Tanka has become a very well trained, and useful tool in alleviating some of my P.T.S.D. symptoms while out in public, especially shopping.......or going to bok-kai festival,  hiking, the fair, post office.......and he does his job void of a beach-ball!That's it!Thanks Veronica, and everyone over at P.S.D.P. for working on my behalf, to improve the standard of living for those of us suffering psychiatric-illness, and using a Service-Dog as a healing tool.Hugs.....

Without the help in understanding the laws, training, etiquette and more, about owner trained service dogs there would be many many people who would be completely alone in the process. Luckily PSDP can help all of these people through the whole process of learning and training and becoming not only a successful service dog user but also help them become healthier and happier and more successful human beings because of the work our dogs do for us!
Psychiatric Service Dog Partners	280905	2	/users/profile/370901	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/25/2016	Psychiatric Service Dog Partners is a wonderful, grassroots, organization dedicate to advocacy, education and support of those of us living with mental illness and using a service dog to mitigate our disabilities.  One thing I most respect about this organization is their dedication to accuracy and knowing the laws that support the use of psychiatric service dogs.  There are a lot of websites out there that tell people what they want to hear, simply to make a sale.  In many instances, the items they sell ARE NOT REQUIRED in any way.  PSDP stands above the rest and I always know that the information I get from their site is factual.

Everyone has been so wonderfully supportive, caring and giving of their time as I anxiously walk through the process. From training tips to input on suitable vests, collars, leashes, and patches they have been extremely patient and more than helpful in allaying my fears. I highly recommend them as the go to site for support and accurate up to date information regarding psychiatric service dogs.

I had decided that I would pursue using a service dog to help me in my recovery.  I found PSDP by accident and am extremely glad I did so.  I have been a member of the online support group since this spring and have found the level of wisdom, courage and support shared among members invaluable.  I also serve on the board of our local NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) and recently gave a talk on psychiatric service dogs at our monthly meeting.  I drew heavily from the information on the PSDP webpage as well as the stories of hope and recovery members of the support group were willing to share.   To me PSDP is an integral part of the light that brings me hope especially during my darkest days.

I'm in my 30's and had not been able to live alone since my diagnosis at 21.  I wanted to do a masters program,  but I had to go away alone,  and I knew I'd need more help to live independently,  so I started looking for a service dog.  I found absolutely no support in my local region,  and all training agencies told me specifically that due to capacity reasons,  they don't train for mental health conditions.  I found an independent trainer who was willing to work with us on this project,  and we did our  best.When I found psych service dog partners,  a lot changed for me.  I have learned about how to fine tune my training,  how to be respectful of others in public spaces,  and many other dog related issues.I have also found a community of people,  for the first time in my life, that understands and supports me.  Through the listserv,  there are always people available to share my frustrations at being disabled,  to listen to, to talk to.  This has meant more to me than I can say.
Psychiatric Service Dog Partners	262635	2	/users/profile/351321	Horsefiddle	Volunteer	5	10/09/2015	I volunteer to help this extremely worthwhile non-profit, PSDP, because, as a handler trainer of my third psychiatric service dog (SD), I get the opportunity to pay back to the community all that I have learned. As a mental health consumer, I value finding and sharing correct information about service dog law, and tips on dealing with the issues arising from use of a SD. Using my PSD has allowed me to heal from my PTSD to the extent that I have a fairly normal life, as long as I have my dog with me to mitigate my symptoms. The support and shared knowledge of this group is amazing!

I am able to stay in touch about applicable laws and practices, obtain training ideas if needed and refer the general public to the very informative web site for information. PSDP also works to reach out to people who might benefit from using a service dog to mitigate psychiatric disabilities by making public presentations.   I am interested in advocacy and PSDP keeps me in touch with current issues.

I do not have a psychiatric disability (merely physical), but I dedicate all my volunteer abilities to making sure this group has fantastically accurate and helpful resources that are available to all with a potential interest in psychiatric service dogs, or even just in service dog use in general. I so often hear stories of the very real impact PSDP has in people's lives that it's easy to stay motivated to keep this group helping more and more.

Agoraphobia kept me trapped inside my home for 4 years until I discovered how a Psychiatric Service Dog could help me. Training a Service Dog is not an easy task but with an organization like PSDP to provide education and support it can be much easier. PSDP has a very comprehensive website with information about everything related to service dogs. Articles such as Selecting a Service Dog Prospect, to info about the ADA laws, that protect our rights to have our dogs are all available on the website. There is also a listserv that is like an email support group for people who are partnered with Psychiatric Service Dogs. I have not come across another organization that offers so much information and assistance to people who are often taking their very first steps toward having a fuller life, by having a Service Dog by their side.

PETS Inc., The Carolinas Humane Society	165586		/users/profile/220087	joshy	General Member of the Public	5	08/20/2013	Pets Inc is absolutely amazing in the work they accomplish!  This organization has accepted dogs from me that other rescues left at my home.  These rescues left me with the vet bills, food bills, housing bills and the animal.  I reached out to Pets Inc after doing some research on them and asked them to help me find homes for these animals.  Jane Brundage did NOT hesitate, she took every animal I had and everyone single one of them found great homes through the efforts of Pets Inc.  This organization has reached out to county shelters in S.C. and took dogs that did not have a chance otherwise.  Pets Inc then provided the medical care all of them needed, housing, healthy food, and provided them with forever homes.  It just amazes me that people in S.C. and/or Columbia aren't knocking the doors down at Pets Inc to either volunteer, raise funding for them, donate to them, etc.  This is one organization in S.C. that shows the goodness that people are capable of against amazing odds.  I just hope they can continue the great work!

However they receive little or no financial assistance from the counties although the 3,000+ animals they rescue yearly come from county taxpayers.     To be more independent they opened a spay/neuter clinic, a dental clinic, instituted a Cheap Shots program , as well as a "Spay Now/Pay Later Program for low income pet owners.  They have an on-site pet-healthy and safe Pet Store with great quality pet food including alternative and  holistic choices.  Safe toys and quality  supplies at very reasonable prices.  It's obvious from your first visit there that the rescued pets are their main concern, and these people want adopters to leave with good advice and supplies for their new pet.   They are a 501(c)3 and have rescued and placed nearly 60,000 pets since they started in 1992, and with over 70,000 pets in the Columbia, SC area signed up in their "Ticket Home" program, they have been reuniting over 400 lost pets a year with their owners.

PETS Inc., The Carolinas Humane Society	80819	2	/users/profile/88231	assiral	Volunteer	5	03/01/2011	When our cat brought a 6 month old kitten to our house one day, we didn't know what to do. They seemed to be great friends...until the kitten entered our home and our cat started defending his territory. We got the kitten on Pets Inc's long waiting list but were lucky enough o find him a good home a couple of days later. Still, Pets Inc was nice enough to help the new family out with shots and getting him neutered. That's when I realized that this wonderful no-kill animal shelter was in need of help and I have been volunteering ever since. I'm more of a cat person, so I go and spend time with the cats and help keep them and their room clean. I also do the most rewarding volunteer experience - I foster kittens! I fostered 3 litters last year and I smile every time I think about them and the fact that they are now each in a loving permanent home.I encourage everyone to support Pets Inc in anyway they can - donate, volunteer, be a foster parent, purchase pet supplies form their store and go shopping at their Thrift store. This is a wonderful charity who makes a difference in our community!

Client Served	5	02/24/2011	My first experience with PETS Inc. was 7 years ago when my mom and I adopted a sweet little girl named Charm.  She was 6 when we adopted her and she'd not had an easy life.  But Charm was such a sweet girl and was there for our family whenever we needed to smile.  Sadly, she passed away in November, 2010.  When my husband and I were ready to bring another four legged child into our family, we both immediately thought of PETS, Inc.  We entered and were given a sponsored adoption of our newest baby, Badger.  Technically, Badger's not a baby as he's 14 years old but he's precious and I treasure his presence in our family.  PETS Inc. is an amazing place and provides a much needed 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) chance for pets who haven't found their forever homes yet.  They provide such a wonderful and caring environment to rehabilitate dogs and cats if needed.  They have a fantastic fostering system.  They're just an all around amazing place.  The main thing they're lacking is money.  They're a non-profit organization that depends on donations and, unfortunately with the economy, PETS Inc. has taken more of a hit and they're ability to help pets that have been thrown out or abandoned has decreased.  We, as a society and Columbia as a city, need MORE places like PETS Inc.  Until we get more, though, PETS Inc. is a beacon of hope for so many souls, not just animals but people, like my family, who wouldn't be complete without them.

The cats and kittens all seemed to be healthy and as happy as a shelter cat can be.  We adopted 2 kittens and one cat.  They had no problem adjusting to each other or to the 11 year-old Cocker Spaniel.  I liked how the volunteers and workers form a bond with all the animals--they know names.  Even months after adopting, when I'd return to buy food and toys, the staff knew my babies by name and asked how they were doing.   It's hard to visit and not bring home more babies!  I've dropped by and just asked to walk a dog--the staff is very welcoming and happy to let us help out, even if we have just a short time.

We found a room with quite a few cats ready for adoption.  They had many cat-friendly features in their room, including places where they could curl up or sit and look out a window.  Having only seen old horrid pet shelters before, I was really impressed with the effort to make the cats feel secure and happy.  While we were looking around a grown cat picked my husband as his special person.  We left that day with two cats--one for our daughter and one for Keith!  These special friends of ours have been part of our lives for all these years and we love and are loved by them dearly.  Since the day we found Cougar and Misty there, Pets Inc has greatly imiproved their facilities.  I remain impressed with the dedicaation of their workers and volunteers to the welfare of the animals and am a quiet but very strong supporter of their work.  Having ourselves provided  a home for many abandoned and abused dogs and cats over the years, I have seen the worst. Pets Inc is a wonderful place for animals to find themselves and a wonderful place for you to find a lifelong friend.
PETS Inc., The Carolinas Humane Society	74056	1	/users/profile/80922	petsincdogs	Client Served	5	02/23/2011	I've worked with Pets, Inc. for over a decade, fostering dogs who needed temporary homes, or extra care, while waiting for the perfect loving person or family to adopt them. This organization is serious about protecting the animals.  I've watched them work on a shoe-string budget to take in, house, feed, and nurse dogs and cats that others threw out, abused, kicked to the curb, or simply gave up with love because of change of circumstances. I've watched them take in animals tied to their gate posts overnight, brought to them from trash cans (I've fostered these), left at the front door with tears in anguish for having to give up their pets because of an abusive spouse (I've fostered these). They utilize volunteers, request supplies from their supporters, educate the public on the dangers of chemical-laden foods and toys, expand their services and facilities in spite of short funds, with the help of donations, sweat-equity, and, always, plenty of love. I've seen other animal organizations adopt a few pets retrieved from the local animal shetlers and spend most of their time raising funds for promises that haven't materialized in the 15 years that I've observed them, but Pets, Inc. has grown, expanded, worked hard and saved and adopted thousands of precious animals. My hat is off to them. We should all be so passionate about life. I thank them for my two dogs, the dogs of several of my clients who have since adopted from them, and the many I have had the priviledge to know and foster.  Every one was loving, kind, and worth saving.  I fully support Pets, Inc. and all animal organizations that follow their work ethic.

Now I see where they are going to bring in volunteers to help train the dogs and the volunteers will be learning skills as well. they are always coming up with creative and innovative ways to help their precious animals.  they require a deposit to ensure the animlas are spayed or neutered so we don't end up with more animals that need homes. we already have such a need in our community for homes. they educate the adopting families and screen them well so the animal is getting a good home.

A couple of years later, we rescued two feral kittens but were unable to find them homes ourselves. Pets Inc took them in and found both of them permanent homes.  We are truly grateful for the services that Pets Inc provided us in both cases.
PETS Inc., The Carolinas Humane Society	73326		/users/profile/80139	Dawn M.	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	I first heard of Pets Inc from my boyfriend who just happened to look up shelters in Columbia to look for a puppy not just for ourselves but to keep our other dog company as well. We went there and the staff was extremely friendly and although at first we went just to look we ended up finding an adorable puppy that I felll in love with. Not only is the staff helpful but they are knowledagble and have a genuine love for what they do. I continued to return there, driving the extra distance past all the regular pet stores to buy dog food , chewies, toy, everything from Pets.On a very personal note, on an unfortunate day our quickly grown puppy, normally stuck to the side of me or his other four legged friend, decided to run off and was hit by a car. I spent all day trying to deal with this and finally called Pets who took care of everything for me. The staff that night were wonderful and I'm so grateful to them for helping me. It soldified for me even more reason to support such a wonderful charity for everything they do.

PETS Inc., The Carolinas Humane Society	73272		/users/profile/80082	April B.	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I began volunteering at Pets Inc. when I worked for Bank of America through their volunteer program in which employees can take 2 hours out of their work week to volunteer their time and talents. I enjoyed getting to play with the dogs and giving them time outside of their pens for even a few minutes a day. The staff at Pets Inc. very nice and they always let me know if there was something specific I could do, and they helped me have an enjoyable volunteer experience.  I started a blanket drive at my building, which had 200+ people working there, to have them bring their unwanted blankets to donate to Pets Inc to keep the animals warm. I got a fantastic response and was able to take over many blankets, towels and warm items for the animals before the cooler weather arrived.  I no longer with with the bank, and am not able to take the time to go to Pets Inc during the week anymore, but I take over blankets and towels when I can, and I am always quick to tell friends and strangers alike about Pets Inc and what they are doing to save pets lives in our community.

They find homes for so many desperate animals.  I adopted my dog from them, and have gotten shots for my cat there, as well as purchased items and food from the store that supports the shelter activities.  They do a wonderful job.

PETS Inc., The Carolinas Humane Society	73214		/users/profile/80018	Robin H.	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I've never seen so many passionate, caring people working with pets. These animals are known by name, given love and affection, and one on one care as often as possible. I volunteered during December and was impressed with the standards of cleaning that were expected, and the high quality diet the pets were fed. I was so impressed, in fact, that I switched my pets to the food that they serve at Pets Inc and have seen vast improvements in my pets as a result. It's rare to find a rescue that gives their animals nutritious food that heals them from the inside out. When cleaning the cat room with an employee, I found that often, the cats were referred to by name, petted, and loved on. The employees knew each and every cat's name, temperament, and could give an idea of the type of home that would be ideal for that cat. While I was there, a couple of cats came in that were declawed from a home that they had been in a very long time. One of the cats, Tequila, was skittish and terrified, not adjusting well to shelter life. I was encouraged to spend some time holding her, loving on her, and helping her build her confidence back. Over and over, the staff made sure that pets who were thrown by their situation were given the love they needed to come out of their shells and find happy homes. The employees obviously love the animals through the poop, grime, and occasional pet-related scratch from an overly excited animal. I went in to volunteer on Christmas Eve, and was asked to make a run to the Pets Inc thrift store to pick up donated pet supplies. I cheerfully loaded my car and got the joy of playing Santa to the furry children I had come to know and love so well.  It was a wonderful experience to see how much of the donated materials make it directly to benefiting the animals. On the whole, I recommend volunteering at Pets Inc, donating money, or finding that perfect new furry member of the family from them.

All parents and bus drivers are served piping hot coffee and gourmet doughnuts as they drop off students at school. Students are treated to stilt walkers, face painting, African drummers and dancers, bubble machines, cheerleaders, uplifting music and so much more!  The main point is that the students are treated!  Burns Elementary is an impoverished and under performing school with attendance and tardiness concerns. This partnership with ECM has increased on time arrival for school on Wednesday...as well as increased car riders on Wednesday mornings!  Our students look forward to each Wednesday as they bound out of the cars and off of the buses. Many of our staff has stated that on Wednesday, behaviors are improved and office behavior referrals are decreased.Oh, Engaging Creative Minds also feeds the staff each and every Wednesday morning.  On Wednesday afternoons, Engaging Creative Minds arrives just before dismissal and makes certain that every student has a hug or high five and pack of smarties to finish off the day.Needless to say, Burns Elementary LOVES Engaging Creative Minds. We feel as if they should be called Engaging Creative Hearts and Minds!!!

My students have benefited from ECM by having the Charleston Stage Company come in the classroom and help students learn through acting tools.  They have also provided students the opportunity to go to the opera and see Porgy and Bess as well as allowing more arts integration into the curriculum by having students create mosaics with artist, Meryl Weber.  I have also had the pleasure of being a part of ECM's Summer STEAM Institute which enriches the lives of students from various backgrounds by keeping their minds stimulated and getting them excited about learning going into their next academic year.  The resources and experiences that ECM provides helps teachers (like myself) become better teachers. -Archie S. Temoney, Jr. 8th Grade S.C. History Teacher C.E.

To say that they enjoyed the show would be an understatement. My students were enthralled, and it was amazing to hear them talk about the performance in significant detail both among themselves and to adults. This experience has definitely piqued an interest in the arts for my students. The opportunity to expose my kids to new places and ideas is just priceless, and to have Porgy and Bess in my back pocket as a teaching tool will impact students for years to come. I simply do not have the words to express my gratitude to the good people at Engaging Creative Minds and Ravinia, as well as their cadre of volunteers and donors.

Engaging Creative Minds	289157	1	/users/profile/379380	LindaDennis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/09/2016	ECM - should also stand for encouraging creative minds!  As an artist for Engaging Creative Minds, I find that working with their coaches and the teachers, that I am able to help share and encourage learning using creativity in all forms of digital and print.  The outcomes vary from short movies, to dvd's with color prints, to printed newspapers and then portraits with a student modeling their dreams for the future and what it takes to get there!   Throughout the entire learning process, the students are encouraged to use their imagination and to create images in their minds and then to write!  In other projects, we help the students to become good observers and reporters, they then write and see their  works published.   Yes, the outcome shows academic success, but often I see other important elements such as the students finding their self within their work,  they gain self esteem and confidence.  And, just think using the creative process.  So when one thinks of the positive outcomes of a creative experience with ECM, I also suggest that we should look  at the  benefit to the whole student!

As a visual artist they helped me fine tune my goal and engage students in thought and consideration of the character and life choices of "heroes". I needed to better understand   how to present this material to young minds as well as how it related to core curriculum. The professionals at ECM have taught and encouraged me  as they opened school doors to experience sculpture. These experiences have ignited creative sparks in Tri- county students everywhere,  be it 3D design and construction, history or focused language arts. The programs from ECM are piquing curiosity and delighting students. I am forever thankful for the honor of working with ECM.

At last count, there were over 160,000 unwanted horses in the United States....currently, the number of registered Equine Rescue organizations, like L.E.A.R.N.,  only have the capacity to care for 33,000 horses annually. Since 2009, L.E.A.R.N. has rescued, rehabilitated and rehomed over 75 horses who otherwise would have gone to slaughter, horse auction, or simply perished alone from starvation or neglect.  Elizabeth Steed works tirelessly, with no monetary compensation whatsoever, for the benefit of the horses that come into L.E.A.R.N.'s care.  She is a fierce advocate for establishing minimum standards of care for large animals in the state of SC, of which there are currently none, and for educating her community about the day to day responsibilities that come with horse ownership.  L.E.A.R.N. is an all-volunteer organization.  We do our best, but often fail, when it comes to being as attentive to our supporters inquiries as we are to the horses we are caring for.  Days on the farm are long and phone calls unfortunately sometimes go unanswered.  We are so very thankful for all of the support we receive from the Charleston community!! Thank you so much for helping us to continue to help horses in need!

Near impossible to get a response,. Voicemail to group consistently full and any posts to their facebook site that hint at criticism is met with attack by supporters. They may provide good care for the animals, but seem more interested in providing a sanctuary they want the public to fund rather than find homes for the rescues. 
LEARN: Livestock & Equine Awareness & Rescue Network	158336		/users/profile/210063	coastal2013	General Member of the Public	4	05/20/2013	@SybM:  It's unfortunate that you base your opinion on ONE story and nothing else.  Your first exposure to this organization was in 2013, I'm assuming on May 18th?  Which means you have no idea what you're talking about.  If you had any knowledge whatsoever of LEARN, then you would know that any outcome other than a horse dying is what they are striving for.  Have you ever seen a starving, dehydrated horse?  Have you ever seen (or smelled) a chemically burned horse that had maggots eating at this wounds?  My guess is no.  It's unfortunate, but human beings are the one and only reason that there even has to be conversations like the one Elizabeth Steed had with the reporter.  I don't deer hunt, but I don't condemn those that do.  Why?  Because starvation and dehydration are painful, horrific deaths.  Please do your research before climbing on your bleeding heart soapbox to condemn someone you know nothing about.  You definitely heard what you wanted to hear in that interview.
LEARN: Livestock & Equine Awareness & Rescue Network	158198		/users/profile/209869	Syb M.	General Member of the Public	1	05/18/2013	I find it troublesome that the rescue's leader, Elizabeth, supports horse slaughter over euthanasia, as she states in this article.  http://www.nbcnews.com/id/51894332/ns/local_news-charleston_sc/t/horse-slaughterhouses-could-affect-south-carolina-equine/#.UZb8z7_ko5x    To quote Steed: "The chemical that we use to put these horses to sleep never goes away, it stays in ground water and is poisoning the ecosystem," Steed said. "people understand recycling and if they could look at this process as recycling these animals instead of 'slaughter'... and use the byproduct of them for something... it would benefit the ecosystem."" Horse slaughter is not a form of "recycling" and a 5013c non profit equine rescue should not be a proponent of horse slaughter.  Steed is also the head of the S. C. Horsemen's Association, which appears very similar to the pro-slaughter organization United Horsemen's Association, founded by Sue Wallis, one of the most vocal proponents for the return of horse slaughter to the U.S.  If anyone is unfamiliar with Wallis, just google her name.
LEARN: Livestock & Equine Awareness & Rescue Network	91316		/users/profile/104414	bclinville	Donor	5	06/18/2011	No story - just familiar with this great rescue group for horses. They are truly missioned, dedicated, hands on, follow thru, take excellent care of any rescue they can take in and truly deserve total support from the community as they need financial support to continue being there for the many neglect and abuse horse cases they work so hard to handle  and rescue.  . As Presdient, Founder of a 34 year animal shelter in Chas SC  (Pet Helpers) where all animals are kept until adoption - a private non profit adoption shelter, that,  as well  depends on community support, I know the hard work and dedication it takes to care for these animals.I urge total support of LEARN.

Donor	5	06/14/2011	HUG found out about LEARN through a Facebook request to our friends as to which nonprofit we should pull into our rotation for the end of the year 2011.  I have been amazed at all they have been able to accomplish so far on their own.  We are certainly looking forward to raising the visibility of this amazing non profit in the local Charleston SC area. 
LEARN: Livestock & Equine Awareness & Rescue Network	90523		/users/profile/103269	Happy	General Member of the Public	5	06/12/2011	I found out about L.E.A.R.N. and met Elizabeth through her sister (a dear friend and former co-worker) Due to my current, crazy, schedule, I have not been able to participate in any volunteer work. However, I was able to attend one fund-raising event and it was during this event, that Elizabeth took us on a tour of the L.E.A.R.N. facilities. It brought tears to my eyes, knowing that the gorgeous, healthy-looking, happy animals were once painfully thing, full of parasites, mistreated, confused and scared. Through proper feeding, care and an abundance of love and grace, Elizabeth and her crew of compassionate volunteers have returned these amazing, intuitive animals to a vibrancy in health that may rival any level of health they have ever experienced before. People neglect their livestock for a number of reasons: bad economy, the old attitude of "an animal is just an animal," I also understand that investors see that a racehorse has outlived their original investment and is no longer bringing great returns, but I simply cannot fathom letting an otherwise perfectly healthy creature deteriorate and *suffer* to the point of starvation or selling a horse that once worked SO HARD for you off to the meat market's highest bidder. L.E.A.R.N. takes on horses, restores them to health and attempts to find them suitable homes. So much money and time is (rightfully) invested in saving dogs, cats and other small animals at the local animal shelters. However, livestock is much harder to place in a good home! Finding an appropriate home for an 1,100 pound baby is quite a feat!    Secondly, it is impossible to mention L.E.A.R.N. without pointing out how L.E.A.R.N. and Elizabeth contribute to the young people in our community. Elizabeth has a veritable ARMY of young women, passionate about the love and care of horses, and I believe their lives are being greatly enriched by their involvement with L.E.A.R.N.  They are learning not only basic equestrian care and skills, but they are experiencing, first hand, kindness and care in one of it's largest capacities. This Nonprofit is most certainly worthy of any time or donations one can give. 
LEARN: Livestock & Equine Awareness & Rescue Network	90009		/users/profile/102562	ltisdale	Volunteer	5	06/08/2011	I wanted to speak out on Learn's behalf because the organization helps not only the animals but people also.  I've known about LEARN and Elizabeth since the 33 horses were put in LEARN's hand in 2009.  If there was no one else to help Elizabeth feed, she did it into the night.  She personally takes each and every horse and makes them her own- even if for a little while.  She is overjoyed for the ones that get new homes and cries for the ones who don't make it.LEARN as a group has helped me tremendously.  While I was out feeding or grooming the horses, I felt joy and peace but no stress.  I often think of those times and smile.

This equine rescue understands every aspect of what a rescue is and what their limitations are.Horses fortunate enough to be cared for by this rescue will have the highest standards of care possible. Ms. Steed, her Board, and volunteers do an excellent job and are the only rescue in South Carolina we fully endorse and work with.

She taught me how to ride when i was around 7 or 8. Ive been hooked ever since. I LOVE working with the horses, especially Chase, a 20 year old thouroughbred. she also taught me how to ride bareback and about coggins and colic and everything like that. Ive had LOTS of expiriences with the horses, both good and bad. A good expirience was when I finally got to ride Chase. A bad expirience was when my friends and I forgot the close the feed room door....But everything turned out ok. I would not know what to do if LEARN wasnt here anymore. Its my favorite place to be.

LEARN: Livestock & Equine Awareness & Rescue Network	89919		/users/profile/102440	baypoa	Volunteer	5	06/08/2011	I have known Elizabeth Steed for most of my life. I can remember growing up and spending time at her house while I helped take care of the horses. She always had a new horse at her house that she was rehabilitating. When she was asked to help rehabilitate 33 horses in 2009 she started L.E.A.R.N, not only to take care of horses in need, but also to educate people about horse care. She has made a big impact in the horse community by rehabilitating many horses and finding them new homes with the promise that if something happens and the horse cannot be kept it must return to L.E.A.R.N so that no harm can come to that horse again. I have also seen her reach out to the youth, in order to educate them about horses and their care. 
LEARN: Livestock & Equine Awareness & Rescue Network	89915		/users/profile/102443	Ellen H.	Donor	5	06/08/2011	Lots of bang for your buck with this horse rescue.

They make every dollar stretch to rehabilitate and give these animals a second chance.

She and I formed a fast friendship and I throughly enjoyed working for and with her.  When the opportunity to work with her again, through her organization,  L.E.A.R.N., came to me in December 2010, I jumped at the chance!  I have personally witnessed the positive impact L.E.A.R.N. is making in the equine community in the Low Country of SC, and beyond.  The need for organizations like L.E.A.R.N. is huge....the numbers of abused and abandoned horses is ever-growing and more and more people are finding it impossible to properly care for their horses in these tough economic times.  Horses that otherwise would have continued to suffer, find a refuge at L.E.A.R.N.  and have the opportunity to heal and prosper and find a new loving home...I can't imagine a better outcome!  Volunteering for L.E.A.R.N. is a bright, positive, rewarding part of my everyday life.  I'm proud to be a member of this organization.

International Primate Protection League	316193		/users/profile/407457	gs20003	Board Member	5	10/28/2016	IPPL does amazing work for primates all around the world, and with such a small and dedicated staff!!! Dr. Shirley McGreal is amazing resource, herself -- a wealth of information on the dark history and present-day workings  of the international primate trade -- and IPPL has documented this history in its many publications over the years.  
International Primate Protection League	315974		/users/profile/407250	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2016	I have supported IPPL for so many years, I can't even remember where I first heard about them!Over the years I've read all of IPPL's news publications including both heart-breaking stories of the abuse of primates and inspiring reports of how IPPL funding has enabled numerous organisations to rescue, rehabilitate, repatriate, care for primates as well as raise awareness and educate about primates. Shirley McGreal is an amazing lady whom I was honoured to get the opportunity to meet a few years ago and as a result, decided to attend my first IPPL biannual supporters meeting in 2014, and again in 2016, having been invited to give a presentation about the trip to Rwanda to trek to see the mountain gorillas that my partner and I had taken the previous year. It was wonderful to attend the meeting again and share our experience with everyone at the meeting and most of all to get the chance to visit the beautiful gibbons at the sanctuary again.Without Shirley and IPPL, I don't know how many of these gibbons would still be suffering or even alive, but with the fantastic care provided by IPPL's Animal Care Givers, at least these now have the sanctuary to live out the rest of their lives in peace after the torment they have suffered previously. Yes, they shouldn't be in captivity at all but it is only down to human cruelty, greed, and ignorance that they were treated in such ways and are here today, rescued from continued abuse or death. I wish the world were different but as long as we have to fight this abuse, I thank Shirley and the IPPL, and others like them, for being there and doing all that they do! Thankyou IPPL!!
International Primate Protection League	315970		/users/profile/407246	Carl23	Volunteer	5	10/28/2016	The world would be such a much better place if there were more places like IPPL. The love and caring that they give for the Gibbons and other primates all around the world is unprecedented, check them out. I have personally had the privilege to visit  and volunteer at IPPL's headquarters in Summerville South Carolina and meet many of the 35+ Gibbons that they have.  It's unbelievable.  The cleanup after hurricane Matthew has been a tremendous undertaking. Please consider them and give any  support that you can.
International Primate Protection League	315621		/users/profile/406932	jciop	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	IPPL has been open to partnering with the College of Charleston's Honors College students for many years.  I have been there several times with students and am always overwhelmed by the love, care and support given there for the gibbons.  Dr. McGreal has  devoted her life's work to giving the gibbons who were rescued from zoos and research labs, often sick, an ideal place to live out their remaining years.   They are kept in beautiful, large enclosures with runs throughout the property so they have lots of room to exercise and explore.  They receive the best food a gibbon can eat and receive wonderful health care.  We love volunteering at the IPPL because everything about it is of the highest caliber.  Dr. McGreal deserves her MBE.
International Primate Protection League	315570		/users/profile/406885	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	IPPL anad all their staff work diligently to not only care for the nearly 40 rescued gibbons at the sanctuary, but also to advocate for non human primates all over the world.  I have learned so much about the  need for primate protection and habitat protection as well as how primates are trafficked or exploited.  Shirley and her team are lifelong advocates for these little gibbons and I love visiting them.
International Primate Protection League	315498		/users/profile/406818	RobinHuffman	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	For years as I was volunteering around the US and Africa at primate sanctuaries, and talking to people in the animal protection world, trying to learn more about HOW to protect them....when I had questions, everyone said "Contact Shirley McGreal."  When I was AT sanctuaries, they talked about what a hero Shirley and IPPL were, and how they saved the day at critical times.   At one place, I painted the signs on a building that had been financed by IPPL after a tragic fire destroyed the previous one.   Then I decided one time I had better go meet this hero Shirley and see IPPL in person.  So I went, and have been in close contact ever since.  Shirley is an unparalleled  wealth of information, and shares it generously and enthusiastically.  Her efforts have been responsible for saving the lives of tens of thousands of primates.  She and her staff are dedicated - 7 days a week, running a very fine sanctuary for dozens of rare gibbons - and spending every single day advocating for all primates around the world.  I volunteered there for a short time.  The staff, volunteers and supporters are terrific, and I saw impressive work ethic, commitment and best practices from the staff especially.  They are hospitable and generous as well.   I observed local community neighbors complimenting IPPL on their facility and even how much they ENJOYED being near the sanctuary and hearing the lovely songs of the gibbons.I saw Shirley and team at the national Animal Rights conference, educating attendees about gibbons and all the sanctuaries that need helping.  I am not sure that there is any other sanctuary which also has such a successful outreach supporting so many other sanctuaries around the world as well as individuals who are on the front lines of fighting for primates.Shirley and IPPL hold a bi-annual conference, which takes a lot of organizing and commitment, but is vital and wonderful in its knowledge-sharing and cross-pollinating of people, practices and ideas.  They were kind enough to include me in this year's event as a speaker on behalf of one of the sanctuaries in Africa they support.  Bravo for IPPL and for Shirley McGreal!!
International Primate Protection League	315481		/users/profile/406801	Donna271	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2016	I was hired by IPPL to care for  a baby Gibbon  (Courtney) when she was only a month old and very fragile. As a former Pediatric RN, I can attest to the excellent care she was given. No expense was spared in order to provide for this sweet baby. I worked there for almost 4 years and was able to  closely observe the entire operation of the sanctuary and the IPPL organization.  I highly recommend IPPL as a great nonprofit. If you love animals, this organization is very deserving of your support.
International Primate Protection League	315360		/users/profile/406685	jsiminski	Donor	5	10/27/2016	I have been a supporter of IPPL for many years now and have tremendous respect for the work Dr. Shirley McGreal and her devoted staff do on behalf of Gibbons. Many of these gibbons suffered physically and emotionally have been subjected to all sorts of laboratory tests in the U.S.  Dr. McGreal has also worked tirelessly to stop of the trafficking of wild gibbons and other primates.  IPPL  also holds annual conferences to help educate people about the role gibbons play in our world and the importance of preserving and protecting them.  They are simply an outstanding organization. 
International Primate Protection League	315335		/users/profile/406661	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2016	Recently I wrote a book about gibbons (Gibbons: the Invisible Apes), and this nonprofit organization figured prominently in the chapters relating to how we can save the different endangered species of these little apes.  They do fantastic work that is recognized worldwide.  The IPPL is one of the most positive forces in making people aware of gibbons (almost every wildlife organization ignores them), and in rescuing individual gibbons.

The IPPL team provides top notch care to gibbons in need of rescue while also doing an excellent job of outreach and education to further the cause on a more global scale. I have seen the facilities and seen how the funding goes to work, and it is clear that the staff cares too much about the mission to let any money go to waste. The group also does a great job with social media and press to help show the work they are doing and that makes a donor feel great. I can't say enough good things about IPPL and I encourage you to take a closer look.
International Primate Protection League	315293		/users/profile/406619	caoneil	Donor	5	10/27/2016	I have been a contributor to the IPPL for 20 years.   It is run by founder Shirley McGreal who has an ardent love of gibbons and dedicated her life to establishing a unique sanctuary for just gibbons.    It is a wonderful place where each gibbon has a well-cared-for life.     But her sanctuary is not her only goal....Shirley is busy full-time looking at all primate issues worldwide: supporting many sanctuaries in the Far East and Africa via direct contribution solicitations and by exposing atrocities in illegal trade and smuggling, asking  all IPPL supporters to be earnest letter writers and petition signers.   The sanctuary is always in need of money for keep-up of established buildings housing the gibbons, and for new buildings so that more gibbons can be accepted.    Hurricanes can take a huge toll, like recent Matthew.    And of course, veterinary care is expensive.     The sanctuary is not a zoo.     People may visit at times with specific permission.      
International Primate Protection League	159510		/users/profile/195272	Michael153	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/05/2013	I have worked with the Dr. Shirley McGreal, founder, and the excellent staff of the International Primate Protection League for over two decades.  They are the most effective organization in the entire animal protection movement for dealing with the international trade in non-human primates, whether they are sold to zoos, labs, or into private ownership.  From insuring the prosecution of illegal dealers, to funding sanctuaries around the world, to educating the entire world about the abuse of primates -- the International Primate Protection League has no equal.  They are THE source for useful information on the international trade in primates.  In addition to their other monumental tasks they also operate a sanctuary for gibbons that provides the absolute best care for several dozen of these gentle apes.  I never miss an opportunity to visit the sanctuary because it reminds me of what I am fighting for in my own work for animals.  In short, I cannot recommend this organization more highly.  Happy 40th Anniversary IPPL!
International Primate Protection League	159509		/users/profile/193451	Karen01	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/05/2013	I have been acquainted with IPPL now for over twenty years and respect their diligence, work, and philanthropy to other groups working for the same goal - to save the primates of the world.  If we need to know who to contact, find out about a specific primate species, or about the primate scene globally, Shirley McGreal, their director,  is the first person that we contact as she will have an answer.  IPPL truly lives up to their name "primate protection."  Besides being a champion for the primates of the world, IPPL also operates a top-notch gibbon sanctuary.

International Primate Protection League	147307		/users/profile/194616	AlfiaW	Donor	5	12/27/2012	My grandmother lived with and wrote books about primates.  She first introduced me to the IPPL over 20 years ago when she was a donor.  I have been a donor for many years and am consistently impressed with the work IPPL does on behalf of abused primates both in the U.S. and abroad.  Its magazine not only tells about work in the field, it provides explicit opportunities to effect change including detailed descriptions of what can be changed and the names and addresses of those to be contacted about the issue.  Sometimes it even includes pre-addressed post cards!  I have learned so much about primates around the world thanks to IPPL. One day I hope to visit the sanctuary in SC and to attend one of their conferences. Shirley McGreal and her staff personally sign holiday cards and thank you cards which is very nice touch too. 
International Primate Protection League	99319		/users/profile/118946	raustin58	Volunteer	5	10/14/2011	I've been a volunteer at IPPL for over ten years. During this time I've witnessed first hand the effectiveness of this organization with regards to primate protection. The founder, Dr. Shirley McGreal, has set the tone of this grassroots organization with her commitment to helping small groups working on the front line who often are neglected by larger foundations and groups. With assistance from IPPL, these volunteers and small groups make a huge difference in the plight of primates worldwide.  In addition to the amazing work on behalf of the worlds primates, IPPL runs a gibbon sanctuary in Summerville, SC that provides a wonderful home to more than 30 of these small apes. Many are retired from laboratories, while others are former pets or zoo castoffs.  IPPL provides a wonderful "retirement" for these delightful apes.
International Primate Protection League	99048		/users/profile/118430	Helen Thirlway	Board Member	5	10/06/2011	IPPL is an immensely effective organisation. Its achievements over more than thirty years speak for themselves. With a very small team, IPPL has helped to secure primate export bans in several countries, ensured the successful prosecution of a number of illegal wildlife traffickers, and saved thousands of primate lives through its campaigning, fundraising and law enforcement efforts. These accomplishments have been recognised by many prestigious awards given to the organisation - and to its founder - Dr Shirley McGreal.
Water Missions International	155368		/users/profile/106238	burtandmd	Volunteer	5	04/19/2013	Water Missions is an outstanding charity that grew out of an engineering background. The group has developed portable water treatment plant that can provide filtered and chlorinated water at a rate of 10 gallons per minute. The water is crystal clear and the Cl residue is less than one part per million, enough to kill any bacteria in any container that a villager may bring to fetch water. For very remote villages the system pump can be powered by solar panels and thus does not require access to AC power. The water treatment plants are assembled by volunteers in Charleston, SC and are shipped to over 26 countries around the world where people do not have access to clean drinking water. Over 300 local volunteers assist in the assembly of the systems in Charleston. In addition to individual donors, WMI has a number of corporate donors that are generous with both cash and gifts in kind. Solar World supplies solar panels at a reduced cost and donated enough solar panels to operate the Charleston office and mfg. facility  on solar power. FedEx helps with shipping, Grundfus, a Dutch pump company, has donated large sums of funds and equipment. WMI is now working as a beta test site with Grundfus to develop a "water meter" that will allow a villager to buy water at a "filling station" using his cell phone and the funds be deposited in the village bank account in Denmark. In addition to providing safe water, WMI also teaches Health and Hygiene in the communities. This information is used to show the villagers the connection between safe water and good hygiene practices. A new program focused on Community Development has just been launched to help the villages have a clearer understanding of the need to save some funds from the sale of water to maintain and improve the system as the village grows and the equipment ages. Most components of the systems are designed for a 20 year service life. Along with the safe water, WMI tries to bring the Living Water message of Jesus to the communities served. However, the water is not just provided to peoples willing to listen to the Living Water message. Water system have been installed in Indonesia and other non christian countries. This is our 5 trip with WMI, We have spent 3 months in Milawi, Indonesia twice, Peru and Honduras/Mexico. We appreciate your support!!!! 
Water Missions International	92577		/users/profile/106238	burtandmd	Volunteer	5	06/28/2011	 Many  years ago, my wife and I had seen pictures of guinea worms boring through to the outside of a child's skin, and we never forgot that picture. After retiring, we were seeking volunteer work to contribute in some way to help relieve the water crisis in developing countries. I am a mechanical engineer, and my wife is an educator, so we knew that we had a good skill mix for the work.  In an effort to explore possibilities for us, we looked for opportunities on the web and contacted several organizations but were ignored. A friend mentioned Water Missions International ( WMI) and after one email, we got a prompt response from the head of engineering who asked us to visit the facility in Charleston, SC, and we have never looked back.  The most impressive part of our first visit to WMI was watching VOLUNTEERS assemble water treatment units (Living Water Treatment System - LWTS).  We learned that WMI has over 300 volunteers who do most of the work in all facets of the organization and that treatment systems have been installed in 40+ countries which is huge work to be accomplished by a relatively small administrative staff. We also learned that the founders of WMI had a lucrative engineering business they sold in order to clean nasty water in developing countries. We were stunned to know that WMI is totally funded by donations and continues to grow which speaks to the effectiveness any non-profit. That combination of information and the fact that WMI is a Christian organization commanded our respect for WMI. We were also impressed that  WMI provides safe water to all people regardless of religion, race, culture or gender.  There are two target areas of work at WMI. Disaster sites anywhere in the world are promptly provided water treatment systems to give people immediate relief from a contaminated water supply. When possible, those same LWTS units are later used for communities in conjunction with sustainable community development projects. The second focus is sustainable community development projects where safe water was the initial impetus for WMI involvement.  As time goes on, we continue to be impressed by WMI with the efficiency of organization, project implementation and financial responsibility that is crucial to effective philanthropy.  In working with Water Missions, we are reminded of the cleche, "Never was so much done with so little." Our assessment of WMI is not from the outside looking in. We have  have volunteered for months at a time in Indonesia two times and in Malawi, Africa. ( Please view our book at blurb.com; Search Burton Northam.) We get administrative, technical and moral support from WMI when on assignment. Other than disaster response safe water systems,  sustainable community development projects are a major focus of WMI. As in all successful community development projects, the local people must be committed and involved. Communities, after an assessment based on requirements necessary to have a viable safe water system, are required to organize a Safe Water Committee which ultimately maintains the project after WMI turns the project over to the community at a commissioning service. Based on current research confirming that sustainability requires ongoing funding, a micro-enterprise system that raises funds by charging a small fee for the treated water is also being implemented by WMI. These funds are used to buy consumables, pay a system operator and eventually build another system for a nearby community. The WMI WASH (Water, Sanitation, Hygiene) program is a vital part of community health training because research shows that providing safe water alone does not improve the sickness/death rate of people if they do not have good sanitation and hygiene practices. The Trainer of Trainers Model is one of the approaches used to equip volunteers in the community to be able to train others, ultimately teaching everyone receiving safe water.   A few paragraphs is totally inadequate space to even begin to explain the numbers of lives (especially children under five years) that have been saved through the work of Water Missions International. We are privileged to be involved with an organization that has such a sincere, deep (and yes, loving) commitment to making a difference in one of the greatest crises the people on this earth are facing, and we appreciate the opportunity to share the work of Water Missions with you.  
Water Missions International	122663		/users/profile/167079	Nancy62	Donor	5	09/20/2012	My son is a volunteer with WMI and had taken a trip to Uganda to document the installation of a water treatment system that was installed in one of the villages there.  I have, since his trip, been able to visit WMI twice and see and hear about all they're doing to help those who need clean drinking water and I've been impressed with their professionalism, their friendliness, their commitment to the call to help others, their faith in God to provide more means and more helpers to continue reaching out to more people, some whose very lives depend upon clean water. 
Water Missions International	122658		/users/profile/167073	Leah13	Donor	5	09/20/2012	I had the opportunity to tour the WMI Facility in Charleston this year.  It was a breath of fresh air.  Not only as a donor, but as an employee of a nonprofit myself, I am encouraged by the passion and integrity this organization instills in its staff.  It was also a pleasure to see exactly what the process of building a water treatment system is like and to see the flag of each country that has been blessed with WMI's presence.  That is truly what Water Missions International is - a blessing.  This is an organization that I will gladly and confidently donate to for many years to come.
Water Missions International	122628		/users/profile/167026	Kyle W.	Volunteer	5	09/20/2012	Water Missions International strives to change the world, one person at a time.  The task at hand is massive and daunting, but with determination and passion, they take on the challenge, and in my opinion, they're winning!  It's not everyday that you have the opportunity to be a part of changing somebody's life, forever!  But, they make that available to volunteers and employees, alike!  All of the water purification systems are built by the hands of people who care. Each system has a plan and purpose. So, when volunteering, it's not simply a "feel good" experience, it's a feeling of knowing that you matter, because you are in the position to let someone else know that THEY matter.  The people that Water Missions is serving are deserving of a chance at life, but often don't get that chance, because of sickness and disease, caused by dirty water. Once WMI steps on the scene, there's a sense of hope for those people. Hope for life. Life, which is so frail, has just gotten a little bit better and the future is brighter.  That all starts at WMI headquarters. From start to finish, the WMI staff and volunteers work hard, strive hard and love selflessly as they impact the world. It's one thing to drop in, give someone a bottle of water, and leave. It's another thing to move in, live amongst the people, see their pain, experience their joy...and let ALL of that motivate you to do EVERYTHING you can to ensure their chances at living. That is what Water Missions does.
Water Missions International	122627	1	/users/profile/167023	Jenny26	Donor	5	09/20/2012	This is the best organization that you can donate to. My family know the owners personally and they are the finest, most upstanding, Christian people that I know. The work that they have done is amazing to me. Please do not think that they only help people in poverished countries. They help wherever there is a problem with the water. That includes the US after Katrina. Please put them on your donation list EVERY year. Your money is well spent and brings LIFE to people who desperately need it.
Water Missions International	93218		/users/profile/107024	Andrew F.	Volunteer	5	06/30/2011	For the past five years I have participated and volunteered for the Water Missions International's annual Walk for Water.  the Walk for Water symbolizes what nearly one billion people, mostly women and chldren have to do everyday, just to get water to drink.  Plus, it is not even clean water.  It is truly a walk with a message.  Water Missions builds and distributes water treatment system throughout the world , helping to stop the spread of disease, improve the living conditions of those receiving clean water and to improve the economic conditions of the communities where the treatment systems are installed.  And as a faith-based organization, Water Misssions also ministers to the spiritual needs of the people being served.  Water misssions has a small but dedicated staff, they are excellent stewards of the donated funds and have a well developed mission and vision for their organization.  I have received much more from my involvement with Water Missions than I though possible.  Knowing that my efforts helps to made a difference to people around the world, meeting one of the basic necessities of life, has been a humbling but joyful experince.   May God bless the work and efforts of Water Missions International.
Water Missions International	92904		/users/profile/106649	waterpudel	Volunteer	5	06/29/2011	I have been a volunteer with Water Missions International for ten years.  During this time I have work on just about every aspect of building the units.  I have traveled to seven different countries to install and teach village members how to operate and care for the units.  The most rewarding thing for me is when the LWTS starts making clean, clear Living Water and village people understand that it is a gift from God. To see them hold a glass of clear water up to the sky and give The Father the Glory.It is a great reward for me to work every week with men and women that are strong christians and be in that type of atmosphere.  
Water Missions International	92395		/users/profile/106012	rachel8313	Volunteer	5	06/27/2011	I helped assemble components of water filters. These water filters get shipped around the world to places that need clean water, and they also educate the people in those communities about why clean water is important and other health related items.
Water Missions International	92311		/users/profile/105908	Sunland Volunteer	Volunteer	5	06/27/2011	This charity is essential to providing clean water in places that would Never be able to provide it for themselves.  The impact is has directly on the community is amazing.  They also spread the good word of Christ and all that he provides for us.  I will not hesistate to take the time to support and go back to Charleston, SC to assist in any manner that i can volunteer.  The inidividuals running the organization are simply "First Class" and have their charity at heart in All they Do.  A wonderful example for us all.
Water Missions International	92155	1	/users/profile/105612	TMD Architects	Donor	5	06/26/2011	TMD Architects is a proud supporter of Water Missions International. In addition to our financial support we have enjoyed the opportunity to volunteer on a weekly basis in the production area and be a part of the annual Walk for Water.  We have been drawn to the organize becuase of its mission, passion and strong founding. We are honored to serve the nations of the world through the work done at WMI. 
Water Missions International	92052		/users/profile/105468	Johnathan E.	Volunteer	4	06/25/2011	I first was introduced to WMI at my church. We raised enough money to have to purification machines placed in Africa. I was really impressed with the organization and the passion they have for helping others around the world. I saw in a pamplet that you could donate your time to them by helping assemble the machines. Since I was low on funds I decided that would be my way to help WMI help others. So I raised money for the Walk for Water and also attended orientation and became volunteer at the warehouse to help assembly. Just meeting all the people who are apart of WMI let's you know that this organization is here to simply spread the message of Jesus Christ and to helps millions around the world who are less fortunate than we are here in America.  WMI makes a huge impact on my life, the lives of others, and the world!
Water Missions International	91981		/users/profile/105372	courtney	General Member of the Public	5	06/24/2011	Water Missions International is the NP that all others should strive to be. They are dedicated to humanity and their goal of providing water to everyone and anyone who needs it. They hold true to their original goal of  shedding God's love on others by sharing His word and providing water but they don't discriminate if those in need don't believe in Him. They are truly amazing people who make up a truly amazing organization.   
Water Missions International	91926		/users/profile/105311	Mr Cavalier	Volunteer	5	06/24/2011	My experience with Water Missions International has far exceeded my expectations of the capabilities of a non-profit organization.  After spending time serving at other local non-profits, I had come to expect slow production, regular hiccups, and, despite the best intentions, an inconsistent product.  Hoewever,  volunteering weekly on the production floor at Water Missions has renewed my faith in the capabilities of the nonprofit sector.  At Water Missions, we produce complex water treatment systems for delivery to some of the most remote areas around the world.  The finished product demands precision, quality, and durability, as the availability of replacement parts and repair services after delivery is severely limited.  Something as simple as a 5 foot section of PVC pipe can be difficult to obtain in a place like rural Uganda.  At Water Missions, this challenge has been met by tight controls and ingenuity on the production line, which enables volunteers of any skill level to contribute to the final product.  Detailed step-by-step instructions accompany every workstation, and hands-on instruction is readily available for the more complicated procedures.  As a testament to their stewardship values, Water Missions has continually elected to conserve donor funds by empowering volunteers to do jobs ordinarily reserved for paid professionals.  
Water Missions International	91904	1	/users/profile/105282	Philip D.	Volunteer	5	06/23/2011	What a fantastic company!  I have been helping as a volunteer this year building the modules that create these water treatment systems as well as helping build the final systems.  While there is a small permanent paid staff overseeing the development of these systems, most of the actual system construction is performed by volunteers.  This allows most of the donations to be used to purchase quality materials. and ship the completed units to more than 40 countries over the past 10 years.  During the first quarter of this year we built at least 100 units and are approaching as many this quarter.  Most of us volunteer one day a week and with pride we build and test units that will be sent to parts of the world where the clean, clear water that we take for granted is unknown.  As a profesional engineer I find great satisfaction in helping construct these units and marvel at the compact design that has been developed to provide clean, clear, clorinated water with a minimum of maintenance necessary to keep them operational for years.  Weekly I look forward to my day at Water Missions and working with other volunteers who are as committed as I am to helping the Greene's realize their vision of providing treated water to those who need it.  I give thanks that I am able to participate in this endeavor!
Water Missions International	91886	1	/users/profile/105258	Martha I.	Volunteer	5	06/23/2011	My husband, daughter, and I assembled alum kits while we were on vacation in Charleston, SC in June 2011. First we had a tour which included history and scope of the organization as well as an interesting explanation of the water purification units and the latrine systems. Then we joined the other volunteers for a status report of recent, ongoing, and upcoming projects which was followed by a humbling and touching time of prayer.  We were absolutely amazed at the marvelous work being accomplished by Water Missions International and are grateful we could help!
Water Missions International	84775	1	/users/profile/94149	Linda Layman	Donor	1	04/04/2011	I donated to this charity believing that access to clean water is fundamental for improving living conditions and health.   I have been contacted twice since donating.  The first time a letter thanked me for my donation and included and envelope to allow me to give them more money.  I used the enclosed envelope to send a letter indicating that I was offended to be asked for more money.    My significant donation should have been acknowledged, period. Today I received a copy of the annual report and another letter.  This was addressed to Mr. and Mrs......   This is additionally offensive as I am not married and donated as a single person.   The entire range of communications from this organization have made me very suspicious of their qualifications, organization and motives. I will never donate to Water Missions International again! 
Megiddo Dream Station	232527		/users/profile/296066	billbrum67	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2014	What a concept!  Teach people the life skills they need to get and hold down a job.  Who would have ever thought that such a task could be accomplished so well by volunteers and only one paid staff member!!  It's just amazing to see folks who you'd expect to be visiting those charities that help down-and-outers to devote themselves to classes where they learn how to actually support themselves and their families.  And all this with no Government support!  WOW!
Megiddo Dream Station	231485	1	/users/profile/295074	Donna190	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	As a volunteer instructor, I am amazed at the lives that have been changed through Megiddo Dream Station.  Most start out discouraged with where they are in life, but over the course of 8 weeks are transformed with hope and a sense of purpose.  The confidence they gain is apparent as they move from the classroom, to job interviews, and then into gainful employment.  Our students are motivated and encourage each other.  While at Megiddo, they are taught not only job skills, but life skills.  They learn to give back through community service.  For those who have children, Megiddo offers free childcare and tutoring.  I am honored and count it a privilege to be involved with Megiddo Dream Station.
Megiddo Dream Station	231475	1	/users/profile/295065	mowguy98	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	Megiddo is a perfect example of 'don't give a man a fish, teach him how to fish.'  So thankful for the ministry of Megiddo and all it's workers.  Communities everywhere could use this as a model!
Megiddo Dream Station	231440	1	/users/profile/295029	Kyle P.	Board Member	5	10/31/2014	As a pastor, I am so thankful for the positive influence of Megiddo Dream Station in our community! This faith-based ministry doesn't just talk about making a difference - they are making a difference. In a relatively short time, over 100 people who were unemployed are underemployed have found work! And, their employers rave about their Megiddo graduate employees.    At our church, we have Megiddo students & Megiddo volunteers & leaders. I see, first hand, the positive difference this organization is making in all who connect with them. I'm so thankful for the blessing called "Megiddo Dream Station!" Pastor Kyle PooleMidland Valley Community Church

Megiddo Dream Station	231415	1	/users/profile/295008	Steve134	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	Megiddo does an outstanding job of helping chronically-unemployed persons gain the skills, confidence and introductions needed to get off of government subsistence and onto a payroll.  It was my honor to work with them as a volunteer teaching a weekly session in their eight week program and to see, first hand, how well the organization serves the community and those needing work.  Five stars AND two thumbs up!

I have seen people go through Megiddo and be able to get a job, from interviewing for a job, to acquiring skills to obtain and stick with a job.  Many other skills are taught there.  It's a wonderful thing to have.

Megiddo Dream Station	212042	1	/users/profile/274991	Cindymeares	Volunteer	5	08/23/2014	I have been involved with the Dream Station since the beginning as a Board member and a volunteer.   The organization is run primarily by volunteers who believe in what they are doing.  The classes help folks move towards finding a job but perhaps the best thing is that they know people care about them and their future.  Folks are able to have pride in themselves as they can support their family. 
Megiddo Dream Station	210513	1	/users/profile/273281	GregoryT	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	Such a great organization that has realized that people want a hand-up, not a hand-out. The detailed programs, rigorous curriculum and caring instructors create an incredibly impactful environment. I've had the opportunity to volunteer there myself and every time, come away more and more impressed with the great things that Megiddo Dream Station is accomplishing.
Megiddo Dream Station	196874	1	/users/profile/257344	BrendaJenkins8989	General Member of the Public	5	04/01/2014	I drive by Megiddo every day.  In the beginning there were a few cars two or three days a week.  I wonder what was going on and finally stopped in.  Students were on porch talking and I just chatted with them.  They all talked about how much they'd learned and how wonderful the teachers are.
Megiddo Dream Station	195227	1	/users/profile/255174	Lisa334	Client Served	5	03/05/2014	I went into the Dream Station with my son, hoping they could help him find a job.  He has a record and has gotten very discouraged with his job hunting.The director Kay stopped what she was doing and sat down and talked with him.  She listened to his story, heard his anxiety and began to speak encouragement and life into him.  I've never been part of anything that made me so aware of the presence of God.  She made it clear she couldn't promise him a job but that she could offer him the training he needed to be successful.  But when we left I saw a peace on him that he hasn't had in months.  Before going to bed he came to me and apologized for the decisions he's made and said he knew that he could be successful if he went to the Dream Station.  He had hope for the first time in a very long time.  I'm excited about his future and thank this program for restoring his hope. 
Megiddo Dream Station	194741	1	/users/profile/254501	rlangley	Client Served	5	02/23/2014	Megiddo helped me to get my life on track.  I had been out of work for 3 years and after going through their program, I got a job in 3 weeks.  Great Director and teachers.
Megiddo Dream Station	136904	2	/users/profile/182853	DJMater	Client Served	5	11/10/2012	Megiddo Dream Station has the best staff and volunteers ever.  They are sincere and passionate about their work.  They set the bar high for the people getting help and they don't accept excuses.  They believe God made us for something good and they don't want us to waste any more time doing nothing.  I would recommend the Station to anyone who genuinely wants to get a job and improve their life.  Not for the lazy or the moochers.

Miss Volunteer Service International, Inc.	304297		/users/profile/395464	nancy2016	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2016	I am very proud to recognize this program as an outstanding opportunity for young woman to build confidence in themselves and their abilities to succeed in whatever goals they have set for themselves.  They also can learn the importance of helping others (their neighbors in their own communities or the world wide community) to succeed in whatever way they can.  Two of my granddaughters are participating in this program and have already made a great difference , one by providing help for other young women to go to school in Uganda , the other by providing chickens to a group who can now help sustain both a means to provide  food and a way to profit from selling the chickens to help their community.  This is a wonderful opportunity for other young women to learn and  be of service to their community while helping themselves to expand their own opportunities in life.

The work I have seen them get done in just a month or so has been terrific. The kids are really engaged and their Facebook page shows new service being done constantly. I wish them all the success for the future.

Miss Volunteer Service International, Inc.	303884		/users/profile/395043	HBruemmer	Board Member	5	09/13/2016	I'm really proud of this program. I am a co-founder and board member. Two of my girls participate as non-competitive ambassadors so I can see the benefits first hand. Our nonprofit was started to provide unique and personalized service opportunities to young people and I think we have far exceeded the expectations of our participants and parents so far. As a mom of six myself, I really feel that community service is a key way to teach children about citizenship and a whole host of other issues. We are only a month old but we are very committed to building this program and at the moment it is run 100% by volunteers.          We call ourselves a competition, not a pageant, but we share elements with pageants, like our crowns and queen branding, to help the girls get attention for their missions. We are a great venue for girls interested in pageants to build confidence, publis speaking skills, and a portfolio for a pageant platform. For kids who would never do a pageant - no worries. We will evaluate you (and want you to learn to evaluate yourself) based on hard work, competence, and commitment. You can learn more about us at www.MissVolunteerService.com
Miss Volunteer Service International, Inc.	303881		/users/profile/395040	GailB13903	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2016	One of my nieces is involved with this program. At first, I though it was just another beauty pageant. I was quickly corrected - It's a competition. Beyond the crowns and sashes, there is nothing about beauty here. It's all about planning a service campaign and then they compete  based on hours served, funds raised, and how well they can speak about their mission and the organizations they partnered with. Really a neat idea!
Miss Volunteer Service International, Inc.	303878		/users/profile/395036	GlendaLynn	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2016	My grandchildren are volunteering with this group. They are brand new, but doing a really good job motivating these kids to create their own long term service projects. I am really surprised by the development I have seen and can't wait to see how this program grows in its first year.

Miss Volunteer Service International, Inc.	303802		/users/profile/394969	QueenSophie	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	I am an ambassador for this program and my mom is on the board. I have been doing pageants, 4H, and other service projects for 3-4 years. My passion is sharing stories about sustainable agriculture and how small stock like chickens and goats can bring people out of extreme poverty. I usually went to schools with a few of my animals and talked about the ONE Vote campaign and Heifer International. Since we started Miss Volunteer Service International, I have been able to make a real difference for people. I created a Poultry project to provide eating eggs for orphans at Real Care Ministries in Uganda and I am able to stay in touch with them and help to build and support the project long term. Most people my age don't get to create and direct their own projects this way.
Miss Volunteer Service International, Inc.	303794		/users/profile/394962	Jodie6	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	I'm so excited to see an organization that inspires youth to serve, but also teaches them the skills needed to do so. Too many people are paralyzed with the fear that they won't be able to solve every problem. Miss Volunteer Service International helps recognize those with the desire to do good in the world and the ability to turn it into action!
Miss Volunteer Service International, Inc.	303793		/users/profile/394960	queenevad	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	My sisters participate in this program and my mom is on the board.

This nonprofit is a startup with a mission to provide meaningful service opportunities to youth. I have seen kids raise money to provide chickens to an orphanage in Uganda and volunteer serving first responders for 9/11. If this is what they are doing in the first month, I can't wait to see what they have accomplished by next year!
Hidden Wounds Inc	231779		/users/profile/295335	ld387	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	I have personally seen the effects of this organization and the impact it is making on our community of Veterans. Mental health services are crucial to those who have served and are greatly needed. This Veteran run organization understands the Veterans they serve due to having served themselves.  Without any reservation I can say Hidden Wounds is making a difference and filling in the gap during this great time of need. 
Hidden Wounds Inc	231770		/users/profile/295327	lah_80	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	This organization has provided a great way to get involved with the community and is extremely knowledgable about Post Traumatic Stress. I feel encouraged when volunteering with this organization by knowing they are enhancing the lives of our Veterans on a daily basis and informing the public of the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress.  Veterans who receive  services from this organization always express their appreciation and feel good knowing there is someone who truly cares about their well being. 
Hidden Wounds Inc	231519	1	/users/profile/295101	jcalderap	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	This organization is the definition of a nonprofit.   All of their money and resources go to further improve the services rendered to veterans that need immediate help.  I've met numerous people that have survived because of the immediate help that Hidden Wounds brings.   They aren't just making lives of veterans more comfortable, but they are saving them and the families and friends around them. 
Hidden Wounds Inc	230598		/users/profile/294227	iblarpc	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2014	This is a group that doesn't spend millions on celebrities to do tv commercials. They don't parade vets around to make people feel guilty and give money. They don't sue other non profits with donor money if they are called out for something shady. The people who work actually care and know what they are talking about when they say They Get It!
Hidden Wounds Inc	230344		/users/profile/293986	danehenderson	Donor	5	10/30/2014	I met Steven a few years ago at a fundraising event where my brother had donated a ice sculpture for the auction. Since then I've donated multiple times. Not nearly as much as I wish I could. When you speak to Steven you can tell he is a warrior but also a gentle man who understands the needs of his other warriors. I done research on some of the big names non profits that do similar work but Hidden Wounds by far exceeds the benifits the soilders get out of the donations. Steven isn't interested in making money for himself. His interests are making our warriors that have put their lives on the line for us can live a normal life like us. 
Hidden Wounds Inc	230253		/users/profile/293902	Lhdiaz	Volunteer	5	10/30/2014	Love what they are able to do for veterans and their family. I have personally seen the lives they have been able to save. Thank you Hidden Wounds. 
Hidden Wounds Inc	226603		/users/profile/290333	Eva O.	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2014	II know the men and women who work to help veterans deal with the issues they bring back from war. Many of the staff have lost a loved one to suicide bc they were not able to handle the demons which haunted them. These are very special individuals whose organization needs more counselors, money, and recognition for our struggling war veterans whose wounds are hidden, These hidden wounds are masked by the military training of strength over weakness. Counselors are imperative for the survival of these vets. I am sure the numbers have changed, but the last time I heard figures 21 vets a day take their lives bv they are not able to deal with the ghosts from war. Columbia SC is a military town and state. SC is home to Fort Jackson, Paris Island, Shaw AFB, and McIntire ANG.  As a result, the needs for mental health are higher than some other states. All of the dollars raised through Hidden Wounds stays in Columba, SC to assist the veterans in this area. The organization does not turn down anyone who seeks help even from other states bc they do not want another brother to fall victim to suicide. Over coming the drinking and drug abuse used to mask the pain is another challenge these vets face. Overall Hidden Wounds funds counseling for Vets to helo them stay alive and keep families in tact.

Hidden Wounds Inc	171542	2	/users/profile/227141	Paula0603	Client Served	5	09/24/2013	For over 8 years my husband was in denial about his PTSD.   He finally came to a breaking point and took off.  He was missing for 4 days.  A friend contacted Hidden Wounds, who in turn contacted me.  A volunteer with Hidden Wounds called me practically immediately and spoke to me about what was going on and how they could help.  The day after my husband came home, the volunteer met with my husband and I.  He made my husband feel that he was NOT alone and that people do care!  Hidden Wounds found a counselor for him to see and he is now getting the help he deserves.  If it were not for Hidden Wounds, I don't know where we would be.

Hidden Wounds Inc	113964		/users/profile/155072	Jennifer102	General Member of the Public	4	06/06/2012	As the wife of an Army retiree I am accutely aware of the need for services to address PTSD, and not just from within the military.  With the number of deployments to combat areas and just the incidence of non-combat related injuries, the amount of PTSD cases has increased dramatically.  Trauma to the mind is just as hurtful (and possibly more so) than physical injuries.  Hidden Wounds is helping to provide services to many people that might otherwise get lost.
Hidden Wounds Inc	113895		/users/profile/154980	iamiwill	Volunteer	5	06/05/2012	Electric organization with purpose, worth while work, and making a difference in the lives of our military veterans AND their family members.

Although my program has an 84% quit rate, I find that this group has an even greater need to not only quit smoking, but to identify the triggers that hold them a prisoner of nicotine.  Hidden Wounds is the only organization that delivers the help so desperately needed.  Please, let's give our military the protection that they so selflessly provided while on active duty.
Hidden Wounds Inc	99625	2	/users/profile/120271	sjw54	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2011	I have  the utmost respect for former members of the military who see a need and take action.   This is the type of organization that can best work with those who need assistance......veterans who are suffering from any of the aftermath of war issues.   For those veterans who have 'been there and done that' their background is crucial.   The fact that they took it upon themselves to commit to the well being of our veterans who are hurting is outstanding.   Hopefully there will be more organizations that will pattern their work after Hidden Wounds.    Experience is the most beneficial means to treat 'hidden wounds' along with the professional staff where their combined efforts make a difference in the lives of our 'wounded'.
Hidden Wounds Inc	99603		/users/profile/120211	Steven234	Volunteer	5	10/22/2011	great group for veterans by veterans. This is the only organization of its kind in the nation. they work as a safety net for the VA by assisting vets by providing interim and emergency counseling services to ensure the psychological health and well-being to combat veterans and their families.

Palmetto Animal Assisted Life Services	309613		/users/profile/400965	akelly0033	General Member of the Public	5	10/11/2016	In 2014 my daughter ran for her High School Homecoming Princess. I so very much wanted to go see her walk out on the football field with her escort and enjoy the moment with her regardless of the outcome. However after serving 10 years in the military I've developed major anxiety that can sometimes be debilitating. I had to have my best friend go with me and basically hold my hand and escort me through the crowds. Also, I made sure to take medication to try and ward off a panic attack and keep my anxiety in check. This is just one example of the daily battles that I go through just trying to live the best life possible and be the best mother and wife I can be for my children in my husband.I don't have a service dog yet but I'm desperately trying to find the resources to try and make it happen. Charities such as this one provide great resources and a plethora of information to aid those like me. I am a service disabled veteran but unfortunately Veterans Affairs only appears to offer the resource of service dogs to individuals with PTSD or a traumatic brain injury. I thank God that I don't have either one of those issues but I sure would like to be able to do something as simple as get on a plane and not be medicated or to be able to enjoy precious moments with my children without fear of a panic attack  Thank you PAALS for all you do. If you are a person looking to donate to a good cause this is definitely one of them.

Without the stellar training that Dapper received, I would not be able to participate in many daily activities.

Palmetto Animal Assisted Life Services	306869		/users/profile/398183	____754	Donor	5	09/28/2016	PAALS is an absolute fantastic charity that I'm proud to donate to each year. Not only do they provide service dogs to those in needs, but they overcome adversity with smiles on their faces and are never discouraged. It's always nice to donate to a charity when you can see the end result and how it's helping the community. Some of the best folks around! 
Palmetto Animal Assisted Life Services	306399		/users/profile/397658	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/24/2016	I am just beginning my journey of applying for a service dog. My husband and I toured the facility last week. We met with the trainers and I think the director. Forgive me if I forget names that is part of my disability. Anyway we were very impressed with the PAALS program. There was so much caring and love for what they do for the dogs and  people with disabilities. The facility was cheerful and clean we felt like we were walking into a friend or family home. I'm looking forward to seeing where this journey takes me.

Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition	305746		/users/profile/397023	brianna.wooden16	Client Served	5	09/20/2016	My experience with FCFC has been absolutely phenomenal. They are  not only professional & friendly but are also completely devoted to rescuing animals in need & ensuring that they find the loving, forever homes that they all deserve. Earlier this year I adopted the sweetest, most beautiful cat anyone could ever hope to meet (now named Sekai) from FCFC. I found him through PetSmart Charities,  who partner with FCFC for adoptions. I was required to fill out an application which asked me questions not only about myself but also questions about cat care. This made it evident to me that they work tirelessly to ensure that only responsible and knowledgeable people are able to adopt. Once my adoption was approved by Joanne (who spoke with me personally) I was able to take Sekai home immediately. In the following months Joanne has checked in on us regularly & even added me on facebook so that she could stay regularly updated on Sekai's well being. FCFC has honestly restored my faith in humanity to do right by animals. The amount of love and care that goes into their adoptions is astounding. Thank you so much FCFC for a wonderful adoption experience & for uniting me with my best friend!!

Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition	305107	1	/users/profile/396335	Writer	Donor	5	09/16/2016	I was able to visit Christine and all the furry babies at the Head Butt Hotel recently and it was amazing! This organization helps animals far and wide. These cats are so well taken care of and are happy and healthy! She goes to extra lengths to make sure each cat has its needs met and exceeds those. She also ensures that they get the best homes and thoroughly selects adopters! If you can't foster, you can do what I'm doing and be a "virtual foster." You can sponsor a cat for 6 months and that helps with their care and needs. I'm so glad I got to go by and pick mine out-Riley Finn -the senior from Greenville :)Thanks again for all you do for the animals FCFC! -Kelcye Richards
Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition	304176		/users/profile/395348	Susan493	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/13/2016	I can't say enough positive things about FCFC and Christine. This is a rescue that is all about the animals and their welfare. Christine goes above and beyond to ensure that potential adopters are appropriate and a good match for the animal. She takes excellent care of the rescue's cats and dogs and expects and insists that adopters do the same. She makes it clear that the animals are her priority -- not money (although, like all rescues, there's never enough), not rescue politics/drama, not a rejected applicant's hurt feelings. FCFC is exactly what a rescue should be.
Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition	303483		/users/profile/394654	jo2go	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2016	Christine is Like mother Theresa for animals, her tireless efforts go above and beyond what I expected to see at a Shelter. These animals are well loved and cared for in every imaginable way. Larry is also a hard worker and deserves an award for being so attentive. They work very long days and nights to keep the space cleaner than some people hospitals. To visit is a pure pleasure and so rewarding with tons of love from the kitties. I called it Disney for cats when I visited the HeadButt Hotel. 
Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition	303437		/users/profile/394602	CatsHuman	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition and their accompanying Head Butt Hotel are doing so much right! This is an organization that I entirely trust to take care of the rescued animals properly. Christine Zois helped me tremendously in regards to an abandoned cat and dog who were living caged for 2 years. She immediately started looking for foster homes for both pets and sent me special food for the cat who had become seriously obese. Although, another rescue place ultimately came through with the placement for the dog and I ended up adopting the cat, Christine continued her valuable follow-up throughout the whole process. She had good advice about how to manage the health issues for this cat and is genuinely caring. I've come to know many details about how carefully she runs the Head Butt Hotel.  The cat hotel and the coalition together are working non-stop to help so many cats and dogs.  Please help them help the animals. You can sponsor an individual cat monthly or give flat donations. Each dollar helps tremendously.Below are photos of Angel dog and Rufus cat in their respective new homes. Rufus has already lost about 10 ounces --down from 16.1 lbs and is no longer having trouble walking. She even leaps onto table tops and sprints across the apartment! Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition helped with her initial diet change.

Here is his story:My name is  "Hunter" and I am from Huntington, WV.  I was severly injured and living in the streets for months when a nice lady and her husband finally caught me!! The lady called every local rescue and could not get help for me but she knew My life was worth saving so she reached out to Feline Canine Fellowship Coalition about 9 hours from me and in another state and the rescue did not hesitate to save my life!   Even with all the unknowns of my vet bills and my quality of life they said YES!!!The vet said I have had my leg and eye injury for many many months..tendons have been exposed, etc.  I am still under the vets 24 hour care (for my second week) for bandage changes daily.  The vet told the FCFC that my leg will NOT require amputation and I am a very happy sweet natured boy and will make some family a great addition!  Imagine that...a family of my very own!!!  I would never have the opportunity to experience love if it were not for this rescue!!!  Sincerly,Hunter the CatFrom Huntington, WV

Our dog Dewey had a horrible start to life, but he was lucky enough to be saved by this great organization. He was heartworm positive, starving, and in a high kill shelter. FCFC worked with other organizations to have him treated and brought to PA to find a forever home. After we found him, I was expecting to have a long, drawn out, stressful time waiting to finally get approved to bring him home. I'm so happy to say that the adoption was as easy as can be. They were very thorough to make sure that we were the right fit, but the whole experience was pain free .Today Dewey is a healthy, happy goofball who makes us laugh every day.  Without them he would not have had a chance, and we are forever greatful that they gave us our boy.

I have adopted from FCFC more than once with great success. I have also learned a great deal about healthy food and kitty health from Christine. This rescue will sometimes choose senior kitties that have lost their guardian or a kitty that need medical attention that they can help become a healthy and happy kitty again. They don't just choose young kittens to help and I'm very proud to know there is a group out there like FCFC helping the kitties that really need it.

In this world, gays and lesbians where gays and lesbians seem to be marginalized, we stand alone most of the time. We are shunned by our parents, left out by our peers for our belife systems, and put down by co-workers when we say, "I am Christian too."  Many say, what a strange dicotomy did you say Christian? Yes, gay and proud, and Christian too! Willing to stand up for our rights, and willing to die for the Lord.Candy Jacobson

I came out in the context of a fundamentalist Christian background and was treated like a criminal. My writings and reading others helped to bring necessary healing.  I have also finished a book called, "The Rude Awakening" that I hope to get published soon so that others in the GLBT and allied community will have some sense of how some Christians respond to people who affirm non-heterosexuality.  This organization helped me to return home to my faith and love for Jesus Christ and helped me to see how expansive the Love of God truly is.  I also feel more equipped to respond to the rhetoric and fear of the Fundamentalists now and am able to pray for the very people who wounded me in my past.

Whosoever Ministries Inc	5270	11	/users/profile/7066	Sean T	General Member of the Public	5	06/16/2009	Whosoever Ministries inc. is an essential resource for LGBT christians. I have been using the website for many months now and find it a great source of encouragement and inspiration. I would even go further and say that it has taken me out of the isolation that many people feel who are Christian and Gay. As a gay christian from Ireland, I have not much direct contact with other LGBT christian groups. The website, email groups, and the podcasts make me feel that I am part of the organisation, even though I have not met any of the people who run it in person. The recorded sermons are a lifeline to someone who does not feel at home in their own local church. The resouce material is excellent, from the prayer and scripture material to the website itself which is very informative and easy to follow. I almost feel as if Candace is my own pastor, because I have listened to her podcasts and find her to be one of the most inspirational preachers that I have heard. I have received a very warm welcome on my local rainbow fish group mailing list. This is a group that puts God and the people it serves first and it inspires us who use it to do the same.

Dr. Jerry Maneker	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/16/2009	"Whosoever" is a superb resource, with many articles of relevance to LGBT people and allies, and for people who are in any way confused about the interaction between being lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender and being a Christian.Many writers, including clergy and lay people, as well as the editor herself, write provocative articles in each issue that meaningfully affirm LGBT people, and amply demonstrate that there is no inconsistency between being LGBT and being a Christian.This magazine is designed to empower and embolden people to realize that God is greater than homophobic rhetoric and actions; one's experience with God is far more important than the ignorant and often hateful messages propounded from all too many pulpits and other venues throughout the world; the Bible in no way condemns "homosexuality" as we understand that term today.This online magazine, "Whosoever," is first rate in every respect, as is its editor Candace Chellew-Hodge.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/21/2016	We live in a community where animals are allowed to breed freely.  People purchase puppies only to forget about them when they are no longer 'cute' anymore.  We live in a community where  animals  are tossed aside for having treatable demodex.   I have witnessed this rescue take these forgotten ones.  Spay, Neuter them, medically treat them.  Then adopt them  to good homes.  Bully4you is sorely needed in our area.  When you donate to this rescue you are stopping a dog from ending up in the shelter system.   You are stopping unnecessary breeding.  Rescues like this one is not afraid to get dirty to help the helpless and homeless.  Foster,Donate,Adopt rescues.

WINGS for kids	147430	2	/users/profile/194877	Seashelly711	General Member of the Public	5	12/30/2012	My daughter currently serves as an Americorps Vista for Wings For Kids, her experience is life changing, she is soaring with Wings right now.This is a dedicated group of professionals highly invested in the challenges that cripple our country. Wings is teaching our children social and emotional skills that will carry the kids through their own challenges in their own lives on a daily basis effective immediately.  It is clearly done with the most important ingredients, love and respect of one another free of judgement, shame or pity. I for one would love to see the Wings for Children creed recited by every child in the nation as their own reminder for self preservation and moral base. I work as a public school bus driver in the Northeast and have been doing this for 16 years. I am familiar with kids of all ages and every child could benefit from the social/emotional process Wings is fostering in America's youth.  Wings in addition strives to support the parents with kids in the program as well as involving the local community. Wings coordinates with other non profits to get nutrition and volunteer services in place to support the kids. I am so proud my daughter has landed with this group and she couldn't be happier. 
WINGS for kids	140310	1	/users/profile/154170	srafalowski	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/15/2012	I have had the opportunity to work with the staff at WINGS for kids for the last 3 years as a partner supporting service learning as a part of the WINGS curriculum. WINGS shines a light on what makes kids GREAT and Earth Force considers them an outstanding partner. Their program is a critical staple of support for schools and communities that are often overwhelmed with with challenges. One of the things that makes WINGS so effective is their focus; all aspects of their program are explicitly tied to Social and Emotional Learning Objectives. Through SEL participants and their families learn how to explore and manage their own responses to the world around them. Through our partnership with WINGS for kids we, at Earth Force, feel that we are better able to achieve our mission to "engage young people as active citizens who improve the environment and their communities."
WINGS for kids	139314		/users/profile/185428	Heather70	Volunteer	4	11/14/2012	WINGS does so much for each student involved in their programs-providing academic help, emotional support, dinner, and FUN!

WINGS for kids	138069		/users/profile/184113	Litzieh	General Member of the Public	5	11/13/2012	As an ex-teacher for a Title One school, I know first hand the challenges the students and teachers face. The WINGS program provides an immeasurable amount of structure, support, encouragement, resources, and love to the children who participate. WINGS without a doubt is providing an environment where the students can bridge the gap between becoming successful academics as well as successful well rounded citizens. A WINGS graduate is presented with a bright future and carries the tools necessary to make their dreams a reality.

WINGS for kids	134908		/users/profile/180773	dgmeyer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/07/2012	Working with children is exhausting! Working with children who are unfamiliar with 'the rules for success' in a school setting, can raise the stress levels and literal noise levels in an educational environment very quickly; I know this from the past ten years. I have seen many teachers in action in our local schools, many of which serve "at-risk" children. I have unfortunately seen few teachers who seem to truly enjoy the process and appreciate their students, until now. The shouting, fighting and sulking behaviour, so typical of many children/students, is being addressed in a kind, caring and affirming manner.The children are learning both how to receive and give respect to others. They are learning about referred gratification and the perseverance and patience required to achieve their goals, something that I believe is too readily absent in our society. The young leaders are the best I've seen in an after school program and hopefully , they too will be even better leaders in our society, given a close understanding of the many issues our schools and students are facing. WINGS for kids gets the highest grade in my book. I'm very thankful they are here and I pray they will quickly expand the schools/sites they are able to work in
WINGS for kids	134303		/users/profile/180118	De Daltorio	Donor	5	11/06/2012	Being the Director of Education for the Charleston Animal Society, I see a lot of children.  I actually go into some of the same schools that Wings for Kids have their after-school program. Since I teach about being humane to animals sometimes the lessons easily can be about being humane to people.  I always know when a child in a classroom is part of the Wings family.  They talk to me by looking me in the eyes, they have a thought and can articulate it.  They see the impact people have on the animals around them.  After the first time I did a demonstration for the Wings about children being safe around dogs, I knew this organization was something special.  I love their curriculum, I think the staff are so committed to the mission and the students are truly a pleasure to teach.  We decided to offer a "reward" to the students who met their goals by having them come to the shelter for a behind the scenes tour, to play with a few animals, & just to learn about the role of the shelter in the community.  The staff overcame the hurdle of transportation and each month brought the students.  I have to say the Wings kids are a treat to be around.  They are generally interested in learning, they are respectful and really get the feelings of the animals waiting to find their forever home.  Their questions are intelligent & thoughtful and they truly care about the animals well being.  I admire the staff, the curriculum and the organization so much I personally donate because I believe in their cause.  Keep up the great work and guide those children to soar as high as they possibly can:)

It was truly refreshing to visit a school and see a large group of students being led in such a powerful and useful way.  The kids were happy, well-behaved and excited.  
WINGS for kids	133955		/users/profile/179716	cegladstein	General Member of the Public	5	11/05/2012	WINGS is an innovative program that actually addresses some of the enormous barriers to learning that are often overlooked:  behaviors.  I stumbled across the program years ago while visiting a school and saw children engaging in activities that actually required them to regulate their emotions!  If only every child received such powerful reinforcement at school.  From the second one walks in the door at a WINGS program, and they are greeted by a charming child with a warm handshake, it is clear that the program is transformative.  This is one of few nonprofits that is working as hard as it possibly can to change lives.

It is so wonderful to see the children's faces as they "get it" when the speakers talk about environmental education.  NatureScope is a 2 day field day filled with educational speakers.  You cannot get this much information in the classroom.  The children get to touch it and experience it.  This is great!!

For many children, it is the first time in their lives that they have had a chance to see some of the wildlife exhibited - let alone getting a chance to be face-to-face with them. The same goes for many of the hands-on exhibits that give the children a greater understanding and respect for their environment and environmental science. This raising of environmental awareness is continued in the classroom both through the science projects that the children create and through the grants awarded to the winning classrooms that are used to further promote environmental science in our county.

As a parent of two children who have had the opportunity to attend Backyard NatureScope Kids Who Care I never knew what my children were able to experience in that field trip to Santee Canal Park until I actually became a part of the board and volunteered at the event each year.  It is very educational and all the volunteers seem to love what they do, including me.

I have children who have attended NatureScope.  This organization not only instills good environmental ethics in our students it also demonstrates good leadership and community involvement as well as teamwork.  What better partnership could you ask for between schools and businesses?  My only wish would be to branch out...challenge other counties to get involved and maybe even take our competition outside Berkeley County.  Some of the projects are really great and could certainly be shown beyond our local community.  From classroom to the world we are making our environmental footprint, one student at a time. 
Berkeley County Kids Who Care Inc	81388		/users/profile/89088	greenbergl	Volunteer	5	03/07/2011	My name is Laurin and I am a 3rd Grade teacher at Sedgefield Intermediate. I was very excited to hear about this program. Not only because it would allow for my students to attend a field trip to the Old Santee Canal Park, but also because of the great opportunity it gave my students. This project allowed my students to really understand the importance of helping the environment and recycling. Our class project involved us reusing milk cartons and giving back to the environment by turning the cartons into bird feeders. The students also benefited because it taught them how to work together and learn from each other. I cannot wait to see how much my students get out of their experience at Old Santee Canal Park, and just them knowing that they were a key part to them earning this field trip will teach them a deep appreciation of hard work. I also believe that people naturally benefit from giving back to others... This project was a wonderful experience. Not to mention that my class won a $500 grant (1st place in the 3-5 individual competition)!!

The NatureScope field day they put together is superb, and provides an opportunity for students to experience a full day of science outside the classroom.

Noahs Arks Rescue	293488	1	/users/profile/384090	clwalker98	Client Served	5	06/21/2016	I adopted my sweet Dally girl from Noahs Arks Rescue. Let me give you a small background on Dally.she was shot in the leg when she was 6 months old in which they had to amputate her leg so she does not trust easily. I had to work with her to gain her trust. I went to the boarding facility where she was every single day (at different times of the day) to work with Dally to gain her trust. There was NEVER a time that I went that the kennels werent cleaned and the dogs werent taken care of. Noahs Arks Rescue does a FANTASTIC job at taking care of these dogs in every realm no matter the cost! The kennels are always clean, the dogs beds and blankets are washed every day, they get any medical they need, fed, bathed, play time with others, outside time, walks, training and A LOT of LOVE and attention. For the dogs to actually love, trust and respect everyone that works with them after the abuse they have suffered just goes to show you that these dogs are loved, socialized and well taken care of. Noahs Arks has the best of the best working for them. They live and breathe for these dogs. I could go on and on about how great Noahs Arks Rescue is but you will not believe it until you come see for yourselfso come on! I am blessed to have found such a fantastic organization! Thank you Noahs Arks Rescue! 
Noahs Arks Rescue	293430	4	/users/profile/384035	Carolinagirls	General Member of the Public	5	06/20/2016	I had the pleasure of witnessing the volunteers of Noahs Ark Rescue in action during an event in March. The organization had multiple families at the event volunteering and you could tell that each person there truly cared about animals and especially the dogs entrusted to their care. During my conversations with them I realized that not only were these volunteers pet lovers, they had done research and knew in detail how to work with and adopt a dog that has suffered from abuse. Since that event, I have talked to a local veterinarian who is aware of this organization and he had nothing but wonderful and loving things to say about them. One of my closest friends adopted a dog from this great organization and I have seen the extensive support they have given her with this dog. During the Hilton Head St Patricks Day parade I witnessed the support and pride the crowd had for this rescue. I stand behind the work Noahs Ark does!
Noahs Arks Rescue	293428	4	/users/profile/384033	JustJeri	Volunteer	5	06/20/2016	I became involved with Noah's Arks Rescue when I was interested in a dog they had taken in. That dog was not a match for my family. After meeting everyone and some of the dog's I knew this is finally a place for me to volunteer.  The coordinator, Monica matched the perfect broken being to my pack of beasties. This type of thing only happens with people who really care and know what they are doing. I have since devoted my time to this rescue. They rescue the ones that everyone else can't take, that man has  let down, that have suffered horribly. They are the rescue that gets begged by others to help. The goal is to love them, make them healthy and whole mentally as well as physically. They never want for anything as they wait for their perfect family to be found. I have been in boarding. It is clean and the dogs are comfortable. There aren't warning signs as accused. It would be great if fosters were available for everyone but, that is not reality. Reality is some dog's are so emotionally abused that it takes time for them to trust again. That trust only comes from an amazing group of people working really hard to help these dog's. I take personal offence from someone trying to imply anthing negative about Noah's Arks Rescue.  We couldn't get so many dogs rehabilitated and in loving home's if they were not socialized. By all means don't take my word, come see for yourself at any event!!!
Noahs Arks Rescue	293417	4	/users/profile/384023	fester	Client Served	5	06/20/2016	This is by far the best group of people doing rescue work I have ever come across. I adopted a special needs dog from them earlier this year. They stepped in when called by Beaufort County Animal Control to take in this dog; they took him in and he was given the medical help he needed. I met him at an adoption event where there were many animals being "socialized" and all were getting along. I follow Noah's Arks Rescue on Facebook  and see all of their events. I stop by on occasion to see the dogs. They are very social, and this is because of the very special people working with this rescue who work non-stop to get them into the best homes. I have seen other organizations at events, one being our local humane society, where the dogs were fighting, blocking the doorway to a store, attacking patrons dogs, and the workers were incapable of being proactive in reading the dog's behaviors. Thank god a Noah's Arks Rescue volunteer saw what was going on and ran from their event over to help the other organization.  These people know what they are  doing!!!!!!!!
Noahs Arks Rescue	293407	4	/users/profile/384009	Jeff102	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/20/2016	I have been dealing with NAR since April of 2015 when Jennifer reached out to me looking to expand their training program to better enhance the lives of their dogs.  Since then, I have had about 7 of their dogs in my home for training.  I usually have about 4 NAR dogs with me at any point in time.  They come to me for additional training, socialization and behavior modification.  While here with my wife and me, we expose them to a slew of different people, places and situations on a daily basis when appropriate.  We have over two acres of property where the dogs enjoy walks in the woods and we have 3/4 of an acre fenced in for play and off leash exercise.   We also host weekly pack walks and we rotate the dogs we take with us on walks.  I will do anything for NAR.  I know first hand that no expense is spared and any measure is taken by NAR to give all of their dogs whatever they need to heal and find their forever home... I also was hired in 2015 to train their volunteers and other staff on dog training and handling of the dogs in their boarding facility.  On 3 consecutive months last year, I went down to SC and trained the staff and worked with all the dogs in their care.  I appreciate the fact that they always seem to be finding ways to improve the lives of the dogs in their care.  The best part about NAR is they take in dogs that others wouldn't.   NAR gives hope to the hopeless.  They give life to near-dead.  The give second chances to dogs that have no where else to turn... That's pretty darn respectable to me... God bless NAR and all their staff and animals!!  Attached is a pic of me and a NAR dog, Freckles...- Jeff Coltenbackwww.JeffColtenback.com 
Noahs Arks Rescue	293380	4	/users/profile/383981	LalaM	Volunteer	5	06/20/2016	I have started becoming involved with Noahs Archs nearly a year ago, when I adopted my sweet blood hound Rosie. This rescue is incredible. The job that they do with pups that everyone has given up in is truely amazing. The dogs recieve the best medical care availible. They never give up on a dog once the dog is part of Noahs. Once the dogs are healthy enough to be released form medical. The dogs are socialized at every availible opportunity. Some dogs are fostered in approved families, others are keneled in a very clean facility. The kenel washes the dogs blankets and bed covers everyday. The dogs play in the play yards , master the agility course, get walks and bathes. Noah works with a variety of trainers depending on the dogs needs. All the trainers are compassionate, caring and truly loved and respected by the dogs. Monica (adoption cooridinator) and Jennifer (owner)take a hands on and personal interest in every dog. I can't say enough positive things about Noah and their staff, they truly  live to save these dogs on every level.
Noahs Arks Rescue	293376	4	/users/profile/383977	Kerri10	Volunteer	5	06/20/2016	I have been volunteering with NAR for almost 5 years. You can't imagine the amount of blood, sweat and tears that goes into saving these dogs! Most come to us broken, physically and mentally and it's heartbreaking. Rescue is not easy, and NAR takes the WORST cases. Some dogs are more broken than others and take longer to rehabilitate. But NAR never gives up!! 
Noahs Arks Rescue	293375	5	/users/profile/383976	tomskees	General Member of the Public	5	06/20/2016	I'm not sure when I first heard of Noah's Arks Rescue but I can tell you who I first read about.   It was a puppy named Freckles who I thought had no chance of surviving.  Just a pup, who I imagine was as all puppies are, full of licks, jumps and playfulness, wanting to be held and loved on.  Freckles didn't get held.  Instead he got dragged behind a car or maybe a truck.  I remember seeing more tissue and blood than the cute body of an innocent animal.  I've kept up with Freckles, watched him grow, stopped in to see him where he is boarded, fed, loved, trained, played with, all  provided by people who know him, know what he has gone through and he lives.  Does he spend time in a kennel, yes, but don't be confused that he is confined to it 24/7, and don't think of it as a small cramped cage, it's not.  It is a refuge, it's a haven for him until someone comes to take him home.  Freckles is not alone.  There are many more just like Freckles, some have been shot, some have their ears cut, some cant walk, others have been hit in their head with tools or hammers, some are used as amusement for humans and are put out to fight and others are simply just left to fend for themselves because much of our society falls short of the image we were created in,.  Somewhere we lost our hearts and our souls. So to anyone who is quick to condemn, if you have a better plan, a better home, a better way to heal the broken put it out there, jump in, walk a dog, take one home for a weekend and let it curl up beside you.  Be a part of the remedy  and not the person who keeps the next puppy from getting the help it needs.  Thank you to Noah's Arks Rescue, their many volunteers, and the businesses and individuals who support them. 
Noahs Arks Rescue	281993		/users/profile/372097	Jennifer526	Volunteer	1	03/09/2016	There is no socialization for these abused dogs.  They are kept in kennels for 20 hours a day.  The trainer uses aversive methods which is probably why they are all bite risks as stated on their cage cards.  If anyone thinks these poor souls are at a sanctuary think again!  
Noahs Arks Rescue	171890	3	/users/profile/150558	blworrilow	Donor	5	09/25/2013	As compassionate an organization as I have ever seen when it comes to severely injured/abused dogs. Jennifer Smith, the uncompensated president and her uncompensated volunteers, seem to have every contact in the veterinary world to save dogs that most people would never think could survive. The communication with admirers and donors as to what goes on with each animal from the day it is accepted until it is adopted (and sometimes medical care after adoption is required) is superb.  
Noahs Arks Rescue	163054	4	/users/profile/201135	Kelly FitzP	Donor	5	07/19/2013	What I love about Noah's Ark  - everything.  They rescue severely injured and abused animals and provide  them with extraordinary veterinary care, rehabilitation and love.  They give animals who never had a chance, a new and wonderful life.  I donate to Noah's Ark without hesitation because I know my money is going directly to help these animals.  They are 100% volunteer supported.  The founder, Jennifer Smith is a beautiful soul.  I wish I lived near there, I would love to be a part of this amazing organization.  
Noahs Arks Rescue	154190	7	/users/profile/173397	Irene9	Donor	5	04/11/2013	Noah's Arks is the rescue of last resort for those at the end of the line. Dogs dragged along roads from the backs of cars, dogs beaten, tortured and left for dead, dogs starved and abandoned, dogs burned... The litany of abuse is endless and horrific. Dogs brought to shelters after suffering this sort of abuse are unlikely to survive or to be deemed viable potential adoptees, so when Noah's Arks get an emergency call to pull a hopeless victim they respond. Noah's Arks provides emergency medical and surgical care to badly damaged animals, rehabilitates them and prepares them for adoption. They keep their supporters up to date on the story of each dog - where they were found, what had been done to them, and the story of how they were slowly healed. Jennifer, who is the president of the organization, writes with such feeling, compassion and love about each rescue - each is an individual and each is special. The stories will move anyone to tears, and the incredible resilience and dedication of Jennifer and her volunteers are totally inspiring. People who intentionaly hurt animals are evil, but Noah's Arks throws down the gauntlet to counteract that evil and bring its victims back to life.
Dream Equine Therapy Center	157075		/users/profile/208305	ATH Cattle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/03/2013	My wife and I have worked with DETC for over 5 years, providing foster care, transportation assistance, material and financial assistance.  We own and operate a successful breeding farm, bringing a combined 70+ years of animal husbandry experience to this discussion.  I am a Board President of an unrelated 401(c)(3) organization and hold a Master of Public Administration with an emphasis in non-profit management.  I am employed as a law enforcement officer with over 25 years experience, to include specializations in fraud investigations, internal affairs investigations and offender profile assessments.  I say all of this to say I know how to raise animals, know how to read people, how to tell good folks from bad folks and can tell when "things" are dishonest, deceitful or just not right. I absolutely no reservations in attesting to the ability, honesty and ethical character of Ms. Stemper.  I have personally witnessed Ms. Stemper's devotion on many occasions as she places the needs of rescued animals above her own needs.  Ms. Stemper goes to tremendous lengths to ensure horses she rescues are placed with caring, competent and respectable people.  She is upfront and honest when dealing with potential foster homes or forever homes, ensuring people understand their expectations, commitments and limitations.  Foster and forever homes are required to sign a straight-forward contract explaining these obligations in substantial depth and detail.  Unfortunately, there remain people of good intention who read with their heart, not their head.  These emotional decisions rarely fare well.  The majority of these people of good heart recognize their mistake and work with Ms. Stemper to further ensure the best interests of the horses are met, which usually involves Ms. Stemper assuming greater expense as she welcomes a placed horse back to her farm.  This leaves a few who, for whatever reason, feel they bear no responsibility for their poor decision, lashing out and casting blame.  This is where my internal affairs tenure comes in.  The personal attacks, innuendo and thinly-veiled threats against Ms. Stemper that are posted on this site are strikingly similar to the retaliatory complaints I have investigated as an internal affairs investigator.  What I have seen (and see in these postings) are disgruntled or embarrassed citizens who have transgressed, then reach for redemption by attacking anything and anyone without thought or concern for truth, honor or dignity.  The unfortunate truth about the internet is that people have the perceived idea that you can say anything about anyone without fear of accountability.  The negative posts I have read are without merit, untrue and demonstrate a marked lack of character. Ms. Stemper - you have my continued support and admiration for your outstanding work and tireless devotion to the animals blessed enough to have a second chance at your farm.  I am looking forward to helping in any capacity towards the continued success of Dream Equine Therapy Center.
Dream Equine Therapy Center	157064		/users/profile/208297	Gina27	Volunteer	5	05/03/2013	Wow....just read "Boobyboo"'s statement.    First, besides your screen name being "boobyboo", calling people "idiots" on this site does not lend to your credibility, so most people will likely discard anything you say.   Additionally, no one at Dream Equine puts children on the backs of nurse mare foals.  Are you kidding or just misinformed?   Dream Equine doesn't even work with physically challenged kids.   The work they did before was emotional therapy and did NOT take place at the farm....I do believe it was visits to hospitals.   And YES, that has been put on hold during the grueling move to a new location, which is now thankfully in the final stages.   I am involved with funding raising and a bit of fostering of the nurse mare foals.   This has been continuing (albeit on a smaller basis) for the past two years during the process of acquiring the new property, mostly at great personal expense to the director of DETC.  Fortunately, she does have a few good foster homes willing to take on the expenses and support many of these horses and foals in the interim.   It is indeed unfortunate that she recently had to take the horses back from this person that "boobyboo" says she is NOT (although, there really doesn't seem to be anyone else on earth that would be this angry and hateful over the matter, that she would use childish words like "idiot" and put libelous statements and threats on the internet...a bit risky actually, since we all have an IP address and these statements in the end are not anonymous if the law is involved).    Back to the horses that had to be taken back.  While they had lost a good amount of weight, they are now under the care of DETC as well as DETC's more reliable foster homes that are in a better financial postion to feed them properly.   I think what we all need to remember is that this "rescue issue" is not supposed to be about our egos.  IT IS ABOUT CARING FOR THE HORSES....SAVING THE ONES WE CAN.    YES, it is rewarding and warms you from the inside out, so it does help people with esteem issues feel better about themselves.   BUT, that should be secondary to what we really are out to do, which at the moment, happens to be rescuing every horse and foal that we are able to.    So, come on guys.    Can we please look inside ourselves and remember that?   Let the anger go.   If you couldn't get the job done, and someone else has stepped up to the plate, be thankful that SOMEONE is able to do it.   Nuf said.   
Dream Equine Therapy Center	156671		/users/profile/207803	boobyboo	Donor	1	04/29/2013	Sadly, I have learned that Dream Equine Therapy's mission statement 'to provide support and wellness to terminally ill and chronically ill people through rescued and rebabilitated equines' is a LIE.  The organization has not provided any form of therapy to anyone in many years.  Using the terminally and chronically ill 'card' to raise funds for the organizaiton is a disgrace.  I, myself, fell for it and am beyond disappointed.  Please consider and research a charitable organization before you donate ... I only wish I had had the wisdom to do the same.
Dream Equine Therapy Center	150057	1	/users/profile/200077	anuislandgirl	Volunteer	5	02/25/2013	I have adopted 2 foals from Dream Equine over the past 4 years.   When I first moved to the area, I made a deliberate decision to check out this 501c3 organization to see if they were "worthy" of my very limited volunteer time.   They most certainly were and I do everything I can to help Terri raise funds now.   What I see is an extremely hard working person (she has a full time job as a nurse) who gives to these horses above and beyond what you would think is humanly possible.    When most people would be to the point they can hardly formulate a sentence, Terri is still going like the energizer bunny.   I have watched her take one of the sickest orphan foals I have ever seen (Armstrong) and thru hard work and sleepless nights, nursed him to health when everyone else thought he would die.   I read the one review from the person who was not allowed to adopt, and it is unfortunate to see sour grapes like that displayed when Terri always acts ONLY in the best interest of the horses under her care, directly and otherwise.   She keeps in touch with adopters and has often had to take back horses that were not being cared for.    The fact that she "nipped this one in the bud" means she protected these horses from what she considered a questionable situation.   I take my hat off to her for having the guts to JUST SAY NO.     As for my own two orphan foals, Ace & Leila, they will be 4 this year and are doing beautifully.    When I look at Leila and remember the condition she was in when Terri rescued her (she was 9 mos. at rescue), my heart is so full and I am so grateful to Terri for saving her.    Ace on the other hand is incorrigible, gorgeous, full of life and we LOVE him!What can I say, but THANK YOU TERRI for all the hard work and your own money that you put into these wonderful beings!

Dream Equine Therapy Center	149757	1	/users/profile/199704	Azar	Volunteer	5	02/21/2013	I have been a volunteer for DETC for several years now and have nothing but great things to say.  I myself have adopted several of their horses, and fostered.  The care, safety, and well-being of the horses are first priority.  All of the horses are well feed (grain & hay), regular trimmings, teeth floated, vaccines, and any vet care required.  I went with DETC to Kentucky for Mindys cancer diagnosis and surgery.  That was a very long couple of days on the road and at the vet.  This trip also included helping a dog get to his new forever home, and rescuing two older horses that were delivered to another rescue in NC on the return trip home.  I have made numerous trips with DETC to pick up horses from cruel, neglected and unsafe environments.  Teresa Ramsey  has only visited the property on one occasion and stated  that Chiclets pictures from the website were from 5 months rehab when in fact it was just 5 weeks (check the date on the pictures).  The cost of rescuing orphan foals and rehabilitating horses is a huge expense.  What money is not made from donations or adoption fees come from DETC personal funds.  I have spent many hours with DETC and can honestly say that I have never seen such loving care given to any animal as they show to those precious horses.  How can someone that has only been on the property just once make such inaccurate statements?  I give to this organization on a regular basis and I know that every penny is spent on the rescue horses.  DETC does own their own personal horses, as any horse loving people would, and all expenses are paid from personal accounts and not from DETC.
Dream Equine Therapy Center	149717	1	/users/profile/199625	Tesev	Client Served	5	02/20/2013	My Mindy is a 2009 nurse mare foal from Dream Equine Therapy Center, and Mindy is my dream that was allowed to come true because of Dream Equine Therapy Center and the vision of Terri Stemper.  The process to adopt her this winter was very open and straight forward, and I was as impressed with Terri Stemper as I was with the whole adoption process.  Terri went above and beyond to answer each and every question I had about Mindys past.  Due to time constraints, I picked up Mindy from Terris home.  Every horse looked cared for and content.  My farrier, Kelvin,  joking said that if he died and came back as a horse, he would want to be one of mine.  I feel the same way about Dream Equine Therapy Center.  At the SCHE Expo in Camden this month, I had the pleasure of watching both Julee Clarke and Terri Stemper share information with fellow horse lovers.  The commitment of both of the these ladies is obvious in their interaction while sharing the purpose of this organization.  I look forward to meeting other volunteers over the coming years.  Thank you Julee for pointing me to Terri, and my sincere thanks to each and every person who donates money, volunteers times and services, fosters, trains, and loves enough to keep this organization going.  It has truly blessed my life and will every day for many, many, years to come.
Dream Equine Therapy Center	149710	2	/users/profile/199612	sunchar	Volunteer	5	02/20/2013	I am proud to say that I have been a volunteer with Dream Equine Therapy Center since 2011. I am currently fostering five horses. I also help with writing grants for funding. DETC's mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and find forever homes for horses. This includes nurse mare foals, retired broodmares, and abused/neglected horses. In addition to rescue, DETC is working diligently to eliminate the need for breeding nurse mares for use in the Thoroughbred racing industry. The current practices result in thousands of unwanted and orphaned foals each year.  DETC is dedicated to changing this by educating both the nurse mare and Thoroughbred farmers on a safe, reliable, and cost effective alternative to their current practices.  Over the last two years, DETC has been using a hormone-induced-lactation (HIL) protocol with retired broodmares. This protocol brings mares into lactation without being bred.  This in turn, eliminates the production of unwanted foals. These HIL mares have been successfully used to nurse orphaned foals, proving the efficacy of the program. Dream Equine Therapy is an organization that will do what it takes to help horses in need. 
Dream Equine Therapy Center	149709	2	/users/profile/199615	HelptheHorses	Volunteer	5	02/20/2013	Just so the truth can be told. I am a long time volunteer with DETC. The below comment is from a Teresa Ramsey of Sharon SC. She wanted to adopt 5 horses from DETC in summer of 2012. She was not approved due to no horse experience and pasture completely lined with barb wire. During the site visit and when her property was not approved for adoption of a young foal, she tried to physically assault the director of DETC. Since then she has been posing as DETC and taking word for word off their website and trying to solicit donations for herself. DETC has had to take legal action against her. It is unfortunate that Ms Ramsey has so much negative energy to put into these lies and harassment, which has all stemmed from her own wrongdoing. I truly hope Ms Ramsey gets the help she needs to be a better person.  As far as DETC, anyone can do their own research and see that none of those comments are true. DETC has never been investigated, has never had 25 horses on 5 acres, has never had horses without food, water or shelter. Anyone can make an appt at anytime to visit horses for adoption and see that they are all well fed, happy, and trained properly. DETC has 3 different properties and multiple foster homes. The director does have her own horses, all of which are paid out of her personal bank account and I know for a fact the director spends thousands per year of her own money caring for the rescues.  This is all public record by the way since the organization is a 501c3 nonprofit.  It is impossible to discredit an organization that is doing so much good. There are hundreds of happy adopters and so many supporters of this wonderful organization. Please visit DETC website at www.dreamequinetherapycenter.org to view the horses and foals available for adoption and see how you can help to rescue orphan nurse mare foals!!
Dream Equine Therapy Center	149647		/users/profile/199514	HorseLovers	Professional with expertise in this field	1	02/19/2013	I have the opportunity to see first hand what exactly is going on on Gordon Road where Dream Equine claims to be and have horses available after following this for approximately two years through an adopter.  The statements on the website are not exaclty the truth.  Horses of all types, ages etc that are supposed there and available for adoption are not.  I witnessed over 25 horses on a five acrea farm.  Six to eight of which where yearlings that had yet to know what grass was due to being in a 500' x 500' roped over dirt area with no grass, water trough, or shelter.  I also had the oppportunity to go nto the barn twice to see two without water on more than one occasion and the one named Chiclet that was taken back... well Ms Terri forgot to mention it was her neighbor that let the horse get into such shape and she could see it everyday because the pasture were side by side.   At the times I visited  she had her back for months and not 5 weeks like stated on the site.The county has ordinances regarding animals and requirements which she was about 20+ over the limit. Which she fails to tell that she has been investigated several times for and is warned.  The bad thngs abouth that is though the laws are not strick enough.  She just gets a slap on the hand and a notice that she has so much time to make changes or else there will be another slap on the hand.  York County officers have even stated that they are trying to improve the laws regarding horses and facilities like this one.I did notice that Ms Terri Semper had quite a few of her own horses on this facilty and gettign the same treatment paid for thru donations, however these were posted throughout the internet for quite higher prices.I do not see how this is a "RESCUE" facilty by what I saw.  I was fortunate enough to have been introduced to this facilty threw a past adoptee of several animals.   I have seen and was also told about the adoption form so I pulled it up and read the requirements.  I have serious problems understanding how the requirements of the potential adopter is any different than the standards set for the facilty itself. and the fact that the facility is constantly BEGGING for donations of all types. This money should only go to the care of these nurse mare foals they claim they are taking such great care of not to the care of ones personal pets and needs.  This is the perfect example of people who take on more than they can handle.TO STATE THE FACTS:  It appears that someone possibly started this with the right intentions but things have changed in the past two years.  I strongly suggest that one look further into this before donating money or any thing else for that matter.
Dream Equine Therapy Center	59393	2	/users/profile/64117	SCBree	Volunteer	5	01/04/2011	Dream Equine Therapy Center works diligently and tirelessly to rescue nurse mare foals and unwanted, neglected and abused horses.  We deeply understand these foals and horses needs, nutrition, training, spiritual.  Placing these horses with adopters is a responsibility that is not take lightly.  Always placement is done with the hope this is the horse's forever home and their past hardships are now behind them.  DETC has placed many many horses successfully.  We promote efforts to reduce the number of unwanted horses holding the first FREE gelding clinic in the southeast in Nov, 2010.

Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	230360		/users/profile/293998	PamBenedict	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	I've been involved with Hope Remains since 2006.  By serving as a board member, it has been extremely rewarding to see how decisions have impacted the organization to thrive and grow by serving more and more children and their families.  The Lord has continued to bless this ministry in spite of the fact that many times the board did not know what decision needed to be made next, but the Lord did.  It's great to serve along side other fellow believers who have a passion for the mission of Hope Remains and I consider it an honor to be a small part of what's happening.  I'm blessed to be a part of an organization that offers 'hope' to hurting children and their families throughout the upstate of South Carolina and beyond!
Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	229907		/users/profile/293558	Dipstick	Donor	5	10/29/2014	My involvement at this time has been as a donor and prayer supporter. This is an amazing program that gives children a chance to find love, support and understanding that they have not been able to receive any other way. I am so thankful there is a place for families and children right here in our own backyard. God is at work on the ranch and in the schools. Thanks you Mel, Pam and staff for answering the call to meet the needs of so many.
Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	229629		/users/profile/293277	Mindy.Connelly	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	Hope Remains Youth Ranch is an outstanding place. I had the chance to intern with this wonderful group , I learned so much not only from the staff but from the youth that participated in this program. I watched children actually grow and change with this program. Hope Remains became their favorite place to be. The older youth would even ask to come volunteer their time when it wasn't their day to be there. I am so grateful for Hope Remains and the experience I had with them. 
Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	229572		/users/profile/293222	CSBC2283	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I have been involved with Hope Remains since 2012.  I have been very impressed with how well Melanie Watt and staff makes the ranch flow.  They selection process for volunteering at the ranch is very selective to pick the best ones to help with the wide variety of clients that they have in attendance there.  No matter what the problem that the clients have there, Melanie and staff come up with the best solution to help them overcome their problems and help them graduate after overcoming their issues.

Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	228467		/users/profile/292154	edensantana98	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	Being a volunteer at Hope Remains Youth Ranch has been the most incredible experience. I thought at first I was there to be a blessing to others when in fact it has been the other way around! I think being a part of the HRYR family has been more of a blessing to me than I could ever be a blessing to the ranch. I never knew how much I would grow and mature as person (and spiritually!) by being a part of the team there. Not only has my life been impacted, but everyday teens and kids' lives are being impacted whether they realize it right now or not. There is no where else I would rather be.
Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	228440		/users/profile/292129	Molly_kate20	Volunteer	5	10/28/2014	I started volunteering at Hope Remains Youth Ranch in January 2014. It started off as just a way for me to have my own hobby away from my friends. This place has made even an impact in my life and has become my favorite place to be. When you are with the staff and volunteers you can't help but enjoy yourself because you know each one of them enjoys what they do and want to help hurting children. It is incredible to see what all this place has accomplished and I am very excited for the future. 
Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	228426		/users/profile/292118	Ken_41	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2014	I've been associated with Hope Remains Youth Ranch from its early days. One truth has remained constant...the goal is to help hurting children and families. This organization has met in several locations over the years, but always with the same message and beliefs. HRYR does an outstanding job of serving the community. I can't say enough good about this organization. Excellent!!!
Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	228233		/users/profile/291932	tarle185	Donor	5	10/28/2014	Hope Remains Youth Ranch is changing the lives of hurting children and families in a very unique and powerful way every day.   I live a couple of miles from the ranch and it is one of the ministries I love and support.  I personally know these folks and they are extraordinary! Horses and people who genuinely love and care begin to work in their hearts and lives of these children and families and they experience hope for the first time.  They begin to open up and respond to the truth that God indeed has a plan and purpose for their lives and He loves them unconditionally.  Lives are transformed.   Melanie Watt, Founder and Executive Director had a hope and a dream when she was 12 years old.  The ranch was her dream, which now is a reality.    Because of Melanies dream and the love and the support of faithful volunteers, supporters, selfless staff and board members and consistent prayer warriors, God is honored and glorified.  Many different programs are offered for these children and families.  God has truly blessed the growth at Hope Remains each year.  Its never too late.  Dont give up!  Nothing is impossible with God! Visit www.HopeRemains.org.  Give Melanie a call.  Come and see for yourself.

I am a retired pilot and am having a great time of enjoyment and fulfillment in being able to spend time with at-risk young men and ladies and having the opportunity to work with them and some fantastic horses, as we use these animals for equine therapy.  For a retired Christian individual, this really beats picking up shells on the beach.  I love it!
Hope Remains Youth Ranch, Inc.	213971		/users/profile/277186	pastormark1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/08/2014	Hope Remains is an amazing organization with a very simple message! There is always hope to everyone that will receive it! The staff and volunteers have a heart for people and they just want to help people thru the "no remedy" situations that we all find ourselves in from time to time. The great news is, they know the source of our hope and are willing to help people discover that "hope" as they help them in real life situations! The end result - John 10:10 "the thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy but Jesus has come so that we may have abundant life!" Have you found hope? If not, I highly recommend that you check out Hope Remains Youth Ranch! Don't take my word for it, come find hope yourself!

In a state that is often striving to show off what we do well, United Way Association is one non-profit that always works hard and it shows!
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	137475		/users/profile/183461	MakeAnImpact	Donor	4	11/12/2012	The United Way Association of South Carolina is  super helpful, efficient, and honest. They made it so easy for my co-workers and I to donate and really demonstrated how even a little amount per pay period adds up, and will be used for great purposes. I liked how they showed that my donation will go right back to my community! I love donating to United Way and will continue to try to convince others to do so as well! 
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	133595		/users/profile/174154	BMerritt	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	The United Way of the Midlands helped me when I returned to SC in 1987, a single mother with two children, ages 3 and 4 months old.  The United Way and it's agencies is the "rock" of our community when we or our neighbors need assistance.  Since that year I have been volunteering for the campaigns and with the agencies.  Please help support the United Way to help ensure those in need are supported when they need it most.
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	129105		/users/profile/174447	Sharon.R	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	United Way Association of South Carolina provides services that improve lives across South Carolina.  The organization provides a 2-1-1 information and referral line for human social services programs across the state; administers the Americorp program for South Carolina; and provides assistance for Medicaid beneficiaries.

United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	128661		/users/profile/173850	Bob_21	Volunteer	5	10/25/2012	I have been involved with U/W for 25 years as a  board member and volunteer throughout. I have worked with the SC  Association  since I retired in 2007.  I have  been impressed with the large impact the SC Association makes with the small SC Local UW's. through communications, training , leadership and ability to actively network the state's social service needs with the SC State Government.  The Governor of SC actually asked the Association to take over AmeriCorp and doing so has grown it's very positive  impact in SC. Since then, as a result of 211's success in SC,  Dept of Social Services  has outsourced their service call center to the Association. The Association is staffed with 21st Century Out of Box expertise who have made the Association a World Class Non-profit.
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	128300		/users/profile/173454	K.H.	Board Member	5	10/24/2012	I hI have had a long and positive experience with the United Way Association of South Carolina.  Earlier in my career I had the honor of working with them on a major initiative to improve child welfare services in South Carolina, an initiative that resulted in my co-location in the United Way Association's office.  This experience linked me forever with the creative and mission-oriented staff and leaders associated with the organization; and today I am pleased to be able to help the organization as a board member.  I am particularly proud of the leadership and ground-breaking direction of the United Way Association of South Carolina in becoming the driving force behind the state's 211 system; for taking on the programs that help citizens access governmental  services in a welcoming, respectful and supportive way; the organization's advocacy for the poor who do not have enough of a voice to effectively advocate for themselves but need assistance in their lives; and our strong support for local United Way efforts and programs.   The United Way Association of South Carolina is the type of organization that one hopes all entities would try to emulate.  I believe our organization is progressive, its leadership outstanding, and the citizens of South Carolina fortunate to have an organization like ours to help to bring together diverse groups and ideas for the betterment of our state.
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	127619		/users/profile/172695	Tom_21	Board Member	5	10/22/2012	The United Way Association of South Carolina serves a critical, but low-profile, role in the service and safety net structure of the state. Its primary function is to enhance the effectiveness of local United Ways by providing, as needed and as requested, backroom technical and administrative support; by cordinating regional and statewide initiatives; and by administering federally funded programs. My previous experience with local UWs has enabled me to appreciate all the more the work of the UWASC. My interactions with other United Ways reinforces this perception. The 2-1-1 program is a perfect example of an initiative that improves both the quality and efficiency of services available to the residents of South Carolina. I consider it an honor to have been asked to be a part of this organization.
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	127481		/users/profile/172538	rocksalvage74	Board Member	5	10/20/2012	It has been my pleasure to get to know the employees of the United Way Association of SouthCarolina. I've spent a career observing and interacting with organizations of all types. Rarely have I met people who are so committed to doing good things for the right reasons, like those of the UWASC.  Every program and service is planned and acted upon in the most professional manner; and every person has an attitude and approach that clearly comes from the heart. Our community is fortunate to have this organization serving us.
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	127472		/users/profile/172531	Moss B.	Volunteer	5	10/20/2012	The UWASC has helped countless numbers of citizens in SC thorugh its management of the the 211 system--a call system that provides critical human service information to the public.  It is a leader in advocating for children and providces a support structure for critical programs like A,ericorp.  The UWASC, with its statewide reach is able to help connect and support programs that would be out of the reach of individual United Ways.  The networking and support of the UWASC guranetees that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and that is essential in South Carolina, a State with significant social, economic and health issues.  Perhaps the best way to consider its value is to imagine what the State and the inidivbual United Ways would be like without it.  It would have to be invented.  
United Way Association of South Carolina Inc	125621		/users/profile/170849	SWH1401	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	The UWASC provides leadership for local UWs across SC. This organization identifies needs of local UWs, and provides a cost-effective way of providing for that need. The association provides education and training for local UWs, it provides leadership in advocacy for the United Way's major focus areas of health, education, and income. The UWASC provides call center functions for a number of UWs, as well as for certain segments of state government. And, the UWASC acts as the point of coordination for grant funding for Americorps, which is a resource for all of SC.

Bradley and I am the Manager of Research at the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.  I am also a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts Lowell, where I received my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering.  Throughout my professional and academic career I was always reminded that my success is not my own, and that there are many people that invest in me (time, money, wisdom, etc.).  The Angie Kennedy Educational Foundation (AKEF) embodies this very principal as it highlights the investment in our youth in the pursuit of their educational endeavors.   AKEF provides tangible support and allows a community to support its children and the next generation.  I am honored and privileged to be apart of this toundation.

Angie Kennedy Educational Foundation	255154		/users/profile/343525	tinamarshallbradley	Board Member	5	09/06/2015	This organization exemplifies what is right about work done on behalf of young people. The vision of the organization represents the philosophy of Ms. Angie Kennedy who did not have a formal education but instilled in her children and grandchildren the importance of hard work and a good education. The organization also models good practices by not simply raising money for scholarships, but also supporting young people in their post secondary goals through mentorship. Additionally the organization has a significant number of young board members in leadership positions which provides a fresh perspective for work to be done on behalf of young people. I feel as if I have learned the most from my young colleagues whose perspectives are closer to the students who are the recipients of the scholarships we are awarding. I think this has made the work of the board more thoughtful and productive.

Angie Kennedy Educational Foundation	267375		/users/profile/356105	lbullard23	Board Member	5	10/26/2015	The Angie Kennedy Educational Foundation (AKEF) has assisted many students with continuing their higher educational pursuits. The Foundation is among only a few elite charitable organizations that allows 100% of the funds from sponsored scholarships to go directly to scholarship recipient. In addition, the Foundations sponsorship approach is one that can be replicated throughout the entire country. Alumni classes, churches, social clubs, families, and numerous other groups are allowed and encouraged to sponsor scholarships. Because of AKEF many students who might not have been afforded the opportunity to attend college are now attending some of our most respected universities and colleges throughout the country.     Through AKEF, both my wife and I and my high school alumni class were able to sponsor scholarships for students who received 100% of the money we donated. When we met the scholarship recipients at the Foundations annual gala, we knew more than ever that AKEF was touching lives of real students in need, for whom every dollar counts. I am happy to be a part of this organization and proud of what its allowing so many students to achieve.  
Angie Kennedy Educational Foundation	267218		/users/profile/355951	JMurph585	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2015	AKEF is an extremely worthwhile charity serving youth who have limited financial resources to pursue a baccalaureate degree or vocational certification. This is accomplished through the foundation providing these youth with financial assistance.

As a student who has benefited from financial support via scholarships and fellowships in the pursuit of my education, I am excited about working with an organization that provides these same financial opportunities to other students.  My hope is that alleviating financial burdens associated with school will allow scholars to focus on their studies and overall college experience. 
Angie Kennedy Educational Foundation	266926		/users/profile/355688	arebeccalanier	Volunteer	5	10/24/2015	This is not your average scholarship foundation. I have never witnessed an organization with this much compassion and love. Motivated by the wisdom and teachings of Mrs. Angie Kennedy, the woman behind the organization's name, the board members strive to assist as many youths with dreams as possible. AKEF believes that every youth should be given the chance to further his or her educational endeavors,which gives the organization the drive to grow. I love watching the members work.

Many individual lives are helped both spiritually and medically through the help of volunteer doctors, nurses and clerical volunteers.

I have found in my years of voluteering a wonderful avenue for growing in the opportunity to love my neighbor as myself.  The best part of the clinic is that every patient and potential patient is treated not just with the dignity of being a human being, but with the care and concern of being a neighbor.

The clinic is based on Christian service to the community and anyone who qualifies for health care that they cannot afford, the Clinic is there for them.  It is for those who are uninsured, no Medicaid/Medicare and are either working or trying to find work.  It has been a blessing for this county.  We are proud of all the doctors and nurses who give of their time to provide the health care needed.  Also, the medicines are free if they are available.  If not, then the Clinic volunteers  help find the drug companies who will provide the more expensive drugs.  I cannot say enough about what this means to our community.

United Way of Pickens County	267366		/users/profile/356096	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/26/2015	I was an intern at the United Way of Pickens County this past summer, from May - August 2015. My experience at this United Way was second to none, and opened my eyes to all of the wonderful things this small but mighty staff does within the community. I saw firsthand, the dedication and passion the staff has in their mission and work. This is not just a 9-5 job for them, but a way to make a significant change. In the 3 short months I was able to help, the United Way of Pickens County funded a revolutionary summer learning-loss camp with the partnership of the YMCA and school system. They raised over 1,000 books in a book drive, met their goal of raising almost 1 million dollars, initiated the first  women's leadership council and coordinated with it's founding members, among many, many other things. My internship at the United Way of Pickens County was one of the most positive experiences throughout my college career, and has made me want to pursue a job that makes a difference, and gets me excited to wake up in the morning. As Julie Capaldi, the president, said to me that stuck with me "you should run to work, and walk home."

Carolina Wildlife Care, Inc.	110369	1	/users/profile/150248	Paws MAC	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/20/2012	I run Paws Animal Wildlife Sanctuary in Upstate South Carolina and work with Carolina Wildlife Care on a regular basis.  I've been 'behind the scenes' in the facility and have had animals transferred to me from their care.  (We each have areas of expertise and will send animals to each other as necessary to make sure each animal gets the best possible care.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I have nothing but the highest regard for CWC.  Their care is exemplary, the staff and volunteers are professional, kind and caring.  They will go the extra mile (sometimes literally) for each animal.  I am amazed by how well they are able to care for each individual animal when they have so many in their care.  They have a protocol for every situation so their people know just what to do and how to get the information they need when they need it.  They have the right people in each position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I am proud to work with them and never hesitate to refer the public to them in situations where this would get the animal in for care faster than trying to get them to our facility.

When I found out that the dock was about to be rebuilt, I called those in charge, asking that the work be delayed until the chicks had safely fledged.  When they were unresponsive, I got in touch with Joanna at Carolina Wildlife Care.  She made several telephone calls and convinced the community association to delay the work--saving the lives of all the chicks. Today, the rebuilt dock has a thriving community of barn swallows, thanks to the great work of Carolina Wildlife Care.

CWC is an excellent organization which contributes to the well-being of our society as a whole.  There are few organizations which take such good care  of God's wild creatures.  I am so grateful CWC is here to look out for them.  CWC works miracles.  They have cared for any number of furry and feathered creatures and a few scaly ones. They also work with other organizations to place animals that are unable to be returned to the wild.  Local Vets volunteer to help,  my daughter-in-law (a Vet Tech) and my grandchildren have worked as volunteers.  There has never been a hint of scandal about this organization.  I can't imagine how they are able to accomplish what they do on with the funds they have.   Carolina Wildlife Care should receive any number of awards for their caring, compassion, and service.

I can't say enough about the high regard in which I hold this organization.  I will continue to support them in any way I can!  Sincerely, Carol Hand

Jackson has Autism and communication has always been a weakness for him.  Seeing my son interact with "Charlie" as well as Dee (his instructor) and the volunteers has been an amazing experience. He has a connection with these horses and these people that I don't see very often, and I am so thankful for all they have done for my son. His language is exploding, his core strength and balance are improving, and he even has a special song he sings to "his" horse at the beginning and end of each session, and that in and of itself is fantastic since he can speak very little. My heart felt love and appreciation goes out to everyone at CATR for all that they give, and all that they do.

Charleston Area Therapeutic Riding Inc	92518		/users/profile/106159	ansausser	Client Served	5	06/28/2011	I am a retired principal. I was able to receive therapeutic riding for my TMD students. I can tell a story of a miracle. One of my students could not sit up nor did she seem to react to any stimulus. The class went to their scheduled riding day and this student went for the first time. (some thought it would be pointless) . Teacher and I insisted that she go.  She was placed on a horse, She sat up and then began stroking the horse's neck. This was the beginning of her new life.
Charleston Area Therapeutic Riding Inc	91723		/users/profile/105029	kajsa99	Volunteer	5	06/22/2011	Charleston Area Therapeutic Riding has been instrumental in helping me steer my career in a new direction. When I moved South to Charleston about 3 years ago, I had quit my position in business world, and was on a mission to find a more meaningful occupation, ideally one which would allow me to positively impact the lives of others. I contacted CATR researching volunteer, or possible employment opportunities, and have been volunteering at CATR ever since. The staff is professional, courteous, creative and everyone goes the extra mile to accommodate the riders, volunteers and to make sure the horses are taken care of well. Through my volunteer work at CATR, and having made friends with several staff members who offered a wealth of advice, experience and ideas, I was inspired to explore the field of occupational therapy as a possible career choice. Seeing the riding instructors at CATR interact with the students, being able to help with the lessons, and part-taking in the sense of accomplishment and pride reflected on the riders' faces astride the horses have truly been a life-changing opportunity that this organization has afforded me. I am now enrolled at the Medical University of South Carolina in my second year of OT school. Thanks, CATR!

Charleston Area Therapeutic Riding Inc	91458		/users/profile/104641	ashleymarie	Volunteer	4	06/21/2011	I have only been working with this organization for a little over a year, but I can certainly vouch for the fact that this program has a significant impact in peoples lives. I found CATR on volunteermatch.com & became intrigued after viewing their website. The volunteer coordinator, Dee, is an extremely sweet lady who helped me through the qualification process. My first day volunteering was with Dee & another woman who works at CATR. Both were friendly, knowledgeable, & overall very helpful in making me feel comfortable & letting me know exactly how things work at their facility, what lessons entail, etc.  I have worked with several children in my short time with this organization. Although they had different life experiences (several were Autistic, one had Cerebral Palsy, etc.), I can tell that their time spent with CATR is not only enjoyable for them, but beneficial as well. It brings me great joy to watch them ride around the area, practice trotting, etc. They get the biggest smiles on their faces!! :)  I find it nothing short of amazing how much this program can advance children with disabilities. It is very interesting to me that riding lessons can assist with so many different factors in a persons life- social interaction, emotional behavior, independence, etc. One child I have worked with used to be extremely timid & scared to even touch a horse- now he rides with a smile on his face! I am proud to be a volunteer at CATR & cant wait to see what the future holds for this organization.

Charleston Area Therapeutic Riding Inc	90109		/users/profile/102695	Happy	Client Served	5	06/09/2011	As an adult student taking lessons through the Community Lessons program at CATR, I have witnessed some of the beautiful work they do with our area schools and children. CATR farms management and staff have created an environment that hums with care, happiness, warmth and good intentions combined with skilled instruction. My lessons often coincide with the Therapeutic lessons and it has been a true pleasure witnessing the joy of the children playing and riding on the farm.  I believe that this is a valuable resource to our community in that it offers a unique environment in which to heal. This doesn't just apply to the Therapeutic Riding students, but to anyone taking lessons at CATR! In my personal experience as a student at CATR, I have been able to diminish symptoms of my own in my struggle with PTSD. I have found that grooming the horses of CATR and riding once a week has greatly reduced the anxiety that comes along with dealing with traumatic experiences. I have been riding at other barns and I can attest to the fact that CATR's healing environment is not only unique, but also worthy of community support of any kind (donations, volunteers, lessons).
Charleston Area Therapeutic Riding Inc	89770		/users/profile/102238	Kelly R.	General Member of the Public	5	06/07/2011	I learned about CATR Farms when I was looking for Non-profits in need of volunteers.  I learned that my schedule just does not fit with their schedule of classes so volunteering has not been possible.  However, they have several other ways to help support their efforts; the one I am most active with is the community lessons.  Our tuition helps support the barn financially and as we all know every penny helps when it comes to non-profits.   While spending the last several months at the barn every Friday, I learned and witnessed what a special group of people run and teach at this barn.  In addition to the horses;  a mule, several cats, and a few dogs are roaming the grounds.  It is clear how much these animals are treasured by all students, barn hands, teachers, etc.  As for the whole purpose of CATR, the therapeutic riding, I cannot think of an environment so welcoming and accepting of ALL people.  I had the pleasure of witnessing a young man make a huge step forward in his therapy by actually putting his leg over the horses back and eventually sitting for a few minutes.  I was told by my trainer that when he first came to CATR, the therapists could not get him to even touch the horse.  How AMAZING!!!!!  During my volunteer training, I learned some of the success stories from CATR's therapeutic riding program which included students with speech issues learning to use their voices, student with touch issues learning that being touched is not a terrible thing, and students with various different physical disabilities developing their strength to various different levels.   The dedication of the team at CATR is unsurpassed and I am honored to have had the opportunity to meet these wonderful people and to be able to help support such a fantastic service.
Warrior Thunder Foundation	298089		/users/profile/388926	Jason124	Volunteer	4	07/26/2016	Hello, my name is Jason and I'm a recently retired Veteran of 23 years, serving in both the USMC and U.S Army.  Since returning from Afghanistan in 2012, I have started to really open my eyes to a major problem occurring in my world and that is suicide.  This past 3 years I have lost 4 brothers in their fight with PTSD/Depression, and every time I reflect on it I ask myself the same question: could I have done more to help.  The fact is you can be there for them only so much, eventually they are going to make the decision to either finish the job or seek help and that's where Warrior Thunder Foundation comes in.  They provide the resources for that veteran to find the help they are looking for as well as providing other wonderful benefits as well.  Fund raising, clothing for the less fortunate, education relief, and sponsorship. After my tour in the "Stan", I went looking for ways to keep my edge and found Obstacle Course Racing.  I immediately got hooked.  Last year I participated in the grueling 24 hour event of Worlds Toughest Mudder. I completed the event but didn't do as well as I wanted to.  This year I wanted another shot of reaching my 50 mile goal and Warrior Thunder Foundation gave me that shot by sponsoring my registration and training.  With their help and support and my experience from last year I feel that my goal is well within reach!!!  Thank you Darren and your outstanding staff for all your help with me and most of all my fellow veterans!!

Warrior Thunder Foundation	263598	1	/users/profile/352299	Writer	Client Served	4	10/13/2015	Outstanding Organization!!! Retired after 20 years of service and was diagnosed with PTSD.  I looked into purchasing a service dog to help me deal with my new life and condition but the cost was just to high for me to take on at this point in my life so the service dog trainer said I could contact the Warrior Thunder Foundation to see if they would be able to assist me, as they assisted another local veteran with obtaining a service dog in the past.  I am so grateful to have been given their information.  The Warrior Thunder Foundation got back to me right away and before you know it, they decided to sponsor my Service Dog Viper for me!! He his already helping me to cope in so many ways.  Can't thank you enough for the difference you have made in my life Warrior Thunder Foundation!! From a grateful veteran.

I can't say enough good things about this organization,  and every penny that they collect in donations is passed along to veterans/family that are struggling. As an former employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Warrior Thunder exceeds in their commitment to improving the quality of life for the veteran and his family, they keep their promise. There are many foundations that have "we help veterans" stamped all over their mission statement, but very few actually do. Warrior Thunder stands alone in its continued and adament commitment to stay true to who they are. Thank you SGM Bean and the volunteers at Warrior Thunder, for all that you do. Be blessed. .. Sincerely, Jean, Thomas,  and Samantha

We had applied to other organizations and no one seemed to be able to help and Warrior Thunder Foundation was there and did not hesitate to help out a veteran in need. My husband and I hate to ask for help, but at the time we had no other choice. We would definitely recommend them to other veterans in need. Thank you for being there when we needed it most! If it wasn't for you we would have probably lost our only vehicle to get my husband back and forth to his VA appointments and you saved us. Thank you very much!

This foundation took action when other so called organizations who claimed they help veterans and there families in need seemed disinterested. I would and have talked to many veterans of this foundation and told them not to hesitate to seek help if needed and they make it easy with their prompt response. I had no idea and was very hesitant to ask for help but the Warrior Thunder Foundation made it easy and made me feel welcome and they were happy to help which not to be dramatic but helped save us from possible home loss and many other bills that were in danger of causing us to live in the dark and lose our only vehicle. This organization is and was a gift to my family and I and I always will be grateful for the assistance they rendered.   Thomas R. Cavanaugh  U.S. Army Veteran

They went far beyond simply helping us refinance our house (fee free no add ons to our current mortgage NO fees) ON top of that they got us in touch with organizations that could help my ailing father to receive other benefits while he was waiting on the VA to approve his claim (he was a 30 year veteran but was too proud to claim his disabilities and they were extensive) They kept in close contact with us helping us to find the resources we needed. They were in our corner at all times and always kind and considerate. They have called to check up on us since to make sure we are doing ok and see if there is anything we need. I cannot imagine someone having a negative experience with this organization..I am sure it is a matter of perspective though,  but from where I stand this is a truly caring outfit!

Danny & Ron's Rescue	150099	2	/users/profile/200133	Myrna W.	Client Served	5	02/26/2013	Our story is simple.  We were desperately lonely after the loss of our beloved "Bear" a Schipperke.  We finally decided it was time to seek another companion.  I called around and was referred to Danny and Ron.  I talked to Ron and asked if we could come that very day to look at adoptable dogs, and in a few minutes we were on our way to their home in SC.  We were amazed at the number of adoptable dogs they had, and at the friendliness of the dogs.  They were obviously well caared for and loved.  We looked  at several when my husband saw a little brown one outside.  The caretaker there brought her in telling us she had come from Missouri and was somewhat afraid.  I took her and held her and she immediately crawled up my shoulder and proceeded to smother me with puppy kisses.  I handed her to my husband and she did the same thing!  I said I think we have bonded and my husband agreed.  We took  her home that very day. At the time we didn't know what breed she was or much about her.  We learned she was a Chihuahua and her name was Susie Q, which really didn't maatter to us as we knew she was the one!     Needless to say, this little 9 lb. brown girl, full of life and fun,  has mended our broken hearts and filled our lives with joy!  We consider her a  God-gift!  We are thankful to Danny and Ron for bringing us together.  They are personable and care about their clients and their dogs!  Many thanks!  We love Susie so much, and she loves us!

These dogs, after experienced this, changed, and these two guys want to help these animals to be happy. They open their home and give these animals a safe haven, a home too, until they are ready to open their hearts again. Not just do they open their home, but their wallets too. they love these animals so strongly, that they make sure that these fur babies get excellent veterinarian care and the procedures they desperately need.

I have also worked in equine rescue and dog rescue and can tell you that Danny and Ron's Rescue is exceptional in every way!  We adopted a pekingese from Danny and Ron's Rescue in September 2012.  They arranged the transportation from SC to NY and everything went very smoothly!  Our new little dog was exactly as they had described him.....only better!  We loved the experience so much that we adopted our second dog in November 2012 and again....the experience was amazing.  Ron was concerned that we might not understand Kosmo's needs so before we adopted him I had a long conversation with Ron and could hear the compassion and concern in his voice. He didn't want to misrepresent the dog and have it returned and us unhappy.  We are thrilled!  We love Kosmo and because of Ron's conversation we have made adjustments so that Kosmo is happy and healthy.....and our 2 new dogs have their forever homes because of Danny and Ron!  The entire staff is amazing and our only problem is.........we don't have a house big enough to adopt more!

Through dedication and courage they have accomplished a truly unique model for a nonprofit organization.   After attending some of the events, scientific sessions, and organization dinners; I learned that the Doctors and Scientists are also contributors to the Foundation.  This is outstanding!  The Foundation strives on the hard work from the volunteers to the board members to the doctors.  Everyone enjoys being a part of this Foundation because when you are, you know you are in the presence of something great. I can see the importance of this Foundation and the need for such a model.  The small, intimate meetings for doctors and researchers allows them to be more open in discussing their research and I have seen the progress they make as a result of the Forbeck meetings. This is an organization to watch out for because they have grown and developed as a reputable organization internationally and domestically over the past 30 years.

William Guy Forbeck Research Foundation	205063		/users/profile/267154	jki965	Donor	5	07/03/2014	I knew Billy Guy and have known the Forbeck family my entire life.  However, it wasn't until about 12 years ago that I became a supporter of the great work this foundation is doing.  I have participated in the "sponsor a scholar" program and thus have been able to attend  events where these leaders in the field of cancer research present the audience with the collaborative progress they are making.  I do not know of another foundation of this size that has prompted such amazing and continuing results.  I am proud to be linked in even a small way to a nonprofit organization that is truly making a difference in the cancer research community.  The base idea of the retreats that WGFRF hosts is to bring together doctors, scientist and researchers that would not otherwise meet, to brainstorm and share ideas.  It is from this type of joint effort that real progress is being made.  It is because of this formula that I believe WGFRF is a leader in what they strive to achieve and it is why I will continue to be a supporter of this foundation.

Mom's Little Angels, Inc.	236029		/users/profile/319761	Yarissa T.,	Donor	5	12/29/2014	I was looking for a way to give back to my community this Christmas. My kids have everything they need and most of their wants so I wanted to share our blessings with other kids that were not going to have a Christmas. I had my kids help wrap the presents and wait with anticipation for their Christmas morning to see their reaction through pictures. We saw the pictures today and my boys were very happy to see that they made other kids smile. They learned the valuable lesson that it's better to give than to receive. I'm thankful for this opportunity that Mom's Little Angels gave us to make this world a better place one kid (or two) at a time. This is a great non-profit!

Beign a mother of 5 gets hard at times with making sure the kids have everything they need for school. My kids were apart of the backpack program this year and it was awesome.

Families who need assistance at Christmas and during back to school time can be helped by this wonderful program. As a donor I am confident that 100% of funds donated go directly for these children.

Greer Relief & Resources Agency	253267	1	/users/profile/341426	GeneBrooks	Volunteer	5	08/18/2015	I have worked as a full-time volunteer for Greer Relief, and I have had daily interaction with clients and behind the scenes with staff and handling donors and donations which come in. I see have seen it all. Greer Relief is the real deal. They really want to help their community, and they work to do it to the best of their ability. I have seen the frustration of the staff with having to turn away needy people because the funds have run out. This is a worthy ministry to help people in the Greater Greer area.

Greer Relief & Resources Agency	129731	2	/users/profile/175135	Bellebuoy	Board Member	5	10/26/2012	Serving on the Board for the Greer Relief Agency has been a wonderful experience.  We help those who unexpectedly fall on hard times financially.  That could be any of us!  That's why this agency is so important.  We have several fundraiser a from a Kansas City Sanctioned BBQ competition, to a Golf for Relief event, and a St. Patrick's Day Dance.  Their entire community comes out for these events to help us raise the money desperately needed to help our clients.  We have a food pantry that we work to keep stocked with outreach t our schools, businesses, churches, the Food Postal Drive, and volunteers.  We never turn anyone away when their need is food.  We have a wonderful Christmas project, too.  People in our community adopt a families and then supply these families with Christmas gifts they otherwise would not have.  I love seeing the smiles on the kids' faces when they come on "Pick-up"  day to get their gifts.  These are just a few of the gifts and services we provide to our clients.  The most important is the emergency financial aid in rent, mortgage, and utilities.  Without our assistance, many families would otherwise have no heat, food, or shelter.  Greer Relief is a blessing to our community for sure.  Lynne Grout
Greer Relief & Resources Agency	129631	2	/users/profile/175009	Scott39	Board Member	5	10/26/2012	I am on the board for Greer Relief and have been involved with the Sooie't Relief KCBS BBQ event for the past couple of years. All of the proceeds above cost go to help the clients of Greer Relief. The unusual thing about this event is that the not for profit runs the event! Many events benefit a not for profit but they are not hands on and explaining the good work that is done in the community to the attendees. I think this really makes us stand apart, it is a great feeling to speak with an event attendee and explain to them all the ways that Greer Relief helps people in the area. We are very lucky to live in such a great community that looks after each other. It is an honor to be part of this legacy (we celebrated our 75th anniversary this year!).
Greer Relief & Resources Agency	129187	2	/users/profile/174549	markgunnells	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2012	I am relatively new to the Greer community, and one of my first experiences here was to attend a fundraiser for Greer Relief.  I learned all about this organization's dedication to the community, and I was greatly impressed.  Greer Relief to me shows that this community truly cares about its own, even those who are perhaps a bit down on their luck.  I feel it is so important for any community to reach out to those in need, and without such organizations a community suffers.  To me, Greer Relief is a vital part of the city.
Greer Relief & Resources Agency	129170	2	/users/profile/174529	yogimeditator	Client Served	5	10/25/2012	Greer Relief is very dear to my heart. I once fell on hard times and went to Greer Relief for assistance. My experience there was very positive and the staff treated me with the utmost kindness and respect. I had never been to such and organization and was a bit nervous and perhaps even a bit embarrassed. However, everyone I met that day made me feel right at home and very much at ease. I was so impressed with the level of service I received at Greer Relief that I made a vow to myself that I would try, in some way, to give back once I got back on my feet. Since then, I've been able to help the Agency with several fundraisers and food drives. Greer Relief's staff and high level of caring for our community inspired me to give back to an organization which helps so many. The Agency's client-base and needs grow year by year and I, for one, am so grateful that our community has Greer Relief to turn to in times of need. Thank you Greer Relief!
Pawleys Island Festival Of Music And Art Inc	71950		/users/profile/78669	tiger	Board Member	5	02/20/2011	I became a Festival board member two years ago. During my tenure I have been extremely impressed with the dedication this group feels toward providing the best possible musical entertainment and visual arts experiences for the people of our community.  Much time is spent to insure that all genres of music are presented and are appropriate for a wide range of ages.   Much effort is given to booking performers who provide community outreach programs.  The cost of tickets reflects a true desire to enable all people who enjoy musical and artistic experiences to participate.  Complimentary tickets are often given to retirement home residents and school children who might not normally be able to attend.  The musical events are located in some ofthe most lovely outdoor natural settings in our community.  Refreshments are always offered for audience enjoyment.  Many of the performers indicate that they want to return because they feelsuch a connection with the audience and appreciate the attention todetails that have been made to insure a successful, stress free performance.  We are very fortunate to have an organization that focuses on such a cultural commitment for our community and strivesto provide nothing short of artistic excellence.
Pawleys Island Festival Of Music And Art Inc	65207		/users/profile/71275	Leo1	Volunteer	4	02/08/2011	Our area is somewhat rural, and the Pawleys Island Festival provides much need cultural and intellectual  entertainment to the populace.The festival has first class entertainers  and events each fall for three weeks, and they are well received and attended by many. Some eventssell out well in advance, so tickets are usually at a premium.Ticket prices are reasonable, so the event must rely on Donors andsponsors to help defray costs.   Administrative costs are held lowby volunteers who keep  the books and organize the events.Most in the Pawleys Island and Litchfield area look forward to the events every year, and repeat customers  are a main source ofsupport.  One of the great non-profits in our area!
Pawleys Island Festival Of Music And Art Inc	65144		/users/profile/71206	johnleeoak	Donor	3	02/08/2011	Everthing was first class except the music that was offered.  We say that it was awful.  Just look at the attendance numbers  We sat at every performance and it was evident that the venue is not what people want.  Including ourselves.   Best part of the event was on Saturday with the Kids revue.

One year exceeds the prior - with excitement and anticipation growing more year after year.  for each year's performances.

As a volunteer directing traffic to the close-in parking, I was able to hear much of the music. As usual there was a broad range of genres, from classical guitar to blues and  the quality was  first class throughout. One of the unusual features that I personally took part in was the offer of free valet parking. Elderly and handicapped person were able to step out of their cars and walk no more than 10 yards to the entrance. It is a genuine pleasure to serve as a volunteer at the Pawleys Island Festival.  The meticulous planning and artistic selections, year after year, have made this festival a major cutural attraction in the Low Country.

I do it because I have enjoyed it and I believe it is one of the best venues for the money in the SE. The people who manage it are professional and the same volunteers consistantly participate year in and year out...adding to the seemingly seemless operation. The performances/performers have also been the top of their field...such performances/performers would otherwise never be seen in this area.\First Class! John E Kaneday
Saint Frances Animal Center	198556	1	/users/profile/259074	JulieST67	Volunteer	1	04/22/2014	I was so disappointed in this shelter. It was filthy, the staff was very rude and inconsiderate. They claim to be a no kill but while I was walking dogs I overheard the staff picking out animals to euthanize. I felt ill and will NEVER volunteer for this nasty shelter again. They make you feel out of place and as if you are a burden because you want to volunteer with the animals. They have a facade of the front being lovely and fake caring but as soon as you enter the back it all changes. Super disappointing and disturbing.

Saint Frances Animal Center	179972		/users/profile/236619	Ruth38	Donor	5	10/19/2013	The staff at Saint Frances Animal Center are in one word:  AWESOME!  I have observed them hard at work during the many visits I have made to the Center.  Wendy Goude is perfect for her position as Director.  She has been invaluable to me by helping me through the grief I still experience from the loss of my little buddy Killer, a Pekapoo.  He was with me daily for 17 years and was totally loyal.  He let me know it was time to let him go and the great folks at the vet's office helped him achieve the ability to be free.  It's been 18 months but I'm still not over this loss.  I'm not ready to adopt -- I've been to the Center several times but my heart is just not in it.  Wendy has shown me how to be a help to not to just one furry friend, but to a lot of furry friends.  We have tried to take the funds we would have spent on Killer and sent it to the Center.  With these small donations I feel like I have made difference.  Her support and love for me is above and beyond the call of duty.  It is evident that she loves her job, her responsibilities and the people who love pets.  I can recommend this extraordinary Nonprofit with no reservations.

I wanted to give back to them for helping my kittens when they were alone and abandoned and needed help. I brought them a donation last December and they were very appreciative. They gave me a tour and made me feel like a part of the SFAC family. Because of this, I have been continuing to donate to them and help them with their mission to help all of the wonderful animals in need! The people at this shelter go above and beyond to help these animals and I tell everyone about how great this shelter is! Thank you for all you do!

As a new foster parent, I needed some guidance along the way. They have been more than helpful with any questions or concerns I've had.  Now I seem to be an adopter and again, they are helping me with the best care and any needs I have prior to adopting.  In comparison to other Humane Societies, just walking in the door is a pleasant experience.  With all the fur babies they take in, it's hard to leave without one in your arms.  Adopt, Foster, Volunteer....you'll be glad you did!

Harvest Hope using their ability to buy in bulk to help the smaller rural food banks buy more food for their dollar.  Harvest Hope even delivers to the smaller food banks.

Harvest Hope Food Bank	74432		/users/profile/81325	Ron Hollis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/24/2011	Harvest Hope has fed so many people that I know and speak to on a daily basis -- from all walks of life.  They provide emergency, high-quality food and there's just nothing else like it around.   When I was a kid and my mom needed emergency food, we were given very little help, with little or no variety.  While we were thankful for what we did get, I can't help but see the great contrast between what Harvest Hope gives out and what other organizations give out. My barber recently needed their assistance and he was so impressed with the service and the integrity of the personnel that he told everyone in the barber shop how special this organization is.  Everyone present agreed with his sentiment.  This is just one of many, many examples of satisfied clients that I run into in our community everday. God bless Harvest Hope! :)
Palmetto Medical Initiative	135517		/users/profile/181389	Chris95	Volunteer	5	11/08/2012	Palmetto Medical Initiative is an amazing organization. I volunteered in May of 2012 to Uganda and will be on the December 2012 trip to Nicaragua. This is by far one of the best medical non-profits in the world. They are a talented group of individuals teamed with expert leadership and the skills necessary to change the world. Their sustainable model is a very successful and unique one that you do not see in other organizations. If you want you life to be changed, volunteer with PMI. I dare you.

Palmetto Medical Initiative has created a model for sustainable healthcare in developing countries and it is working! The vision from its founders and the passion of its supporters has made this nonprofit stand out, and now other projects around the world want to know how they are doing it. I volunteered with this organization on a one week trip to Uganda while I was in nursing school to gain some more nursing practice and because I like to travel. I came back from that trip with so much more than some new nursing skills. It changed my entire perspective on life. This organization is providing hope, its drastically improving the communities it enters into around the world, and its changing the lives of everyone who gets involved. I can't wait to see what their future holds!

They have successfully built high-quality, self-sustaining, local-run medical clinics, even a labor and delivery ward, in Uganda.  They are now starting to build 5 similar clinics in Nicaragua, then expanding to other countries as resources permit. They are host 8 medical teams each year to provide high-level specialty medical and surgical care, and support and train the local physicians. To go on one of their trips, is a certain life-changing experience, challenging us all to lead a life of real significance.  
Palmetto Medical Initiative	43034	5	/users/profile/43798	vernon1	Volunteer	5	06/04/2010	I went to Uganda as well with PMI.  This organization is run by the most talented and capable group of young people that I have ever worked with.  They offer SO much more than any other medical mission out there, and they will be successful.  The trips are open to any and everyone and I HIGHLY recommend going.
Palmetto Medical Initiative	25106	6	/users/profile/26112	jj	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/01/2010	I have traveled to Africa (Uganda) with this group to participate in a medical mission trip, and it was simply outstanding.  I highly recommend checking out this group if you are interested in foreign medical missions, tropical disease, international hospital administration, Africa, medical education, or just a great cause to get involved with.
Childrens Museum of the Upstate Inc	250714		/users/profile/338602	mcconm1981	General Member of the Public	5	07/30/2015	This is the best children's museum we have ever visited and we are so fortunate it's right in our own town!  My children and I visit the museum frequently and during the cooler months we go almost every week. They never get tired of it even though we have been multiple times. They have their favorite exhibits, but usually visit them all for at least a short time while we are there. We love when a new exhibit arrives, some of our favorites are Imagination Playground and The Great Outdoors.  We have a yearly pass and this is great because we can sometimes pop in for an hour or 2 and sometimes we stay the whole day. Just depends on how much time we have that day. My kids are happy to do either. We are very grateful that we have this fabulous museum practically right in our own backyard. 
Childrens Museum of the Upstate Inc	249479		/users/profile/337300	Wilfredo	General Member of the Public	5	07/23/2015	Last Saturday I visited TCMU, it was not my first time there as I had toured the facility several times and covered several events for Latino Newspaper. This time I was there as a gran'pa! I took two of my grandchildren to visit, Yaleska (10) and Angie (9). Oh boy! It was a spectacular experience for all, the children, my two daughters and MYSELF! Yaleska wrote an article, which I published in this week's issue of Latino Newspaper (www.latino4u.net) as follows: "El sbado 18 de julio abuelo me llev a m y a mi prima al Museo del Nio en Greenville. Nosotras estbamos muy felices, jugamos en el supermercado a ser cajeras y hacer compra. Despus a jugar Legos y armar casitas y carritos. Despus nos fuimos a ver la parte de Japn. Tienes que ir es muy cool. All puedes jugar y aprender a la misma vez. Atentamente, Yalezka."

Childrens Museum of the Upstate Inc	235177	1	/users/profile/314475	BethanyWinston	General Member of the Public	5	12/09/2014	My family visits The Children's Museum of the Upstate on a frequent basis, including not just visiting the museum but also attending museum events. I own a website that offers event news and reviews about our area, so we have visited several other museum including science centers and children's museums in nearby cities.  (Note: I do partner with the museum on a business level, but this review is my personal opinion). I'm impressed by the size of TCMU and the variety of exhibits. The museum is well-maintained and kept clean throughout the day. The exhibits are educational but also encourage open free play. Even though we visit frequently, my children are never bored of visiting and always request to go back. The classes and programs that we have attended are also well-run and fun for the kids. We attended a homeschool day that included 5 hands-on science classes for my kids. All the classes were interesting and well-taught. I was really thankful to have this resource as science can be a difficult subject to teach at home. Plus, we enjoyed meeting other families. There is a nursing room and changing tables in the bathroom. It's also really easy to roll a stroller through. My kids are currently 3 and 6.

This organization helped me to keep my cool, create a safe and logical plan to extract my children and provided safe temporary housing after my children were returned to me!  Thank you for knowing who to contact and gettingy kids back!! Thank you!
AJ's Haven	310942	4	/users/profile/402278	Staffthatluvsajs	Board Member	5	10/15/2016	AJ's Haven is an awesome group of people!  They are sympathetic, caring, supporting and will tell the survivor not what they want to hear but what they NEED to hear! AJ's will trust and accept ALL individuals no matter what background. However, if/when you return to your unlawful ways, AJ's Haven has NO problems with reporting the indviduals to law enforcement. What has this caused?  This has caused people  individuals to write "false" experiences and reviews on "Great Non Profits" in an attempt to discredit the organization.What has AJ's Haven done?  AJ's Haven will continue to gather, report and document any and all suspicious activies; including fake "reviews from alledge donors."  The fake poster seems to forget that your identification including computer information has been collected by "Great Non Profits."  Furthermore, Great Non Profits will assist and aid all law enforcement agencies and release the information to said agencies.While someone can post fabricated stories and claims to hurt AJ's Haven, the truth of the matter is that you are proving yourself in being your own worst enemy.  We knew your lies and actions would come out, it was just a matter of time before they did. Once a convicted felon who served 5 years probation for fraud (amoung other things) always a convicted felony.  You've been given the chance to turn from your wicked ways....now repent your sins before the Lord, our God takes his wrap upon you...The Staff of AJ's Haven will hold out and stand strong through whatever storm you through, because the staff is strong enough to bend during during the storm and they have the truth on their side.

AJ's Haven	214669	3	/users/profile/277950	Norma6	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2014	The fact that an individual, who has no legal authority over a child, and whom is very publically using said child's image for personal and monetary benefit, is so outraged that she would post not once, but twice, character attacks against a charity proves that AJ's Haven is doing an excellent job of exposing child abusers and supporting victims of abuse. Saving just 1 child from the toxic environment of mind control and manipulation and just 1 abused parent from the effects of parental alienation makes all the hard work worthwhile. In HIndes v. Hindes, AJ's Haven provided the Court w/ evidence of child and parental abuse w/ images, videos, TV interviews, print interviews and web sites featuring the child and posted publically in order to incite violent rhetoric against the child's mother and the judge, extract money from an unsuspecting public and alienate the child from her mother. The Court ordered those images removed.Thank you, AJ's Haven for all the hard work you do on behalf of abused children and parents!
AJ's Haven	204498	14	/users/profile/266516	Lynn73	General Member of the Public	1	06/28/2014	My only experience with this "charity" is that they are deliberately harassing a military family, the Matthew Hindes case.  In coordination with "Norma Earls" they have begun to unfairly target a man who is serving the country, and the fund that people set up to help him get a stay, while he was held in contempt while on deployment in a submarine.
Crossbridge Family Ministries Inc	85708		/users/profile/95700	sharon oquinn	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2011	CrossBridge Family Ministries is a living, breathing example of being Jesus' hands and feet to those who need Him desperately.  The stories of the families and children that CrossBridge and its loving volunteers have cared for are sweet and inspirational.  Needs are met that are tangible and also go way beyond.  
Crossbridge Family Ministries Inc	85701		/users/profile/95688	rhonda fain	Client Served	5	04/14/2011	We HIGHLY recommend Crossbridge Family Ministries.  They helped my family with housing when our baby was born with a congenital heart defect at MUSC in June 2010 and had to have open heart surgery at 5 days old.  They provided meals, emotional and spiritual support as well as the take the weight off of our shoulders about how we would pay for housing by providing that too.  Our son ended up staying in the hospital for 4 months that time and it would have financially crippled us.  Melissa, Walter and Julie have a special place in my heart for all of their help during this incredibly stressfull time in our lives.Crossbridge helped our family again with housing, meals, and support  in Feb 2011, when our son had his 2nd open heart surgery at MUSC.  He was hospitalized for 7 weeks this time.  The financial burden of housing is lifted off of us with Crossbridge Family Ministries help.  We have nothing but positive feeling towards all of the Crossbridge Volunteers.  Without them our family would have had a major financial hardship.  They are all like family to us and we love them all very much!!  :)The Fain's
Crossbridge Family Ministries Inc	85697		/users/profile/95683	shannon	Client Served	5	04/14/2011	Our daughter was hospitalized off and on for a Congenital Heart Defect.  Watching your child suffer is heart breaking and is emotionally and physically draining.  CrossBridge Ministries was with us every step of the way to offer support in any way that they could.  Whether it was offering to pray with us, bring meals for us or help us financially, they were always there by our side.   When our daughter passed away at 10 months of age, CrossBridge yet again stepped up and helped us.  We didn't know where to go to make arrangements and they connected us with a wonderful man.  On top of arranging everything for us, the funeral home only charged us what it cost them which was minimal.  He also took the blanket that our daughter was wrapped in home and washed it for us.  That touched us so deeply that a perfect stranger would go to the trouble of doing that for us.  He was so genuine and sincere and we are grateful for CrossBridge leading us to him. CrossBridge offered to send us to counseling when we needed it after we lost our baby girl.  It was a tremendous blessing and helped us with the healing process.   CrossBridge has helped us in so many ways and has helped so many of our new hospital friends in so many ways.  From helping purchase centrifuges to spin the fat out of breast milk so that the heart babies can have it, to assisting families that have had to uproot their lives to move to Charleston, they are an amazing group.

Crossbridge Family Ministries Inc	85645		/users/profile/95622	sm1210	Client Served	5	04/14/2011	While visiting Charleston, SC for a quick three day business trip for my wife's company, a dramatic medical emergency sent my wife, in her seventh month of pregnancy, to the Medical University of South Carolina intensive care unit.  Prior to going on this trip, her doctors in New Jersey cleared her for travel, so this emergency was totally unexpected.   Here we were, twelve hours from home, and being told that if all goes well, she would be in the hospital on bed rest until our son was born, minimally 3-5 weeks.  Having packed for three days and with our four year old daughter still in New Jersey, we were overwhelmed. The first person to visit us in the hospital was Melissa Altman, the founder of Cross Bridge Family Ministries.  I am not exactly sure how she found us but I am certainly thrilled that she did.  She provided the calm we needed amongst the chaos.  Cross Bridge helped coordinate and assit financing of accomodations, provided daycare for my daughter who flew down with my mother, and meal tickets to offset the cost of eating at the hospital.   My wife gave birth to a beautiful baby boy after three weeks of bedrest at MUSC.  Cross Bridge was a blessing for our family and we were truely humbled by the experience.  We were so impressed by the people that we met through Cross Bridge that we relocated our family to South Carolina where we currently live. 
Crossbridge Family Ministries Inc	85613		/users/profile/95575	stephhut1	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	Although, I currently live in Tulsa, OK I am originally from Charleston, SC. So, usually I follow CrossBridge Family Ministries from afar, as many do. I have watched in awe and amazement as God blesses all of us so richly through the lives of the Children and the families touched by the LOVE of God through the selfless work of CrossBridge Family Ministries. While I was home in Charleston for Christmas, I was able to work with Melissa and Kathryn to serve God's people. I was so blessed. I have a greater understanding of Gods character from my very first opportunity to physically be a part of CrossBridge Family Ministries and serve Gods people while working with these powerful women of God. As a busy hospital buzzed along, I saw miracles happen before me. That was amazing and so exciting. I wanted to shout Stop, look, wait, you are missing this miracle!! But, if you are looking for Gods glory, miracles, signs, and wonders, you need only be still because they are happening right now. As we visited patients and met the families of CrossBridge, Proverbs 3:5 kept coming to mind. Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding. As I looked that Scripture up today to quote it correctly in this post, I was AMAZED at what I saw!! Proverbs 3:5-10 (New King James Version) 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. 7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil. 8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones. 9 Honor the LORD with your possessions, And with the first fruits of all your increase; 10 So your barns will be filled with plenty, And your vats will overflow with new wine. In that scripture God speaks loudly to me. It is time for me to make an offering. Thank you Melissa and Kathryn for this opportunity to be so blessed.

Client Served	5	04/13/2011	Our daughter was born in June 2009 with a complex congenital heart defect and a rare genetic disorder.  She has had two open heart surgeries so far, along with several minor surgeries, heart catheterizations and other procedures. Cross Bridge Family Ministries has provided for our family each and every time we have had to travel more than 4 hours from our home to the hospital that is equipped to deal with our daughter's medical needs.  We have been provided with lodging - for weeks at a time! - with no questions asked.  We have also been provided meals during our stays away from home. The most important benefit of Cross Bridge, however, is the personal interest that each of the members takes in the families they serve.  We frequently receive emails, phone calls or facebook messages to check up on our family and to see how our daughter is doing.  And without fail, each time we are reminded that the members of Cross Bridge loves and cares about our family.  That makes all the difference in the world to those who are walking through a medical crisis.  Thank you, Cross Bridge!

They provide a safe living environment for these raptors that are blind or permanently injured and socialize them for use in these great educational programs.

Faith Vision Ministry Inc	170580	2	/users/profile/151033	Mari D.	Board Member	5	09/19/2013	Faith Vision Ministry Inc pastors and staff open the doors of the church (called The Refuge) twice on Sunday, again on Wednesday evening, Friday evening and once a month for a free movie.  They have outreach programs for delivering free clothing, household items and fresh food from their community garden.  These items are given with no requirement of proof of a persons need.  There is also a program called NAVAJO H2O that delivers these same services to the Navajo, Apache, and Hopi tribes on the reservation in New Mexico.  They also have been working to get water to the outlying areas of the reservation.  Recently they have been successful in these efforts.  This summer they saw one well restored and are actively searching for locations for other wells to be drilled or restored.  They hold fundraisers to help defray expense to carry the clothing to the reservation.  Travel is in the pastors personal SUV since the church doesn't own a vehicle.  Each individual pays the majority or all of their own travel expense, depending on the success of the fundraisers.

In Lexington, SC a facet of this ministry is called The Refuge, a non-denominational church that provides a safe fun place for young people on Friday nights and free food for the community. They also have community gardens for free healthy food, and they do outreach in the community such as "like new" clothing distributions.THere are many other things I havent listed, but they are very helpful.

I only post it to remind you and your supporters that greed is everywhere and needs to be reigned in.ITS THEIR WAY OR NO HIGHWAYIn Horry County South Carolina we are blessed with many things that make life well worth living.  A beautiful Ocean, now protected from the threat of Off Shore Oil Drilling, Wonderful Weather, Great Friends and Neighbors, Low Taxes, and plenty of Natural Beauty.However there is one aspect of life in this area that deeply troubles many of us, the incessant rantings and disruption of a foreign organization that has no offices, employees, board members, or interest in Horry County (other than telling us how to conduct our business).The Charleston based Coastal Conservation League, with offices in Georgetown and Beaufort has taken it upon itself to disrupt our lives by demanding Its Their Way or No Highway.Our County Riding on a Penny I & II programs have been threatened and delayed by the CCLs nit picking, which has cost Horry Taxpayers over 20 million dollars in Redesign, Construction Cost Delay Increases and Legal Fees.  Horry residents are currently being asked to suggest new projects and approve a Riding on a Penny III program, which will most likely find several objections coming from the CCL.This organization of obstructionists, along with their legal arm the SC Environmental Law Project has so far hindered construction of Routes 31 South, the expansion of 707, and the paving of International Drive from Carolina Forrest to Route 90 among others.  The CCL & SCELP also have their greedy eyes on Improvements to the Buckport Marina, owned our Water & Sewer Company (Grand Strand), the I-73 project from Interstate 95 to Myrtle Beach, the northern extension of 31 to the North Carolina border and who knows how many other transportation improvements needed to make our roads safer and travel more efficient.The worst part of the whole situation is that these obstructionists pay no state taxes, yet make frequent use of our state taxpayer funded Court System to hold up much needed projects.  They act like spoiled children if their ridiculous demands, including tribute in the form of mitigation demands are not met.The CCL & SCELP can easily and inexpensively file with the Courts if they feel slighted, and have done so many times.  Its time on a State and National level that Legislation be proposed and enacted making these organizations pay a fair share of the costs to taxpayers when these often bogus lawsuits are filed.Enough is Enough!Scott Dilliard lives in a community 1 mile north on Route 90 from the proposed Rt. 90 entrance to International Drive, which has been held up for 8 years due to other Ride 2 Project delays and for the past 2 years by obstruction from the Coastal Conservation League & now the South Carolina Environmental Law Project

As a young non-profit, we are extremely proud of the breadth and depth of our programmatic work, which is rooted in data gathered in our Water Quality Monitoring and Patrol Programs and extends to our educational and outreach initiatives.  A member of the international Waterkeeper Alliance organization, we are dedicated to protecting and preserving Charleston's waterways, and to promoting the public's right to clean water.  
Charleston Waterkeeper	236498	1	/users/profile/320423	seagull843	Donor	4	01/07/2015	True supporters see the impact and quality of people working tirelessly behind the scene and on the water to attain the mission of protecting and promoting the public's right to swimmable, fishable, and drinkable water.  The organization was filing all donations under the national Waterkeeper Alliance section 501(c)(3).  They corrected the organizations filing in early 2014 and retro dated their tax exempt status back to 2011.  Below are the 4 functioning programs they have put in place and operate successfully to protect the public's right clean water.  Without passionate, water enthusiasts and loyal supporters they would not be able to protect Charleston waterways.   1-The Recreational Water Quality Monitoring Program regularly tests the swimmability of several local tidal creeks and hotspots for activities like swimming, SUPing, and sailing.  From May through October, samples are collected weekly and analyzed for the amount of Enterococcus bacteria present. Testing results are published as soon as they are available, so you can make an informed decision about when and where you  swim, SUP, kayak, and sail.  Follow them on facebook, instagram or twitter to get same day results. All data is collected and generated under a DHEC approved Quality Assurance Project Plan.  Samples are analyzed at the College of Charlestons Department of Geology and Environmental Geosciencess Hydrochemistry Research Laboratory which is certified by DHEC to test for Enterococcus bacteria.   2-Charleston Waterkeeper just had the 1yr anniversary of their Pumpout Program.  To offer a mobile pumpout service in the lower Charleston Harbor.  The pumpout boat, the Number 2, will come to your slip or location at anchorage and pump out your onboard sanitary waste holding tank.  The Mobile Pumpout Program provides boaters with a free, convenient, and legal way to dispose of sewage from sanitary waste tanks.  As of January 1, 2015 the Number 2 has pumped 12,500 gallons of waste water from private boats. 3-Charleston Waterkeepers Patrol Program is the on-the-water eyes and ears of the Ashley/Cooper River Basin.  Once per month the Lady C and program staff patrol an area of interest in the watershed and conduct a visual survey of water quality and habitat conditions.  Areas of interest are identified through local knowledge, research, satellite photography, and our Recreational Water Quality Monitoring, Permit Watchdog, and Mobile Pumpout Programs.  To alert Charleston Waterkeeper to a potential area of interest please contact them via email or call (843) 670-3390. Any problems encountered during a patrol are documented and reported to the appropriate authority such as the United States Coast Guard, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, or the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.  After each patrol they publish a blog post with photos of what they found in the field.   4-Permit Watchdog Program monitors the issuance permits and the compliance history of permit holders in the Charleston Harbor Watershed.  Twice per year the program selects a group of permit holders and conducts and in-depth examination of their permit and monitoring data.  When issues are discovered they reach out to the permit holder.  Then they work to ensure the problem has been identified and fixed and that a plan exists to prevent reoccurrence.  If the permit holder, DHEC, and EPA wont act to ensure compliance with permit limits, the Clean Water Act authorizes Charleston Waterkeeper to enforce the permit in court. The Permit Watchdog Program also regularly researches, drafts, and submits public comment letters to DHEC and the Army Corps of Engineers during the permit development and drafting process. By participating in the public comment process Charleston Waterkeeper works to improve the quality of the permits issued in our watershed.
Charleston Waterkeeper	159873	5	/users/profile/212054	kenbonerigo	General Member of the Public	1	06/06/2013	As one of the original supporters of Charleston Waterkeeper who attended the meetings that led to their eventual affiliation with the Waterkeeper Alliance I have followed the organizations progress closely. Although promising at first after several years of projects not followed up on, projects that never came to fruition or  results of "testing" that are not published the lack of progress has been discouraging. The Charleston Waterkeeper has been prodigious at fund raising though, Just not with results that effect water quality.  After investigating further it was with dismay that I discovered they have had their IRS 501c3 status revoked for non filing...ever! Though the founded date on Guidstar says 2011 the Charleston Waterkeeper was formed in 2008 with zero filings. Repeated requests for financial transparency and disclosure to supporters and donors have gone unanswered though fundraising has continued. The BOD is packed with real estate and business interests despite the fact that at least one scientist, that I personally know of, with a long distinguished career dedicated to local and statewide water quality testing was asked by Charleston Waterkeeper and volunteered to serve on the BOD yet was never seated. 
Equine Rescue of Aiken	290094		/users/profile/380370	hayesmel	General Member of the Public	5	05/16/2016	I was fortunate enough to tour the Equine Rescue of Aiken, South Carolina on March 28, 2016, and found it to be an amazing place. The property is absolutely gorgeous with pastures of rolling hills with plenty of space for the horses to roam. A team of volunteers keeps the stables and paddocks clean, the horses well-fed, and the grounds immaculate. The horses are clearly loved and well cared for---if I were a horse, I'd want to live there! There was even a blind horse living at the Rescue, who was accommodated with a companion horse to assist him. This is a wonderful organization with an important mission.
Equine Rescue of Aiken	289120		/users/profile/379337	b.ellis	Volunteer	5	05/09/2016	I moved to the Augusta/Aiken area and was looking for a way to get more involved with horses even though I was relatively inexperienced. I am so glad that I found the Equine Rescue of Aiken! Many of the volunteers have been there for years and it really is a big family of people who care. From the horses, to the cats, to the dogs, everyone at the Rescue is looked after with the highest attention to detail and compassion. And at no other facility will you get the same opportunity to have hands-on time with the horses you help care for, whether that means grooming, doing ground work, or even being able to ride (if you're qualified).  One of the most rewarding experiences is seeing a troubled horse who has either come from a harsh track/training environment or has experienced a traumatic event or loss of owner find their place and peace at the ERA. A horse that is head-shy, spooks, or just needs some extra attention to address bad habits will be a completely different horse after a week here at the Rescue. On a similar note, I think one of the best programs on site is the Saratoga War Horse Program. The War Horse program provides equine-assisted therapy to veterans that are often brought from thousands of miles away to participate and it is an incredible experience if you have the opportunity to participate as a volunteer.  And because there is so much love for the horses, it is always bittersweet to see one adopted out. But the adoption procedures and application are incredibly thorough and really qualify the adoptee to ensure that every horse goes to an appropriate and suitable home. Taking on the responsibility of an off-the-track thoroughbred is no flippant decision. This ensures that they can transition from a former life on the track to a new job with a new family, which might include trail riding, companionship for both humans and other horses, shows, jumping, you name it! I cannot thank Caroline enough for her patience and the time she spent with me helping me to learn more about the horses and everything from haltering to veterinary care. And Jim was always around to crack a joke despite his huge task of making sure everything runs smoothly for over 70 horses, which is no small feat. I moved to a different state a few months ago and not being able to volunteer at the Rescue was one of the biggest drawbacks of my move. I learned a lot about horses, but I learned just as much about myself in the process. I am proud to say that my experience at the Equine Rescue of Aiken gave me the confidence and skills to take on my first horse, Dunny. He's a dun quarter horse that I hope to finesse and ride for many years to come, in no small part thanks to ERA. 
Equine Rescue of Aiken	289062		/users/profile/379274	Marcia36	Volunteer	5	05/08/2016	The view from the top of the hill told me this was like no other rescue I've been to before. Rolling hills of green pasture flowed into one another. The contentment and peace of the grazing horses filled my inner soul.  It was a picture book setting.  Surely this was someone's private farm. As I took in my surroundings I discovered why this Rescue was so special. It was filled with the love and caring of the farm managers and the many volunteers who took it upon themselves to make sure the horses were loved and cared for. That the horses had clean living spaces, grooming, fresh water, grain & hay, farrier, dental, vet checks. Did I mention "hugs"? And then there is the farm maintenance man who, with his team of male volunteers, keep the 80+ acres of fences mended, the grounds mowed, the water running, the hay into pastures, and so much more. The contentment in the horses' eyes told me everything I needed to know. They are loved and with the farm manager's watchful eye will find that perfect "forever home". There is the general manager who gives tirelessly of himself promoting the Rescue raising the necessary funds to keep this Rescue functioning. How could I walk away from this little slice of heaven and not return to volunteer?  It's been almost two years now and I'll be there until my legs no longer carry me.
Equine Rescue of Aiken	288783		/users/profile/378982	mikef48	Volunteer	5	05/05/2016	I visited once and became a volunteer the same day...an impressive place doing great work! This organization is located on 80 acres of beautiful rolling hills and is the temporary home for some sixty horses, while they wait for a family to adopt them. Most of the horses are off-the-race-track thoroughbreds, so are young and healthy.  Since the organization began in 2006, some 700 horses have been placed into loving families, making Aiken Equine Rescue the largest horse rescue of its kind in the southeastern United States. One of the amazing things is that there are only three paid staff, so volunteers are everywhere....over fifty volunteers help make it happen, no matter the weather. Because the organization is lean and truly cares for the welfare of the animals, it has a great culture and reputation. Over 2,100 people came to visit the facility in 2015, and over 7,400 people follow it and 'Like' AER on Facebook....statistics that rock in a town of only 30,000 residents.
Equine Rescue of Aiken	239437	2	/users/profile/325240	akckirvan	Volunteer	5	03/19/2015	I can not put into words how wonderful Mr. Jim and the Equine Rescue of Aiken are! Mr. Jim carries a smile that is contagious to others and everyone at the rescue, and always has the horses best interest in mind. The horses at the rescue are treated with the best care and loved unconditionally. I support the rescue 100+% and encourage others to visit, volunteer and see for yourself how absolutely wonderful it is!
Equine Rescue of Aiken	239421	3	/users/profile/325204	HorseMom	Volunteer	5	03/18/2015	I have volunteered with this organization for over 4 years. The facility is immaculate, the horses are given the best care available by the farm manager, employees and volunteers. It is a beautiful place full of beautiful horses. More importantly the folks there have big hearts and a tough mission to take in rescues that can find new lives in other horse disciplines.  A few animals are there for life and are truly loved. However, most of the horses that come through Aiken Equine Rescue find new forever homes that are meticulously scrutinized prior to adoption.I have a rescue horse from there and I know many people who have adopted from there. The manager, Jim Rhodes, is a big guy, with a big smile and an even bigger heart. He has integrity and the true grit necessary to try to raise the funds needed to save as many animals he can and find new, happy homes for them. Sometimes it's tough to stay positive. However, Jim just went through a long, tiresome and very expensive process of trying his best to save 4 foals from near death. 24 hour care by Jim and his volunteers over several months, saved 3 out of 4 of these desperately sick animals. The 3 remaining babies will grow and prosper and find new forever homes thanks to Aiken Equine Rescue!

Careteam Inc	48084	2	/users/profile/48991	linda37	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2010	The staff is professional, yet passionate about the care they provide.  They go out of their way to provide the optimum in care and the respect shown for each client is extra special.  The director works hard to bring every opportunity to the agency for growth in a positive direction.  The board has grown and developed into a true working partnership.  I cannot say enough about the leadership and services provided at Careteam.
Careteam Inc	47801	1	/users/profile/48566	js1489	Former Volunteer	5	07/06/2010	Sixteen years ago I was diagnosed with HIV.  Four years later. It was suggested that I get my affairs in order.  My numbers were declining while my viral load was increasing. I thought I was going to die soon. Paying for my meds each month for four years  was rapidly depleting any savings I had acquired,.  My health was failing and my savings were almost gone .  I called every government ageny, federal and state, asking where I might buy insurance to cover my medical bills and medications. I was not looking for a handout. I was on a wild goose chase.  Every call I made asking to buy insurance was met with "I'm sorry". Then someone suggested I contact CareTeam.I had never heard of CareTeam and I was desperate. I made the call and spoke with a fine young lady who after hearing my story and asking me a few question suggested I come to thier office and speak with them about thier programs and what they were all about. I will say only this.  "I walked into that office with a very dark cloud hanging over me, but walked out with the sun shining brightly all about me." I met the kindest most compassionate people who were not afraid to touch me or hug me.  They told me to go home and stop worrying about my meds.  Everything will be all rightCareteam saw to all my medical needs with wonderful doctors, a staff that truly cared about my health and progress. To this day I thank the good Lord for allowing me to find this most wonderful and caring organization whose only goal is to help people in need. If I never believed in angels, I do now.  Because of the care I recieved from CareTeam and it's staff I am healthy and continue to be virally undetectable.  Thank you to a truly caring organization, CareTeam.  Angels really do exist.
Careteam Inc	47800	1	/users/profile/48564	kwyche	Board Member	5	07/06/2010	Careteam is a wonderful organization. it's mission is to empower the community to stop the spread of HIV through prevention, education, treatment, and support. The staff at Careteam has devoted their careers to this goal. They provide compassionate and comprehensive care to the folks in our community who have a dire need; a life sustaining need. The clients often have nowhere else to turn, but that doesn't stop Carteam from growing, improving, and keeping up with the latest in treatment, policy, politics, and community support and services.
Careteam Inc	45870	7	/users/profile/46747	dan15	Former Volunteer	5	06/26/2010	I have been involved with Careteam since its inception, including helping to write the initial grant application almost 20 years ago.I was also one of the first volunteer drivers to get clients to their doctor appointments, as well as one of the members of the first board, and past-chairman of the Horry County AIDS Consortium, which pre-dated Careteam, Inc.Over the years it has accepted the challenges related to getting its clients the best care and drugs available.  It has taken the work of a great number of volunteers and staff to be able to meet all of the challenges presented to Careteam, and has worked with all people affected by this disease--all genders, all races and all sexual orientations, without exception.  Although many of its original clients and volunteers have passed on, Careteam has continued to grow and expand its programs and presence in the Horry, Georgetown, and Williamsburg Counties, despite all of the misinformation and fear that it faced, especially in its early years.  It still continues to be a well-run organization that has only gotten better throughout its years on the Grand Strand.
Careteam Inc	45827	7	/users/profile/46706	beachgolfer	Volunteer	5	06/25/2010	Our area is so fortunate to have Careteam to meet the needs of people who are HIV positive and have related needs.  In our society, too often, AIDS is seen as a single population problem brought on by the actions of the afflicted persons.  This is simply not true.  Careteam provides HIV speciality medical care, medical labs required for care, mental health and substance abuse counseling, oral health care, case management, transportation to medical appointments, emergency assistance with housing, support groups for clients, families, and friends and free and confidential counseling and testing.  These services are provided to persons needing such services regardless of their ability to pay.  The staff is outstanding and caring.  They respect the needs and privacy of their clients and families.

Animal Shelter of Clarendon County	195451	2	/users/profile/255499	Puploverpup	General Member of the Public	5	03/10/2014	I became involved with the Second Chance Animal Shelter, formerly known as the Animal Shelter of Clarendon County  some ten or more years back when a stray dog in my neighborhood was hit by a car right in front of my house.  My husband was at work that evening.  It was a painful experience hearing that harmless creature moaning aloud suffering from whatever injury he was enduring, I felt helpless that I could do nothing to relieve his suffering. There was no animal shelter at that time for Clarendon County, and the local police had no authority to serve the country area that  I  resided at the time. I knew he needed to be helped or put out of his misery, and at the time my knowledge of gun use did not exist to do something humane,nor a nearby neighbor.  I had to wait out his dying in quiet of the night, feeling miserable and guilty for doing nothing but crying in despair, That terrible experience led me to join a group of Manning animal lovers in their determined effort to build an animal shelter in our county. At least I could have called friends or associates with the shelter for advice or assistance, It was a long arduous journey that took several years to accomplish, but this is my story as one of the co-founders of the Animal Shelter of Clarendon County, still going strong and helping homeless dogs and cats.
Animal Shelter of Clarendon County	195402	3	/users/profile/255425	rubywoofer	Donor	5	03/08/2014	I am a donor for the Animal Shelter of Clarendon County and have been giving for a little over 3 years.  I first became aware of the shelter when I saw one of their compelling donation boxes in a Shoney's - and knew I had to visit.  I was afraid that what I'd see was animals in cramped cages, languishing without homes.  What I saw on my visit was a happy place, with animals who are obviously well cared for.  The staff and volunteers I spoke with were welcoming, friendly and helpful.  Over the years I have seen this shelter grow in so many ways: bigger mission results, better processes, more collaboration outside of their immediate community, a better management team,  more volunteers,  more engaging communications, and better board leadership.  I was thrilled to hear about the launch of the new low-cost spay/neuter clinic!  I am so proud to be a supporter of the shelter and only hope that the community there will become more involved over time.  
Animal Shelter of Clarendon County	195330	3	/users/profile/255338	carolinablessed8	General Member of the Public	5	03/07/2014	Actually, my "role" should be most of the above! I have volunteered with this shelter, I have used their services, I have donated to this shelter. The only two that don't apply is "board member" (would love to but am just too busy to do it right) and "professional in this field" although I have worked with numerous shelters over the years because we used to get transferred fairly often. Of all the shelters I have spent time helping, this is easily the best. The people working and volunteering here have always been friendly and dedicated. The place is neat and clean and the animals are well cared for - not just physical needs but social needs as well. They are serving a vital need in this county in caring for the multitude of strays we have and educating the public on the necessity of spaying and neutering, and providing a low-cost option for spaying and neutering. If I had any spare time, it would belong to this shelter, because helping here is a pleasure.
Animal Shelter of Clarendon County	195329	2	/users/profile/255337	Matilda Dogwalker	Volunteer	5	03/07/2014	I have been affiliated with this non-profit, 501(c)3, no-kill shelter since about 2006, first as a volunteer, then Secretary on the Board, then Office Administrator for three years.  During this time the people and the animals I have worked with have filled a void in my life that no one or nothing else ever could.  I've been there through many managers, kennel workers, volunteers and the public.  I've laughed, cried, reasoned, mediated, greeted, compromised, worried, walked and socialized dogs, scooped poop (and worn it a few times), and I wouldn't trade any of it for a million dollars--although the Shelter could sure use that kind of a big fat donation to support their spay/neuter program and save more animals.  You see, the Shelter rescues as many dogs as possible from the County's Animal Control Facility, and finds them new FUR-ever homes. The animals are fed and cared for, and the Shelter kennels are cleaned and sanitized daily by the dedicated staff, who often go above and beyond for the sake of the dogs and cats.  The need for more volunteers to walk and socialize the dogs is critical.  All dogs and cats adopted from ASCC are fully vetted--spayed/neutered, vaccinated, heartworm tested, dewormed, deflea'd.  That's quite a deal for the low adoption fees they charge. The citizens of Clarendon County and our members outside the county are the Shelter's "bread and butter" so to speak.  The Shelter gets NO government financial support, and relies solely on proceeds from A Second Chance Thrift Store (in downtown Manning) and donations from membership and friends of the animals. I strongly urge anyone who is not presently involved in animal rescue to get involved in some way. If you're not physically able to volunteer, then please donate.  If you can't volunteer because it would break your heart--then donate.  Donations of towels, blankets, pet beds, food, treats and $$ are needed.  Gift certificates are available for low-cost spay/neuter.  When "In Memory Of" and "In Honor Of" donations are received, a thank you card is sent to the donator and an announcement card is sent to the family of the pet or person being remembered.If you become a Member you'll receive news about all the shelter's happenings via e-mail or postal mail. You can visit the Shelter's website at:  www.ASecondChanceAnimalShelter.com for more information and Paypal donations, or mail a check to:  ASCAS, 5079 Alex Harvin Hwy, Manning, SC 29102
Animal Shelter of Clarendon County	195307	2	/users/profile/255302	Connie33	General Member of the Public	5	03/06/2014	Have had good experiences with ASCC over the years.  For a while I was volunteering with their ink recycling program.  It is very rewarding to work with them. They are a very professional and the animals are treated wonderfully.  It was a great day in this county when this shelter opened up.  They do the best they can with the help they receive from the community.  I appreciate anything anyone can do to help financially, personally, etc. Hats off to ASCC

Many people say they never thought they would have to ask for help but they lost their job, lost their insurance, had a major illness or something else beyond their control. The gift of sight or hearing frequently helps people  get a job, do better in school, regain self  esteem and have a brighter future.

South Carolina Lions Charitable Services	178417		/users/profile/235054	scarolinared	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	The South Carolina Lions Charitable Services has an amazing program to help people with vision problems.  The fact that they can take a $1300 donation and give someone back their sight is amazing.   My favorite story that I've heard while working with them is that of a Vietnam vet who was suffering from PTSD.  Going blind from a cataract was compounding his issue and giving him enormous problems.  When he said very solemnly that he didn't think he would be here without the surgery provided by SC Lions Charitable Services it sent chills down my spine.   Their reach is statewide, and the need of SC residents is great, so if you want a charity that makes a big difference (and keeps 100% of donations in SC) this is it.

It is great to meet new people each week and to know that we are all working to help other people in need.  As we look forward to the future of the GGP, I am really excited about some of the upcoming project and the additional food we will be able to produce using natural resources.

We have worked through the hot SC summer and have not missed a single weekend! For years I have given "non-perishables" to organizations with a bit of apprehension knowing that the canned veggies are loaded w/ sodium and preservatives. Sugar Diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure are illnesses that disproportionally affect poor people, I've ofter wondered how are we perpetuating their ill health with our "good works" of giving. Working in the Generous Garden lets me contribute to the poor in a wholesome, life giving, nourishing way! May God Bless the vision, the leaders, and the hands in the Garden.
Generous Garden Project	96011		/users/profile/111726	soccermom	Volunteer	4	08/18/2011	The Generous Garden Project allows me to help in the community while I am fully employed elsewhere.  Serving time is flexible; I can participate to the extent i am able while still keeping my family and work responsibilities.  There are ample opportunities for planting, maintaining, and harvesting in the community garden.  In addition, there are gleaning opportunities, and many "behind-the-scenes" tasks that can be done from home.  It is a worthwhile service opportunity that can fit into anyone's schedule.

The executive director constantly stives to make efficient and effective use of board time, volunteer time, and donor resources.I have delivered meals on a regular basis.  I have helped with "holiday gift bags" for the clients.  I have spent a significant amount of time with the internal staff, and can give this my full support and approval as a top-notch non profit organization.  Truly world class.  A benchmark not only in the Meals on Wheels organization, but also a great model for non profit leadership across the industry.
Meals On Wheels Of Greenville Inc	57225		/users/profile/60152	Missy J.	Board Member	5	11/17/2010	Meals on Wheels of Greenville is an outstanding organization because of its people. Every person involved with the organization - volunteers, staff, and board - are committed to the mission which enhances the quality of life of homebound individuals by providing nutritious meals, personal contact and related services. It is a honor to serve as a board member and watch this organization prosper. I own a senior resource guide that covers the Upstate of SC and often get phone calls from seniors in need. Anytime that I have called Meals on Wheels to get their assistance for a senior they have responded immediately and professionally. 
Meals On Wheels Of Greenville Inc	57212		/users/profile/60136	lawebb	Board Member	5	11/17/2010	Meals On Wheels of Greenville has been operating in the community since 1968 and has served over 9,000,000 meals during that period of time.  Without Meals On Wheels, many individuals would not receive a meal, and in our society today that is unthinkable.  I have personally witnessed the dozens of volunteers that arrive each day to prepare and package the meals and the hundreds of volunteers that selfishly deliver over 1500 meals daily.  The staff and management of Meals On Wheels do an excellent job of running the organization keeping the focus on eliminating senior hunger.  Even in these difficult economic times, Meals On Wheels of Greenville continues to provide meals to a growing segment of our population.
Osprey Village, Inc.	134441	2	/users/profile/180279	Sueofhhi,	Donor	5	11/06/2012	As the widowed mother of a 38 year old son, I feel the urgency of a community such as this.  Living as independently as possible is a crucial element for my son's future.  Jobs, community interaction and friendship are integral parts of all of our lives and is certainly a vital part of the developmentally disabled adults lives as well.  With the assistance of loving, caring volunteers and well trained staff, this will become a reality.  The future of OSPREY VIllage is comforting to me and crucial for my son.
Osprey Village, Inc.	275001	1	/users/profile/364542	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/27/2015	I'm a  sister  and caregiver of my 53 yr old adult  schizophrenic and mentally challenged  sibling. My 79 yr old mother also lives with my husband and I and was recently dx with mild dementia. I know it will be only a matter of time when my mom will require assisted living since my husband and I both work full time. I'm ecstatic that this program  will be in our community since the only option available for residential placement is in Charleston. I'm a professional  long term care social worker in the Bluffton community and know the lack of resources available for the disabled adults. We all need to support this vital program .We live in a area where many baby boomers reside who are caring for their adult children and as they age out there needs to be an identified place for their loved one to reside what a tremendous relief for the caregivers peace of mind!!! Please let me know if there is a waiting list to sign up for this program. I always donate to Heart to Home and encourage everyone else to-We need to continue to support the community we all live in. 
Osprey Village, Inc.	154868	1	/users/profile/205736	David149	Advisor	5	04/15/2013	With 2600 developmentally disabled people on the DDSN waiting list in SC, would you rather wait for the state to figure out how to meet this need or have a nonprofit like OSPREY Village tap into the private enterprise resources to come up with a solution that serves more people at a lower cost with better outcomes?  This "neighborhood with a purpose" idea is one whose time has come!
Osprey Village, Inc.	154687		/users/profile/205536	CarolynSWH	Volunteer	5	04/14/2013	The best concept ever for solving the underserved developmently disabled adult population.  Homes are desperately needed here in South Carolina.  This idea will work nation wide.  Companionship, friends, jobs, volunteering and community involvement are just a few of the opportunities for this more than capable population.
Osprey Village, Inc.	154676	2	/users/profile/205526	Susan202	Board Member	5	04/14/2013	I am the mother of a 42 year old daughter who is mentally disabled.  There is currently NO group homes in our local community.  We are building OSPREY Village to be a " Community with a Purpose".  Mentally challenged adults will be 1/3 of the population while 2/3 will be family members, retires, an anyone who wants to live in the community an volunteer 4 hours a week to assist our challenged residents.  They, in turn will volunteer for those living in the community!   The  charm of OSPREY Village will be very appealing.   Cottages with window boxes enhancing the large front porches, a "Village Green" where friends can meet, play frisbee, or sit an enjoy the activity of others!  A community "Grilling Area" will allow for frequent gatherings of community an friends.   As a widow, I realize the vital importance of OSPREY Village.  It will give my daughter an others a true home where the values of "Gentle Teaching" will be in place, a homey atmosphere, an genuine community involvement to help make their lives "The Best" they can be. Mentally Challenged residents of OV will have the opportunity to achieve their highest potential of independence with qualified 24/7  house staffing, a job coach, and a community that supports them daily! 
Dog4u Inc	272709		/users/profile/361798	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/23/2015	I found this non profit organization Dec 2013 and was so impressed with Dog4u, Inc's program that I have  taken on the role of funding for this rescue.  
Dog4u Inc	105362		/users/profile/141559	Catherine15	Board Member	5	02/01/2012	This is a fantastic organization. They take in animals who others would not bother with. Dogs4u is the most caring and dedicated agency I have ever been involved with. I recommend them to any and all.  5 stars all the way!!!!
Dog4u Inc	105197		/users/profile/141220	CHOLLAND	Donor	5	01/31/2012	Three things summarize my experience and involvement with Dog4U, Inc.: Donor, Adopter, and Volunteer. Initially I donated to the charity to support a noteworthy cause. I visited their facility on several occasions  and eventually decided to adopt a dog. Bringing another dog home, totaling two in my household, was a major decision that took some time to make. Adopting a Pit Bull was the absolute last thing I ever would have imagined myself doing. Alas, I fell for a sweet, quite, friendly bulldog named Mickey. He has been a delightful addition to my family, probably the easiest dog I have ever cared for. He made a seamless transition and has been a wonderful playmate for my older female bird dog mix. After adopting Mickey I was offered the opportunity to make the 2000 mile round trip to Massachusetts as a relief driver for a rescue transport. As it so happened, the trip worked well with my business schedule so I signed on. It was an incredibly rewarding experience and I have participated in two transports since my initiation into animal rescue volunteer work. Having participated as a relief driver on three rescue transports going from South Carolina to New England since June of 2010, I can honestly say that the work Dog4U, Inc. does makes a difference in the lives of countless animals and a reciprocal number of people. My family and I support their mission and look forward to seeing it continue. -Carl
Dog4u Inc	105047		/users/profile/140996	Jerzy	Volunteer	5	01/30/2012	Not many like this one around. Non-kill, fantastic care for the animals, incredible amount of work and commitment by Kristina, who founded the organization and continues to run. Kudos!
Dog4u Inc	103393		/users/profile/137723	fenigsen	Volunteer	5	01/13/2012	This is a wonderful organization that helps to place abandoned and neglected animals and provides care and shelter to those who cannot find homes because of their age or medical condition. All the work is done by volunteers. Kristina, who started Dog4U few years ago, takes care of the animals, runs the office, organizes fundraisers, and writes grants -- all to be able to keep her charges fed, vetted, and loved upon.

They instil pride and a sense of self worth in their new homeowners and reinforce the fiscal discipline it requires to build equity in their homes.My family chooses habitat for humanity  as the charitable organization to which we donate in honor of each other ILO gifts each Christmas.

Habitat For Humanity International Inc	66871		/users/profile/73085	twhisnant	Donor	5	02/11/2011	Since I'm not much good at construction, I make a donation each year to this fine organization in honor of my closest friends in Marion.  I have said many times that Habit of Marion is our county's most important charitable mission that impacts the lives of so many people (homeowners, volunteers, etc) in so many positive ways.  If we're ever going to bring ourselves together as a community, the work of MCHH is the appropriate model. 
Habitat For Humanity International Inc	66715		/users/profile/72920	lynnold	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	Such a worthwhile organization!  We have so many people in our area that are in need because of lack of employment, etc. that it is refreshing to hear of a group like Habitat that will help provide a house for a family at a price they can afford to pay.  The Board of Directors and many volunteers that work with this group are dedicated and passionate about this cause.  I cannot say enough about them.  Lynn OldfieldResident of Marion County
Cyber Crime Response Agency	312999		/users/profile/404370	elbertnoel	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	CCRA is engaged in one of the most important issues of our time-Internet Crimes.  From child predators to terrorism, CCRA has enlisted a cadre of exceptional volunteers to help tackle this issue.  My experience with CCRA has been excellent.  The support network from many talented individuals willing to share their expertise with me has been an eye-opening experience.  This has been a great opportunity for me to contribute in furtherance of this endeavor.  Although CCRA is doing an excellent job, it is not perfect.  There is still room for Improvement in the case reporting platform.
Cyber Crime Response Agency	312737		/users/profile/404111	sdunham	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	A place for the voiceless victims to gain a voice again. They are real people with the  real drive to seek justice for what is right for each and every client that comes to them in a time of need. There is no computerized machine to take a name and a number just to have such name and number to be placed on a list. Each and every client has their own place within the organization to seek the help they may need. I myself have helped in many different nonprofits that assist Law Enforcement, I can honestly say given the opportunity  to help assisting Cyber Crime Response Agency has made a true life changing impact. I am very proud to call this nonprofit home. With the ever changing world of cyber crime Local Law Enforcement cannot keep up with everything that gets reported to them. This is where Cyber Crime Response Agency can and will step in by offering its services to both victims and Local Law Enforcement, from taking a report of a internet crime from a client then investigating that report and compiling evidence together and granting client access to there case 24/7 there is no time lost for information to be forgotten ensuring a rock solid case for the conviction that is needed. When you really think about this organization, each and every investigator is not paid by the case, as a nonprofit the satisfaction for the investigator comes from the dedication, passion, conviction that they put into each and every case.  With today's online predators at a all time high and spreading like a epidemic, the Cyber Crime Response Agency is able to monitor cyber chatlines undetected 24 hours a day reporting the predator before they can gain another victim. I have worked with Law Enforcement in many different ways for the past 16 years and i can honestly say I have never in my life worked with a organization that can make a difference in today's world like the nonprofit organization  Cyber Crime Response Agency. When a cyber victim has lost all hope ran out of places to hide this agency has the door open for each and every one of them, a place for the victim to speak, gain the respect they deserve, get their case made and presented to them in a proactive manner to allow for a speedy conviction. Cyber Crime Response Agency is not made up of just people, its true heartbeat are the heroes that put all the hard work in to this nonprofit. The list of what Cyber Crime Response Agency can do is endless. I am very proud to be a active member of this nonprofit...

Cumbee Center to Assist Abused Persons	243908		/users/profile/330759	caap_am	Volunteer	5	05/29/2015	The Cumbee Center does some fantastic work for their region in advocating for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The fact that they also have a program for batterers is stunningly progressive for the area and is the kind of proactivity that is needed in the social services arena. The staff is professional and caring and the volunteers are well-trained, compassionate, and reliable. Clients of the Cumbee Center can be assured that anyone associated with the organization has their best interests in mind and they will be able to develop the skills and find the resources they need to recover, heal and move on from trauma in their lives.
Cumbee Center to Assist Abused Persons	243409		/users/profile/330142	livetruth	Volunteer	5	05/21/2015	Cumbee Center reaches out to those who have been victim of what we hope never happens to any of us. It takes alot of courage to walk in a hospital room and speak to someone who is not only hurt, but ashamed and humiliated to be there. These women often love the one who abused them, and don't want to admit the truth, yet the danger of the situation often forces them to face it. Usually women have no other option but to return back and hope it doesn't happen again because of a lack of money or emotional strength. That's where Cumbee Center steps up to the plate, to offer them a safe haven and opportunities to get on their feet and become independent. 
Cumbee Center to Assist Abused Persons	243375		/users/profile/330104	CAAPVolunteer	Volunteer	5	05/21/2015	The Cumbee Center and the services they provide are vital to the community. Their staff is motivated and driven, it shows through the work they do for their clients and out in the community.  When deciding where I wanted to volunteer I searched and searched then the Cumbee Center popped up in my search engine. It was an obvious choice to give back to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault being that I have been through various forms of abuse myself.  The Cumbee Center requires their volunteers to attend a 25 hour volunteer training. I learned things about domestic violence and sexual assault that I never thought about before. The trainers really helped me look at all viewpoints to fully understand what a survivor is going through.  I currently volunteer for the Cumbee Center on a monthly basis helping out in the office, hosting support groups at the shelter and advocating for a victim at the hospital.

I have depended on this GREAT organization for years while serving as the Victim Advocate for Barnwell County Sheriff's Office.  They have helped so many victims from our County.  The Cumbee Center is such an important organization.  All of the employees are always willing to help.  I wish they could get more funding for all of the awesome services that they provide.  I don't know what we would do without them. Thank you Cumbee a Center for always taking care of victim's needs.    Thank you Kaye Mixson, Jessica Pierce-Coach, and all of the other fantastic staff.  
Operation Quiet Comfort	125996		/users/profile/145449	LuckyLark	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	I was looking for an organization to help through virtual volunteering, but I did not think I had much to offer.  I love to knit and crochet, and came across Operation Quiet Comfort.  I thought what a great cause this is, sending needed items to our injured service men and women being treated overseas.  My skills could be used in a way that is rewarding to me.  As I became more familiar with the organization, I found even more ways to help, that are very easy for me to do, such as collecting used blue jeans and cutting them into squares to be signed with messages  of appreciation, comfort and hope and combined into a quilt to be given to an injured servicemember.  I love the fact that I am able to help those who are far away, serving our country.  It is little enough, considering the huge sacrifice they are making.  I am so glad I found this way to help and I wish word of it could be spread to more people.
Operation Quiet Comfort	100212		/users/profile/121814	PatDoyle	Volunteer	5	11/02/2011	I've been involved with this wonderful group for a little over a year.

Mercy Care	115724	1	/users/profile/157604	goodbike	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/19/2012	Mercy Care is the areas hometown hospice and it shows. their staff is kind, caring and compassionate. I would recommend Mercy Care over all of the for profit hospices in the Myrtle beach area.
Mercy Care	94321	1	/users/profile/109041	Sara-Jo	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/25/2011	OK, this will obviously be biased, but Mercy Care provides the ultimate in best quality care to patients and their families. Mercy has been around the longest, 30 years, this year, and, it is the only legitimate non-profit hopice in Horry County, but those facts aren't always the telling signs. How do I know that Mercy is providing the best care? The family satisfaction survey results are heartwarming and indicate that care was excellent throughout the patient's experience, the first week telephonic surveys indicate that needs are being met at the beginning of care, the number of purple angel pins awarded to staff because of positive patient experience comments is skyrocketing, and the Buckingham 12 internal staff satisfaction surveys came back at mostly 100% with a 62% return rate!
Mercy Care	71126		/users/profile/77755	Bellaboo	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	I found Mercy Care during a painful and sudden loss in my life. I would go as far to call it a crisis that put me in dire need of professional support. By fate, I called and left a message and was contacted later by a grief counselor named Loran Bulla. Over the course of months, this person took time to talk, listen, and care about how I was working through my grief and making a life for myself afterwards. His personal and work experience, kind words, and willingness to be available helped form a strong bond between us and allowed me genuinely let him 'help me'. He will always have a special place in my heart and I think of him often. I wish I could repay him somehow for his kindness, words of wisdom, anecdotes, advice, and hope he shared with me. Considering, this was all at no cost to me- not a penny! This organization is one of the best services our community has to offer and I hope it continuously receives the support it highly deserves. Thank you Mercy Care & Loran!
Mercy Care	69481		/users/profile/75927	Bamneal	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/16/2011	As a not for profit, Mercy Care provides quality care to the entire community they serve.  There are numerous services (unrelated to hospice) that reach into the community.  Providing grief counseling care for children that have suffered a loss within the community schools that may otherwise go overlooked.  These children also receive special attention through Mercy's "HAPPY HEARTS" day camp.  Another area that Mercy addresses is the needs that community veterans may face.  the MERCY HONORS program provides a simple, yet poigiant, "thank you" to the veteran through a special pinning (plus personalized certificate).  Last year alone, Mercy honored over 300 veterans and many found healing through this program.  Mercy has also reached out to numerous patients to help with psychosocial / financial needs at a critical time of their life.  Mercy is about experiencing life rather than focusing upon death.  This brings comfort to patient and family alike.
Pet Helpers Inc	215581	3	/users/profile/279010	sprice3	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/18/2014	I was hired by Pet Helpers in April 2014 to head up the fundraising effort. I have been an animal lover my entire life and I have always had rescued animals, ones I found along the highway or at my back door. It's a family weakness. I was never able to go into a shelter. I wanted to keep my blinders on ... I didn't want to know how many get euthanized or the poor quality of their care or how poor the financial resources. It runs in my family. My sister in Virginia can't walk into a shelter either. When she's in the market for a new animal, and if one doesn't find her, she calls the local shelter and asks them to bring her one that needs a home. She's done this three times in her adult life. But then along came Pet Helpers. I moved to Charleston in April and wanted a job I could love. I applied for the Pet Helpers job that I saw posted and the minute I walked through the door, I knew it was a different kind of place. I knew I wanted to work here. The animals that end up in our care are in deed very lucky animals. I only wish we could help more ... a lot more. Please support Pet Helpers!
Pet Helpers Inc	207051		/users/profile/269592	Tuckersmom	Client Served	5	07/23/2014	I found out about Pet Helpers 6 years ago when I saw a dog on an adoption site that I was interested in. He was heart worm positive and I fostered him until he was cleared for me to adopt. They made the foster to adopt process so easy. Since then, I have not only volunteered for them, but also became a kitten foster as well as having them be my "charity of choice" for monetary as well as physical donations. They are so close to my heart that when my close friend passed away, her family chose Pet Helpers as the charity to donate to in lieu of flowers! 
Pet Helpers Inc	207028	2	/users/profile/269571	CMahoney	Client Served	5	07/23/2014	Before deciding to adopt I did not know much about Pet Helpers, but when I saw my future dogs faces on a link posted on social media, I knew had to check it out immediately.  The staff there was helpful and kind, letting us spend time with, and answering all the questions they could about our puppies, who had been dropped off at the shelter a few days before after being attacked by an adult dog.  They were vetted, neutered, and cared for at no cost to us.  We were even asked to come back in for a wound check, and given a complementary veterinary visit with our adoption fee.  Pet Helpers Clinic remains our vet to this day, and I am happy to say that my girls are thriving thanks to the excellent care they received at this facility during such a critical time.  In addition to directly caring for animals, Pet Helpers has numerous programs, and affiliations to make the lives of all the animals in Charleston better, not just those who are still looking for their furever home.
Pet Helpers Inc	150660		/users/profile/200912	Brooke Asbury	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/07/2013	As a "forever" shelter, this company goes above and beyond to ensure that not only are those donating their time and money are thoughtfully acknowledged, but also that those new pet parents are given every tool to succeed.   Pet Helpers has opened doors for those individuals previously unable to properly care for their pets to keep them in their homes where they are loved.  This has been done through their pet food bank which is open to individuals with animals who are receiving government food benefits.  Also, much progress has been made with the Unchain Charleston campaign, a volunteer program that builds fences for those without one so that they do not have to keep their dogs chained in the yard. Pet Helpers is transforming the Carolina Lowcountry through a variety of avenues to find animals in need permanent, loving homes.
Bethel Christian Camp and Retreat Center	235505		/users/profile/319096	omc123	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/15/2014	Bethel Christian Camp is such a great place to be. I worked all 8 weeks this summer and loved being surrounded by other staff who love children! Bethel works hard to make the word of Christ known to each and every camper and to show love and also have FUN! I most definitely would recommend Bethel to any one with children. Even if your child has problems fitting in, at Bethel they will feel a sense of belonging, and make friends that last for a lifetime.
Bethel Christian Camp and Retreat Center	233566	1	/users/profile/297407	fmboudet	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/12/2014	As a point of reference, I served as part of Bethel Christian Camp's staff the summers of 2002-2009.  During my tenure at Bethel, I served in various capacities, under different directors, alongside different leaders, and with different staff members nearly ever summer. The things that always stood out the most to me were: 1) The absolute dedication to teaching the Gospel and love of Christ, 2) The "campers first" mentality, and 3) The dedication to ensuring ALL staff were equipped to succeed, lead, encourage and be encouraged. From Day 1 of camp each summer, there is always an emphasis to sharing and teaching the Gospel. Daily devotions for staff and campers, chapel twice daily with following Q&A time between campers and cabin staff, verse memorization, even staff introductions are designed with sharing the love of Christ. Bethel serves a large inner-city community and many of the children who attend Bethel aren't regularly exposed to scripture. Time and time again I witnessed hardhearted, hurting children who would simply blossom and flourish from the attention and love the staff would pour out week after week. It is a testament to the work the Lord is doing that so many children and young adults give their lives to the Lord because of their time at camp.  We all learned to give more energy, time, thought, consideration, and attentiveness to the kids around us. Living for people other than yourself day in and day out really helps you to appreciate humility and selflessness. Camp is for the kids. While we often had fun as a staff, we also knew that we were being watched...our actions/attitudes/words/behaviors. We always let the kids eat first, we would monitor the staff during games to ensure the kids were enjoying themselves and having fun "catching" staff members. Our goal during group canteen time was to help our campers memorize their verses for that day, spend time playing carpetball, or frisbee, or just hang out with them! This was sometimes easier said than done, but our head staff were always setting the example by engaging with the campers daily. My last takeaway deals with the extensive training the staff receive prior to the first week of camp. For all staff members, there was a minimum of a 1-week training and orientation period. This was longer for staff in leadership positions, head staff, and those going through lifeguarding training. The topics covered in training were vast and included everything from safety skills (CPR, First Aid, Buddy System, etc), to dealing with difficult situations, how to explain the Gospel in kid-friendly ways, how to inspire encouragement, excitement, camaraderie among children of different backgrounds, lifestyles, socio-economic status, etc. The blessing to working in a small staff is people were instantly aware if you were struggling with something and needed encouragement. There were weekly staff devotion and development times and always someone willing to pray with you. If you needed something, there was an effort to see it provided. The leadership cares deeply for its campers that make camp possible, but also for the staff who give sacrificially to continually serve Bethel's youth. The annual hand-washing ceremony is an incredible and tangible demonstration of their heartfelt attitudes of thankfulness for ALL staff members, as well as their commitment to exhortation and encouragement. I have since moved away from the South Carolina area, and have a new appreciation of the blessing of camp. I look forward to visiting Bethel when I can, and can't wait until my kids are able to attend.

As camp week neared, I realized that six nights away was a lot for a first time experience. I discovered that day camp was an option and the administration allowed me to change. We live locally. When we arrived at check in Monday, I was thrilled to see that we were not the only ones doing the day camp option. Another parent and child "in line" at registration introduced themselves to us. This boy was a repeat camper and he was friendly. The two counselors with our son's group were friendly. I left feeling great. Later that day I checked the flicker photo feed and was shocked to see a photo of my child in a canoe! We are not outdoors people and my son does not try new things quickly. He does not have the best balance or fine motor skills. I was so pleased for him at his accomplishment. These were the reports that I heard: the food is good, the counselors are cool, I want to go back, I made friends.  Our son even stayed over on Friday night and thrived. I think Bethel is a sweet, safe place that encourages independence, adventure, and relationships. I was pleased with the spiritual components. I loved joining in the excitement on Saturday at closing time. There were a lot of smiles and laughs. The staff appeared thrilled to be working there. We will be back!

He goes for 2 weeks in the summer and a weekend in the fall. He absolutely loves the camp especially the counselors. They ate so amazing and love the kids so much. The camp is reasonably priced, very safe, fun, and Christian based. They learn about Jesus and themselves at the same time. I would recommend this camp to anyone and everyone. 
H.O.P.E. Acres Rescue	321697		/users/profile/415194	Writer	Volunteer	5	01/20/2017	I love working with HOPE Acres! They are an incredible group of selfless people truly making a difference in the SC equine community. I especially loved being a part of the Partner Program last year and getting to bond with a special rescue while learning about horse behavior and training. This rescue does an excellent job of getting the volunteers involved with the horses too, not just with the chores.
H.O.P.E. Acres Rescue	286233		/users/profile/376321	Writer	Board Member	5	04/19/2016	I have been associated with H.O.P.E. Acres for three and a half years, first as a volunteer, and now as a board member. I am overwhelmed with the dedication that our volunteers and board members demonstrate toward the horses in our care. Seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, our volunteers are in place making sure that the horses receive food, proper veterinary care, grooming, training, and most importantly, love. The transformations that some of the horses have made is truly remarkable--from untouchable, frantic, traumatized, and fearful of humans, to being able to be handled by small children and ridden on trails; from  emaciated, diseased, and lame, to fit, healthy, and sound. Pictures on the website do not show the full transformation--it must be seen in person.  There are no paid positions--everyone who works here is a volunteer. This rescue was formed from a vision of love--and so it shall continue...
H.O.P.E. Acres Rescue	285927	1	/users/profile/375972	Judy159	Volunteer	5	04/14/2016	After my husband passed away, I was looking for something to occupy my time but be worthwhile too.  I was so very lucky to find this organization.  Not only are the owners and volunteers dedicated to the exhausting work it takes to keep this farm running, but the effort that is expended to get these beautiful horses back on their feet is outstanding.  I  became a volunteer about three years ago but had never seen the hurt and suffering these poor horses had gone through.  My very first horse that was emaciated was Chance.  His hip bones were almost breaking through his skin he was so malnourished.  It just broke my heart.  As I watch and worked with the volunteers and saw their love for these beautiful animals, I observed the change in Chance.  He not only became thicker in girth, but his spirit and love returned.  I credit the people working each and everyday with his gentle recovery.  Each and every horse brought to H.O.P.E. is treated with love, kindness and a compassion beyond anything I could have dreamed.  Much of the money used to feed, vaccinate and care for these equines is either by donations or by fund raisers we have every year.  Please, if you are looking to donate or even if you  are not, consider H.O.P.E. Acres as your pledge to assist us in continuing the work needed in this area.  These beautiful animals have so much love to give and so do our volunteers.  We need your love and support also.  Thank you for considering our horse rescue.
H.O.P.E. Acres Rescue	285869	1	/users/profile/375907	Rae Anne	Volunteer	5	04/14/2016	H.O.P.E. Acres Rescue is an amazing organization that has the health, safety and comfort of these beautiful rescue horses as it's #1 priority.  Tranquil grounds, off the beaten path, is where I enjoy spending my spare time.  It is extremely rewarding to watch these horses grow and blossom, and find a forever family to love and care for them for the rest of their days. The most gratifying feeling to know you have a tiny hand in this magnificent circle of life.

His heart and passion to help others sometimes gets him in trouble because he tries to help everyone...ones that's under-serving. So back in the day he's caught slack from people like savvyguy who nothing about his giving out of his pockets to serve communities all over the US. This is why  I recommend Joseph Bailey & the Movement of the BASH!  Simply because I see direct Results to thousands of people year after year...due to there efforts. So please know, we appreciate this Foundation & Mr. Bailey! We will continue to support its efforts to make a major difference.  Blessings to All!

Baileys B.A.S.H. Foundation	182758	1	/users/profile/239634	Business	Client Served	5	10/27/2013	The founder & CEO of the company (Joseph Bailey) has a background of making a difference throughout the state of SC & beyond. His service started under his mother who served & benefited more people in the area of St. Stephen SC than any other entity, individual, or organization. Its services began over 4 decades ago and still currently serving. I am a witness that this family created over 4 communities of rehabilitated criminals to productive citizens...serving anyone in need. Then in 2002 Joseph decided to continue his mothers legacy (after serving under his mom for decades) by not just continuing to serve SC, yet to open those efforts to the nation.  He began doing entertainment with a purpose...to create the platform to serve even more people, places and things. In over 11 years, there has never been an event produced by Joseph & Bailey's B.A.S.H. that has not been set up to directly benefit some community project, individual/family, or organization. It has earned him the "Highest Civilian Humanitarian Award In SC" for his efforts & service results that's second to none in my book...because he takes his Salary from Car Sales & his home to fund those events & projects. I don't know anyone that's doing that. I'm a witness. My family and community from Berkeley county are also witnesses....that Joseph Bailey has a HUGE heart & passion to serve and to make a major difference. We know, only greater things are to come. He can call anyone in our network on any day &/or time to join forces in any project, simply because we know his heart has always been in the right place no matter what...and that's Serving Others! God Bless Joseph Bailey & Bailey's B.A.S.H.

I became homeless because my sister who was my "Representative Payee" with the social security office was not paying my bills but instead spending all of my check on herself and her friends.  These folks became my new Representative Payee this past month and have been working toward getting me into my own apartment  Today they wrote the check that paid my first months rent and I am so happy to be living like a normal person again and out of the shelter.  The shelter was good, but there is no place like home!

I met these flks while over at thier church looking for some help getting a hot meal.  Even though most people look at me with suspicion Jon was quick to offer help and also asked me if there was any thing else they could do for me.  Because I never have any money left after I cash my check I asked him to help me handle my money so I would not get evicted from my apartment.  He helped me set up a free checking acount at a local bank, change my address at the SSI office and helped me qualify for foodstamps, and in home health care.  I call him my daddy now and Ms Gail is my mama!

Greenville County, Habitat for Humanity of	244789	1	/users/profile/331802	sidneye	General Member of the Public	5	06/08/2015	Habitat Greenville is a wonderful organization.  I love the Habitat model, where families go through a homeownership preparation program, and participate in building their own home and the homes of others.  When you volunteer with Habitat, you know you're having a direct impact on someone's future!
Greenville County, Habitat for Humanity of	234779		/users/profile/303478	Sarah223	Donor	5	12/02/2014	Habitat for Humanity of Greenville continues to strive towards the goal of helping low-income families realize the dream of homeownership. But it's way more than that. Habitat holds the families mortgages in-house at 0%...the families must work hard to earn their home by taking classes and participating in "Sweat Equity" by building their own home, helping to build other Habitat homes and donate their time to other charitable organizations. The investment you make, as a donor, lasts far beyond the trajectory of time that we will see in our lifetime. Your support of Habitat for Humanity helps to break the cycle of poverty by introducing hope into families lives.

New Beginnings Shepherd Rescue	233421	4	/users/profile/297217	TruthBeTold	Volunteer	5	11/11/2014	NBSR goes far above and beyond what most rescues do!! I am shocked at the two "reviews" here. SherriR.- First, NBSR doesn't call YOU to check to see if the puppy was spayed or neutered, they call your VET!! Second, the puppy that you adopted was only 3 months old at the time you adopted it and that is far too young to have her spayed at that time, NBSR is aware that some do spay and neuter that young, but it is has been proven that doing so at such a young age can cause serious health problems in the future for your pet. You were aware that the president of the rescue, who normally does all of the adoptions, was in the hospital, but you asked to meet the puppy anyway and her husband, very kindly, offered to introduce you. He was not accustomed to handling adoptions and should not be criticized for not doing whatever it was that you thought he should have done beyond what he offered to do.  Henry13: NBSR did not forget that you had an appointment, you were 2 hours LATE for your scheduled appointment, without even the consideration of a phone call! Yes, everything was done in the front yard of our HOME, where do you think it should have happened? Again, this is when the person who normally handles adoptions was in the hospital and both of these people were aware of this and they could have been patient and waited for normal operations to resume......NBSR went out of their way to try and accommodate these people. As a result of these two people, the president's husband has declined to ever help with adoptions again. I guess it's true, you just can't please some people :(

The man went and got the dog took 250.00Didn't ask any questions and we signed the paperwork on the hood of his vehicle  3. Was told he was on heart worm medication and frontline..NOT TRUE...4. Was assured he was  microchipped... When we picked him up the man said "oops he wasn't" .. He also asked us "well do o you want him or not" after only about 4-5 minutes with the dog.. the poor dog looked malnourished and was starving and dehydrated... Also after we got him home I noticed that his hind leg was bothering him.. I would not suggest this place to anyone... They haven't even responded to my email.   Seriously they need to be closely investigated its obvious they are in it for the money..  
New Beginnings Shepherd Rescue	166868	1	/users/profile/221711	SherriR.	Client Served	2	09/04/2013	I adopted my dog from this rescue over a year ago. She was six months old at the time, and the owners rescheduled with me twice before I could go take a look at her. I spent five minutes getting to know her and the man who I met with asked me "we'll, do you want her or not?". I asked him a few questions about how she had come to rescue, and he told me he didn't know but that her mother had been brought to the rescue pregnant. I decided to take her. I soon found out she had worms even though I was assured she had been wormed.  She has been extremely afraid of people since I got her, and though this has improved with socialization and training, she still has behavioral issues that she came to me with. When I signed the adoption paperwork I agreed to have her spayed, and was told that this would be followed up on and confirmed by New Beginnings. I have never heard one word from them over a year later. Fortunately, I have a wonderful dog who I love, but I would not use this rescue again nor recommend it to anyone.
Mental Fitness	42655	7	/users/profile/43370	joel4	Board Member	5	06/02/2010	The main program is a musical-theatre presentation of a family's struggle with an eating disorder and a facilitated talkback. Before I had seen it, I trusted it had good value as a teaching piece, but as a professional singer-actor I was skeptical about it being good theatre. I was so blown away I immediately offered my services to the organization in whatever capacity they needed and found myself part of the presentation and now also on the Board. I have been witness the amazing impact we can have. The more I learn about Normal In Schools, the more impressed I am with every aspect--the vision, the leadership, the organization. I am proud and honored to be part of it.
Mental Fitness	38879	6	/users/profile/39794	mp1	Volunteer	5	05/13/2010	As the mother of a 16 year old daughter, it's vital that I understand the specifics of eating disorders - what to watch for, how to help.  Normal presented this all to me in an educational and creative way that allowed me to understand and empathize.  ED was an issue that I only knew about through the news, which doesn't paint the full picture.  It also is a venue that speaks directly to my daughter, which is not always easy to do!  Through witnessing the characters go through the challenges of ED, our whole family was able to truly feel as though we understood the issue.  Also, the talk back sessions after the performance provided a way for us to ask additional questions and receive referals if needed.
Mental Fitness	38847	8	/users/profile/39761	mlgietl	Board Member	5	05/13/2010	Normal In Schools is an amazing experience lived through the very real life scenario of a family dealing with a daughter/sister's eating disorder.  This powerful musical, followed up by a talk-back with professional medical experts on eating disorders, combines the power of ED education through theater with the clinical expertise necessary to help heal the mind and body.In addition, the organization is in the process of putting together a DVD of the musical to be used in conjunction with a high school health class curriculum.  There are very deep rooted psychological issues associated with eating disorders and this organization is helping to spread the word that there are many people out there suffering from the same conditions and by becoming aware of the warning signs and working through them with an open mind, great successes can be obtained.

Spartanburg Area Conservancy Inc	34700	2	/users/profile/35576	katherineaul25	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2010	While I've only known about SPACE for a short amount of time, the events and projects that they've provided Spartanburg have given me an excellent insight into the importance of land conservation and it's role in preserving and enriching a community. SPACE's efforts in maintaining the Glendale Shoals Preserve, particularly since they began a partnership with Wofford College's Environmental Studies Program, has been especially exciting for me to observe and participate in. The Glendale Shoals Preserve is certainly one of Spartanburg's most precious natural and historical gems, and it is in large part thanks to the Spartanburg Area Conservancy that the public is able to utilize, learn about, and enjoy this special place. Also, as a part of Wofford's Environmental Studies staff I'm looking forward to collaborating with the SPACE team to plan their annual Jazz on the Bridge event at Glendale Shoals. This event is a perfect example of SPACE's ability to responsibly employ a nature preserve that benefits both the vitality of the space, and also brings together a community.
Hope Haven Of The Lowcountry Inc	286904	1	/users/profile/376975	CJ_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	From Victim to Survivor: A Story of HopeHope Haven of the Lowcountrywww.hopehavenlc.org A young woman is raped by her boyfriend. She tells him no, she does not want to have that type of sex with him, but he doesnt listen and he forces her. Afterwards, she is bruised, beaten and betrayed. She calls the police and is taken to the nearest hospital. Her boyfriend is arrested, but he may not even be held overnight and could be home before her. Already feeling violated and exposed, her clothing is taken from her as collection of evidence in the investigation and she is asked to wait in a room she cant leave in nothing but a hospital gown, which after her assault makes her feel more exposed. The nurse shows a stranger into the room. He says hes a volunteer advocate from Hope Haven of the Lowcountry, a child advocacy and rape crisis center. He begins telling her what Hope Haven is, how they offer counseling, legal services, medical referrals, and advocacy for her. He tells her that what happened to her is not her fault, and that what she was wearing, how sober she was, or who she had sex with in the past should ever be used as reasons to justify her rape. Rape is never justified. He tells her that the doctor is going to collect evidence from her body and it is going to make her feel more violated, but it is the best option to make sure she gets justice for the crime committed against her. She has the option to not report or to collect the evidence and report later. She decides to go through with the exam and all the evidence is collected. Afterwards, the advocate asks her about her safety and whether or not she wants to go home. She says she doesnt feel safe. So, the advocate gives her the contact information for a local domestic abuse shelter and she calls and makes the arrangements. She spends the night at the hospital. But, before she goes to sleep she knows that tomorrow she has somewhere safe to go, that an advocate was by her side when no else could be, that her evidence was handled properly by the hospital and the detectives, and that tomorrow someone from the Hope Haven staff would be there for her. As a volunteer advocate, Ive seen assault victims just like this one. Ive been that stranger who had to walk into a hospital room and tell a victim that everything would be okay. I became a volunteer two years ago after graduating from college and moving back home to Beaufort, SC. I started volunteering at my church and that is where I learned about Hope Haven. After going to Mercer University and where I learned about the horrors of rape, sexual assault, and sex trafficking throughout the world, I wanted to do my small part to help within my community. After 25 hours of training, I learned how to be an advocate for victims of sexual assault, and how many obstacles they face when reporting their assault. I learned that most victims dont report for fear of being blamed. I learned that 1 in 4 women will be assaulted in their lifetime and 1 in 6 men will be assaulted in theirs. I learned that only 6% of assailants will ever be convicted for their assault. And, I learned that rape and sexual assault are not far flung problems in big cities, foreign countries, and differing cultures across the sea, but is an epidemic worldwide, even in our own community. While this is usually a subject that many people choose to ignore, I stand with Hope Haven that it is an issue that needs discussion and more importantly needs action.Hope Haven is the road to recovery for children and adult victims of trauma in 5 counties of the South Carolina Lowcountry. Last year, they serviced 544 clients with counselling, support groups, and advocacy, while also furthering prevention efforts in at-risk homes and local schools to stop the epidemic from spreading. While I hope I can make a small difference in the life of a victim, I know that Hope Haven makes all the difference in the world. Their biggest goal is to make every victim, their friends, family, and society around them, no longer see themselves as victims, but to empower them as survivors and help them get back to living life.
Hope Haven Of The Lowcountry Inc	286905	1	/users/profile/376976	Whitney_O	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I support Hope Haven of the Lowcountry by volunteering my time and energy, and I am convinced I receive so much more from this powerful experience than I could possibly give. Give: to freely transfer the possession of something. The powerful act of giving unto others is something I have always felt impassioned to express; however, for much of my life giving has been a challenge. In fact, my early experiences in life led me to demonstrate the polar opposite of giving by taking anything and everything I could. To understand the nature of this incredible transformation in my life it is helpful to view giving as a selfless act of love, and taking as a selfish act of fear. As a fearful child experiencing pain on a daily basis and perceiving many things beyond my control being taken away from me, both tangible and abstract, my survival revolved around an impulse to take what I could. My heart wanted to give, but my instincts told me to take. Naturally, living life in this mode only increased my pain. It is because of organizations like Hope Haven of the Lowcountry providing healing to children affected by abuse and neglect that I am able to give today. The individuals that come together to support and provide these services to the community are invaluable to improving the quality of life for everyone in our immediate environment, as well as the global community at large. From my experience, actions have a ripple effect and when we act from a place of selfless giving, rather than selfish consumption, we are spreading love and affecting others in empowering ways we cannot even begin to imagine. I give today because it is an absolute joy and privilege to be of service to others when for so long I was incapable of doing so.
Hope Haven Of The Lowcountry Inc	286903	1	/users/profile/376974	Constance_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	What inspires me to give is the enjoyment I receive when helping and working with people. I have always wanted to be a help to others.  I always feel happy when I help someone else, and at the same I feel am truly blessed myself through helping others.  I believe God has blessed me so that I can help others even if I can't help financially, sometimes people just need a word of wisdom or encouragement and I make myself available to people that just need someone to talk to. The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to make some difference in someone's life. I personally I don't wait for good things to happen to me, I go out and make some good things happen. Volunteering with Hope Haven of the Low Country for five years I give cheerfully and accept gratefully, then I know everyone is blessed. Take the time to help other people without expecting a reward or gratitude is definitely important in living an optimistic life. There is more happiness in giving than in receiving. What inspires me most also was my mother was a single parent with seven children.  I, as the second child can recall someone always helping us.  My mother's brother and sister helped provide food and financial help to my family.  My older sister and I continue to talk about how good God was to us because he provided for them and then they provided for us without any rewards.  I just thank God that I am able to help others today. Volunteering with Hope Haven I have come in contact with two most important Hope Have representatives by the names of Christine Smith and Jeanne Newland, these two people are like family members to me and I feel they inspire me most to volunteer with Hope Haven.  I love what I do and whenever I need help, Christine's is there to provide support where I can handle the task no matter how big or small.  Christine Smith is one of the best people I have had the pleasure to work with.   Another influence in my life with whom I had worked with was Jeanne Newland before moving on to another location.  I will never forget her because she is my hero.
Carolina Basset Hound Rescue Inc	100526		/users/profile/122962	Eric23	Volunteer	5	11/11/2011	About a year ago, my wife and I decided to take the plunge and attempt to "foster" a basset for Carolina Basset Hound Rescue (CBHR). I guess fostering to was the same as tryout for a new baby in the family. We failed miserably at fostering. That baby was adopted in less than 12 hours. Since that time, we have been active in several activities for and with CBHR. This rescue group is phenomenal! CBHR is the most dedicated group we have seen. They a highly organized, well-oiled machine with dedicated volunteers throughout both Carolinas. If you are interested in "dog rescue", you cannot find a finer, more active group than CBHR.

It is a therapeutic environment encompassing a strengths perspective.  The success of the program can be see through figures and data, but the real success is evident in their clients reports.
Nurturing Center Inc	92892	1	/users/profile/106635	Shinglea	Volunteer	5	06/29/2011	The Nurturing Center is a fantastic organization that really promotes having a healthy state of mind and healthy family relationships.  It is an establishment that promises a safe place for children to grow and be loved.  The children at The Nurturing Center receive more than just hugs, they are welcomed completely and set up for success.  For example, if a child has a certain roadblock on his/her development, The Nurturing Center focuses on helping him/her with that particular obstacle so he/she can stay on pace developmentally.  The entire staff is friendly and caring.  The are wonderful at what they do and really focus on providing the best care possible for the families.  This organization is determined to help people, and it definitely does.
York County Humane Society	233668	1	/users/profile/297564	MAMarini	Donor	5	11/14/2014	My family and I adopted our dog, Tyson, through York County HS about 3 years ago and to this day, I am humbled by the employees and volunteers who spend their days cleaning after and caring for these animals!  We visit regularly and are ALWAYS greeted with kindness, love and smiles, even after three years!!  It is this type of compassion and caring that brings joy to our wonderful community!!! I have a special place in my heart for you all. My family and I thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for all you do to make this world a better place for all of us!!  I am very proud, and consider myself lucky, to donate to such an incredible organization!!
York County Humane Society	177596	2	/users/profile/234162	MbKnapp	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I've been volunteering with the HSYC for several years. I am responsible for fund raising and work with amazing people. We are a family at the HSYC (staff and volunteers alike). With a family we have disagreements but at the end of the days....it's all about the animals.  We work diligently to make needed funds to support our no kill shelter. We currently house 140+ cats/kittens and about 40-50 dogs/pups. We also have a thrift shop that's focus is to make money to support our cause. Together the thrift shop and the shelter along with the business of running the shelter costs $32K a month. We regularly request donation of items and when spending act as if we are conservatively spending our own dollars when making decisions about our shelter. Our shelter is a very positive place to visit. Our staff is paid very little and works with a passion for the animals.  As the fund raising coordinator, I feel very respected and appreciated for the activities I coordinate. However, I cannot do it alone and I have an amazing group of people I work with that makes every day a pleasure.  It takes a community to make this all work. As an organization and as a volunteer, I regularly direct people to other rescues ...even Animal Control to find the pet that fits with the family's need. We work toward the common goal of finding the right fit for pet and family but bottom line we are the pet's advocate no matter what. 
York County Humane Society	107767	2	/users/profile/146326	crickettjiminy470	Donor	1	03/09/2012	After I made a sizable donation to this group, I realized a few things and I regret not having checked further into their financials and procedures.  Based on the amount of pets saved and the gross revenue for this group, I was surprised that comparitively speaking they are spending donation money . Look at the numbers they reported closely. Why, they are taking in so many cats and puppies are they not offering a spay and neuter clinic? Wouldn't it be in everybody's best interest to work on stopping the problem rather than only housing pets. When they reach their limit then what happens? I also do not see any colaboration and all donors know that with the animal concerns now a days it is essential that groups work together and also offer spay and neuter. Whoever is in charge of making these decisions needs to totally redirect their efforts with the goal in mind to reduce population and find as many good homes as possible through networking. NEXT TIME I WILL BE SURE TO PUT MY MONEY ELSEWHERE. I CANNOT EVEN GET THEM TO ANSWER THE PHONES! 
The Children's Security Blanket	286569		/users/profile/376639	Marjorie_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Children's Security Blanket - Wrapped In Hope And LoveMy Giving StoryI love music and dancing. One of my favorite songs is Ron Kenolys  Give and It Will Come Back To You In Good Measure, Pressed Down Shaken Together and Running Over How You Give Is A Reflection Of Your GratitudeI believe that the more we give, the more blessings we receive. Thus, in my everyday life, I try to give back at least as much as I have received. As we make our communities better, we create a better future for our children and those who will come after them.I want to share a story about a nonprofit that leverages its limited resources by helping young children living with cancer.  One evening, as I watched the Wrapped in Hope and Love video presented by the Children's Security Blanket, the tears streamed down my face. Young children under ten years old jumped around Camp Victory (summer camp) without a single care in the world. A little boy had been given the opportunity to ride a horse and was beaming with such pride. Watching several terminally ill children bonding and smiling at each other ignited my hope in humanity. That night, I wrote my first check to the Children's Security Blanket. In addition to providing terminally ill children with special blankets, the Childrens Security Blanket of Spartanburg provides financial and emotional support to families of children facing cancer. Through the sparse resources available to the Security Blanket, families receive financial aid for transportation, lodging, meals, and recreation. A refuge for families with children living with cancer, the Security Blanket is there to support these children during spinal taps, blood transfusions, surgeries and multiple hospital stays. Considering the impact of the Security Blankets work, I would be thrilled to see them receive additional funds for their services.For additional information, please visit The Children's Security Blanket at http://www.childrenssecurityblanket.org/

Within days of this terrible day, i was sitting at the Children's Sercuity Blanket with Tom.  He was so nice and encouraging.  They helped us  with gas money and prayers.  Zack has attended Children's Security Blanket parties and dinners and has had a great time.  They have called and check on us, they have given us blankets, toys, and household items.  They have been a blessing and I hope if anyone is going thru something like childhood cancer that they reach out to Childrens Security Blanket.  They are AWESOME.
The Children's Security Blanket	188376	1	/users/profile/245787	5browns	Client Served	5	11/12/2013	Our son was diagnosed at age 10 with leukemia.  He required 3 1/2 years of chemo and has only in the past few weeks finally finished his treatment and had his port removed.  He is in remission and 14 years old.  Children's Security Blanket was the first organization and the only organization in Spartanburg that reached out to help us.  They visited our home and asked how they could help.  They presented our son with a blanket with his name on it.  They gave us gas cards to cover our mileage for round trips to the hospital 50 miles round trip, many times a week for years!  Every summer they held a pizza party at the local outdoor swim park and also a delicious holiday dinner.  The get-togethers have been a great chance to meet other families who also have children in treatment for cancer.
Roman's Travel with Care	292327	1	/users/profile/382832	Deborah147	Client Served	5	06/06/2016	I started fostering almost a year ago.  Thanks be to God, for bringing Karen Simpson into my life.  Her non-profit; Roman's Travel with Care helped me save a mother Pit and babies. Janice the mother dog, was a first-time mom, giving birth in the shelter caused her to be full of anxiety and skiddish with her pups.  she had nine.  Four babies died in the first two weeks from bacterial infections, in their umbilical chord. Karen without any hestiate drove the last leg, well beyond the stanard miles. Next, I called regarding a pull in Elizabeth Town, time was of the essence.  She was already out transporting in the area, once again she did not disappoint.  She picked up Jerry, the dog who had been in the shelter too long.  Jerry developed high anxiety, standing at the door opening he stood for hours obsessively licking, never stopping.  Jerry, could no longer endure time spent locked up and showing exremely poor.  Jerry would have lost his life, had he not been removed.  Well, since it was Karen, I also foster the last two puppies~~~ un adoptable, Bella and Scarlet. Karen didn't even blink, picking 3 dogs instead of one!  She took pictures throughout their journal, so course...I was excited.  Beyond the transporting, Karen is an animal advocative, often times using her own money, she has a wealth of knowledge on all sides.  Karen even inspired me!  I transported a blind puppy to his new owner. I have seen already experienced the good and the bad side...of rescuing.  Karen Simpson of Roman's Travel and Care, just does everything right.  I have respect for what she does...rescue would grind to a halt without people of intregrity, work ethic, passion, knowledge and compassion, if any one of five  are missing it doesn't work.  I can say with hesitation, Karen Simpson, has what it takes and I depend on her to save lives.

National Foundation For Credit Counseling Inc	89339		/users/profile/101448	barbiebosh	Volunteer	3	06/01/2011	Credit counseling has been a great help to all consumers.In fact,the Credit card Act became legislation in 2009. Part of the law required card corporations to work with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling to provide free assistance to consumers in danger of default, largely in the form of advising. While they've held up their end of the bargain, recent NFCC studies have found that consumers simply are not taking advantage, states Bankrate. The proof is here: Are you using Credit Card Act help like you should be?, personalmoneystore.com/moneyblog.
National Foundation For Credit Counseling Inc	84680		/users/profile/93971	beca146	General Member of the Public	5	04/01/2011	Family Service Center of South Carolina has helped many individuals in many different ways.

Lowcountry Orphan Relief	173029	2	/users/profile/229099	lyoung2	Board Member	5	10/03/2013	Lowcountry Orphan Relief now serves 68 agencies, three counties and every abused child that is removed from its home.  What a wonderful organization and above all 88% of its money goes directly to the children.  Even the Director/Founder takes no salary.  What a great model.  This charity keeps all of its money locally and provides direct service to the children.  The people are nice, their hearts are big and their love for the children are unbounding.  Must tour and hear the full story behind this great organization.

Grass roots, 92% of all monies goes directly to the cause with only one full time & one hourly employee with all others being volunteers.  Children's letters tell the story that is pinned on their boards and they have created six libraries in shelters, and hold two unbelievable events per year for these abused and sheltered children.  They  clothe and give all basic necessities a child needs when removed from their home when abused. Must see, experience and be a part of of to appreciate their 24/7 work. 
Trident United Way, Inc.	151697	2	/users/profile/202579	TUW Volunteer	Volunteer	5	03/27/2013	I don't know where this person is getting their information but it's completely wrong. For example, Trident United Way does not keep money inside its doors and it does not hire consultants to do its work. In fact, it's the most strategic non-profit in the Lowcountry that invests our donations in activities that measurably change people's lives. There is no non-profit working more collaboratively in our community to achieve real positive change than our United Way 
Trident United Way, Inc.	85698	2	/users/profile/95684	B Wain	General Member of the Public	1	04/14/2011	I think most donors do not realize how much of the money TUW receives stays inside their doors - with paid "consultants" who go out into the field and demand that programs conform to the model TUW has decided fits our community - with total disregard for whether it does or not. THis is a one-size-fits-all model that is a lot like giving a size 5 garmet to a person who wears a 20 and then blaming them for not being able to wear it. When the program has enough clout in the community to stand up to TUW - like the Boy Scouts...they can get funding.   However, small programs who serve some of the neediest clients are going to get silently turned away. When a TUW board member wants a job - TUW makes sure they get it - this happened with the Boys & Girls Club directorship.  They TUW tried to force all afterschool providers to purchase and use B&G Club materials...BUT when that individual left Boys & Girls, the organization funding was cut off...not because the program changed, but the political ties no longer held.   I think TUW has moved a great distance away from what people think they are paying for...and they are no longer responding to community needs - but they are telling the community what it needs - and they play favorites. I, personally, hope a Community Chest or other collaborative funder arises in our community so TUW has competition for donor dollars and they have to start listening to every voice in the community.

WINYAH RIVERS FOUNDATION INC	148499		/users/profile/197685	palmettoproud	Donor	1	01/24/2013	I have to agree with the previous review. I don't see where my money is making a difference with river protection. From most indications the water quality in the river is currently good, and I see other organizations doing more or at least are better at keeping me informed of conservation efforts. I'm going to watch closely over the next few months to see if activities are those I want to support.
WINYAH RIVERS FOUNDATION INC	130937	1	/users/profile/176455	tigerfan	Donor	2	10/29/2012	I have been donating for a few years, however I haven't heard much from the organization as to what the current activities are. I just can't get enough information on what the organization is doing to satisfy my curiosity about how my donation is helping the river.  I haven't seen a newsletter in about a year, which is in stark contract to other organizations I donate to. As a Santee Cooper retiree, I'd like more information on the environmental concerns that have led to the lawsuit. There is nothing on the website and it's been months since the lawsuit began. The only communication I ever see is concerning events where there will be a table or trash picks along the river. I'd much rather hear about specifics concerning the lawsuit to validate the organization's involvement and continue my donation.  The Riverkeeper is perfectly nice, but I'm not getting enough information from the organization to justify endless donations.

I was a former employee from March 2015 to October 2015. The CEO and Lead social worker of the organization. She is poorly unorganized, she degrades her employees and feels she can talk to you any type of way and make you feel less than. Her  husband is the CFO of the organization, often times they will engage in power struggles in front of staff and clients. The CEO doesn't take accountability for anything that is her fault and will displace it on you or another one of her staff. Turnover rate is high and people quit often. She fired me because someone showed her a text message talking about what I really think of her husband and her and then she tried to lie to unemployment but she lost the case. PLEASE do not believe any of the Love in that organization. The CEO is a shady character and she is not to be trusted.

GOOD  ALS Foundation for their immediate response to a request made through a Speech therapist, AMY, at the ALS  Clinic in Charlotte, NC.  I had been undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and finally after 4 years I was accurately diagnosed with PBP-ALS onset, which has caused me loss in my ability to speak clearly, my tongue, and my ability to swallow easily. I hesitated about going out in Public and could not express myself. I had to give up tutoring. Within a month of the request for an iPad with a text to speech to help me function, this foundation responded. I now go out in public, use the iPad to communicate, do my banking, shopping, and now I can continue to tutor three students via the iPad. They love the technology!  My quality of life has improved because ALEXA R. GOOD ALS Foundation stepped in and met my need. Thank you, Amy, for making the request, and thank you, ALEXA R.

Please pay close attention when adopting and make sure you don't notice sneezing or discharge.  I adopted a kitten and within 24 hrs. it became very ill.  It was denied by director that I acknowledged sneezing in other animals but not the one I was adopting at the time.  Then an employee told me that I could bring the kitten back, take on foster status and they would provide meds to treat illness, and then I would re-adopt.  as I drove into the parking lot, I recieved a call telling me they could not honor previous promise.  I was treated as though I was the villain here even though I came specifically to the Humane Society to adopt.  Director needs P.R. skills.  i will never recommend Humane Society again and will go out of my way as an animal lover but not a millionaire to speak out.

Teresa Loving and her staff are out there doing fantastic, nay amazing things for special needs children and their families  not because they seek recognition  but because it is a dream that is lives and breathes in their hearts. Teresa Loving has a vision to help special children and seems to inspire everyone around her to jump on board and catch the spirit of what it means to be committed to a wonderful cause with determination and purpose. When you arrive at SOAR Academy, it just looks like any other building. But once you get inside, the first thing you will notice is how much she and her staff just love these kids. Its unlike any place you will ever visit. You cant walk out without asking how you can help.Most people see things and say Why; But Teresa Loving and her staff DREAM things and say Why not?   They have given Hayden the courage to dare to do great things.  They have shown us as parents that we can dream new dreams for our children. Dreams for our children to SOAR!
Soar Academy	39773	1	/users/profile/40744	bettyboop	Volunteer	5	05/21/2010	SOAR is a non-profit school for special needs children from age 12 months up.  There was a real need to reach these children with education, therapy, living skills that public school did not fill.Theresa Loving and a group of caring people saw this need and opened SOAR Academy.  You just have to make one visit and meet the students to see what a tremendous difference this has made in their lives and the lives of their families.  They are left out of a lot of every day events that they see their siblings and friends attending.  One of these was the fun of a Vacation Bible School.  When it was organized,  these special needs children were able to take part in all areas that they had heard about from others.  They had music sessions with their own "band" and learned songs to sing and dance to.  There were craft classes from which they carried prized crafts made by them home to show off to family.

Help Of Beaufort	170455	1	/users/profile/225827	ramblin	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	We are an all volunteer non profit where no one gets paid to work there. We pay $1 a month rent on our building.  We bring in donations of clothes, food, money, furniture, and anything else anyone would like to give away, and we give everything away at no charge. We assist with food for families one time a  month, and we help with their utilities, rent, mortgage, etc one time a  year.  People can shop for clothes for free once a month also.  We are completely dependent on donations. 
Help Of Beaufort	170425	1	/users/profile/225789	southerndodgegirl	Volunteer	5	09/18/2013	I joined this organization above many others to assist in my area. The reason I chose to give my time and energy.... They are 100% non profit. We all give our time, dig into our own pockets and do all we can to serve the entire county and I have never had so much joy in doing so. Here is a short description of what we do... We have a food pantry/clothing facility. No money is ever taken. We assist for emergencies (fire etc) or just plain down on luck people. We also provide meals to the sick and the elderly through our Mobile Meals division. Sometimes it is the only warm meal the receive. We provide financial assistance after ensuring that the system is not being abused for medial/power etc. It has cost me both time and money to assist them and yet I get WAY more out of what we do and how we do it than any $ could ever give me joy if I were to buy myself something.

Jenkins helped me get the paperwork I needed to get food stamps and start looking for a job. However, because I was pregnant no one wanted to hire me. Rev. Jenkins took me under his wings and had me assist with work that needed to be done at the shelter and church. I didn't feel useless anymore. I helped type letters, assisted with a fundraiser and began to feel like I was needed. As the years have pasted, 19 to be exact, Rev. Jenkins will always have a special place in my heart and in my memories. I don't know where I would be today without him & I Thank God that he lead me to Rev. Jenkins door.

GOODWILL INDUSTRIES OF UPPER SOUTH CAROLINA INC	28256	6	/users/profile/29323	jpcrowder62	Board Member	4	02/13/2010	I am a current Board member for the Goodwill Foundation which supports Goodwill Industries of the Upstate/Midlands SC.  I am in my 3rd year of involvement with this organization.  I work in support of Goodwill Industries because I see the mission and cause for this organizaiton as being critical for so many in this region.  Goodwill Industries works to give people a hand but not necessarily a hand out.  Through programs at Goodwill, they teach lifeskills and help people build capabilities and therefore, self-sufficiency.  Through "Job Connection" people served by Goodwill are finding meaningful opportunities in the community to be employed and earn a living.  I love to see the morale improvement that comes from a person served by Goodwill learning new skills and then taking those skills to the job market.  That is a large part of why I supporrt Goodwill Industries through participation on the Goodwill Foundation.

Her generous donations of materials and equipment have truly given many others the incentive to also start community gardens. For this and for generally being an awesome force in the sustainable scene in Charleston, the Sustainable Warehouse deserves recognition.

Her efforts have allowed many lower-income homeowners upgrade their dwellings and improve their standard of living using materials that would otherwise find their way to the Bees Ferry Landfill.Rebecca is also an ardent supporter of charities, schools and other non-profits that put her salvaged material to good use.  It is my pleasure to support Rebecca and her efforts with Sustainable Warehouse whenever possible.
Palmetto Equine Awareness & Rescue League	90854		/users/profile/103769	vashsmom	Client Served	5	06/14/2011	Pearl saved the lives of 3 of my horses.  Nicole took charge of my horses after they were abused  and starved by someone who was supposed to be taking care of them. She was able to stabilize 2 of my horses for them to make the very long trip home to FL. Pearl,  the different sheriffs departments and individuals also spent weeks searching for 2 of my other horses that were being hidden and constantly moved by the abuser. One horse was finally turned over to Pearl from the abuser but sadly the abuser had killed my other horse. The horse turned over to Pearl was a walking skeleton by this time, and we really were not sure if she would make it.  After a long rehab with Nicole at Pearl, my Chloe was finally stable enough to make it home to FL. That was over 3  years ago and happily Chloe has recently turned 28 years old and is doing fantastic along with my other 2 , Vash and my mini Mr Nibbles. They are all alive because she cared. Thank you Nicole!
Palmetto Equine Awareness & Rescue League	90070		/users/profile/102645	Rebecca G.	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/08/2011	We first met PEARL when working several cases with the Sherriff's Department.  They got serious about Technical Large Animal Emergency Rescue techniques, and also use natural horsemanship training techniques to work with their cases (horses that have been taken in from abuse and starvation).We were impressed with their "real world" attitude - understanding that we can't save EVERY single horse - that they needed to have a JOB and a FOSTER or ADOPTIVE home that actually would be a good match.  They understand that funds have to be raised by the organization to feed the animals, and they work hard to find homes quickly, working with local veterinarians to ensure follow up care for the animals.We have worked with them since 2005 and have worked several cases with them.  Now they are offering a course in Large Animal Cruelty Investigations to get to the bottom of the problems with disposable animals by EDUCATING law enforcement and animal control officers in their state of SC as well as other states.PEARL is involved in every aspect of the horse industry within the state of SC, from the State Vet's office to Clemson University's public education efforts.  We are proud to be allied with this organization.

Joshua Group Inc	294658		/users/profile/385402	donnafernandez	Client Served	5	07/04/2016	The disease of alcoholism/drug addiction is among the most destructive, debilitating and deadly diseases ever known, No culture, creed, or ethnicity is immune to its deceptive brutality.  Other chronic/terminal illnesses (except brain diseases) attack a patient only physically and any resulting emotional side effects are triggered purely by fear or anger with coping with a terminal illness. These other diseases do not sabotage the victim's attempt to treat the ailment, i.e. when a patient has heart disease the heart doesn't deny undergoing surgery; with diabetes, the pancreas doesn't reject an insulin pump; etc.  However, in active addiction the disease deceives the patient into believing either there is no need for remedy, or that the individual is capable of handling this on his/her own. Consequently, the disease progresses and the patient permeates lies and deception under its wretched influence.With alcoholism/drug addiction, the disease directly invades the entire being from the start and attacks the patient physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.In a deep, dark veil that shrouds the person entirely, it will steal anything, and everything, that defines the stricken individual.  It will deceive him/her into choosing substance abuse over all that was once meaningful/valuable to the afflicted person.Initially, it will create a "euphoric high" (a feeling better than anything previously experienced); it will temporarily relieve physical or emotional pain; it will seem to strengthen an inner weakness or briefly satisfy a void. However, before long, it will plunge you lower than you've ever fallen... steal your dreams and any healthy sense of motivation toward self-improving goals/desires...strip your dignity, self respect and moral integrity...there are no limits to what you may lose, as it will extinguish life itself.  This quite morbid reality is the outcome of an alcoholism/drug addiction path without recovery.HOWEVER, there is endless hope and infinite promise in recovery!  And, for our daughter, that lifesaving rescue happened at Charleston Recovery Center. The most successful healing from this dreaded disease occurs within a strong recovery-seeking community.  Ronnie Byer, his staff, and all members of Ashley Hope House are the most phenomenal "Earth angels" I've ever encountered. The genuine compassion, empathy and heartfelt love each member has for one another is absolutely undeniable and among the most beautiful experiences I've ever shared with a group of people (during each of my visits).  Their accountability and commitment to helping each other is unbelievable. They have traveled the road of malicious wreckage that substance abuse leaves every time and they are determined to reverse it.  The sense of support is remarkably outstanding and, I dare say, there are few places on our planet where miracles happen as often as they do at Ashley Hope House. While completely professional, Ronnie and his staff operate more of a ministry, than a business. Their passion for healing and helping someone seeking recovery is beyond worldly expectations or reality. Rooted in intensive education and practice of the 12-Step Program, Charleston Recovery Center takes it further by fostering daily sharing and healing among all community members. This outreach of service to each other is the key to maintaining long-term sobriety.We are forever grateful to Ronnie and this community for supporting our daughter every step of the way, while coaching her in the tools and discipline necessary to stand on her own while continually helping others in need. The premise of how they operate so successfully is, literally embodied, in the expression: "mutually beneficial". For it is known, that by serving others, we serve ourselves. Beyond doubt, this is the healthiest, most rewarding way for our daughter to continue living.  Words cannot express our profound appreciation and we will highly recommend Charleston Recovery Center. Sincerely,Donna  Fernandezdonnafernandez68@gmail.com678-637-6122

They accept children who have been expelled, suspended, truant or otherwise dropouts from the school system and provide them with supplemental education and strong behavioral management.  It is a volunteer agency that works with the children one-on-one to also provide mentoring and referral services for their families.  It's almost like sending your children to their grandparents home to straighten out issues that the parents are having difficultiy dealing with.  It's an awesome program that also gives the children structure, stability and hope.  They say it's their goal to transition the child back into school academically enlightened and with positive behaviors and attitudes.

It is a good feeling to know that my donations are helping put people to work in the down economic times that we are having.  After I donated on several occasions, I drove around and parked, went into the retail store and during the time I was in the store, the items I just donated hit the sales floor!  That was efficient!  I was so impressed that I actually considered buying back the items I just dropped off!

It is a structured  environment that place the needs of the children first.  My daughter started in May, two months after turning 3, I could see huge advances in her cognitive, social and physical development.  I am a very involved parent and believe that education begins at home.  They enhanced what I was already doing.  If you are a working parent as I am (plus single) you know that the environment your child is in 8 hours out of the day makes a hue difference.  I love this school and the staff and would recommend it to all who would listen.  Most importantly, we have active PTO (close to 100% participation) that work hard to ensure that our children are receiving the best beginning education possible.  A GREAT Choice!!

Flock Together Bird Rescue Inc	199609	5	/users/profile/260574	birdlady1	General Member of the Public	1	05/04/2014	Bird rescues should not be breeding. Yet this "rescue" does. Their current Facebook cover photo is of two hybrid macaws that were bred by the owner of this "rescue." To add insult to injury, she bred two endangered parrots in order to produce these babies. Scrolling through their Facebook page revealed other pairs of birds with nestboxes attached to their cages/flights.  Legitimate rescues are there to place birds in new, loving homes. Just about every rescue in the United States is beyond capacity because a million new birds are added to the marketplace. Too many birds see several homes in their lifetimes and many ultimately end up in rescues. This "rescue" is contributing to the problem of overpopulation by breeding. Anyone interested in adopting a bird should go elsewhere.

However, MAMAS' veterinary services were a serious problem.  She was badly infested with parasites and worms, missing some of the required shots and  unspayed. (There was a scar but the ovaries and uterus were intact.  She went into heat two weeks after I got her and had to be spayed).  When informed of the problems, MAMAS took no responsibility.  I spent more than $1000 to put the dog on a solid footing medically--in addition to the adoption fee that I paid MAMAS. Beware!

While I now understand the process and the rules, I was not pleased with the rudeness of the organiser of the show.She did not greet me or introduce herself and let me know her position, she would not answer basic questions and when I asked if I could have the contact number to speak with the board of directors, she told me I should, "Find  an organization that cares."While the organiser, I do not even kniow her name as she never introduced herself, may do a good job of organising Art in the Park, her manners and rude, uncultured attitude leaves a poor impression of who and what the Waccamaw Arts and Crafts guild is as far as friendliness and professionalism goes.

Each women there had to take turns cooking even if they really didn't know how.  So on top of the disgusting part and lying part was that the staff, the one girl who looked about 18 who didn't even great me at the door, just didn't care at all.

I went in to ask about the commodity supplemental food program and was told by the receptionist the program was closed. I asked for an application and she said she would give me one but they were not accepting new members. No one else was visible on 10/17/2013 when I entered the building, just a large empty room with the desk clerk. She didn't offer any help with other programs or ask if she could assist me in any way. It seemed to me that I was wasting my time even though my grandmother fell well within the eligibility guidelines and struggles with her limited income to make ends meet. I hope that my experience was an aberration and not the kind of help someone in need would get when they contact the organization in person

My wife had started planning a wedding about 9 months in advance. The individual named Lynn Thompson, failed to inform my wife personally, it was on the contract . It was different from the Parks and recreation of North Augusta, (Lynn Thompson) took a check for $1200.00 and only would refund $300.00 for trash pickup . And refused to return the remaining $900.00 after my wife tried to get her money back after 2months and some days. Lynn Thompson has plenty of time to re schedule another event. I believe she is not running this facility to the best interest. That's very harsh ,when she admitted she had actually presented the wrong contract, and failed to tell my wife her contract differs from other parks in North Augusta,S.C.. The contract was non-cancelable once signed. She has had an attorney draw up this contract , to make it difficult to give patrons their money back .BEWARE

Humane Society Of Cherokee County	163401		/users/profile/216935	grassy1	Volunteer	5	07/23/2013	The impact of this organization in our county is immeasurable. The county run animal control facility would be a 100% kill rate were it not for the volunteers working diligently to save the many animals that are brought here. The county provides 0 funding to this organization and it is run solely on donations. 
The Orangeburg Part-Time Players	133334		/users/profile/179042	My Rotti	Client Served	5	11/04/2012	It's great that the city of Orangeburg has such dedicated volunteers to run and perform in the wonderful plays and musicals that are done at this playhouse.  Without this here, the citizens would have to go many miles to find plays of this caliber.

Military Transition Services	191345		/users/profile/249783	kmoreland	Board Member	5	12/21/2013	Too many veteran organizations are worried about how much money they can get to help themselves with salaries and perks. This organization is 100% volunteer and uses all of the funds from its fundraisers to help veterans. We have recently helped a female veterans who was living in her car while trying to go back to college to get her A+ certification to get her own apartment and completely furnish it, and help cover utilities, as well as provide a computer to use for school. We helped another one that was being evicted to have a roof over their head and to help them obtain HUD housing, plus the veterans daughter was able to obtain employment using our job services locator. We are also helping others with resume' writings by professionals, and job placement, such as the male vet who lived in a house with no utilities/heat to obtain a job a $40K job. Other vets who are in sheltered housing are using our services to get back on their feet.
Christian Revival Church Association Inc	253261	1	/users/profile/341426	GeneBrooks	Board Member	5	08/18/2015	This evangelical church planting ministry in Liberia does not just plant churches. It does that very well, but it also has nationally recognized schools and certified teachers, helps the local economies with rice production and feeding programs for children and puts protein in the communities' diets with pig farms, chickens, rabbits, and fish. Dennis T. Aggrey is an awesome leader as well, but there are many leaders in Liberia working for the glory of the Lord and the help of the communities in which their churches are planted.

New Bethel Foundation	264480		/users/profile/353205	Movetobebetter	Board Member	4	10/15/2015	We are a new Foundation but we are on the move, we are opening our doors to the Lexington Community by sponsoring our 3rd Communitywide Harvest Festival "Free to the Public" we provide games, inflatables, bounce houses, trunk a treat, face painting, popcorn, cotton candy, costume contest and a free meal. The first two years of this event was supported by the church congregation and a few donations from outside sources. This event grew from approximately 100  people the first year to about 200 in 2014. We want this to be an annual event because  a lot of children in the community can not afford to attend the State Fair, or a Carnival. So it is our duty as Christians and community workers to provide for the unfortunate. Yes in the 21 century we still have families and individual who need our support.

United Ministries	61627	2	/users/profile/67308	Bruce S.	Volunteer	5	01/29/2011	I have been a volunteer and a donor for over 25 years. United Ministries does an amazing job of getting people back on their feet and participating in life as good productive citizens. There are 5 parts to United Ministries: 1. The Place of Hope day shelter helps homeless people. They can wash their clothes, get a bottle of water in the summer or toiletries, and more importantly, get counseling and case management so they can get off the streets. 2. Emergency Assistance gives deserving people rent and utility deposits, a bag of food, life-saving medications, help with food stamp applications, when they're down and out. But these people are screened to be sure their services aren't being abused as happens sometimes. 3. The Learning Center allows people to get their GED at a pace that fits their schedule and needs. Education is so important. They graduate more people than most high schools! Many of their graduates go on to Greenville Tech. Their results are amazing! 4. Employment Readiness helps people get a job. 5. Our Eyes Were Opened educates people who have resources (not poor people, but people with money who can help) so that they better understand poverty and will then help those who are less fortunate. It helps educators, healthcare workers, business people, law enforcement people and others understand what the poor go through so they can better deal with them. It helps all of us make better decisions with our donations of money and time and our votes. United Ministries is very flexible. If a program isn't working, they will change it so it does or eliminate it. If a new program is needed they will start one. They do amazing work with their limited budget. This agency is a model that should be duplicated in other communities.  The religious philosophy and workings of United Ministries is detailed in Beth Templeton's must-read book, "Loving Our Neighbor - A Thoughtful Approach to Helping People in Poverty" (iUniverse).
Faith Works Pediatric Innervations	99253	1	/users/profile/118820	happyfeet	Volunteer	5	10/13/2011	I have really enjoyed my time that spent at this establishment. All the kids are very happy to come there and excited about the work that they do. The owner is a very faith based person and she treats all the kids and everyone that comes there like family. Everyday there is something new and special going on. I would not trade it for anything. When you walk in the door you are greeted with a smile, good morning or good afternoon. Each child is always treated with the respect. They are a joy to be around and some of them like to come everyday. The company provides a lot of different services for the children as well as the parents. There are workshops that the parents attend and they also have spring fling during the spring vacation. So much of learning and fun with learning is a part of Faithworks. I really enjoy my time there. 
NORTH PALM MINISTRIES INC	108368		/users/profile/147494	costa	Volunteer	1	03/27/2012	Do not give a dollar to this church/ministry.  They proclaim to help the needy and the hispanic community, but in turn they take advantage of them.  Not trustworthy at all and have never divulged their financial statements.

Last Day Healing-Deliverance Center	245905		/users/profile/333130	lacreshia155	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Last Day is an awesome ministry that I found to be placed in the right place at the right time for a people in search of God and what he has in store your our lives. This ministry has been a blessing to me and my family through the prayers of the Pastor, opening arms to me when I felt like no one else cared, and when I was all alone. Last Day was there to lead me back to a place of stability when I had lost all hope. If you have lost your way with yourself and with God, this is the ministry to visit. Your life will never be the same again. They encourage hope, love, forgiveness, salvation, building of leaders, support to single mothers/fathers, support to singles, support and watch care for the elderly, just to name a few.I thank God for placing such a ministry that deals with the whole man. God bless you Pastor Johnson and LDHDC Family!!

Darlington County Cultural Realism Complex	28058	6	/users/profile/29131	phillip	Volunteer	5	02/11/2010	I have worked for CRC INC. for nearly 20-years and I'm very impressed in the manner in which the Executive Director, Mrs. Wilhelmina P. Johnson, has nearly single-handedly re-invigorated the African-American Community with a sense of pride in the City of Darlington, the Pee Dee Area, and S.C. by bridging the gap between School and Home by establishing Historical, Cultural, Educational, and Employment Programs and Services for her community.

Sistercare Inc	277778		/users/profile/331672	dkitner	Volunteer	5	01/22/2016	Sistercare will be a leader in ensuring that the topic of Intimate Partner Violence remains a top priority here in South Carolina, a state ranked  #1 or #2 repeatedly in homicide as a result of domestic violence.  This organization has programs and survivor advocates in all 5 counties surrounding and including the city of Columbia.  They are there before you even know you need them and will stay there until you feel you can make it on our own.  Everyone, from the grant writer to the court advocates, the shelter staff to the community advocates, and the volunteers are professional and passionate.  I am fortunate to have been able to become of part of their team.
Maude Schiffley Chapter S P C A	133332	1	/users/profile/179042	My Rotti	Client Served	5	11/04/2012	I have adopted 3 animals from this organization, and I have been very happy with them all.  They are my constant companions.  The staff were always very helpful when I was there by telling me everything they knew about the animals, including any health or behavior problems.  I applaud the fact that they spay/neuter every animal before it leaves their facility.  We have too many unwanted animals turned loose to fend for themselves because people will not take responsibility for them and let them breed indescrimitly.
Garden Club Of South Carolina Inc	34462	1	/users/profile/35318	kalli	Volunteer	5	04/02/2010	How could there not be a prior review of GCSC?!?!  Garden clubs give so much.  The only thing members get in return is a sense of accomplishment and camaraderie.
Remember	192525		/users/profile/251406	chasgirl	Volunteer	5	01/14/2014	I have given to Remember for several years.  One of the things I appreciate most is that one of the Board members of Remember personally verify every need before they contribute any funds.  This ensures that your donation goes to a legitimate need. I was also able to volunteer on a Remember medical missions trip.  This was an unforgettable experience in which I got so see the needs of persecuted Christians around the world--in this case, specifically in Burma and Kachin refugees in China.  I highly recommend a Remember missions trip!
Boys and Girls Clubs of the Midlands, Inc.	166800		/users/profile/221600	cdrop1971	Client Served	1	09/03/2013	I have used the boys and girls club for several years and never had a problem until recently. At the begining of this school year, my child had a credit to her account. When I registared her I was assured that the organization would us the monetary credit in her account before charging my bank account. This did not take place I was charged through my bank and this caused an overdraft fee to be assessed to my account. I spoke with several people including management in the finacial office about this and was basicly told sorry but we are not going to reimburse you this. I was also told that their finance department and the automated  payment system do not communicate in any way. I think this needs to be fixed immediately. I am extrememly dissappointed at this as, I feel it could have been handled so much better than it was.

Penn Center Inc	238610		/users/profile/323958	MJP08	Board Member	5	02/26/2015	Penn Center is a non-profit organization that helps to keep the efforts of civil reformation alive in the minds and eyes of those who visit or have been impacted by it.  The staff and volunteers do a great job in providing the customer service representative of what the organization stands for.  The information provided in the museum and book store gives a great depiction of life during the development of Penn Center's time period.  A great takeaway from a visit to Penn Center is the book detailing its history. 
Phoenix Rising Border Collie Rescue Of South Carolina	195741	1	/users/profile/255966	scresident	General Member of the Public	1	03/17/2014	I take animal adoption very seriously.  I have a beautiful home and large yard for raising a border collie.  We also do not have children.  However, I am not impressed with the adoption process.  We were told that it was a chance that we would receive a beautiful border collie.  The inspector inspected my home and asked me many questions about my life.  I was told that Phoenix was very interested in me and another family in Georgia and that I would be contacted once they made their selection.  I received, by email, a letter stating that they chose a family in North Carolina.  When I inquired about the selection, the foster parent told me that they did not want the dog to stay outside.  However, we had not intention of keeping the dog outside.  The border collie was intended to be an inside dog.  They also stated that the family in North Carolina  would take the dog on trips.  We take trips also.  They made up excuses on why I did not get the dog and falsified the information given.  I would not suggest going through this agency.  They already know who they want to adopt their border collies and will just waste your time.  
Metanoia	148616	1	/users/profile/197912	katk21	Volunteer	5	01/28/2013	Metanoia is a great organization.  They truly teach the member of the community how to be successful on their own.  They help in a way that will create a long last sustainable success.  The children are taught valuable life skills and character traits from 1st grade and these are taught all the way through high school.  They are taught skills such as interviewing, filling out applications and other valuable real life skills.

They do a great job finding homes for the babies that are brought in, dumped off and abandoned. They don't put dog's down just because they are a certain breed. They treat all breeds the same no matter what.  The kennels are clean and the staff is helpful and friendly. I visit the animals often and try to network what they have on my Pet group on Facebook, I have also adopted from them .  Love this place and I support them 100%
Roper Mountain Science Center Association	196299	1	/users/profile/256614	tommiereece	General Member of the Public	4	03/24/2014	While most of what RMSCA does is to sponsor active and hands-on lessons in science and social studies to school classes Monday-Friday, some of the same exciting programs are open to the public.  The planetarium shows every Friday night are awesome in the full-dome setting, enabling us to really see and learn about our heavens.  The monthly Second Saturday events, such as Engineering Day, STEM Fest and even the Blueberry Festival, are a great way to be introduced to and explore all fields of science, math and engineering.  We are lucky to have this entity focus on STEM learning as well as provide a natural setting with the Living History Farm right in the city.  They seem to operate very effectively, being frugal with limited resources, as they plan to upgrade and expand with the future.  They are welcoming to volunteers and need additional ones.

Hammond School	48762	3	/users/profile/49954	cretch	Donor	2	07/27/2010	Here is just a quick observation from looking at the data: they laid off two people this year under the pretense of budget concerns, while nearly tripling the tuition revenues in the last ten years. And, as I pointed out in detail below, administrative salaries have risen much faster than faculty salaries. All of the following is from the 1997-1998 and 2007-2008 form 990s:Tuition1997-1998 $3.6 million2007-2008 $10.2 millionNet Assets (line 21, page 1)1997-1998 $2.2 million2007-2008 $13.98 millionTotal Expenses (IV-B e)1997-1998 $4.4 million2007-2008 $11.95 millionSalaries (line 26)1997-1998 $2.6 million2007-2008 $6.4 millionAdministrative salaries (2008-2009):1) De Pencier - $277,611 (+$35,000 = $312,611?) || 2007-2008: $204,750 || 2006-2007: $195,0002) Michael Collins - $234,2913) Bob Davis - $167,512 || 2007-2008: $161,408 || 2006-2007: $155,3504) Chris Angel - $129,485 || 2007-2008: $113,530 || 2006-2007: $104,4205) Julie Brooks - $101,047In other words, every single administrator received a pay raise every year. Some were substantial (Chris Angel got 14%!). This is after raises from the previous year, and while faculty pay was frozen!Here are the year over year percent changes in salaries for the same positions from 07-08 to 08-09: (calculated as increase divided by original)1) De Pencier: +35.6% ($204 to $277)2) Bob Davis: +3.8% ($161 to $167.5)3) Chris Angel: +14.1% ($113.5 to $129.5)Here is what some other top people made in 2007-2008.Blair Lowery: $91,000Matt Radtke: $81,000Tracie Ifkovits: $85,500Herb Barks: $75,000 (part V-B)Paul Ragan: $72,800Here's 2006-2007:Herb Barks: $113,000 (section V-B)Rick McCormick (MS Head): $84,892Julia Moore (Admissions): $66,720Tracie Ifkovits: $75,850Paul Ragan: $69,600Here are the year over year percent changes in salaries for the same positions from 06-07 to 07-08:Adam De Pencier: +5.0%Bob Davis: +3.9%Chris Angel: +8.7%Blair Lowery: +7.2%Matt Radtke: +21.4%Tracie Ifkovits: +12.7%Paul Ragan: +4.6%Check out the "Mortgages and Notes Payable" section near the end of the 2007-2008 form. They increased the debt load of the school by $8.7 million dollars in June 2005 with two loans from Carolina First Bank, ostensibly for construction. While the $3.7 million loan has a 5.7% interest rate and is being repaid normally, strangely enough, the other $5 million loan is being paid interest only and neither of the forms (2007, 2008) have the interest rate listed for that loan. So one has to wonder how much the school is spending by having an interest-only loan at an unknown rate?

South Carolina Coastal Conservation League Inc	287849	1	/users/profile/377978	Scott140	General Member of the Public	1	05/01/2016	An open letter to Dana BeachExecutive Director (Godfather) of the CCL***********************************************************************************Since founding the Coastal Conservation League in 1989, Dana has received awards from many institutions, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the South Carolina General Assembly, and the American Institute of Architects. In 1998, Dana was named one of ten Heroes for the Planet by Time Magazines, Time for Kids.***********************************************************************Sounds like Dana & the CCL are Super Heroes.  Or are you really Super Villains? This may have been before you and others at the Coastal Carolina League decided that a culture of corruption would greatly benefit the financial status of the organization & incidentally add to your own income potential.The CCL no better than the Wounded Warriors Project that has given very little to American Veterans, while lining the pockets of organization executives.Thankfully Current National & Social Media coverage of this organizations practices, has deeply hurt their formerly successful fund raising efforts.The plan is to continue efforts to do the same to the Coastal Conservation League  so you decide  do you want contributions from Environmentally Concerned Citizens & Organizations  or do you want to rely on your game plan and continue to seek Tribute in the form of bogus Mitigation Funds from entities such as Businesses, Agencies & Taxpayers in South Carolina?The Rape of Boeing, Volvo & the Port of Charleston at 5 million each may have bolstered your Assets over the past few years (10 million Dollars Plus)  but it has hurt the economy of our state and the taxpayers who support the state. For years Americans, have been fighting Corporate Greed and now it looks like we have to add so called Non-Profit Charitable Greed to the list.The rambling case you presented in the South Carolina Administrative Court will result in Horry County getting a positive judgement from the Court.  It seems Amy Armstrongs selection of witnesses as well as the presentation of CCL demands is juvenile.  Going from Bears, Birds & Plant concerns to Tunnels, Fences, Lanes, Cutoffs & Future Development only shows that she is grasping at any straw that will break the back of the International Drive Paving Project.  As anyone can see, (and Im sure the Judge will agree), your case has gone from merely trying to protect the environment to totally halting any improvements to the area and its taxpayers. And most disturbingly you actually have the GALL to use the taxpayer supported Court System against any opponent i8n order to reach your shakedown goals.Ok, you now know the complaints against your methods of doing business (as if you havent seen many comments on your face book page which no longer allows comments from non-approved citizens of this state to be published).Here is what is going to happen until you stop taking Horry County to Court.  The CCL will be fought through the print media (including Letters To The Editor) , broadcast, and social media showing that your organization is no better than the Wounded Warriors Project & every other non-profit that has been set up to scam contributors and so-called recipients of donated funds.  Every other Organization that is overstaffed with so called experts.  Every other Organization that has lavish offices, holds high priced conferences and supports expensive, yet incompetent legal counsel.Its time to let it go, and allow Horry County to Pave International Drive WITHOUT Bear Tunnels (leading to future residential areas), and with 4 lanes and as many cutoffs as will be needed for future expansion of homes and businesses that will spread out the taxpayer base.Enough Is Enough!Then we will make sure that every future project that is within the CCLs area of concern is informed that thru Self-Mitigation (like plans for I 73 from Route 95 to Myrtle Beach) the CCLs business as usual (Extortion) will not occur.Heres the question.Do you want the CCL to be considered a Super Hero or a Super Villain?

Evangel Fellowship International	121814	1	/users/profile/165756	laura.c.zim	Donor	1	09/02/2012	I have been a donor since 2006, hoping that my donations were going to help an orphanage/nutrition center and feeding center down in Managua and Tipitapa Nicaragua. I then heard that there were discrepancies in where the money was designated to go and where it actually ended up going. Long story short, I requested financial records and information to assure me that money was going where I thought it was. They assured me they would return a report. Two months have gone by with no response even after I requested one a second time. This organization has confirmed to me that they are not accountable to anyone - even those that are funding it.

Greenville Rape Crisis and Child Abuse Center	210189	1	/users/profile/272941	JYounginer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/11/2014	Imagine yourself in the shoes of an innocent child who is being abused. Imagine the confusion and anger you feel. Imagine wondering if your home is safe. Imagine thinking theres nowhere left to turn, and you discover a place that can help. Now imagine you are not alone. As an abused child, spouse or sexual assault victim, you meet others just like you who overcame the unspeakable things that happened. Thats exactly why the Julie Valentine Center is here, to help people in your shoes. Our inspiration comes from an infant who was found deceased in a wooded area here in Greenville on a cold February day in 1990. The police named her Julie Valentine. Adopted by the community, her legacy has become a symbol of hope for those who have survived rape or child abuse. The Julie Valentine Center works to stop sexual violence and child abuse.

Einstein Learning Center Inc	99322	1	/users/profile/118949	cassgorton	Volunteer	1	10/14/2011	I was a volunteer, donor and parent to a student at this institution.  Over the course of more than a year, we were repeatedly told that certain services (ex:  Interactive Metronome, autism support,  individualized educational plans) were part of the program, then told they were not available because of lack of funds, lack of staff, etc.   Meanwhile, virtually all fund raising money went to a "future building" fund, versus the program itself, while donors and participants were led to believe it went to the children being served.    The school was in operation for more than 5 years before bylaws were written.   A board member wrote a proposal in July 2011 expressing concerns that the school was not providing promised services, but his proposal was not approved.   Turnover of students enrolled May 2011 to September 2011 is follows:  of 25 students,   five "graduated", and seven elected to leave.   That's more than 25%.    Since leaving,  we have learned from the secretary of State's office that the school failed to file either an application or exemption to solicit funds in South Carolina for 2010 or 2011, although the Gala event netted more than $14,000 October 2010.  Money which went to the "future building fund" vs the children being "served".    Or not.

I am a professional in the field (an academic administrator) and am involved with Cherry Hill because I believe it is a critically important part of the emerging infrastructure supporting Paganism.  We may all have our own clerical training and traditions, but Pagan leaders could almost universally benefit from some augmentation, such as getting a background in pastoral counseling.  This also provides a mechanism for structuring continuous learning, which is important for Pagan leaders.

Girl Scouts of the Congaree Area, Inc.	237572		/users/profile/322308	KarenLeeMitchell	Board Member	5	02/03/2015	This is a well run and smart organization.  In 2007 three G. S. councils merged into a brand new council consisting of half the state.  The merger was successful because the three councils did research and made the hard decisions before they merged, not after they were together.  Everyone knew what was expected.    They also created an entirely new entity, not just putting themselves into one of the three councils.    The way this merger was done created a tradition of doing things thoughtfully and for the long term.  That tradition is being carried on today.
Door of Hope 4 Teens	39979	4	/users/profile/40922	godsbabygirl	Client Served	5	05/21/2010	The first time that I spoke with Debra from Door of Hope 4 Teens, for the first time in years, I felt like someone actually cared. At the time I was surrounded by so much darkness, I truely believed that I was going to die unhappy. After a few months of talking with Debra and the counselors from Door of Hope I ended up moving to New York to live with Debra and her family. I lived "in the Door of Hope" for two months, and in those two months I learned what it meant to be a Child of God. I recieved so much support, love, and encouragment that I was able to break free from a huge bondage in my life while living with Debra and I could never thank her enough. Door of Hope 4 Teens has been there for me every step of the way in my road to recovery, and I can say from my heart that without Debra, Door of Hope 4 Teens, and God I would not be where I am today.

Anderson Interfaith Ministries (AIM)	126980	4	/users/profile/172014	Carrie-Michal M.	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	Anderson Interfaith Ministries (AIM) is a wonderful non-profit organization that focuses on several important needs in the community of Anderson County. The biggest programs are Emergency Assistance, Hunger Ministries, and Women and Children Succeeding (WACS). The WACS program is now in the process of replication in the state of South Carolina. AIM began in 1989 as a result of churches coming together to eliminate duplicated help and serve those who were not being helped. AIM is led by an educated and trained team of professional workers who give their all to serve the community, whether through direct service or through capacity building. AIM currently has over five hundred active volunteers who serve in all five buildings on the campus. There are six main programs at AIM that serve those in need, but there are other smaller programs that run seasonally. In order to receive help from AIM, clients must go through an interview process. This way AIM hopes to serve those truly in need and to avoid duplication of help.

I have been a resident of Safe Passage since June 18,2013 and can't say enough good things about this DV shelter. The resources it provides are great from advocacy to therapy to financial planning to parenting classes. They have provided food, transportation and most important support. The residental shelter director Chris Pelligrano is the best person I have ever met, besides my own mother. Her determination and focus are amazing and well admired and respected. She couldn't possible get paid enough for all her caring and support. They have also provide legal advocacy and excellent one-on-one counseling. I'm am truly greatful for everything they have done for me and all their support and would encourage anyone who can afford to donate to help support this nonprofit organization to help the many women and children who are in domestic violence situations get out. If you need help, this is the place to be. You must be willing to do the work to change but you will get all the support and encouragement possible. The staff is very helpful and always willing to listen and offer advise. Thanks you Safe Passage for all that you do! Keep up the great work because you are changing lives...

Jesus Is Lord Balloon Ministries	277704		/users/profile/367528	Writer	Client Served	5	01/22/2016	When my wife Teresa and I got marred back in 1995. I had planned for us to leave the wedding  in a Hot air balloon, but the weather did not cooperateI wanted to do something special for my wife, so I looked into taking her on a balloon ride before it is was to late.The prices that I found was $400 per person. = $800 for the both of us.I sent an email to the Balloon Federation Of America to see if any of their members would be able to help us with a possible cheaper rate that we could afford.On 10/02/14 I got a call from a man by the name of Don Bell. He said that, the email had been forwarded to him and that he wanted to help.He said that he runs the Jesus Is Lord Balloon Ministry  out of Lexington SC and would like to take up for a ride, at no charge to us. He said that he was lead to help out.I talked to my wife about it and she said that the 3 Hr. ride there and back would just be too much for her.I called Don back and thanked him for the offer, but the long ride would be just too much.Don then said that he had already made arrangements for him and his crew to come to our small town to take us up in the balloon.Don set up his balloon, less than 2 miles from our house. When we got there, they were just setting up the balloon.When the balloon was up, I picked up my wife out of the car and carried her over to the balloon and the other men there put her wheelchair in the gondola and I lifted her up and over into her wheelchair.Then we were up, up and away. We stayed up about 30 min, passing right over our own home.The 30 min right was good enough because I do not think that she needed to be out of her hospital bed for very much longer.I do not think that anything else that I could have done for her, could have made her more happy that this experience.Teresa Passed away on 01/04/15

Center For Counseling & Wellness	276594	1	/users/profile/366397	Writer	Client Served	1	01/14/2016	Please do not donate money to this "non profit".  They are unwilling to share their financial information to the public as required by federal law.  They claim to offer free and reduced services yet their sliding scale fee begins at $35.00 an hour for counseling... not affordable for the poor and un or under employed without benefits.  Try Coastal Samaritan Counseling Center instead.
Chapman Cultural Center Inc	100272	1	/users/profile/121911	Lamideel	General Member of the Public	4	11/03/2011	Having recently moved to the Upstate I learned about the Chapman Cultural Center through a friend.  I've attended a few  events at the Chapman and have enjoyed each and every one.  The last event I went to was to see a Russian Dance Troop - they were very good.   The Chapman Cultural Center is really a beautiful facility.  The theater is gorgeous, not too big where you would have to worry about not being able to see or hear well at any event.  The parking there is not a problem, they have a brand new parking garage that was recently built. There seems to be something for everyone there.  I recently learned that there are pottery classes available.  I'm eager to learn about other upcoming classes and events that may interest me.   I'd love to see more progams showing diversity, have more cultures highlighted.  I think the Chapman provides events that you will not find anywhere else in the Upstate.  I look forward to seeing what else the Chapman will be planning for the future.

I could not be more proud to be part of this organization! As a Board member, one of my duties is to help ensure that funds go where they are most needed. One of the goals of RosaLuz is to be transparent with their donors and they share pictures and videos to show supporters the tangible difference they make in the life of children. Truly a small charity worth supporting! It is made up of a small group of people with a passion for kids and Big hearts. They are dedicated to changing kid's lives for the better and I can not imagine not being a part of that change and watching RosaLuz grow.

Cindy Roof Wilkerson Foundation	260240	1	/users/profile/348806	RosalieSmith	Board Member	5	09/30/2015	The Cindy Roof Wilkerson Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit Educational Corporation, was established to fulfill the dreams of Mrs. Cindy Roof Wilkerson, a 27-year veteran PE teacher, who passed suddenly in 2012 from brain tumor complications.  Her  life, though brief, influenced thousands, including her students at the University of South Carolina.  Mrs. Wilkerson dreamed of building an outdoor healthy fitness park where her students and their families could come after school hours and together enjoy being back in the out-of-doors; a park that provided unique outdoor classrooms  students could enjoy during the school day.  In 2011, she began pulling together her team which included parents, teachers and community volunteers.  Work began.  In February 2012, the community was devastated when it lost Cindy.  After her passing, the park was appropriately renamed "Cindy's Place" in her honor.  The first outdoor fitness park became a joint use collaboration between the local school district, the town, and the local elementary school where Cindy taught for 27 years, the only one of its kind in the State of South Carolina. Future initiatives include a healthy nutrition agenda, outdoor amphitheater, installation of special needs fitness equipment, a college scholarship program for students interested in areas of health, PE and nutrition.   All proceeds donated to the foundation are restricted for these purposes.  For more information, visit www.crwilkersonfoundation.org   Thanks to our community and industry partners.
DOCHAS N GRA HOPE AND LOVE RESCUE	277990		/users/profile/367858	Monica79	Volunteer	5	01/25/2016	Dochas N Gra is a rescue like no other! They don't take in cute puppies or purebred so they can make a quick adoption, they take in terminally ill or injured animal and help them medically. If it is loving and lessening their pain and loneliness from a dyeing animal, to loving and helping a animal that has been badly injured to thrive and have a normal life with a loving family. This rescue is one you don't find everyday. They take in animals they know won't live long and shower them with love and kisses. Then when they cross the bridge, it breaks her heart yet she wipes her tears away and takes in another animal in need. She truly is the most compassionate person I know.

Iwag Puppy Rescue Inc	255125	3	/users/profile/343496	HarryDen	Volunteer	1	09/06/2015	I am writing this because I believe that anyone reading this should know That the operators of this nonprofit  by Victoria and Jack are actually running a fake operation/ scam using their non profit status as a tax dodge.  The address they use for their "shelter" is actual a thrift store where they charge people rent to operate thrift booths and then take a cut of everything sold. They do take in  puppies (ONLY PUPPIES because they resell for profit) from time to time but these pups are never seen by Vets and are resold for $95.00 to $200.00 all profit.  They only operate in cash transactions and pay their employees only in cash so that there is no paper trail. These two con artists are scamming the entire nonprofit community, public, and sadly the good hearts of those who donate to their "so called" cause.  All donations to this fraud are just pocketed by these two people. If you read this spread the word letting people know what these scam artists are doing. 
All 4 Paws	198362		/users/profile/259074	JulieST67	Volunteer	5	04/19/2014	All 4 Paws is an amazing animal advocate group. They go above and beyond in adoptions, education and animal care. I have volunteered for other groups locally and was highly disappointed until I found All 4 Paws. I cannot say enough about the founders and staff. Their facility is beautiful, staff unbelievably caring and their animals are treated and cared for top notch. If anyone is interested in volunteering, adopting or donating to an animal welfare organization in this area All 4 Paws is the ONLY group that I have found that is ethical and they go out of their way to help the community. Two thumbs up and greatly appreciated as a community resource! 
Women Of Distinction Network	286739		/users/profile/376809	Vanessa_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	My Inspiration for GivingMy inspiration for giving began in 2011 when my daughter, Teaira turned 16. Teaira was a very smart girl, but had very low self-esteem, had a hard time making friends, and was very unsure about her future. My husband and I discussed the problem and decided that a mentor or a youth program would be helpful to her. We were surprised to find out that most mentoring programs were income contingent, were very expensive, or automatically disqualified our daughter because she didnt live in a single parent home. I started talking with other mothers and women in my community and realized that they were having the same problem. The non-profit organizations in our area did not support or focus on the needs of middle income families. This inspired me to create an organization that would support everyone in our community based on need and not income.Fast forward to 2012, my inspiration to help children in need led to the formation of Women of Distinction Network. This organization is comprised of 13 ladies, who work together to mentor young girls, empower other women, and assist people in need within our local community.  In 2013, we were able to mentor our first group of young ladies and offer two, $500.00 scholarships.  Since then, we have started offering brand new laptop computers as part of our scholarship program. This strategy allow us to mentor young girls and women for college and meet a need that is based solely on an essay and a desire to attend college. It warms my heart to see a young woman smile, because of our desire to support her college journey and to motivate her. Every time that I have the opportunity to mentor a young girl, encourage another woman, or give out a laptop, I am once again inspired by my daughter, Teaira. Her life completely changed when her Youth Pastor became her mentor. Her self-esteem improved and she was excited about attending college and making new friends. I pray that I have the same impact on the girls I mentor and that they become successful women who give back to another woman and their community. I also pray that Women of Distinction Network will continue to make a difference in the lives of individuals in our community through mentoring, motivating and uplifiting.

SEWEE Association	113290		/users/profile/154170	srafalowski	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/30/2012	I have worked with Julie and Karen at SEWEE Association for years and am fortunate to have a variety of excellent experiences to partner with them and observe their great work! SEWEE Association programming bridges the gap between classroom learning and real-world experiences for young people to see, touch and absorb the natural world. They provide core professional development for teachers to integrate experiential, environmental-based learning into the required state standards. With a small staff they manage to serve teachers and students in at least 3 different school districts with their Earth Stewards program and many, many more through their on-site programs. It is also important to note that staff at SEWEE are quick to work together to provide the highest quality programs through their facility and to the teachers that they work with. The partners that work with the SEWEE Association also speak to their high-quality of programming; SC Department of Natural Resources, Center for Ocean Sciences Education and Excellence, Environmental Education Association of SC, Earth Force and The Center for Birds of Prey just to name a few. We are fortunate to have the SEWEE Association working every day to shepherd our youth as well as the general public through the protected spaces that carry such value in our beautiful, lowcountry home. Thanks to them for tirelessly working to foster future generations of environmental stewards!

Many are victims of domestic violence.+The shelter program is holistic: providing job search help, transportation to jobs, mental health counseling, substance abuse counseling, parenting, and addresses other issues that occurs in healthy living.+Women leaving the program after completion are able to live in a healthy manner, reunite if possible with their families, have jobs, and a place to live.THE Participants start with nothing and needing help from programs to becoming productive members of society, They have healthy life styles, work, pay taxes, and are often able to reunite with family members.DEFINITELY A GREAT INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE THAT CHANGES THEIR LIVES.

This group does a wonderful job of saving these poor souls that would not have anywhere else to go.  I adopted a beautiful senior pyr from this group in January, 2015.  He was the sweetest Great Pyrenees that we had ever met.  Even with his medical problems, they took excellent care of him during his 4+ year stay with the rescue and he had been used at their fundraiser events.  That was a testament to how well they had worked with him.  He went from being a shelter dog with two strikes already against him because he was a special needs dog to becoming a loved family member.  Since that time, I have tried to help network dogs that they have available through the internet and have had many interactions with Alli Rathert, the director of K9.5.  She is a wonderful person to work with and has a great compassion and understanding for these animals and goes above and beyond to make sure they are all part of her family.
