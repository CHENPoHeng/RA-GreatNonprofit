Youthlinc	308460	1	/users/profile/399839	BrookeBurningham	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	Youthlinc is an amazing nonprofit organization that I have been a part of for many years. They promote both local and international service and do a fantastic job in "creating lifetime humanitarians." I would recommend this organization to anyone!
Youthlinc	306647		/users/profile/397921	barajas_elizabeth12	Client Served	5	09/26/2016	Youthlinc is truly a great nonprofit organization, creating lifetime humanitarians. It has made an immense impact in my life and of those I love. I really enjoyed every moment of my experience with Youthlinc, starting from the beginning of my trip to actually going on the trip. It helped me become more confident, a better team member, and a hard worker. I would extremely recommend Youthlinc to any person who want to help other people either in their community or internationally. I will always remember Youthlinc, as the start of my lifetime as a humanitarian. 
Youthlinc	306027		/users/profile/397295	ToshinaYoung1	Volunteer	5	09/22/2016	My experience with Youthlinc was absolutely incredible and life changing! Thanks to my team leaders Britnie and Justin Powell, who lead our Madagascar trip through crazy ups and downs smoothly and with low stress. The experience in Madagascar was unmatchable and unforgettable! Thanks to this program, I have built and discovered skills I didn't know I possessed or had a passion for that I wouldn't have been able to discover without this incredible program!
Youthlinc	303302		/users/profile/394463	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/12/2016	The last two service trips that I have served with Youthlinc have been life changing, and I would not be the person I am today without the experience of a third world country. The culture was so different in both Madagascar and Cambodia, which exposes young adults to new people and new traditions that don't exist in their own country. I gained leadership skills from my previous trips and I feel more confident in acting as a role model for other students in the organization.  I love Youthlinc and I am excited to serve another year!
Youthlinc	302789		/users/profile/393937	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/07/2016	I had the experience of a lifetime working with Utah Youthlinc. It was amazing working with people both locally and abroad.  This was a life changing humanitarian effort for me.  The opportunity to experience another culture and get to know the love and warmth of the Cambodian people, without my family, allowed me to grow as a person.  At the end of my stay in the village, it was hard to say my goodbyes.  I can only hope that we helped to change and touch their lives for the better.  Thank you for allowing me this once in a lifetime chance.
Youthlinc	302528		/users/profile/393662	hindsammy	Volunteer	5	09/03/2016	Youthlinc is an amazing non-profit organization. You do local community service hours and out of the the country service. Last year I learned so much volunteering. Without Youthlinc I probably wouldn't have volunteered at different places. Going to another country and helping others there was a whole new experience for me and seeing how different other people live from me and seeing how we also aren't that different in life. I have just learned so much from Youthlinc.
Youthlinc	302065		/users/profile/393189	Annie U.	Volunteer	5	08/31/2016	Youthlinc has given me the opportunity to voice my opinion and make a change for those not only in my community but also by serving a village on my service trip just this passing June in Thailand! Being a young adult in today's world can sometimes consist of being labeled by some ageists of other generations as 'lazy, glued to our phones, and selfish.' However, by participating in service we are able to stand up for our beliefs to make the world better, make a change, be productive and bring a smile to a stranger which we never knew we could love so dearly. Youthlinc brings people together and gives us opportunities to open our hearts and to learn together, unifying the youth of our world, future generations to come, and allows us to define ourselves instead of accepting the words tossed around by those who doubt us. Whoever says you're too small to make a difference is wrong, because with Youthlinc I was shown that that statement is far from incorrect. 
Youthlinc	301983		/users/profile/393099	Cassandra18	Volunteer	5	08/31/2016	Youthlinc was an amazing experience! Youthlinc helped me get more involved in serving others locally and in Guatemala. It was an unique experience that helped me learn more about myself and more about what life looked like outside of the US. Although I ended most days in Guatemala covered in cement, it was worth is because I got to help other people and changed their lives. My Youthlinc teams was able to put cement floors in 37 Guatemalan houses. We also taught kids and adults English, taught people how to use sewing machines, taught people how to cut hair, and we were able to give and install stoves into different houses. I would highly recommend Youthlinc to anyone who wants to be more involved in service.
Youthlinc	301968		/users/profile/393077	John403	Volunteer	5	08/30/2016	Great experience! I had so much fun as a member on the Peru team. The trip didn't even feel like community service because of all of the amazing people you worked with and visited. Would recommend to any and everyone.
Youthlinc	301855		/users/profile/392913	ethan12345	Volunteer	5	08/30/2016	Youthlinc was an awesome experience, an experience of a lifetime! Their equal focus on local and international service truly helped instill a desire to serve. With an 80 hour minimum local service qualification, all members of Youthlinc had to sacrifice a lot in order to be eligible for this trip. We had to put other things on hold as we diligently worked to get 80 hours. And the international service was an experience I would not trade for anything. Seeing the eyes of Malagasy men, women, and children light up over the smallest things was something I will not forget. We worked alongside the people and helped make lasting impacts. We did not just go in and throw money at a problem. The experience I had with Youthlinc is something I am immensely grateful for! It has changed my life for the better and I hope to be able to continue to serve as Youthlinc has inspired me to do so well. 
Youthlinc	301846		/users/profile/392903	Kumen S.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2016	This organization has given me the opportunity to change the lives of those locally and internationally. I had the chance to travel to Peru and help the villagers of Santa Isabel. It was an amazing experience and something I will never forget. 
Youthlinc	301805		/users/profile/392839	erinstella	Volunteer	5	08/29/2016	Youthlinc provides the best experience out there! I went on a trip to Madagascar last summer and I can honestly say it was an experience like no other. Youthlinc is very organized and fun to be a part of. I think the best part is that you not only get to serve internationally but locally as well. 
Youthlinc	301801		/users/profile/392832	your	Volunteer	5	08/29/2016	Youthlinc is amazing!!! You learn so much during your service year, and experience more then you could possibly imagine during your international trip.
Youthlinc	301795		/users/profile/392811	karben	Client Served	5	08/29/2016	There are a lot of organizations that take students on international humanitarian trips, but Youthlinc is the best program to go with. Not only do you get the opportunity to serve people internationally, Youthlinc gives students the chance to become more involved within their own community. Serving locally truly does create lifetime humanitarians which changes the lives of all those who work with Youthlinc. I would recommend Youthlinc to anyone who is passionate about service.
Youthlinc	301763		/users/profile/392756	Sage O.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2016	Extremely amazing and eye opening. Most fun I have ever had lots of hard work that paid off.
Youthlinc	301759		/users/profile/392752	mandybyh2o	Volunteer	5	08/28/2016	I had such and AMAZING experience with Youthlinc. They are an amazing organization. And are very put together and know what they are doing!! I had such an incredible experience with the touring of the country and also being able to put myself to work and help out such amazing people. Youthlinc definitely should be one of your top choices for a non-profit organization. Love every second of it!!! 
Youthlinc	301758		/users/profile/392751	izikmarley	Volunteer	5	08/28/2016	I had the best time I have ever had in my life. I got to meet so many people that i made connections with. Youthlinc has changed my life.
Youthlinc	301726		/users/profile/392717	madelinej242	Volunteer	5	08/28/2016	Youthlinc is an amazing non-profit that allows people to learn the importance of service not only internationally but also locally. It helps you gain perspective about the world and also your community and what you can do to help. The experience I had with youthlinc was unforgettable and I'm so excited to be working with them again.
Youthlinc	301722		/users/profile/392711	camcam	Volunteer	5	08/28/2016	Madagascar was my second youthlinc trip. My first trip was several years ago to Cambodia. There really aren't words for what Youthlinc has done for me in my life. It has truly changed me forever. I would recommend it to everyone! With Youthlinc you are able to be completely invested in your international trip due to the experiences you get to have each month for a year leading up to the trip. You are able to do local service, plan out projects that will be done in country, fundraise, and work with your team to create a successful trip. This makes the trip so much more meaningful. I will never forget the things both Cambodia and Madagascar have taught me. I have learned what true humility is, how to serve, how to work, and how to love. I have learned that we all speak the same language- it just may sound a little different. I have learned that even the littlest things can make a difference and change the world. The experiences I have had thanks to Youthlinc will forever remain close to my heart and for that I will be forever grateful 
Youthlinc	301634		/users/profile/338251	Hwilk	Volunteer	5	08/27/2016	About a year ago I joined Youthlinc as a service student and went to Cambodia as my international site. It was the best experience of my life and I'm so grateful for it! The organization is very well planned and executed. Everything that needed to happen for successful travel and productivity on site happened because of the preparation and help Youthlinc provided. Not only was serving a phenomenal experience but I was able to meet so many people who will be life long friends and I developed better leadership, communication and responsibility skills. I'm so grateful for Youthlinc! 
Youthlinc	250411	1	/users/profile/338251	Hwilk	Volunteer	5	07/28/2015	Youthlinc is an incredible organization. I was a participant for the 2015 service year. I went to Cambodia, and it was incredible. Youthlinc helped me all along the way and they truly do an amazing job. I'm so grateful for the opportunity I had to work with Youthlinc. Life changing! 
Youthlinc	301606		/users/profile/392581	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/26/2016	Youthlinc does such an amazing job at creating lifetime humanitarians and by making a difference in the local community by requiring local service hours. 
Youthlinc	301601		/users/profile/392575	graceklekas	Volunteer	5	08/26/2016	Youthlinc is such an amazing program and it does not doubt to create lifetime humanitarians. I had the experience to go to Madagascar on a service trip in 2016 and it will be something I will never forget. We got to help kids in 3rd world countries learn about our culture and our language, we helped build a classroom for children to learn in, taught women how to see and garden, basically helped these people learn how to have a more civil life. It was honestly just heartwarming to leave this place knowing we left it better than we found it. 
Youthlinc	301555		/users/profile/392506	alicebarnett	Volunteer	5	08/25/2016	Youthlinc is a nonprofit based in Salt Lake City, Utah dedicated to making lifetime humanitarians. The time I spent in Kathmandu, Nepal with Youthlinc were easily the best two weeks of my life. I made so many strong friendships and learned so much about a new culture that was completely foreign to me. I got many leadership opportunities within my team, and was constantly busy doing construction work, teaching English lessons, going on home visits, getting to meet some of the most amazing families with the most humbling stories. I knew within a few days of being on Nepal that I wanted to continue to serve the international community as an alum leader for Youthlinc. (and I am going on another trip in the summer of 2016)  I absolutely love Youthlinc, their mission statement, and the amazing things that they continue to do year after year for those less fortunate than us in third world countries. I would highly recommend Youthlinc to anyone who is looking to serve both their local and international communities, to take on leadership rolls, and to get out of their comfort zone and try something completely new. - Alice Barnett
Youthlinc	301479		/users/profile/392413	lilsabel16	Volunteer	4	08/24/2016	I love youthlinc. They are so unique in their program and I love how they are involved in community work and they have an amazing travel program. Such a great experience for any age and I love the adult leaders they have as that lead the discussions and all of the organization is incredible. Such an amazing year. Such an amazing program.
Youthlinc	301465		/users/profile/392397	Spencer B.	Volunteer	5	08/24/2016	I was first involved with Youthlinc in 2011 when I was a senior in high school. I applied to the program because I wanted to not be so focused on myself and because I honestly thought it would look good on college resume's. I had a great experience going to Thailand and volunteering many hours throughout the year to a local service site. I got back and life caught up with me. I forgot about Youthlinc and it's mission until about 4 years later I got an email from them. I realized that I had not fulfilled Youthlinc's goal of creating a lifetime humanitarian. I also realized that I missed volunteering and being involved in my community. So I decided to apply to Youthlinc again to help open up a new site. I was excited to be a part of the organization 5 years later. I couldn't have guessed the impact that this trip was going to have on me. The organization, kindness, and true desire to help others made me reflect on myself. I felt that this organization wasn't about sending kids on an international trip to go experience the world, but much more. This organization is about reaching outside yourself, at times going outside your comfort level and finding ways to connect and help those around us. You gain different view points from serving others from such varied backgrounds. When we finally made it to our international site I was blown away by our approach. We weren't there to just hand them a bunch of stuff, but we were there to understand the international community and help implement projects their way to further improve their way of life. As we left the village for the last time I felt myself tear up. Coming home I truly feel that Youthlinc didn't give me a fun trip to Madagascar. Rather Youthlinc made me into a lifetime humanitarian.
Youthlinc	301464		/users/profile/392396	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/24/2016	Youthlinc  was an amazing experience. I was apart of the 2016 Kenya team. I loved every minute of meeting new people, building, teaching, learning, and just experiencing things I though I never would. not only did the international trip change my life but also the community service we did changed my life as well 
Youthlinc	301440		/users/profile/392373	sarahremund	Volunteer	5	08/24/2016	I have had so many incredible opportunities while being involved with youthlinc. I have been able to lose myself in the service of others and develop many  life skills that have already become so valuable. Youthlinc has truely changed my life for the better and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to continue to be apart of it!
Youthlinc	301428		/users/profile/233791	Alyssa Clark	Volunteer	5	08/24/2016	I absolutely love Youthlinc. My experience working with this program was so fulfilling. Youthlinc taught me to be responsible and passionate. I learned to involve others in my service and help them to feel passionate about the world as well. I feel that I learned so much from the complete program--both the local and international service experiences. After working with various international humanitarian programs, I remain very impressed with the effectiveness and strategy Youthlinc uses in international development. On a personal note, Youthlinc changed and reoriented my life.
Youthlinc	177256		/users/profile/233791	Alyssa Clark	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	Youthlinc was such an incredible experience for me. I loved doing local service at Real Life multiple times a week. Becoming friends with those kids was one of the greatest parts of my year. I loved getting to know my team and team leaders--they were great examples and friends. I went to Vietnam internationally and would not change that experience for anything. The people, especially the kids, I met there changed my life completely. I have never felt so much love and happiness. Never have I been so sweaty or exhausted or laughed and played so much. This experience was more than I could have hoped for.
Youthlinc	301385	1	/users/profile/392304	Nelsotan	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	Youthlinc is amazing!!This nonprofit turns young people into promising future humanitarians and leaders through service both local and abroad.  My personal experience with Youthlinc has been phenomenal.  I was a volunteer on the Peru team for the 2013-2014 school year and we spent the year preparing for, and completing a humanitarian trip to northern Peru in a small village that greatly needed our help.  We taught English, built a bridge for the school children to get to school, and taught the local women the trade of sewing on a machine to help make money for their families.  The village was forever changed!I love Youthlinc and its mission!  I encourage everyone to check it out and to support it in its great cause! 
Youthlinc	301383	1	/users/profile/392302	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	Hello! My name is Aubrey (I'm 17) and this past summer (2016) I traveled with a youthlinc trip to Madagascar. I absolutely loved it. Never before have I had such a rewarding and eye-opening experience in my entire life. Youthlinc's devotion to local service and 80 hour requirement prior to the universal trips sets them apart from all the rest. They require you to spend time serving those around you before you are able to serve those far away from you. Their commitment to consistent service before and after the trips keeps their volunteers on the path to becoming lifetime humanitarians.  Instead of having all of the in country activities and arrangements made for you, student volunteers have to help plan them and create lessons to teach over seas. This gives students a sense of responsibility and demands the development of leadership skills. Overall, youthlinc was one of the best things that ever happened to me! Thanks to them I'm on my way to becoming the best lifetime humanitarian I can be. 
Youthlinc	301382		/users/profile/392301	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	I love my experience at real life!!! I was so sad to leave and am looking forward to next year when I can come see my wonderful friends at real life! You make such amazing relationships with the kids you mentor and it's very hard to leave.
Youthlinc	301361		/users/profile/392278	monicamoynihan	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	Youthlinc's motto is "creating lifelong humanitarians", and I believe that it truly does. Something that makes Youthlinc so unique is that it requires students to serve both locally and globally, allowing students to see and act on the need in their own community, as well as creating cultural bridges among the globe. Youthlinc lights a spark in students to want to continue serving both locally and globally.
Youthlinc	301353		/users/profile/392269	marleigha	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	I had one of the first important and fun learning experiences of my life through Youthlinc. I received a full and immersive humanitarian experience through this great organization and look forward to working with it next year!
Youthlinc	301342		/users/profile/392258	kelsiekinikini	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	I traveled with Youthlinc last year as a service year student to Kenya. I had the most amazing experience with this program. It helped me realize what I can do to help change my community and the world for the better. I love that they require that you serve within your community. Through my community service I learned so much about myself and other people. The international service was just as a amazing! I was able to experience another culture and serve the most amazing people I have ever met! I highly recommend looking into Youthlinc because it was truly life changing!
Youthlinc	301323		/users/profile/392233	Betsy34	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	Youthlinc has honestly changed my life. I never expected it would, but it did. I really feel as though this organization is truly dedicated to making lifelong humanitarians as they say in their slogan. Every time I have had a question I always received a quick response that answered my question. I am so glad I decided to work with this organization, and I plan on continuing working with them.
Youthlinc	301322		/users/profile/392232	annahib	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	Youthlinc is such an amazing thing. It really helped me to become a better person and to help out in my community. It has been such a blessing in my life to be apart of such an amazing organization like this. 
Youthlinc	301315		/users/profile/392221	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	My experience with Youthlinc was everything I had hoped it to be and more. Not only did it show me that I could truly make a difference in my community, but it also exposed me to a world I had never seen that was much larger than myself. Everyone in this program is dedicated to producing lifetime humanitarians, and it is their passion for what they do that allows them to fulfill their mission. Everyone student I know that has participated in Youthlinc comes out of the program with a new view of the world, and most want to keep coming back because they realize just how wonderful this program is. Youthlinc allows the students in the program to make a difference in their community and personally contribute to a larger cause. I would and do recommend Youthlinc to everyone I know because I know the difference it has made in my life and so many others lives. This is the perfect platform for students to learn more about the world around them and feel like they have personally made a difference in others lives. The connections and relationships made at my local service site, in my Youthlinc team and halfway across the world will last me a lifetime. I can't get enough of this amazing program and know that I will continue to be involved for as long as I possibly can. Youthlinc really does create lifetime humanitarians. 
Youthlinc	301309		/users/profile/392214	kayleeaguirre	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	Youthlinc changed my life! Such an incredible organization that builds young humanitarians and indescribable relationships that will last the rest of your life. 
Youthlinc	301285		/users/profile/360810	Katie137	Former staff	5	08/23/2016	Youthlinc not only promotes service on a global level, but locally too. Before first year students travel on their humanitarian trip to another country, Youthlinc requires they complete 80 hours of local service, 40 of which must be at one site. For the 2015-2016 academic school year, I interned for Youthlinc's Real Life, an after-school program with a life-skills curriculum that aims to serve underprivileged youth in Salt Lake County. There are about 8 or so sites where the youth can come and participate in the program. Real Life has sites that focus refugee teens as well, helping them become successful people as they start their new life here in the states. As for the students who volunteer, Real Life provides them with a leadership opportunity that will help them with creating lessons and teaching them, all while learning about classroom management. Being apart of this program was enlightening and humbling. To see the friendships formed between everyone involved was incredible. Again, Youthlinc never fails to impress. 
Youthlinc	271897	1	/users/profile/360810	Katie137	Volunteer	5	11/12/2015	I traveled to Nepal this past July with Mark and Shelly Burningham as my team leaders and it was the most enlightening and humbling experience! To be on a team with the sweetest and coolest mentors/peers from all across the state of Utah who all cared about the same things as I did and had the same goal of helping others made it all worthwhile and incredibly special!  As a recent high school graduate, I feel that Youthlinc's testimony of creating lifetime humanitarians is one that is especially powerful that impacts youth greatly. If you are a high school/college student looking to broaden your service experience, meet new people,  travel someplace new,  and change your life, Youthlinc is for you! 
Youthlinc	301284		/users/profile/392185	Kylee B.	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	Youthlinc changed my life. I have learned so much from everything I have done with them and I can't wait to keep expanding and growing with them 
Youthlinc	301278		/users/profile/340543	Easton_Bowring	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	Youthlinc is a life changing organization. I have had the opportunity to participate in 2 Youthlinc service years, and have loved every moment. I was able to travel to Peru on the 2014-15 service team, and then return again on the 2015-16 service team. Youthlinc has taught me more about myself, then I would have ever imagined. I have learned that service is a priority in my life, that life is about more than popularity or being rich, and that service does not have to be international. Over the past two years, I have learned how to stay organized, work hard towards and ending goal, plan major events, and to always work with a smile on my face. There was never a time where I ever felt unsafe while on a humanitarian trip. Youthlinc did very well at making sure we had the proper nutrients, accommodations, and safty, while still allowing you to experience a life changing event. Being able to participate in Youthlinc has help me better prepare for adulthood, more then anything else. I have learned to serve other, and to try and make a change in my community here in the United States. Youthlinc is an amazing organization, and would recommend it to everyone. 
Youthlinc	252473		/users/profile/340543	Easton_Bowring	Volunteer	5	08/10/2015	Youthlinc has changed my life for the better. By installing a love for service into me, they motivated me to become a member of every service club possible at my school. The have installed life time humanitarians into the youth of Utah, by having them serve in their community and internationally. Youthlinc created an environment that allowed students to be them self, learn from others, and to serve. They are an organization that has exceeded my expectations and I would gladly participate with Youthlinc again. 
Youthlinc	301275		/users/profile/392177	gcarse	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	Youthlinc changed my life! I went on 2015 team Cambodia and 2016 team Peru. They were both such amazing experiences from the local service to the in country construction projects. They teach you so much about yourself and are such awesome experiences you can't get anywhere else! I recommend this organization to everyone!
Youthlinc	301268		/users/profile/392169	Aurora R.	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	Choosing Youthlinc was one of the best decisions I have ever made! I never thought that I would grow so much from a two week trip. Getting to know people from across the country was a life changing experience and the connections you make with them is heart warming. I hope to go on a Youthlinc trip every year and serve those that need it most! Thank you Youthlinc for such a life changing experience!!  
Youthlinc	301263		/users/profile/392164	Malhop11	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	This past year, I had the opportunity to participate in Youthlinc's program for students called the Service Year. It was a year of local community service followed by a humanitarian trip to an international country. I loved the fact that they require 80+ hours of community service before allowing you to go on the international trip, because it really teaches students the meaning and value of everyday service. I also loved the international trip, (mine was to Peru) as it changed my life immensely, and taught me about building human relationships. 
Youthlinc	301259		/users/profile/392160	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	I've been involved with Youthlinc for the last two years and have really enjoyed the whole process. I traveled to Cambodia last summer and went to Madagascar this year as an alum leader. Youthlinc has opened so many doors for me and I couldn't be more grateful. I have met so many people that I've continued to be friends with and am now in the process of apply to be an intern for Real Life, and after school tutoring program for students from 6th to 12th grade that is sponsored by Youthlinc. If it wasn't for Youthlinc I wouldn't have been exposed to all the great friendships I've made, the opportunities I've been given, and the major I hope to study while I'm here at the U (Social Entrepreneurship). Youthlinc has had a profound impact on who I've become today. 
Youthlinc	301252		/users/profile/392150	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	Youthlinc was a great way for me to stay involved in the community.  I was able to meet so many wonderful people and make a change in my life.  I see so many things in a different way now and I am so grateful for the experiences that Youthlinc gave me. 
Youthlinc	301247		/users/profile/392145	Gabriella K.	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	Youthlinc is an amazing nonprofit that has truly changed my life! I have been on two trips with this group and have gained more knowledge than I had expected and built amazing relationships with truly unbelievable people. Not only do you give back abroad but you help our within your own community and that in itself helps to build character and true life time humanitarians. 
Youthlinc	301244		/users/profile/11532	Bonnie	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	My Husband and I have now been on 10 international service trips with Youthlinc. We served as the Medical Mentors on all but the last trip since I am an RN and my husband a Pediatrician.  We have served in Kenya four times, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and this past June/July to Nepal.  All were exciting, interesting, fulfilling and hard work!  The best part is observing the students experience a new and very different culture, meet and work with people and other students not knowing their language while learning how to travel so far from home.  For me, these trips have been life changing experiences that make me value how others cultures live and how lucky I am.  These trips are well organized and do all that is possible to make these trips safe, meaningful and life changing for the students.  Guess that says it all in a nutshell!
Youthlinc	120556		/users/profile/11532	Bonnie	Volunteer	5	08/13/2012	YouthLinc promotes involving HIgh School & College youths in community service with the additional reward of international service.  I have been the nurse/mentor for  8 trips including Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Cambodia & Kenya.  It is such a pleasure to observe the changes that occur in the students as they prepare for these experiences, deal with foreign travel, strange customs and foods.  There are building projects, health & education classes developed and taught to the in-country students and/or their families, fund raising, Fun  & Health Fairs.  Students are selected in November and meet monthly until departure.  Community hours of service must be completed before leaving the USA.  A great opportunity for all concerned.
Youthlinc	9713	6	/users/profile/11532	Bonnie	Former Volunteer	4	08/28/2009	YouthLINC offers outstanding opportunities for young adults to experience humanitarian service in their own communities as well as in other parts of the world.  I enjoy observing these young adults as they learn to adapt to new customs & living situations in foreign places. One student is now on her way to graduate school in International Studies based on her experiences with YouthLINC.  Another is on her way to med school.
Youthlinc	301242		/users/profile/392140	megan.fogarty5	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	I was able to travel to Nepal in 2015 and I am pleased to say I will be joining up with Youthlinc again this year. Youthlinc is an amazing program that encourages local service as well as allowing young adults and adults to go on amazing humanitarian trips. They understand the needs of the places they are going and work very hard to make lasting impacts with everything they do. 
Youthlinc	301229		/users/profile/215991	Michelle Moynihan	Volunteer	5	08/22/2016	Youthlinc is unique in its mission as a nonprofit. It desires to see change in people that in turn will change not only the cities they live in but also the world in a larger sense. It truly does create lifetime humanitarians that are excited to serve and love all people. The staff at Youthlinc are incredible, friendly, helpful and just generally amazing. I highly recommend this nonprofit.
Youthlinc	162728		/users/profile/215991	Michelle Moynihan	Volunteer	5	07/16/2013	My first experience with Youthlinc was watching my oldest sister go to Kenya and come back a better person. After hearing her stories I knew that I wanted to get involved with this amazing program. A few years later, when I was old enough, I applied to go on a trip. I was accepted to be apart of the Guatemala team. I never could have imagined how much not only the trip but also the service year in general would impact me. Through Youthlinc's service year I was able to work with teen refugees to teach them life skills, collect medical supplies for a clinic, and have exceptional leadership opportunities at a young age. In fact I had such an incredible experience that I decided to go again the following year. This past year I worked as a development intern to raise $2000 of project fund money for my team. Youthinc has given me the opportunity to improve not only other people's lives but also my own. It helped me discover that I want to do humanitarian work for the rest of my life. Youthlinc connects people through mutual love and respect. I would and have recommended this program to everyone looking for a life-changing experience.
Youthlinc	301124		/users/profile/392006	ryanej42	Volunteer	5	08/20/2016	I've participated in the Youthlinc Service Year program for the past 2 years (on the Nepal June 2015 Team as a student and on the Madagascar July 2016 Team as an alum leader). Youthlinc does a very good job of giving students real world experience with the issues facing small communities in developing countries. One thing I really appreciate about Youthlinc's model for international service is that it emphasizes cooperation between the community members and the Youthlinc teams. I think that encouraging both groups to teach and share ideas with each other reliably creates a very good outcome for both the communities Youthlinc serves and the students in the Service Year. When on a Youthlinc Team, it is important to remember that the more energy and effort you put into the projects, the more you, your teammates, and the community you are in will benefit from the experience. I highly recommend the Youthlinc Service Year- it is a great opportunity both to serve and to learn.
Youthlinc	301106		/users/profile/391984	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	Youthlinc has provided the opportunity for many young people to expand their experience in the world and begin their journey of life-long service.  Youthlinc has also contributed to the positive development of leadership and service in the adults who mentor these youth.  Youth and mentors alike evolve symbiotically for the cultivation of compassion and love in action, contributing to a better world.
Youthlinc	301103		/users/profile/391981	Katie155	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	I enjoyed every minute I dedicated to my youthlinc expirence this past year! It was a great way to get me involved in my own neighborhood as well as in another country! The leaders and mentors on the team were spectacular! They made sure everyone felt involved and needed as we planned and carried out our international service trip! The trip itself was an amazing opportunity that I can't wait to  expirence again! Youthlinc, in my personal opinion, is not something you can do just one time. 
Youthlinc	301099		/users/profile/391977	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	I had a wonderful experience with Youthlinc this past year. I was fortunate enough to be able to be a part of the Madagascar July team this summer and had an outstanding experience serving both in Madagascar and my home town of Salt Lake City. Thanks to Youthlinc, a small village we helped in Madagascar changed for the better in several ways. Additionally, in serving locally I also helped out the people near me. Youthlinc is a fantastic organization and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. 
Youthlinc	301090		/users/profile/391967	Lucy23	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	Throughout the Youthlinc service year, I served with Real Life, a teen refugee mentoring program in Salt Lake City, where we meet once a week with teens from all over the world, and help them with their schooling and also become friends with them. Before being in this environment, I never even knew that there were refugees in the Salt Lake City area let alone near where I live! After volunteering with Real Life, a service site I wouldn't have even known about without Youthlinc, I know that I have made a difference in the lives of these refugees by hearing about their stories and helping them to excel in their second or third language! 
Youthlinc	301086		/users/profile/391962	Nicole156	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	I can honesty say that Youthlinc has changed my the way I think, act and view the world. I have been on 2 service trips through Youthlinc and have had nothing but positive experiences have helped shape who I am. I have learned so much about building relationships, how I should treat others, how to problems solve and how serving others is the one thing in this world that brings true happiness. These list goes on and on, and I have Youthlinc and the people who are involved with it to thank. I would highly recommend it to anyone and am so grateful for the lessons it has taught me. 
Youthlinc	301081		/users/profile/391958	Emma25	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	From the beginning of December and July I worked with youthlinc to prepare for our service trip to Madagascar in July we met every month until our trip to get ready. During that time we also had to do service within our local community which was to expand our knowledge of our community and globally. Once we went to Madagascar we were able to accomplish so much in so little time, it was amazing.
Youthlinc	301075		/users/profile/391951	Courtney69	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	Youthlinc is an amazing organization. Everyone is so dedicated to helping people all over the world. I have learned so much while working with youthlinc. It has helped me grow and become a better person.
Youthlinc	301073		/users/profile/391950	haylee23	Volunteer	5	08/19/2016	While being a part of the youthlinc service year I grew so much more as a person than I ever realized possible at my age. I learned to be much more thankful for everything I have access to in life. I traveled in the first trip to Madagascar with youthlinc and it was absolutely amazing. We helped the village build a school room, taught English, business, and sewing lessons and got to become forever friends with the native Malagasy people. I have already applied to go again next year because I loved it so much 
Youthlinc	298914		/users/profile/389798	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/02/2016	Youthlinc was an amazing organization that gave me an experience I'll never forget. I went to Kenya and got to meet people and see and do things I don't normally get to do. Even though international service is way important, Youthlinc is big on local service. Before any student is allowed to go to their international site, they have to do 80 hours of community service, with at least 40 of those being at the same place. They do this to help build ties to our community and to the people we serve. I got the opportunity to serve at the Boys and Girls Club for my main service site and it was a great experience for me. I got to get used to working with kids and keeping them entertained which was super beneficial to me in Kenya. We had meetings every month which also helped us to bond as a team and work together. Some other organizations don't meet each other until they arrive at the site. To me, getting to know the people I would be spending 2 weeks with in a foreign county beforehand was crucial to my experience. We all had a great time and got to see and do amazing things.Youthlinc makes sure you get your immunizations and has a doctor there who works alongside you instead of just being there. 10/10 would go again!
Youthlinc	298895		/users/profile/389780	tostmark	Volunteer	5	08/02/2016	Youthlinc gave me the opportunity to meet people and do work that I would have never had the chance to do before. Being able to go to Africa, and teach the children, build schools, and interact with the culture is an experience that I will truly treasure for the rest of my life. 
Youthlinc	298890		/users/profile/389775	Jill100	Volunteer	5	08/02/2016	Absolute best trip I've ever been on. Changed my life completely! The whole program is amazing, leading up to our trip, during our trip, and even after! Great leaders and very organized 
Youthlinc	298843		/users/profile/389730	Jena C.	General Member of the Public	5	08/01/2016	My daughter went to Thailand with Youthlinc in the summer of 2016.   This organization is excellent, requiring 80 hours of local service before the youth are allowed to participate in service abroad.  This service has instilled a passion for service and my daughter is constantly looking for volunteer opportunities since her return.  I love to see her eyes light up whenever someone asks her about her time in Thailand.  She fell in love with the children there.  As a parent I appreciated the frequent and thorough communication from her team leaders and Youthlinc staff both before and during her trip.   It is a very well run and respectable organization which gave me peace of mind when sending my daughter half way around the world.
Youthlinc	298629		/users/profile/389518	Jacksonstart	Volunteer	5	07/31/2016	Youthlinc was an overall amazing experience for me to go through the this year. I learned so much from my service I had to do before I left and all the life lessons I learned in Nepal. You learn how to appreciate all the little things you take for granted here in the U.S. So what you take away is the fun in life from all the random joys in life.
Youthlinc	298391		/users/profile/389242	AlyssaSmoot	Volunteer	5	07/28/2016	I first got involved with Youthlinc back in 2013 and was able to go to Kenya on the humanitarian trip. I absolutely loved my experience, my team, and all the things I learned from other students/Kenyans. In fact, I still keep in touch with a little girl named Shamila who calls me a couple times a year. My younger brother Spencer went to Kenya last year (2015) and met Shamila and was able to take her a photo book that I had made for her. She started crying when she got it and Spencer said he knew right then how impactful these relationships are. I then tried a few other organizations the following years and just didn't fall in love with them the way I did with Youthlinc. I love how Youthlinc focuses on local service because I honestly didn't know there was such a dire need and that I didn't have to go to another country to make a difference, although that is also a very powerful part of the service year. I did my local service at Park City Hospital and still keep in touch with people I met there while volunteering. Now as a college student at the University of Utah, I've completely gone a different direction with my major than what I had planned for myself because of Youthlinc. I've seen how Youthlinc impacts people's lives literally around the world. As the oldest child, my younger siblings have seen the difference that it has made in my life and have chosen to get involved as well. Even my parents, who are now on the Board,  participate as much as they can whether sponsoring other students to go or sit on the parents panel at orientation to share with others our positive experiences as a family by being involved with Youthlinc. This year I had the amazing opportunity to be an Alum Leader with my brother Spencer on a trip to Thailand, and our younger brother Andrew was able to come along as a first time student. The best part about participating on the leadership side of these trips is watching it change these kids who decide to go. It is a lot of work for months before and sometimes it gets a little hard for teenagers to put as a priority in their lives, but once they're out in-country and building strong relationships with others I can see it all click for them; that this is why they've put in so much effort and that it's worth it. That is my favorite part, being able to witness these experiences change the hearts and minds of people. Youthlinc creates lifetime humanitarians time and time again and i'm proud to be a part of such an amazing organization. 
Youthlinc	298178		/users/profile/389022	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	I love this organization and everything it does. My only complaint was I found my team to be disrespectful and unfocused in country and struggled working with them.
Youthlinc	298120		/users/profile/388966	annienielson	Volunteer	5	07/26/2016	From the beginning of the service year serving in my local community to serving in country, Youthlinc has been an amazing experience! It gave me the opportunity to learn how to become a leader, how to build long lasting relationships, and helped me expand on my social skills. It is a great way to get involved with your community and a way to help those all around the world. I highly recommend the Youthlinc program as a way to not only change the lives of others but as a way to change your life for the better and begin the path of becoming a life long humanitarian. I will never forget the life lessons I have learned and the memories of my trip and service year all thanks to the unforgettable experience that Youthlinc has provided me with. 
Youthlinc	298115	1	/users/profile/388957	Jayne B.	Client Served	5	07/26/2016	This was our first experience with Youthlinc and it was wonderful! They are a great organization.   They are well organized, great at communicating and clear on what their expectations are of the kids.  I like that their goal is building life long humanitarians.   The 80 hours local service that the kids have to do is wonderful and Youthlinc is great at providing opportunities.  My daughter's experience with Youthlinc and her trip to Nepal was life changing!  Thank you Youthlinc for providing this opportunity to the kids in our community!
Youthlinc	298076		/users/profile/388912	Treasure L.	Volunteer	5	07/25/2016	For 16 days I had one of the most amazing experiences of my entire life thanks to the Youthlinc organization and the wonderful individuals that helped make the journey possible. I traveled to Nepal with 41 other participants to perform work at a school in Suntakhan. Although we were only in country for 12 days, they were the most life changing ones which I have experienced. I would highly recommend this program to anyone, not simply for the opportunity to help so many other people, but for the chance it gives one to grow as an individual. You may think that you will teach the people in county much, I promise you, though, it is nothing compared to the lessons you will learn from them. I encourage to take this chance to leave a beautiful legacy within the hearts of all those who you will touch, for the memories you leave them will remain remembered for a lifetime. 
Youthlinc	297806		/users/profile/388620	mandamy	Volunteer	5	07/23/2016	Youthlinc is absolutely incredible. my experience with them was unforgettable and will always be in my heart. I enjoyed the opportunity to  be apart of something bigger. Definitely one of the best organizations out there. our service trip to Guatemala this year was one for the books, it really made me take things and life into perspective. I would not hesitate to go on another trip like this through youthlinc. Their organization was exceptional the people that run the organization are exceptional people and I loved my team and the things I went through with them. I love love love youthlinc. 
Youthlinc	297752		/users/profile/388567	lizzie00	Volunteer	5	07/22/2016	Going on a youthlinc trip has truly changed my life, going across the world to help and teach others is an experience you won't receive often, and I assure you that I learned more from them than i could have ever taugh them. Youthlinc is a great program that I would recommend to anyone and everyone. 
Youthlinc	297751		/users/profile/388566	Writer	Volunteer	4	07/22/2016	We went to a small village in northern Thailand and taught the students English and the women sewing. The women we taught to see ended up starting a business. It is an export emcee I wouldn't trade do the world and recommend for anyone interested in a humanitarian trip. 
Youthlinc	297724		/users/profile/388534	Millie B.	Volunteer	5	07/22/2016	Youthlinc is amazing. I would not be the person I am if I hadn't gone on a Youthlinc trip. It's absolutely life changing. The friendships you make arrangements unforgettable.  To see the happiness on the villagers faces makes everything worth it. 
Youthlinc	297723		/users/profile/388533	jjhamel77	General Member of the Public	5	07/22/2016	My son Phillip joined the Youthlinc team in 2016 and traveled to Thailand on his service trip in June.  It was the best thing he has done to date in terms of developing an un-paralleled appreciation for culture and realization that the world is out there for him to see.I would recommend it to anyone who has a student that wants to expand their horizons!
Youthlinc	297718		/users/profile/388528	Sheila J.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/22/2016	Youthlinc is an amazing program. As an educator of 25 years and a parent of a Youthlinc volunteer it is by far one of the most successful leadership training  program for you. I have seen my own daughter and hundreds others thrive. The beauty of this organization is that it changes the hearts of all involved. My daughter loved serving the elderly on our local town and was the light of the rest home. She cried when she had to leave Guatemala after her summer humanitarian trip. What Youthlinc accomplished in two short weeks is nothing short of miraculous. 38 families were taught vocational skills, business and money management, and dozens of children we estatic to learn about sound, health and dozens of other lessons. Concrete floors were poured and specially designed stoves installed. Lives will be saved literally by not having toxic smoke in their homes. The adult volunteers sacrificed and pay their own way to ensure the experience is superior. When a young adult catches a vision to serve then they fulfill the mission statement in its entirety- "Creating Humanitarians For Life!" All my children will be Youthlinc humanitarians! Judy has created a model that is second to none. This organization needs to be in every state! 
Youthlinc	297709		/users/profile/388517	Lois26	General Member of the Public	5	07/22/2016	My daughter went to Guatemala in 2015 and Thailand in 2016. Both times, she raised the money herself, proving it can be done. And it was so worth it. She has a good heart and Youthlinc is a journey of the heart, bringing out the best in all who participate, youths and adults alike. The trips are well-planned, they accomplish a lot and the participants come back both grateful for their own blessings and anxious to help others. Best of all, the service they do in their own communities gives them a keener understanding of many people's lives  and a deep desire to forge connections and help others. If you have a chance to go, GO! 
Youthlinc	297616		/users/profile/388423	mkgeds	Volunteer	4	07/21/2016	Youthlinc is a traveling nonprofit that focuses on both community and worldwide service. My experience with this nonprofit was as a student volunteer. I volunteered rather frequently with other groups before joining Youthlinc, but the Youthlinc program  helped me serve on a larger scale. To participate you have to contribute at least 80 hours of local community service, and after doing this and raising the money necessary, you go to another country to serve the education systems there. I went to Thailand with Youthlinc, and it taught me a lot and helped me develop a greater passion for serving, and a stronger sense of the worth of others, as well as my self. I learned a lot with Youthlinc, and highly recommend doing it if you are interested in serving both your community and worldwide.
Youthlinc	297528		/users/profile/388329	benbutcher	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	Youthlinc is the best nonprofit I have ever worked with. This is simply because it provides everyone with opportunities to help others in our backyard and 2,700 miles away. This nonprofit teaches true leadership, commitment and hard work to anyone who is involved.  This was my first year participating and I was a part of the Guatemala Team. However, the airport was not where this journey began. It was required for me and all of the other students on my team to volunteer at least 80 local service hours before leaving to Guatemala. I was lucky enough to participate in the Real Life Program coordinated by Youthlinc. Every Monday and some Wednesday's I would go to the Hser Ner Moo community center and help teen refugees living in Salt Lake City with their homework. Not only were we tutors but we would also help teach life lessons to the students everyday. Some of these students could barely speak English, however every single one was eager and motivated to learn and succeed.  I learned from this experience how truly important education is and how sometimes I take it for granted. These students made me realize how lucky I am to be going to school and to be learning. Volunteering locally was not the only thing each team member had to do to be prepared for Guatemala. We had monthly meetings, and at these we would prepare. This is where Youthlinc teaches each student commitment. This organization taught us to commit to what we are doing and to do our best all the time. Our team prepared very well for the trip, we knew what we were going to do with the two communities we were helping and how we were going to do it. However, without this preparation our time in Guatemala would not have been as useful and productive for the people of Pacoxpom and las Escobitas. I was a participant of this business committee. We prepared to have a business fair for all the men and women in the community. During the fair we each created lesson plans to teach the men and women. The subjects of these lessons varied from money management to entrepreneurship or to basic marketing skills. When we were in Guatemala and gave our business fair it could not have gone better. The men and women could not have been more responsive. We all felt like what they learned will now help small businesses in the community to grow which will help with the villages economy. However, this would not have happened if each person in my committee didn't work as hard as they did and commit to our projects. We were fully prepared which was why the business fair was a huge success. Another thing our committee lead was computer lessons to the students at Las Escobitas. This was an experience I will never forget. The kids were scared to use a computer, something I use everyday. They simply did not know how to use one. Showing them and watching their faces light up while they were learning was unforgettable. These lessons will now benefit the students in school forever, they can now learn and do their work on the computers. It's examples like these that makes Youthlinc such a unique nonprofit. The work we do locally and globally is not work that will be forgotten. Everything we did in the villages the people will use forever. It's not something they saw and will now forget as they move on with their lives. Youthlinc provides people with skills and tools that can make their life more prosperous for a lifetime, not just the two weeks we are there. Another example of this was our construction project in Guatemala. The people in the community had dirt as their floors, and stoves with no ventilation. These were both health hazards that our team was able to help with. As a team we put in cement floors in 37 homes, and in each of these homes installed a new stove with ventilation. They will never have to cook on an open stove again. This made the people so happy and they were so thankful for the floors and the new stove. Not only were we working hard with construction, but each student taught an English lesson to the students of the villages. These lessons varied and it was a great way for the students to advance their English and learn something new. Regardless of what we did we were always having fun, and creating memories that we will never forget. We being my team and I and the people of Guatemala. We came together as a community and created so many emotional bonds that were difficult to say goodbye to. On this trip I learned many things, developed several friendships, and developed many skills that I will use for the rest of my life. Not only did my team change the lives of Las Escobitas and Pacoxpom but our lives were changed as well. All these memories, and this whole experience was because of Youthlinc. As a nonprofit Youthlinc's goal is to create lifetime humanitarians. I can confidently say that the 2016 Guatemalan team is now full of lifetime humanitarians, all because of Youthlinc, I simply cannot wait to participate with them more in the furture.  
Youthlinc	297527		/users/profile/388328	lenachan	Volunteer	5	07/21/2016	This summer, I had the opportunity to be a part of the 2016 Guatemala Youthlinc team. The entirety of my trip provided me with new opportunities and experiences that changed my overall perspective for the better. This is largely thanks to the organization and positive support of Youthlinc and the leaders on my team. By working so closely with its in-country coordinators at People for Guatemala, Youthlinc is able to aid long term sustainable projects each year. For example, our vocational team worked with People for Guatemala to maintain a safe place to keep Youthlinc's sewing machines and ensure the villagers from Pacoxpon will continue to have access to sewing lessons even after we have left.  As a whole, I highly support Youthlinc and hope to continue working with the organization as an alum leader next year. My experiences mixing cement, installing stoves, teaching English lessons, and leading the Mondo Art project have allowed me to form lasting relationships with my team and the people of Guatemala, learn more about myself, and make a lasting impact in the community. I treasure each and every memory made during the trip and am forever grateful for the lessons on gratitude and kindness that I have gained and will continue to cherish throughout the rest of my life.
Youthlinc	297407		/users/profile/388200	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/20/2016	I have been very impressed with the organization of Youthlinc and the way they have their system set up. I felt very prepared heading into country where we would be serving and safe as well. One of my favorite parts about this organization is that they require the students to do 80 hrs of local community service prior to leaving for their in-country experience. This requirement makes the kids work hard prior to leaving and results in a team of people who really want to make a difference in the world no matter how hard the work may be. I would highly recommend working with Youthlinc. They are a fantastic organization! 
Youthlinc	294534		/users/profile/385272	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/02/2016	Love, compassion, teamwork, acceptance, hardwork, respect, leadership and happiness all discribe my experience with Youthlinc. I traveled to Thailand with 36 other wonderful people and I completely came back with my heart filled with happiness and love from teaching the kids, hanging out with my other teammates, trying all the new exotic foods and meeting and greeting the people in county with kind smiles and respect. My whole life perspective and outlook has changed and I would do anything to go back again. Youthlinc has given me so many memories and joy from serving 80 hours of service to running away from the kindergarten kids in Thailand who loved to tickle. Youthlinc has taught me so much, and the lessons I have learned with my service year I know I will always use them throughout my life.

Youthlinc	274190		/users/profile/363556	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/10/2015	I went with Youthlinc to Cambodia in 2012 and it was an amazing experience! What I like the most about Youthlinc is that they put so much emphasis on local service before going abroad, which is exactly why I chose to volunteer with them. The staff and team leaders are extremely helpful with everything, and make sure everyone is included. The time I spent with them in Cambodia gave me a whole new perspective on serving others, and I'll never forget the kindness of the villagers and how incredibly thankful they were for the service we provided. Youthlinc is definitely the best nonprofit out there if you're looking to serve both locally and abroad instead of just going on a vacation. I would definitely (and do) recommend Youthlinc to anyone looking to make a difference in the world!
Youthlinc	274175		/users/profile/363541	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/10/2015	I have been involved with Youthlinc for two years now and it has absolutely changed my life. I am more dedicated to service and strive to make it a major priority in my life. Youthlinc has such a great program set up for anyone who wants to volunteer. They give you so many chances to take leadership opportunities and to take charge of your experience and make it everything you want it to be. In country, I have never felt more safe. I was really nervous about going to Thailand last year because it was the farthest I had ever been away from home. When I got to Thailand my team leader was amazing at making sure we all felt safe and he knew where each of us were at all times. Our mentors were also fantastic at keeping us all together and keeping us safe. Overall I would recommend Youthlinc to anyone who is interested in local and international service! 
Youthlinc	274117		/users/profile/216611	Sidney D.	Volunteer	5	12/10/2015	I've been involved with Youthlinc for two years. My first year I was a student and the second year I was an assistant team leader. My experiences were both amazing and have helped make me the person I am today. Youthlinc isn't just a great organization because it lets you travel the world, it's also amazing because of the emphasis they have on local service as well. As a Youthlinc student you have to serve 80 hours in your local community before you can go on your international trip. I LOVED that part of Youthlinc. It showed me the need for service in our communities and it helped me develop a love for service. I still volunteer regularly in my community because I love it so much. Youthlinc is also filled with amazing people. Youthlinc has helped me meet some of my best friends who I wouldn't have met If it wasn't for Youthlinc. They also gave me mentors who I look up to and still talk to on a regular basis. Also everyone in the office is incredible and so helpful, I loved working with them once a week when I was an assistant team leader. All and all you should do Youthlinc. It's a life changing expirence that introduces you to new cultures and amazing new people who are all Intrested in serving others. I love Youthlinc and I know you will too! 
Youthlinc	163171		/users/profile/216611	Sidney D.	Volunteer	5	07/21/2013	Youthlinc is the best non profit in the world!! I love Youthlinc. Youthlinc changes lives, not just those we serve, but our own. My life was changed and touched from my Youthlinc experience. It taught me that by serving others we can truly find happiness, and that we should all make it our common goal to serve and help others. By doing that we can make this world a better place. I love Youthlinc with all my heart and I am so grateful for the opportunity that I had to be apart of Youthlinc, and wish that I will stay involved. 
Youthlinc	274116		/users/profile/163043	Youthlinc	Volunteer	5	12/10/2015	I have done two trips with Youthlinc, the first as a student going to Kenya and the second as an alumni leader going to Thailand. During both of my trips, I felt that we were able to not only provide help in completing many construction projects and teaching the people valuable vocational and business skills, but we were able to learn so much about their respective cultures. Youthlinc not only emphasizes helping the communities through construction and teaching, but emphasizes learning to understand people of a different culture and appreciating their culture. I also love Youthlinc because it stresses the importance of performing local service that helps students learn responsibility, commitment, and how to interact with others professionally. Students become so aware of the fact that local service is so easy to perform and is the type of service one can see lasting results with over time. Youthlinc also has amazing leaders and staff that wish to know every student personally. While the leaders provide guidance and supervision throughout the whole service year, they allow the students to create and organize their projects that are to be performed in-country. Overall, Youthlinc is an amazing organization for introducing students to local and international service.
Youthlinc	207755		/users/profile/163043	Youthlinc	Volunteer	5	07/30/2014	I returned to Youthlinc in 2013 to be an Alumni Leader for the Thailand team. It was amazing getting to experience helping other teenagers make a change in the world, both locally and internationally. Locally, everyone worked hard to serve their communities by consistently volunteering at various sites, while internationally, we all committed ourselves to helping the generous Thai and Burmese people around us. Youthlinc provided an excellent avenue for young adults to experience serving others while learning about life and the world from the people they served.
Youthlinc	119930		/users/profile/163043	Youthlinc	Volunteer	5	08/02/2012	Youthlinc teaches students so much about serving the community and helping anyone. The program far exceeded my expectations, and I made so many new friends through doing service with them. I feel like Youthlinc truly helped me make a difference through service.
Youthlinc	274109	1	/users/profile/363462	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/09/2015	Youthlinc honestly has changed my life. It humbled me to the max and opened up so many doors. I have been involved with Youthlinc for two years now and have loved every second of it. Youthlinc makes me feel so invloved and I love all the local service opportunities it provides. Youthlinc made me a humanitarian for life!
Youthlinc	274100	1	/users/profile/267276	jacobmontana	Volunteer	5	12/09/2015	My family has been involved with Youthlinc for about 4 years now, myself a total of 2. I was a student on my first trip to Thailand and an assistant team leader in Nepal the next year. I really enjoyed my time with this organization, because it focuses on many different aspects of service. Yes, you get to go to a foreign country and experience the culture. Yes, you get to help people in genuine need. Yes, you get to make lasting friendships with people you would have never met otherwise. But the best part of Youthlinc is the emphasis they put on local service. Students serve for a total of 80 hours throughout the year, and 40 at a main service site somewhere in their local community. This really helps students to realize the impact they can have right in their own communities and encourages them to keep serving on a regular basis. I also loved all of my leaders and the people I interacted with on my teams and in the Youthlinc office. They were always helping me to become my best self and to push myself to accomplish my goals. They were on top of all of our tasks and projects were able to answer our questions. Even when our plans changed before and even in county on a few instances, they were very flexible and adapted to what we needed to do. They handled everything in a professional manner. Overall I enjoyed my experience with Youthlinc. It changed my outlook on my personal life and made me more grateful for what I had. I would recommend a Youthlinc service year experience to anyone. 
Youthlinc	205172	1	/users/profile/267276	jacobmontana	Volunteer	5	07/04/2014	Youthlinc really helped to change my perspective on life in general. It helped me to get over myself and focus not on the inward of myself but the outwards of others. When I did that, I was able to help those around me and not think of myself. Youthlinc has the best participants, mentors, and leaders anyone could ask for. They help you to become the best you, and thats all you can ask for in a humanitarian program. 
Youthlinc	274085	1	/users/profile/363438	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/09/2015	I've been on 4 trips with Youthlinc in various roles and each one was absolutely incredible! No other organization that I have found is more well rounded. With different committees to help each individual maximize their talents and grow. Leadership both in country and traveling has been phenomenal. These trips have been some of the happiest times in my life and I am truly grateful to Yourhlinc for making it possible. It's amazing to see how much a team can accomplish when working together. In my trips we've helped to build school class rooms, libraries, a community home, and a nursing station. We also put in two septic systems, dug a lot of holes and laid cement, painted classrooms, held English camps, taught vocational and micros terrorize training. These are just a few things we did but I could go on and on. They definitely ache live their mission in taking high school students and turning them into life long humanitarians. I can't wait for the chance to go with Youthlinc again and hopefully lead a team down the road. If you have the chance to go with Youth Linc DO IT! Your life will not be same and you will make lifelong friends. 
Youthlinc	274083		/users/profile/363436	John368	Volunteer	5	12/09/2015	I have been on 1 trip with Youthlinc and I have to say it's one of my favorites, I went to Guatemala 2 years ago and had the time of my life... The leaders Ruth and Jordan were rad our team got very close and we did a lot of great work even when things were not that fun we made it fun.. The work was hard and busy but the trip in all was fun and rewarding...
Youthlinc	274081		/users/profile/363435	Writer	Former staff	5	12/09/2015	My experience with Youthlinc is something I hold near and dear to my heart. My experience started out in 2012 as a volunteer to Kenya. After falling in love with the mission, I knew this was a organization I wanted to work for. I was employed at Youthlinc for over two and half years. In this time, I was able to see the immense effort that the staff plays in making sure everything runs smoothly. This organization goes above and beyond to make sure every person has a positive experience. They are always seeking to improve their processes. The people I encountered during my experience are truly some of the best people I know. Youthlinc attracts wonderful people, staff and volunteers alike. I would recommend this organization to anyone! 
Youthlinc	274040		/users/profile/363382	Writer	Volunteer	2	12/09/2015	 I have been on two trips, my first trip as a student and my second year as an alum. My  first trip was fantastic although I felt like we weren't doing much other than playing with kids and teaching them a few words of English. (I'm not sure how English would help them at all in Thailand) I loved playing with the kids and  frolicking around but I wanted and  expected  to do more then just go take pictures with kids? I was hoping we  would do you some type of construction. But the first year the only type of construction we did was level out a "field" which is an area that is often flooded that at the end of the two weeks was unleveled again. The only type of  construction I did the second year was dig  trenches for rain (which would fill up and  disappear in one day) to me it just kinda felt like busy work and trying to pretend we were actually helping. The second year was when i was an alum we were supposed to build the bathroom but instead they hired several local workers to build the bathroom which is  understandable because they did it 10x better and faster than we would have. But then were kinda left with nothing to do other than dig holes in the mud and bring the works some water.  I'm not  complaining about the work of digging in the dirt at all. I wanted more of it. Just the work we seemed to be doing was just to make it look like we had something to do while we weren't playing with the kids. Don't get me wrong, these places really do need help. But the help we were offering didn't seem to be very helpful.  Now on to the leaders of my trips,First year- Bobby and Carson. The most  fantastic positive people you'll ever meet. Love them to death and they are the reason I signed up the second year. Second year- Dave and Linda. The reason i hate Youthlinc. Not only did they favor their kid who was on the trip and her friends. they were completely clueless and unhelpful to the whole team. NOT leaders. A girl went MISSING IN THAILAND ON MY TEAM and the leaders/ mentors were talking about adding each other on Facebook while the whole team was looking for her? Then when we found her Dave tried to comfort her but made her more homesick and MORE uncomfortable. Oh let's not forget when the kid rented a motorbike and rode into downtown in the rain and bought  alcohol. Did Dave or Linda ever find out? Yeah at the end of the trip when our group had a charge for a motorbike on it. But the kid was gone for hours and missed dinner. Why didn't they know? Oh  probably because they were chatting about Facebook. When we were on location Dave and Linda sat in the shade all day and yelled at people for not working. Dave told one of my team mates to "get back to work" when they had just sat down to drink water then got  passive aggressive when they asked if they could have minute just so they could have some water? This trip was  complete chaos. Kids renting motorbikes, girls missing and under age kids drinking? Not to forget that Dave is a complete and total sexist bully. Let's talk about the team doctor (not a doctor a  fertility nurse ?) she knew nothing about medicine and everytime someone would ask her for help or was having a health  problem she would say take and Advil or put a bandaid on it. Some of my teammates were riding elephants when the elephant slipped and sling shoted them into a tree and also get one of them stuck under the elephant. You know what the doctor did after that to help? Nothing. One of the bus drivers pulled out a first aid box and helped the girls out. Then later at dinner she said do you need an Advil (of course)  My final thoughts and advice for Youthlinc, Interview your leaders better and don't pick any stupid adults with the money. They are watching teenagers and need to pay attention. Do more construction and less pictures? I feel like this a tour group or something and not a  humanitarian trip. In the end I do not regret signing up for Youthlinc because of the friends and  memories I've made . But they need to improve because my last trip was  straight up chaos and negative
Youthlinc	254492		/users/profile/342840	871jac	Former staff	5	08/31/2015	I have been a part of this organization for two years and it has given me the two greatest experiences of my life by far.  Being able to participate in the local service as well as the international gives a truly unique experience. I have met some amazing people through this and it has opened up my views on things as well as encouraging me to stay involved.  It sounds very clich, but going on a trip with Youthlinc will truly change your life and I recommend it 100%.
Youthlinc	254239		/users/profile/342564	maggie.cannonmatch	Volunteer	5	08/28/2015	Youthlinc was one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had. I truly felt like I was part of a family in which everyone cared for and loved each other. The privilege to serve children and families in need is one I will never forget, and I will continue to recommend Youthlinc to my fellow peers looking for a life changing experience. 
Youthlinc	254217		/users/profile/342539	alexandra03	Volunteer	4	08/28/2015	Going on a humanitarian trip to Guatemala was so rewarding in so many ways! I was able to come back and be a more appreciative and grateful person. There are so many great memories I will forever cherish!  My leaders were amazing and I truly miss my mentors who were there for me every step of the way. I learned a lot from being in their community and about team work. I do think that there needs to be more emphasize on being a civically engaged person in the community (long term) coming back home. 
Youthlinc	254202		/users/profile/342521	Kateannie	Volunteer	4	08/27/2015	My experience with Youthlinc was amazing! Our group leaders were incredibly organized and did a fantastic job. I was in such good hands on the trip and the experience and reliability of the leaders and adult mentors kept me at ease. The service I was able to do in country as well as locally is something I will never forget. You must me dedicated and willing to work hard, but I highly suggest applying for this program! 
Youthlinc	252091		/users/profile/340127	aubko1	Volunteer	5	08/07/2015	Youthlinc is an amazing organization that allows youth to associate with other service minded teens and adults. My team went to Peru and I couldn't have asked for a better leader, assistant team leader, or team in general. We all became very good friends over the course of the service year. This cohesiveness that we developed was crucial to our success in country. We were able to complete various projects in our village including cement work, chicken coops, and a mural. In addition to relationships within the team, I built relationships with the people of Santa Isabel that I wouldn't have without the opportunity that Youthlinc gave me to serve them.   Youthlinc isn't just some way to be able to travel outside the country, it requires students to complete 80 hours of local service before the international service trip. My local service site was a nearby elementary. I had amazing experiences with the kids that I tutored there. Overall, Yourhlinc provided me with such a wonderful experience that definitely leaves me wanting to continue serving people, both locally and internationally.
Youthlinc	251685		/users/profile/216200	Shae B.	Volunteer	5	08/05/2015	Youthlinc is an incredible organization. I have learned so much over my 3 years of participation. It is a great way to get involved in service and humanitarian work, especially because it is so hands-on. Youthlinc has changed my life and given me a huge appreciation of all of the many things I have.
Youthlinc	162887		/users/profile/216200	Shae B.	Volunteer	5	07/17/2013	Youthlinc provided me with an eye-opening and interactive view of the benefits on both ends of service (the recipient and the volunteer) both in a smaller local setting and the larger global community. I am thrilled to have become involved with Youthlinc.
Youthlinc	251449		/users/profile/164032	pernille	Volunteer	4	08/04/2015	A service trip will always change your life for the better. It makes you think of others before yourself and helps put things in perspective. Youthlinc is a wonderful way to do such a trip. It is extremely well organized, brings the best out in people, and teaches you life long lessons. I will recommend Youthlinc to anyone interested in working hard, making a different in other peoples life and wanting to learn about other peoples culture.I loved my experience as a mentor.
Youthlinc	120605		/users/profile/164032	pernille	Volunteer	4	08/14/2012	My service trip to Cambodia has been amazing. It not only taught me about service, helping others in need and putting others before myself but also about the amazing history that has shaped this country.  I loved how Youthlinc took time to educate and show us what the country and its people have been through. It is not until you understand a persons background that you can fully comprehend where they are coming from and what their needs are. I feel like we learned on so many different levels.                      While I was gone my husband was busy keeping up on his own work, the kids, running the household and several yard projects. I thought he did great, but when I made lunch for my children the first day I was home, we discovered Jason had not made it to the store to shop for groceries and therefore we were out of Thomas favorite colbyjack cheese. Thomas got really put out. What was he supposed to eat now? He could not have a sandwich without his cheese!!!! Besides there was nothing in the house to eat at all!!!! Nothing good. He was just NOT going to eat ANYthing!!!!! With my heart still in Cambodia I told him of an experience I had had the last day we were in Siem Reap. We had sat down at the restaurant to eat our breakfast. I noticed 2 boys coming in and looking under the tables and chairs. My first thought were that they had been in there to eat just before us and lost something. Silly me! It fast became clear to me that the missing object was food. They were street boys, or at least very poor boys looking for food. Starving! I quickly called the one boy over to me. He appeared to be about 8 or 9. With sign language I asked him if he was hungry and wanted food. He nodded eagerly and could not take his eyes off of my plate. I had just buttered and jamed 2 rather large pieces of bread. I had not yet touched my omelet or opened my water. I put the breads in a zip lock bag I had and did the same with my omelet. My girlfriend had now seen what was going on and helped me put another omelet in a napkin for the boys. I then gave them my water and asked one of the other students for their water as well. The expression on this little boys face when I handed him all that food was priceless. He could have run to the corner and snorfed it all down by himself, but he did not. He ran to his brother and we saw how they together sat down outside and shared. I of course was starving that morning, but hunger had never felt so good to me before. Because I was hungry, those 2 wonderful boys were full. I know you are supposed to "teach a man to fish" instead of just giving him a fish. For the past 2 weeks we had "taught men to fish". Sometimes a man just need a fish too. Those boys had nothing to eat. They had nothing in their kitchen. They were just not going to eat anything, but for different reasons than my son, Thomas.                       After telling this story nothing else was said in the kitchen for quite a while. My other children ate their food in silence, thankful they had food.  Thomas just sat there and thought. After about 4-5 minutes he got up, got the provelone cheese out, put it on his sandwich and ate it in silence.                         Thank you Youthlinc for giving me this unforgettable experience. I have memories and lessons for a lifetime.    Pernille Ream, Mentor.
Youthlinc	251305	1	/users/profile/339231	guajiraz	General Member of the Public	4	08/03/2015	My daughter went to Peru with Youthlinc.  It was a wonderful experience, but I'm not going to lie, the year leading up to the trip was difficult.  She was awarded a scholarship for the trip but had to come up with the rest of the money herself.  Working part time while going to school and doing regular community service was very hard.  However, she would not have changed anything.  Her local service site was amazing and helped shape her thoughts about future careers.  She wants to go again but this time she thinks her parents should come!   
Youthlinc	250095		/users/profile/337925	ASteenburgh	Donor	5	07/26/2015	My son participated in the Nepal July group with Youthlinc.  The team was assembled before the devastating earthquake.  The communication with parents after the earthquake was outstanding.  The leadership for the team was wonderful.   The structure of Youthlinc's program is fantastic!  I was so impressed prior to the team's departure and am even more so now they are home.  Kids are engrossed in service prior to leaving.  This continues on the service trip.  These kids worked very, very hard for the villagers in Suntakhan village.  They met many new friends.   So grateful.  Thank you, Youthlinc!
Youthlinc	250070		/users/profile/273352	maggie.bradford26	Volunteer	5	07/26/2015	Youthlinc has shown me how I want to spend the rest of my life: serving others. I could not be more grateful to this organization and to the wonderful people who help make it what it is.
Youthlinc	210578		/users/profile/273352	maggie.bradford26	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	I have been volunteering with Youthlinc for years and I couldn't be happier with the results within the community, the international community, the mentors, the students, and their parents. Youthlinc changes lives all over. One of the best parts of Youthlinc is the required community service hours--giving back to the community before going abroad.
Youthlinc	248757		/users/profile/336526	Hannahkh15	Volunteer	5	07/17/2015	This organization has helped me realize the importance of service and what it can do for your own community as well as international communities.  It was a wonderful learning experience for me and I will surly do this again!
Youthlinc	248701		/users/profile/336467	Mia24	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	Being a part of Youthlinc has changed my life for the better! I would recommend it to anyone whether they are interested in service or not.
Youthlinc	248666		/users/profile/336433	wednesdayhackwell	Volunteer	5	07/16/2015	Youthlinc provides an amazing opportunity for youth and adults to come together and work on creating a better world by doing local and international service. You may think that the international trip is the whole reason for all of the work that you do, but really, that's just an added benefit. Doing service anywhere and everywhere is the main reason for even joining Youthlinc and you should enjoy giving your all to help others. I loved being a part of the Youthlinc team and helping those around me both internationally and locally. I loved getting to know the people and youth I worked with on a much deeper level at my main service site. I loved creating bonds with the people on my team, and with those we worked with at our international site. In all, Youthlinc is an amazing program and by participating, you will gain new opportunities that you may never get again in your lifetime.
Youthlinc	248260		/users/profile/335965	mcdonaldj	Volunteer	5	07/13/2015	I served as a mentor in the Youthlinc Guatemala 2015 team. I am impressed with both the Youthlinc model and learning philosophy. Students must undertake 80 hours of domestic service prior to their international summer trip along with monthly meetings--this is true committed service and not just a vacation tour masquerading as a service experience.  Pedagogically, Youthlinc is very much committed to an engaged learning model coupled with reflection as an intentional piece of the educational process. In Guatemala, Youthlinc partnered with a boot-on-the-ground NGO that was a model for engaged and sustainable development. It was a pleasure all the way around working with the students, community, and NGO as we collectively made a contribution the betterment of us all. 
Youthlinc	248211		/users/profile/335910	boonhuish	Volunteer	5	07/13/2015	I loved the whole youthlinc experience.  i think that the organization as a whole is a much better humanitarian group than many others because of the service hours required.  I loved my main service site, it was such a fun way to get involved in my community more and serve.  I loved the international trip, i loved the leaders on the trip, my group was the best group ever.  definitely one of the best experiences i have ever had in my whole life
Youthlinc	248182		/users/profile/269123	annabanana9700	Volunteer	5	07/12/2015	I served a trip to Thailand in 2014 and now in 2015 returned to Nepal. As an alum leader this time, I had new experiences and responsibility. From the beginning of the year, I knew as an alum leader I was held up to a standard as a leader. This new responsibility helped me focus and direct my attention to my team and I felt more involved. Nepal was a new and wonderful experience. With the recent earthquake, there were many things that I saw that changed my views on everyday life. Many people had lost their homes and family members to the earthquake and were out of hope in their life. The children in the village were loving and accepting to everyone that helped. The love you feel for the children and your team after every trip is unreal, you love them as you would love your family. In Thailand, I spent most of my construction time painting and washing floors. As much as painting and cleaning floors is important and the work still needs to get done, I decided before I went to Nepal that I would spend my time doing hard, intense labor. When it was time for the handwork, I made sure that I was willing and happy to help out. The work was hard and very tiring but the overall experience was great. As much as I was tired, I decided long before that I was going to work as hard as I could. At the end of the trip, I felt like I impacted the team and the overall projects with my work. If I have any advice to give to future Youthlinc participants it would be to work as hard as you can. What you end up getting out the trip is so much better than just sitting around. Your sense of accomplishment and that you helped contribute to something boosts your confidence and overall happiness on the trip. 
Youthlinc	206663		/users/profile/269123	annabanana9700	Volunteer	5	07/19/2014	My entire family has always been involved with youthlinc and my sister had previously gone on a trip to Guatemala two years before I was selected to go on my service trip. My sister came home and loved her experience so much I knew I would want to have the same experience as her. Once I was old enough I applied right away and luckily was able to be selected to go on the Thailand July team. All of out meeting throughout the year helped build the excitement to the upcoming trip. Having our 80 hours of service was stressful but well worth it in the end and helped you realize that you don't need to go to an international country to make a difference. Finally we were able to leave on our trip and it reached far beyond my expectations. Everything there was wonderful and I loved every aspect of it. The people and the kids and the whole culture was amazing and I fell in love with the beautiful country. 
Youthlinc	248172		/users/profile/335862	KarleeZ	Volunteer	5	07/12/2015	Youthlinc is the most amazing way to meet new people and serve others. I had the best experience. You're able to connect with new people and make memories that will last a lifetime. It's a great way to experience different culture and better the lives of others. I would definitely go on a trip again
Youthlinc	248110		/users/profile/215424	Lori68	Volunteer	5	07/11/2015	Can I just say, I LOVE Youthlinc!!!  My daughter heard about Youthlinc at her high school and she told me about it. Between us, we've done 5 trips.  She went as a volunteer and as an alum leader.  I have mentored 3 trips.  From a parent standpoint, I love the connection between local and international service.  I also love the organization and safety of the international trips.  I slept well knowing my daughter was in good hands.  As a mentor, I am so grateful and inspired.  Seeing youth rise to the opportunity of service never ceases to amaze me.  The growth I see over the year is huge!  Students bond with each other and form international relationships that will touch their hearts forever.  I will be forever grateful to Youthlinc!
Youthlinc	162325		/users/profile/215424	Lori68	Volunteer	5	07/09/2013	Youthlinc's mission is to create lifelong humanitarians.  It is geared toward students and young adults.  I went to Kajuki, Kenya as a mentor.  I went to serve and to teach.  But, in reality, I was the one being served and learned much more than I could ever teach.  I never knew I could love a total stranger, let alone an entire community. The story and love in the Kenyan eyes I looked into and within the hands I held will last a life-time.  I took so many photos hoping to capture each moment, but upon arriving home, I realized that although photos, videos, and journal entries will help trigger memories, the feelings of love and gratitude and burned deep in my heart.  Being able to see another culture and give completely for 2 weeks is truly life-changing.  I came home wanting to be a better wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend, teacher, and humanitarian.  Mission accomplished!  It was also such a blessing to travel with 38 amazing team members.  I felt safe, appreciated, and needed.  Youthlinc has changed my life forever!
Youthlinc	248051		/users/profile/335721	MarissaQ	Volunteer	5	07/10/2015	Youthlinc is an absolutely outstanding nonprofit organization doing good for the people who need it most! We take the preparation we do and apply everything to the in country experience and teach the people how to strive with the opportunities and supplies that they have. Youthlinc isn't just dropping supplies off to the villagers, they're making sure that the villagers know how to use the supplies and know how to strive with and without them. I recommend to everyone, its absolutely astounding. 
Youthlinc	248046		/users/profile/335714	Britbarlow97	Volunteer	5	07/10/2015	Youthlinc is a humanitarian nonprofit that I have been involved with for over 3 years. I have done the local service that they require and gone on international trips and can honestly say it's the best thing I've ever done. It makes service and volunteer work more than just a summer fling, but more of daily habit. 
Youthlinc	247717		/users/profile/335324	Shalese C.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/07/2015	I have had the privilege and opportunity to participate in two service year trips with Youthlinc, both of which have been to Kenya Africa.  I have been volunteering as a mentor for the Community Health Committee (a smaller group within the team). Everything I learned while studying Public Health in college has been applicable and beneficial to this role. I've really enjoyed the focus on education while we taught about Clean Water, Dental Hygiene, Personal Hygiene, Family Health, Malaria Prevention, STD/HIV prevention, Anti-smoking/drinking, Female Health, and so much more. This last year we were able to also focus on teaching and education girls about their bodies, caring for them, and handing out Days for Girls kits that allow them to continue to attend school even when they are on their periods. This will allow more girls to finish school and go to the University and to be able to change generations in the future. It has been an incredible experience working with everyone; the staff in the office, the team leader(s), the team, and all the people we work closely with while in country.  I love the focus on education and knowledge sharing rather then hand-outs. We prepare from October til we leave in the summer for the lessons we will teach, the projects we will implement, and so much more. The preparation time helps to make the experience that much more powerful! When there I feel as though we are working together with the people to help them find solutions that work for them. We are there assisting in the education and sharing of information. I loved my experiences and am excited to continue to be a volunteer/mentor with such a wonderful organization. 
Youthlinc	247595		/users/profile/335170	tynman	Volunteer	5	07/06/2015	A great year-long service opportunity. Youthlinc delivers! The in-country coordinators found real needs in the community, and we were able to make a difference.
Youthlinc	247514		/users/profile/335065	Litton1999	Volunteer	5	07/05/2015	the Cambodia 2015 trip has been one of the highlights of my life. no other experience could amount to this. leaving our everyday problems behind and traveling half way around the world to serve is definitely something I want to do again. the local service and service in country have helped me develop certain people skills and have gone towards a resume for a bright future. it was hard work in the beginning but it all comes together and is worth it! I loved getting to know the people I met in Cambodia and also the people I worked beside, these people will be life long friends. if you ever get the amazing opportunity to go on a humanitarian trip through youthlinc, just do it! it will be the best decision you have ever made!
Youthlinc	247478		/users/profile/335019	Sylvia J.	Volunteer	5	07/04/2015	I just returned from my 6th Youthlinc trip. It was my 4th trip to Kenya. After a 4 year break, I finally got to go on another trip. I hadn't realized how much i missed doing a service trip. From 2006 until this year Youthlinc has evolved and progressed. This was by far my best trip out of the six trips I have taken. Youthlinc does an amazing job organizing the trips. Every minute is filled with meaningful activities. I took my 17 year old on this trip. It was her first service trip and she was excited but did not know what to expect. Now all she can talk about is doing another trip. She told me that she had not expected to get so involved, love the people she served, and get attached to the children in Kenya. She had a hard time leaving and has a completely different outlook on life. Youthlinc manages to organize trips that not only serve the people in country but also forever touches the volunteers, youth and adult mentors alike. None of us comes away from a trip without realizing how much we as Americans are blessed and how fulfilling sharing ourselves with less fortunate children. We gain invaluable culture awareness, and experience. ever since my first Youthlinc trip, I have had a hard time enjoying regular sight seeing vacations. If service is not part of a vacation it seems we waste our time.  I can highly recommend Youthlinc to anyone. If you are looking to serve others, while being part of  a well organized trip, then Youthlinc is the charity. I don't know of another charity that stresses service in our home country to qualify for the service trip. Youthlinc strives to create life time humanitarians. It certainly has done that for every one of my family members that have participated. 
Youthlinc	247276		/users/profile/334786	ta12	Volunteer	5	07/02/2015	     I recently returned from the 2014-2015 youthlinc trip to Kenya. The trip was a fantastic opportunity to learn and grow while serving others. The trip didn't "change my life" it provided an experience that helped others in meaningful ways and in turn, helped me grow as an individual. Actively participating in the 2014-2015 service year helped me realize the impact meaningful service can have on those in need.       I have been back a week and everyday I find my mind wandering to those we helped in Kenya. I cherish those memories and they have fueled a desire to continually look for ways to help those in need. I couldn't be more satisfied with the work and results of the service year. I look forward to continue volunteering with youthlinc. It is a fantastic organization that is effective, well-run, and it changes lives. 
Youthlinc	247262	1	/users/profile/334769	braydendavies13	Volunteer	5	07/02/2015	It was an amazing experience. It allowed the opportunity to go and serve in a way that not everyone has the chance too. It really reinforced the idea that one person can make a difference if they try. Along with the international service and relationships developed, I was also able to grow through my local service and was able to help kids in Salt Lake as well. 
Youthlinc	246992		/users/profile/334460	Marci6	General Member of the Public	5	07/01/2015	I am a parent  that had a daughter on the Kenya 2015 trip.  Not only was her youthlinc experience in Africa Awesome!!, but it has also magnified her desire to serve others in her community. She is looking for ways to be involved in serving in college and of course talking about her next trip with youthlinc.  I always had confidence in Youthlinc that she would be safe and taken care of. I strongly recommend youthlinc to anyone considering it.  Plan on sending my last two boys when they are old enough.
Youthlinc	246836		/users/profile/334285	applenanaman	Volunteer	5	06/30/2015	Youthlinc is an amazing organization and I really loved volunteering with them. The local service is perfect for getting involved with your community and serving those who need your service. I loved working with the people at my local service site. Real life and Youthlincs partnership is a great one. The international service trip is the perfect ending to the service year. I loved Kenya; the people are amazing, the service is real and lasting and helpful, and the experience is life-changing. I recommend this to anyone interested in falling in love with service. -Also, for those worried about the cost, I was able to fundraise almost all of my costs.  I highly recommend the letter system Youthlinc introduces you to, and if the price is the only thing holding you back, please don't let it. Fundraising works, and this experience is WORTH IT. Thank you Youthlinc!
Youthlinc	246798		/users/profile/334241	Juliahaglund	Volunteer	5	06/30/2015	My experience this year has been life changing, I was able to volunteer at a school with a high population of refugees students, and saw how important education was for them. The students I worked with were from families in extreme poverty situation here in Salt Lake. When I arrived in Kenya I experienced true poverty. My experience in Kenya was truly magnificent. Working with the children in St. Peter's and Kathwana has changed my life. I feel very close to them, and want to continue working with them in the future. The Youthlinc organization has been wonderful to work with and has Amazing leaders, and mentors that has helped me all along the way. 
Youthlinc	246720		/users/profile/334155	Tanner H.	Volunteer	5	06/30/2015	Youthlinc has changed my life. Going into the service year, I hadn't realized the importance of local service. Through my time at Horizonte Alternative, I was able to understand the importance of giving back to the community. During my time in Kenya, I saw that poverty is everywhere. I had to go all the way to Kenya to realize that poverty exists at home in Salt Lake City. It was an incredible experience, and I can't wait to continue to volunteer in Salt Lake this fall. 
Youthlinc	224970		/users/profile/288740	Kaysville Rotary Club	Donor	5	10/22/2014	The Kaysville Rotary Club is a proud donor for many years.  We look forward to sponsoring students each year who come back enriched with life changing experiences, while serving their fellow man in far away places.   Thank you for allowing us to be a part of Youthlinc as a donor.
Youthlinc	216437		/users/profile/279924	rsmith1015	Volunteer	5	09/22/2014	The last time I volunteered with Youthlinc was in 2013. This year I will be volunteering again. I am so excited to meet new people with a similar vision of helping other. My experience in 2013 was life changing and one of the best experiences of my life. I am looking forward to the 2015 service year and working with so many wonderful people.
Youthlinc	211003		/users/profile/273827	mckennapetty	Advisor	5	08/17/2014	Youthlinc far exceeded any expectations I had of them. I am so glad I got myself involved in this incredible organization and will be for the rest of my life. They are organized, understanding, helpful, and truly care about their cause and every single person involved with the organization. They work so hard to make the service year the best ever and it always is. You will never regret being involved with Youthlinc because they provide opportunities you cannot get anywhere else. Meeting new people in your community and all over the world, gaining a life-long love for service, being completely changed by the people you meet on your trip and through your local service, and most importantly making a change. I love Youthlinc and recommend it to anyone!
Youthlinc	210927	1	/users/profile/273738	Chasem	Volunteer	5	08/16/2014	This year, traveling to Thailand to help the Burmese people was one of the most life changing experiences I have ever had. Realizing how much we did for these people and how thankful they were for us being there was an incredible feeling. Not only did we go to teach and help the Burmese people but the Burmese people taught us. We left with more knowledge about there culture and way of life then we had arriving. It was an amazing experience that I will never forget.
Youthlinc	210682		/users/profile/273469	Annabelle H.	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	Youthlinc was such a life changing experience for me. The way the program is run is wonderful and it honestly does make life long humanitarians. The opportunities they give to serve inside your community and in the outside world are amazing. Not only did I bond with the people of Guatemala but I also with my whole team and I made friendships that will last a lifetime.  Youthlinc was one of the bet experiences of my life and I would recommend it to everyone. 
Youthlinc	210599		/users/profile/273374	danicalhoon	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	My time with Youthlinc was one of the most defining and unforgettable experiences of my life. Youthlinc pushed me to make volunteerism a part of my life and I'm so glad it did. Service has helped to shape the person I'm becoming and has inspired me to dedicate my life to helping others. I can't wait to do another service trip with this organization. 
Youthlinc	210574		/users/profile/143714	Kevin24	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	Youthlinc is fantastic and I would recommend it to anybody looking to make a difference. 
Youthlinc	106408		/users/profile/143714	Kevin24	Volunteer	5	02/14/2012	I heard about Youthlinc a few years ago and immediately wanted to get involved.  Youthlinc was not only able to give me an opportunity to travel to Kenya and make a difference there, but it helped me realize there are plenty of places in our community that need help.  Traveling to Kenya and making a difference for the people there was definitely life-changing and anyone involved will tell you the same thing.  Thanks to Youthlinc and the wonderful people apart of it, I'm volunteering regularly and am now headed back to Kenya for a second time.  Youthlinc is absolutely amazing and I would recommend it to anyone.  
Youthlinc	208307		/users/profile/270985	Joelbruder04	Volunteer	5	08/01/2014	I have never met such a caring, generous and enthusiastic group of people like the ones I met at Youthlinc. The people here put all their efforts toward us volunteers and to our mutual goal to help the community we were visiting. All of these people are very supportive and help you accomplish all your tasks. They completely prepare you for your trip and are willing to go the extra mile just to help you out. I've experienced this personally. As my trip to Kenya was almost here I was overwhelmed with school work, sports, and Youthlinc tasks. However, my group reached out and help me accomplish what I needed to do for the trip. Everyone helped everyone, we made sure that we were all going to be prepared and not left behind. 
Youthlinc	207890		/users/profile/270589	Andaman_Discoveries	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/31/2014	As a partner working with the Youthlinc team in Thailand, we were impressed by the work ethic and interest level of the volunteers to complete their projects.  Their hard work and enthusiasm will be remembered by the Burmese community for a long time to come!  Thank you.  
Youthlinc	207826		/users/profile/270510	ashton.bailee	Volunteer	5	07/30/2014	Youthlinc was amazing! I absolutely loved every minute I was able to be apart of the organization. I went on a service trip to Kenya, Africa this past summer. Youthlinc really made sure that everyone on the team was well taken care of and safe. Not for one moment did I think I wasn't safe or taken care of. The leaders of this organization are incredible! They make sure you feel welcome and have a great experience. I highly  recommend using Youthlinc if you are ever thinking about going on an humanitarian trip. They really are the best! I cant wait to go on more service trips with Youthlinc throughout the years! 
Youthlinc	207551		/users/profile/270218	Trinny	Volunteer	4	07/28/2014	Youthlinc is a wonderful organization that strives to provide leadership opportunities to youth while finding sustainable solutions to help those less fortunate. I was able to participate in an international trip to Kenya this past June and I can say it was one of the most challenging and heartwarming experiences I have ever had.  It was great seeing all of the hard work planning over the months leading up to the trip come to life once in country. The team worked so well together and was so flexible when something came up and plans changed.  Over all this was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend it to friends!
Youthlinc	207310		/users/profile/269946	livyandrus	Volunteer	4	07/26/2014	Youthlinc is very good at keeping you well informed and busy the entire time you're in the country. Not only do you get to teach the locals there something new, but you learn things yourself, too, whether it's about yourself or about the people you're helping. There was perfect balance between interacting with those we were helping and getting to know more about them and doing other activities such as construction. I would definitely recommend this organization to a friend!
Youthlinc	207201		/users/profile/160744	Jennifer_	Volunteer	3	07/24/2014	Youthlinc is absolutely one of the best non profits out there right now. It gives students a chance to travel and make a world wide difference. 
Youthlinc	118176		/users/profile/160744	Jennifer_	Volunteer	5	07/12/2012	My year with Youthlinc really changed my life. From the moment my team all met for the first time, to the second we boarded the plane to come home from Cambodia. It really helped to have such an amazing team along side me, going through the exact same things I was going through. We all got along so well. A lot better than I thought we were going to. We became a family on this trip. We stuck together and never left a single person out. I truly think the Cambodia team was the best team here. We were all so determined to fundraise and help. We all worked so hard to get to out goals. We were even determined to have the best lessons to teach the kids there. We spend so much time thinking of ways to make our lessons even better. We revised them about four times each! Every thing we were going to be doing over there was so important to us. We wanted to make sure everything was perfect. I do think we deserve so recognition for out hard work. My trip with Youthlinc was something I will never forget. Our hard work was greatly appreciated by the villagers. It really touched my heart to see how excited they were with everything we had done. I felt very honored while I was there. I feel so lucky that I got to be a part of it. They were so welcoming from when we arrived, to the day we left. I learned that even the smallest things, can make the greatest impact on a person. We changed their lives as they changed mine. It was truly the experience of a life time. I have made life long friends within the group and also back in Cambodia. I will definitely try to go back and volunteer and help out as much as I can! I hope that next years Cambodia team will live up to our teams standards. I think we really raised the bar this year and I hope it gets raised even higher next year. I want to personally thank Youthlinc for being so incredible. Without it, I don't think I would have been able to have had this amazing, life changing experience. Youthlinc helps change the lives of so many people and with their help, I got to change lives too. I can't even begin to thank Youthlinc enough! I hope it keeps helping people like me, to change the  lives of others. Thank you Youthlinc, for making 2012 the greatest year by far for me!!!  
Youthlinc	206855		/users/profile/269341	Samcarter25	Volunteer	4	07/21/2014	My international service trip to Thailand this July was amazing. Our team was extremely hard working and we were able to change the lives of everyone involved in the Burmese learning center.  We constructed a back wall for the learning center to prevent  burglars from breaking in, assembled a hydroponic garden so the school could be more self sufficient and not only have more food to consume but be able to sell to local restaurants as well. Our team also assembled and cemented an entire playground for the kids, dug multiple six foot holes for a septic tank, made a gutter for proper drainage of water, cleaned and remodeled the cleaning areas so dishes could be sanitary, and much more. Another great experience was bonding with the Burmese children and also having cultural conversations with poor fisherman. These experiences changed my life and will forever make me more grateful of the people i am surrounded by and the things I own. 
Youthlinc	206673		/users/profile/269131	Postojnska_Jama	Volunteer	5	07/19/2014	I participated in Youthlinc this past year, and it is incredible. Unlike many similar organizations, Youthlinc does not just impose itself in the lives of the people it serves internationally, but instead asks what the community needs and does what it can to give the community that thing. My trip to Guatemala was a life-changing experience, not least because Youthlinc provided an environment for positive interactions and connections with the Guatemalans and the other team members. I will never forget the time I spent with the Guatemalan people. Not only did we work on two construction projects and life skills lessons (English and sewing), but we got to experience the culture of Guatemala, and show them a bit of our own culture. The trip went so smoothly, and preparations were not at all lacking, and it was much more fun than I expected. I was also changed by the local service I did with Youthlinc (the organization's main focus). I loved that I could choose a service site that matched my interests and even experiment with different sites for some of my local service hours. I will not forget this year and I will certainly stay involved with Youthlinc. Its mission to create lifetime humanitarians is being fulfilled from what I can see.
Youthlinc	206667		/users/profile/215568	Lauren Jackson	Volunteer	5	07/19/2014	My Youthlinc experience has been absolutely amazing. Last year I went to Guatemala and the people there changed my life. I fell in love with their culture and their ability to be so happy with so little. Watching someones face after you have served them is priceless. I loved Youthlinc and it's motives so much that I went back this year as an Alum leader on the thailand july team. I fell in love with the Burmese kids from the moment we drove up to the school. The second i got out of the bus, little kids came up to me and were waving, smiling, and giving me high fives. Moments like that make you stop and think about what you are doing. Giving a small child a high five in Thailand is service. Watching kids faces light up at their new playground is service. Digging a 7ft deep hole with a hoe usually isn't what someone would do for fun, but with youthlinc it is fun. The wonderful thing about the international service trips is that the work people do is not temporary,  it is designed to help in the future too. In thailand this year we built a playground for the kids. A playground may not seem like a big deal to an american kid but to a Burmese kid, it is a reason to come to school. I remember our in country coordinator saying that because of that playground, more kids will want to come to school. That playground may be the start of a little kid getting an education and getting out of poverty. That's a big deal. Another project that we worked on in Thailand is a bathroom/septic tank for the toddlers. The school already has a bathroom so a second bathroom doesn't seem needed, but it really was. The toddlers aren't big enough to use the bathroom already at the school so they usually just do their business on the floor...gross. With the new bathroom the toddlers will be able to use their smaller toilets. Having pee all over the bathroom floor is one really gross and two not healthy. Health is already an issue with the Burmese refugees and they don't need another factor added to the list of health problems. So the bathroom was a needed project that will benefit the kids in the future. Youthlinc is such a special program. After being involved with it the last 2 years, I don't want to stop! I feel like Youthlinc has inspired me to truly be a lifetime humanitarian.
Youthlinc	162410		/users/profile/215568	Lauren Jackson	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	This year I was apart of the Guatemala Team with Youthlinc. I was amazed at how involved i was in my community and also in country. I had opportunities to serve all year round with amazing people. After my Youthlinc experience, I noticed that I was always smiling, happy, and willing to serve. This organization is remarkable and I recommend that everyone should apply to be apart of any Youthlinc team. 
Youthlinc	206654		/users/profile/269110	AussieMags	Volunteer	5	07/19/2014	On my Youthlinc trip to Guatemala I learned so much more about the world then I ever could have in a classroom. My service year began in 2013, and without the motivation I received from Youthlinc I would not have made the impact that I did in my community. In Guatemala my committee assisted in educating the local youth as well as assisting three families in starting a self sustaining livestock business. Overall I think that Youthlinc far exceeds expectations in it development of the lives of it's volunteers, as well as the development the service creates in communities in need, both foreign and domestic.
Youthlinc	206642		/users/profile/269095	m.floodman6	Volunteer	4	07/19/2014	You will not provide life saving medical treatments nor change the circumstance of these families by giving them money. No, with Youthlinc you give something far more important to the people of other countries: education.  The best way to change someone's circumstance is to give them a tool they can use for the rest of their lives, and that is knowledge.  You see the value and strength education gives these people and they are so appreciative for your lessons and your help in providing another school.  I traveled to Cambodia with Youthlinc to a small village in Pusat and worked to build a preschool and provide health education. I know that the availability of a preschool in the village with truly change the villager's circumstances and ability to learn, and that is something  they will always be able to use for generations to come.  
Youthlinc	206101		/users/profile/268458	serveitup	Volunteer	5	07/15/2014	I went with youthlinc on a humanitarian trip for two weeks this June.We worked with the Burmese refugees in kuraburi, Thailand. Our construction site was the Burmese learning center where all the kids kindergarten through sixth grade attend school. The school was built two years ago, but ran out of money. There is a team going in July to finish the projects that we started. The school has a front wall, but no back or side walls. We halfway finished the back wall. We planted bushes along the walls that the kids will be able to pick fruit off of to eat. We tiled the floors in their classrooms and kitchen. We patched a hole in the roof so it wouldn't rain in the classroom anymore. We also fixed up and repainted their playground equipment. Construction was hard. It was very hot and humid. If it wasn't sunny, it was  pouring rain. A lot of the work we did was hard manual labor and very repetitive. I cannot tell you how many buckets of rocks I carried, or how much bug and maggot infested trash I scraped up and carried out. There was one day toward the end of the trip that I was getting very sick of hauling stupid buckets of rocks, but I just kept on going. I wasn't in a very good mood, I wad just doing what needed to be done. Mike finally sent us on a water break. I was happy just to have a short break. While I was drinking my water Wiasoo came up to me and wanted to play a little hand game with me. We played for a couple of minutes. Then Oolulai came over and played with me too. In those couple of minutes I was rejuvenated and reminded why I came and who I was doing all this work for. If anyone ever got burnt out or sad, all we had to do was spend a couple minutes with one of those happy little burmese kids and we would be ready to work again. Those kids truly amaze me and I miss them so much. Not only do we do a  construction project, but we also go out into the community and teach health lessons, business lessons, a new skill, and have cultural conversations. I was on the vocational committee, which teaches a new skill. I was able to participate in all of the committees as well. We taught a group of women there how to sew. We donated three sewing machines to them an the business committee help them set up a co-op. I have always loved sewing and have taught many kids to sew at sewing camps in the summer, but this was a whole new experience. We had translators because I don't speak Thai or Burmese. These women and girls were all so eager to learn. They picked it up so fast! We only had to tell one or two ladies what to do and then they would proceed to teach each other. It made our job a whole lot easier, but then we had to come up with extra projects for them since they flew through all of our planned projects. We also taught English lessons at the school. I was kind of nervous about my lesson. I've taught many kids before, but never ones that didn't speak my language. My lesson went really well though. A lot of the kids were really excited to learn, and the older ones already knew some English. The first grade class was definitely the greatest challenge. There were two kids, Pulapi and Nyete, who were the definite class clowns. They were running all over the place and making the other kids want to cause trouble with them. I had helpers in my classroom to quiet them down so that they would sit through the class. Once they calmed down, everyone else was fine and class went smoothly. Everyday two youthlinc groups went out into the community. Each group would go into one of the people's homes an their neighbors came over. We gave the health lessons--sanitation, cooking food properly, washing your hands, etc--first. They mostly already knew that they were supposed to do these things, so we just reminded then that when they do it it keeps their families healthier and there is less chance of them getting sick. After the health lesson is the cultural conversation. This was definitely my favorite part. And all we did was talk. We asked questions about their lives, they asked questions about ours. These people have all been through so much. They truly amaze me what they put up with everyday, and they opened their homes to us, which are literally one 10 foot by 12 foot room with a squatter and cooking area out the back door. They don't have much, but they shared with it all with us. The most interesting cultural conversation was when a Burmese woman said that she feels like Americas get to "live to live, but we are just living to survive." Erin asked he how we could help change that. She said that's what is so great about the sewing and business lessons. We are teaching them skills so that they can start their own business and be able to make more money to better their situation.Youthlinc wants to get away from the classic "handouts" that humanitarians give and change that to giving a "hand up." We do give out many donations while we are there, but we also teach useful skills and learn things from them. It was a true cultural exchange.
Youthlinc	206022		/users/profile/268317	david.h.mays	Volunteer	5	07/14/2014	I've absolutely love the mission of Youthlinc and feel the way things are handled on the trips are excellent. It is especially nice peace of mind that on our trip we had a well qualified nurse with us.  I saw some really amazing and beautiful places on our end of service year trip to Guatemala. I love that the real focus though is helping students become lifetime humanitarians by serving in their own communities. 
Youthlinc	205755		/users/profile/267997	KP1734	Volunteer	5	07/11/2014	Youthlinc helped me gain the experience of serving those in need and allowed me to gain the leadership skills and confiendemce to get to the point where i felt that my service was changing someones life for the better. Youthlinc helped me gain confidence that will translate over into every other area of my future adult life. I am forever in Youthlinc debt because they gave me the tools that will help me to have a meaningful and joyful exsistance.
Youthlinc	205366		/users/profile/267510	han.hoj	Volunteer	5	07/08/2014	This organization does a great job with really helping students become life long humanitarians.  After Cambodia with Youthlinc in 2012, I was hooked.  I quickly started volunteering in my community and have loved every minute.  I thank Youthlinc everyday for the relationships I have made and experiences I have had through volunteering.  Youthlinc has taught me many great life lessons such as hard work and being resourceful. Youthlinc also does a great job making me feel safe both in and out of country and they are always very organized.  Great experience and I hope to do it yet again!
Youthlinc	205310		/users/profile/267453	jenessa.lyn	Volunteer	5	07/07/2014	I have been on three humanitarian trips with Youthlinc now.  I am always impressed by this organization's efforts to make service sustainable and by their ability to improve on their own service model each year to do even more good.  My experiences with Youthlinc have been life-changing and I have seen Youthlinc have this same impact on countless students and adult professionals.  I recommend Youthlinc highly to anyone looking for a rewarding service learning experience.
Youthlinc	205226		/users/profile/267354	brina.keri	Volunteer	5	07/06/2014	I loved my experience with Youthlinc! The people I worked with were easy going, fun to be around, hard working, and happy! It introduced me to volunteering weekly here in Utah and it gave me an incredible international experience. When I arrived in country I loved every minute and never wanted to leave. I'd go back right now if I could! My experience taught me so much and has changed my life. Youthlinc is a great program and it increases your desire to serve greatly. I'm very grateful I got to be a part of this organization! 
Youthlinc	205113		/users/profile/267208	buhler.emily	Volunteer	5	07/03/2014	It was such a privilege for me to participate in this amazing organization this year!  I am so thankful for my Youthlinc experience because it first taught me that there are countless service opportunities right in my own community.  I learned that there is always someone nearby who could benefit from even an hour of service.  Youthlinc also gave me the chance to embark on the greatest adventure of my life.  From travelling internationally, I gained a deeper perspective on and respect for people who live completely different lifestyles from my own.  It greatly humbled me and touched my heart to have a few weeks where I could forget about myself and serve others.  During my stay in Thailand, I connected with people on a personal level, experienced a new culture, and learned to work hard.  
Youthlinc	205089		/users/profile/267181	jsonkens	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/03/2014	As a physician,  I felt it was time for me to intensify my efforts in educating others on the great field of healthcare.  So many have taught me so much throughout my professional career and I wanted to share this knowledge.  My desire on this trip was:1) To educate my team and those we served that by taking better care of ourselves we can come to take care of others better;2) To impress upon our team that there are many things we can do to help others;3) To provide health education on things that could be sustained by those living in Peru after we left;4) For those we served to know that we truly cared about them and wanted to improve their lives in important ways;  5) For all of us to learn how by working together we become far more effective than if we tried to accomplish these things on our own. The strength of Youthlinc is that they have an excellent method of training volunteers before they leave through providing local service.  By setting high standards of personal conduct the volunteers become ambassadors of humanitarian service, both in our community and worldwide.   Sincerely, Jerry Sonkens, M.D.
Youthlinc	205024		/users/profile/267111	whit_m_h	Volunteer	5	07/02/2014	Participating in Youthlinc has been the best thing I have ever done in my life. I learned many life lessons that I will continue to carry with me. I got experience in leadership, planning large projects, and following through with them. I would love to participate in Youthlinc every year and I wish everyone would get that opportunity. Working with my team and team leaders was so enjoyable. I will never forget the people that I have shared this experience with. I loved that I got to serve my community before I went and served internationally. It really made me feel like I was making a difference here at home and across the world. I love that we get to plan our in-country projects before we are actually at our site. It made the projects much more meaningful. That being said, the best part was obviously being in-country. My time in Africa changed my life. The people there have so little but are grateful for so much. They are the happiest people I have ever met. And I love knowing that their joy is real, honest, genuine joy. Not joy that comes from material items. They make you feel so welcome and make you feel like you have a home there in Africa. They are the type of people I would love to surround myself with because their smiles and happiness are contagious. The kids are also right up there with the people. They are so amazing! They are loving, caring, funny, genuine, happy, and so so much more. I met so many kids who wanted to be doctors, pilots, teachers, etc. Their dreams motivate me to keep working towards mine. I have learned to love and appreciate where I come from and to be grateful for everything and every opportunity I have had and will have. But more importantly, I have learned to love, appreciate, and be grateful for the people of Kajuki. I wish they knew how indebted I am to them. I will never forget their sweet spirits and angelic smiles. This has truly been the best experience. Thank you Youthlinc for giving me this opportunity.

Youthlinc has united me with different people and cultures around the globe, left me humbled and made me realize what it means to be a descent human being.  Anyone would be lucky to be apart of such an outstanding organization.  Youthlinc truely changes lives and creates lifetime humanitarians.
Youthlinc	204629		/users/profile/266656	kayliewitty	Volunteer	4	06/29/2014	I volunteered once a week at a daycare and it was really awesome and fun! then once i was in-country doing service and actually seeing all the planning go into place and see it in action was way cool!  I could actually see the things that we were doing were making a difference in those peoples' lives.  
Youthlinc	204617		/users/profile/266646	kekeb1313	Volunteer	5	06/29/2014	Youthlinc has changed my views on the world. It makes me realize how licht we are to love in this wonderful country and to have so many things we have. I love how Youthlinc focuses on local service before we go on the international service trip. It makes you appreciate doing service here and makes you get in the habit of doing service before we leave to the international site. 
Youthlinc	204606		/users/profile/266633	ErinJensen	Volunteer	5	06/29/2014	This was the most amazing experience of my life. I loved my group, the people of Peru. I felt that we were actually useful in the village. We built a school house, garden, bridge, and sidewalks. I knew we were helpful because the people were so grateful for us and loved us. I would recommend this to anyone this was a life changing experience.

You really make a huge difference in this world and Im really proud to be partnered with you and am excited to see how this partnership continues to evolve.  Thanks again for everything! Mikell
Youthlinc	67572		/users/profile/73852	Mikell S.	Volunteer	5	02/13/2011	I am so impressed with Youthlinc. They're not just about doing having volunteers do one time service on trips - they are about cultivating life long humanitarians. I am so excited to be a volunteer for this organization, and look forward to doing some good work in Kenya with our amazing team!
Youthlinc	199454		/users/profile/260393	Erin808	Volunteer	5	05/01/2014	Youthlinc is such a beautiful organization. I have now been on 2 Youthlinc trips and will be going on my 3rd as an Alum Leader to Thailand. Over the last three years, Youthlinc has changed the way that I look at this world. There is so much good to be done and whether at home or abroad, I know I can make a difference. My team leaders, the Youthlinc employee's, and most importantly my dear friends that I have made over the years through Youthlinc, have made this a lasting impact on my life that I will cherish forever. I love Youthlinc! 
Youthlinc	199311		/users/profile/260216	MonaMonaMona	Volunteer	5	04/30/2014	My daughter visited Thailand in 2010 after an extraordinary year of experience with local service.  That year, I had the pleasure of volunteering in the planning of the Annual Benefit.  It was a collaboration of effort and resources that resulted in a meaningful event for all those behind the scenes, as well as those in attendance.  My daughter is wrapping up her third year in college working on her degree of Community and International Development, and two minors that will work together in her charge for bringing about humanitarian change that matters.  Youthlinc played a pivotal role in carving out her path for the future.
Youthlinc	199129		/users/profile/259998	mverickson2014	Board Member	5	04/28/2014	I became a fan of Youthlinc about six or seven years ago - at the time one of our employees asked me to help sponsor his daughter on a humanitarian trip to Peru.  I agreed, not knowing much about Youthlinc at the time.  The young woman came into our firm after returning from her Peru experience and gave us a very in-depth report of what she had done and what her team had accomplished.  After seeing what the experience had done for her and the good they were able to accomplish, I became a strong advocate.  Since then I have sponsored a student every year, and finally had the opportunity to join a team to Guatemala 2 years ago.  What an incredible experience!  My oldest daughter and I were so grateful to be part of such a wonderful group of people.  We loved the experience and learned so much.  I think 2 things set Youthlinc apart from so many other groups:  1) The teams are formed in October and begin working together to prepare for their trip the following June/July.  You become attached to the team and establish strong bonds that continue for many years.  2)  The students are required to commit to giving 80 hours of local community service before going on the international experience.  This creates commitment and usually results in building a love of service - both locally and internationally.  This organization is top-notch with super-dedicated people who are so committed to Youthlinc's mission - to build lifetime humanitarians.
Youthlinc	199105		/users/profile/259969	bananaflour	Volunteer	5	04/28/2014	I first started with Youthlinc in 2008 and haven't looked back since.  I visited Kenya for both of my services trips where we did everything from water projects, to sewing, to micro-loans.  The impact and mission Youthlinc brings to these communities can't be matched.  The heart and development that go into the meetings and local service volunteering is what makes Youthlinc a special and unique program.  The volunteers have to prove that they are willing to help in their local community and put forth the efforts in do so before they are eligible to help make the difference abroad.  Youthlinc has shaped my future (literally) in a way I would have never thought possible.  My full time job, passion and dream were all sparked because of Youthlinc.  I am forever grateful and indebted to Youthlinc and the wonderful work they do.
Youthlinc	199100		/users/profile/259962	jerikameganmays	Board Member	5	04/28/2014	I was first introduced to Youthlinc while attending a Rotary youth leadership training in 2006. I was immediately interested. Thoughts of traveling overseas ran through my head. Later, as a participate on the Kenya team I quickly learned that Youthlinc is more than just a service trip per say. It is a leadership program that requires participants to complete 80 hours of service in their own community before they even step foot on an airplane. I learned how to prepare in-country projects, complete a fundraiser, and network with friends and businesses to gather donations. In short, I became a service leader as I gained the skills I needed to execute my own service incentives. For this, and so much more, I will always be indebted to Youthlinc. 
Youthlinc	199017		/users/profile/259856	jh4270	Board Member	5	04/26/2014	Youthlinc has made such a positive impact not only on my nuclear family, but my extended family, friends, and neighbors as well.  The mere fact of my daughter getting involved as a sophmore in high school has created a domino effect.  She learned how to serve our local community, setting an example for those around her who continue to serve in many different capacities.  Her involvement encouraged countless other high school students to get involved.  All of us have made life-long, like-minded friends through Youthlinc who have enriched our lives in a way nothing else could.  Youthlinc teaches its participants how to manage a project from beginning to end, how to work on a committee, and it provides leadership skills to the students.  It holds the participants responsible for certain goals they need to reach and offers incredible, supportive resources to help them meet those goals.  All the team-building components will stay with my daughter and undoubtedly the other particpants for a life time.
Youthlinc	199011		/users/profile/216506	MikeDraper	Volunteer	5	04/26/2014	I've worked with Youthlic in several capacities, and am very pleased with what Youthlinc offers. 1) As a parent of a Youthlinc participant (my daughter went to Kenya in June 2013), I feel grateful that she (a college freshman) was so touched that she changed her career path based on an amazing experience that she had with the team in Kenya. It is true that she had to work hard to raise the funds to go, but one of the goals of Youthlinc is to ingrain in these relatively young participants the motivation to "own it". As a parent, I couldn't ask for anything more than what I got. 2) As a mentor on the 2013 Kenya trip, I had a fabulous time, and experienced the team-building spirit as I've rarely felt it before. We all were asked to do things that got us out of our comfort zone (teaching preschool kids for me, building a vocational school, working in the sun, etc for others), all done in the spirit of service. Everyone I worked with served with a smile. 3) As a board member for the past several months, I've seen the inner workings of Youthlinc. I've heard all about budget, goals, programs, internal office personnel changes, etc, and I have never once heard any comments other then "how can we help these kids to be lifetime humanitarians?" I feel quite qualified to say that this program truly does put it's mission first: "Creating Lifetime Humanitarians".  I look forward to a long time of service with Youthlinc.
Youthlinc	163097		/users/profile/216506	MikeDraper	Volunteer	5	07/19/2013	I happened upon Youthlinc because my daughter was involved with the Kenya 2013 team and found out that they needed a mentor with my particular expertise for the trip. I was hesitant at first, but decided that no matter what it would be worth it to be able to hang out with my daughter for about 3 weeks. From the moment I signed up (and especially when I left SLC to go to Kenya), I was impressed with the organization.  My team leader (Scott) was fabulous, and never let a moment go by where he didn't have a constructive suggestion for how we should use our time to the max. He kept us moving when it might otherwise have been easy to waste time, and made it fun every minute of every day. Our team was superb, and we got along very well, even all cramped together on bunkbeds in a single 40-person dorm. The kids there were amazing, and our site was overseen by the incredible Father Franklin, who was always cognizant of the students under his care. 
Youthlinc	199000		/users/profile/259839	pbstringham	Board Member	5	04/26/2014	As a 5 year board member of Sustainable Cambodia (SC) I was asked by Judy Zone (Youthlinc's Director) 3 years ago to consider our Cambodia projects to be part of YL's international service locations.  SC is a very organized NGO with numerous projects ongoing. As a matter of policy SC stays away from youth groups because of the risk of dealing with youth wanting to travel for the primary sake of picture taking & sightseeing. Before making a commitment to YL I went to Asia to witness YL's organization firsthand.  I was completely impressed with YL's team leaders and especially the youth.  They worked extremely hard in a very uncomfortable sweaty environment.  YL has now been to SC's projects in Cambodia for two years with great success. SC will continue to work with YL and Judy Zone in the future.  Now as a  board member of YL & SC, I've been able to see the ongoing challenges of keeping an effective youth program moving, part of which is to be fiscally sound.  I commend all who support YL financially. Countless youth have been fortunate recipients of YL's vision.  Judy Zone has been willing to pop her head above the crowd, to raise needed money, not for the need of recognition but for the ultimate sake of developing youth.  Not an easy task!  The time and effort it takes to run YL is enormous.  Someone has to take the leadership and bear the risk.   Thank you Judy!     
Youthlinc	198835		/users/profile/259632	scottloves2golf	Donor	5	04/24/2014	I have been involved with youthlinc in many capacities.  As a volunteer fundraiser for the first few years and as donor and supporter for the past few years and I have nothing but good to say about this organization.  It is difficult to rely mainly on volunteers for your support as you run and maintain a wonderful program that benefits all involved.  I have seen lives changed by the programs Youthlinc provides.  When a youth comes home from a trip, their life is greatly impacted by the experience.  I wish every youth had the opportunity to experience what Youthlinc provides and I hope the program continues to grow so that more do have the opportunity to begin their path as humanitarians for life.  Teaching our children the importance of giving is almost more important than teaching them how to continually try to accumulate in this life.  Thank you Youthlinc for all the good you do in the world.
Youthlinc	195311	1	/users/profile/255306	Kenyaforever	Volunteer	1	03/06/2014	The original idea for Youthlinc was great, however, that has been lost either due to personal or financial pressures.  The organization spends more time drilling the volunteers to raise money and worry about their reputation (Executive Director) than treating the volunteers with respect and honoring their sincerity about helping make a better life for the underprivileged.  Many volunteers are communicating the same level of disappointment receiving threatening emails and verbal abuse mostly from the "Executive Director" or is it "Exclusive Director"?  It's an unacceptable way to run a volunteer "humanitarian organization". Sadly out of control, manic personality who is a grown up bully! 
Youthlinc	187511		/users/profile/244531	VsHalliday	Donor	5	11/01/2013	My husband and I have been involved with the Youthlinc organization since he and our oldest daughter participated in one of their service trips to Mexico in 2007. Since then we have sponsored many other students on their service trips and have sent both our daughters on a service trip to Thailand. I am greatly impressed with this organization and with it's focus on creating lifetime humanitarians by getting young people involved in giving service. In addition to the well organized and meaningful service projects that they do on the international level the participants are required to give local service in their own communities to earn their sponsorship for the international project they are participating in. I know with both of my daughters this service requirement resulted in them having to step out of their comfort zones and was a eye opening and life changing experience which made them realize how fortunate they are and helped them see the needs and the opportunities available around them every day. I have friends whose children have participated in international service projects with other groups and though these experiences were very meaningful they did not have the same impact on their children because the focus of the project participants was raising funds for the project rather than getting involved in giving service. I appreciate this major difference. For me it is far more important to teach my children to give service rather than to teach then how to raise money to donate for service. Though raising money is essential to fund service projects it is detached from the people who need our service and does not require us to give of our time and ourselves in the same way as giving actual service does. I love this organization and have nothing but praise for the impact it has on the lives of those who participate with it.
Youthlinc	186270		/users/profile/243266	M. Farmer	Donor	4	10/31/2013	I am a donor as well as a Youthlink parent.  Last year my teenager was in a group that went to Cambodia.  I was impressed with the Youthlink leaders and how they kept everyone involved, including parents in the planning and preparation for the trip.  The effort included local volunteer service, planning for the activities in Cambodia, as well as getting shots, packing and medical exams.  The leaders patiently  answered all questions and helped provide solutions for problems and concerns.  The result was a life changing experience for my teenager and others which reinforced the importance of service and provided confidence to do difficult things.  Thank you Youthlink.

My daughter who went to Guatemala this year was able to participate in service even before she left because of the service hours that are required before leaving on the humanitarian trip.  I thought this was a great way to get youth involved in their community and to educate them of the many service opportunities right in their own state.  The trip to Guatemala was the perfect way to reinforce what she had learned from serving in her community. She had a wonderful experience. Learning about different cultures and being a part of a group working to make a difference was a powerful tool in her growth toward becoming a life long humanitarian.  Thank you Youthlinc!
Youthlinc	181847		/users/profile/238598	jmoss	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	I volunteered with Youthlinc as a mentor for two years.  It was such an amazing experience that I would recommend it without hesitation.  The first time I went with my daughter and she had a wonderful experience as well.  The programs are well organized with meetings each month which helped us to get to know each other and be really  prepared to serve when we left the country.  Service is emphasized, not only abroad, but in our own communities as well.  Once we were in our chosen country, it was astounding how much we were able to accomplish to help the people. It was hard work, but very rewarding, and we were able to improve the lives of so many people.  I feel it also improved the lives of the youth that went and they had experiences that they will remember for the rest of their lives. I know for me it was also an unforgettable experience that I will always cherish.

Youthlinc	181075		/users/profile/237785	jessyjo	Volunteer	5	10/22/2013	YouthLinc has been in my life for the past 4 years.  I first heard about YouthLinc through my best friend who was going on a trip.  I watched her do service in the community, and she loved it.  When she finally went on her trip she came home and talked about it for weeks.  Hearing about how life changing her experience was i new that I wanted to be apart of it.  That following summer I was on the Peru 2011 service team.  Peru was the most humbling and amazing experience.  It showed that people who have close to nothing can give you more then you could ever give back to them.  When I returned I was so eager to go back that I went on the two following Friends & Family trips to Cambodia and Vietnam.  Which were just as amazing as my first trip.  YouthLinc is a great way to make new friends, and teaches you so many life lessons that you could not learn any other way.  I could not thank this organization enough.

As she became involved with Youthlinc, I also was drawn in to not only be a donor but to volunteer my services with the group. Youthlinc is an outstanding organization, combining the molding of young people into lifetime volunteers and providing much-needed help in countries around the globe.
Youthlinc	180564		/users/profile/237249	schlags	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	I went on a service trip with Youthlinc to Thailand, during the summer of 2012.  This was a life changing experience for me.  The importance of giving back and selflessness in this organization is unreal.   The whole year we had to prepare by giving back and doing service in our local community.  This gives a sense of how important local service is.  We had monthly meetings where we figured out what was going to be scheduled while we were at the school in Thailand.  I was apart of the Vocational committee and we focused on education for the students so they can start a career with a focus in tourism.  Our stay in Thailand was unforgettable.  The connections I made with the students of the elementary school we taught and worked at are long-lasting.  Although we couldn't communicate directly with them, they changed my life.   To see the struggles they persistently go through, but always have a smile on their face, taught me to be resilient and put my life in perspective.  This experience is life-changing and this organization creates a family of life-long volunteers.

Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	Two years ago I embarked on a journey with the humanitarian organization Youthlinc, which connects high school and college students to the world of service. I did a year of in-country service at an after school program for teen refugees and the summer after traveled to the Peruvian Amazon to work alongside villagers and other students to better the small community of Yanamono. Alongside the villagers we constructed concrete walk ways and bridges that could withstand the annual rising and flooding of the amazon that destroys their paths, painted the community center/school and constructed a restroom for the village center. Beside my fellow peers I organized and led English lessons for the children and cultural immersion projects for both villagers and volunteers. I translated soap making lessons for the women of the village and home visits with villagers to see what other needs we could help them with when the next Youthlinc group came to the village next year. I was truly inspired by these humble people and their dedication to their village and their desire to be a part of its improvement. More than anything, they helped me. Because of the empathy, compassion, productivity, change, and unfiltered love I was encompassed by, I told myself I would see the village again.That's how life changing the youthlinc experience is. In fact, I'll be participaating as an Alum Leader this year, so I can go back to Peru and work with this wonderful organization again.
Youthlinc	180222		/users/profile/236883	Mlmo	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	Youthlinc is a wonderful organization... one that really focuses on its mission of creating lifetime humanitarians.  As a parent of students who have been involved with Youthlinc for four years, I have seen the lasting impact of serving our local community as well as the international communities touched by Youthlinc teams.  My family has been blessed by the staff, team members, and people served by the Youthlinc organization.
Youthlinc	180218		/users/profile/236878	rinpoche	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	Youthlinc is a great nonprofit organization. I was involved as a service year volunteer and having the required service hours helped me get involved in my community as well as helped get me in the right mind set for our trip. It really helps create an attitude of a lifetime humanitarian. 
Youthlinc	180187		/users/profile/236848	Rachdans	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	I first heard about Youthlinc through a neighbor and friend. I decided that I wanted to have a unique experience and serve those around the world. Going to Cambodia was a life changing experience, one I will never forget. Words cannot express how grateful I am to Youthlinc for providing this opportunity for me. I formed friendships I will cherish through out my entire life. I went on a humanitarian trip to serve those in need, but they are the ones who changed me.
Youthlinc	180181		/users/profile/159746	Mia Felin	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	I loved being a part of Youthlinc!  I went on the service trip to Cambodia, and it truly changed my life.  Youthlinc's goal is to make lifetime humanitarians, and it has definitely succeeded in this goal, as so many of the people I volunteered with still volunteer to this day, and I strive to do the same.  Youthlinc is amazing in its complete selfless acts of service both locally and worldwide.  Without a doubt, Youthlinc gave me one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life, and helped me to learn that when I come together with people of a common purpose, I can make a difference.
Youthlinc	117496		/users/profile/159746	Mia Felin	Volunteer	5	07/01/2012	I loved my Youthlinc trip to Cambodia!  I had the best time and learned so much about how little acts of service can change lives.  I feel like I learned more from them than they learned from me.  In the village we served in we had the chance to build a preschool for the children.  The whole time we were doing this I had at least 2 kids by my side helping with as much work as they could.  I learned about hard work and kindness from these sweet people, and will never forget how happy they were for the circumstances they lived in.  We would be walking down the streets and see people in huts and doing hard manual labor, yet they would look at us and smile and wave.  A partner and I had to plan a lesson that we wanted to teach while in Cambodia, and we decided to teach how to brush teeth.  I felt like this made quite the difference.  When we handed out floss, not even the teacher knew what it was or how to use it, so we really taught them some useful skills, as did the rest of the group with their lessons.  I wouldn't change anything that took place during this trip, because I learned a great lesson even from the smallest acts of kindness or the big mistakes we made as a team.
Youthlinc	180166		/users/profile/12692	maggiecrockett	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	I went to Mexico with YouthLinc twice and found the experience to be truly life changing. I am now a committed volunteer and I believe that much of my commitment to volunteering is a direct result of my volunteer experience with this organization. I also believe that I became a better teacher because I had a better understanding of my students who were coming from regions in Mexico to my classroom. I hope that my children will be able to experience YouthLinc and learn the value of volunteering and giving back to your local community as well as internationally.
Youthlinc	10787	5	/users/profile/12692	maggiecrockett	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	My experiences with YouthLINC truly changed how I view children with disabilities, especially those coming into the US from other countries. My trips to Mexico also helped me become a better teacher and role model to my students. It also instilled in me a desire to continue serving people in my community as well as communities abroad. The emphasis on local as well as international service truly sets YouthLINC apart. I plan on being associated with this organization from now on.
Youthlinc	180135		/users/profile/236795	KFoust	Volunteer	4	10/20/2013	My Son went to Thailand with Youthlinc and gained such a love of service! This experience helped him grow and mature in ways that he couldn't have known otherwise. Youthlinc and their staff are so thorough and do such a wonderful job. I would highly recommend their programs to anyone seeking to better themselves.
Youthlinc	180122		/users/profile/236778	Brian Mercer	Volunteer	5	10/20/2013	My daughter went to Thailand with Youthlinc and she had a great experience. She worked hard to get some things built for the students at the school. She got to know the students and was very sad when they had to leave. She enjoyed working with the other volunteers and had many great experiences.
Youthlinc	179231		/users/profile/235873	melissa melendez	Volunteer	5	10/18/2013	I went to Peru during the summer and it was one of the best experiences in my life. Getting to help and meet all the people of Yanamono ll was amazing. I can genuinely say that village will always have a special place in my heart. Getting to know some of the villagers stories was so interesting and playing with the kids everyday was just so much fun. Everyone was so welcoming and nice, it felt good:)
Youthlinc	179200		/users/profile/235840	Jazlyn M.	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I had an awe inspiring experience with Youthlinc this past year. Youthlinc is a great organization which encourages teens to become life long humanitarians by encouraging them to serve in their community for eighty or more hours. I was able to get over one hundred hours worth of service because of Youthlinc. They encouraged me to do what I can in the area I live in. As a reward for having done so many hours of service in our communities, teens are able to travel to a foreign country to make a positive influence.I traveled with our Cambodia trip and the best part of the whole trip were the people. You get to see those you are helping out with and know you are making a difference. It is really cool to be able to say I did service with a humanitarian group to a foreign country, but in reality, Youthlinc has helped me become more aware of the needs that aren't being met in my community. The mentors and youth leaders that go on this trip are wonderful to work with. Youthlinc has made a humanitarian out of me.
Youthlinc	178987		/users/profile/235617	J. Nelson	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	My son went to Vietnam with Youthlinc last summer and had an experience of a lifetime. He really enjoyed every aspect of his Youthlinc involvement, from the 80 hours of required volunteer time working with refugee teens prior to the actual trip, to serving on committees to plan lessons for the actual trip to Vietnam. And of course, the Youthlinc service trip was "the best vacation" he has ever had. He loved the Vietnamese people and the team he was with.  As a parent, I was impressed by how organized Youthlinc is, and appreciate how much work they put into making it the best experience possible. Everything is well thought out, always putting the student and safety first. 
Youthlinc	178800		/users/profile/215527	Katy12	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I did Youthlinc last summer of 2013 and I absolutely LOVED IT! I went to Guatemala and we made bunk beds for the boys' dorms, we painted the boys' dorms, we made book shelves for the library, eco-benches for the soccer field, made macro-tunnels for the agricultural class so that they could make their own food, and painted a mural for all the people there. I met lots of great people that truly changed my life, some of which I am Facebook friends with! This organization is just amazing and I don't know what where I would be at this moment if had not gone. Youthlinc is incredible and if I was rich I would just do it every year! Youthlinc has changed my life and I don't regret anything about it!
Youthlinc	162382		/users/profile/215527	Katy12	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	Youthlinc is an amazing program that really brings youth together to make a difference in the world. The way that I found out about it was from one of my friends who had went to Kenya last year and posted lots of her pictures on Facebook. I immediately was amazed at how involved she got in the program and I wanted to see what it was about too! So I looked it up, applied and got accepted! This program taught me how to become a true humanitarian. When I went to Guatemala, I learned that everyone is human and that you can't judge a book by its cover. Guatemalans are like my friends and I love them so very much. They aren't just a lost cause, but people who are content with their life. I also learned to not judge my teammates as well, because honestly they are the best people that I have ever met in my life! I love Youthlinc! The two weeks in Guatemala and the preparation before, is just so great and connecting that it really made my experience in Guatemala that much amazing! I thank this program for all it has done to enhance my life! 
Youthlinc	178038		/users/profile/234657	jlwoolley	Donor	3	10/16/2013	Youthlinc was a door of opportunity and understanding for our daughter.  The experiences she had in Kenya were eye-opening as she served with Youthlinc in a Third World situation. The love she acquired for the people and the enthusiasm she returned with were priceless. I would recommend this organization to anyone wanting a life-changing opportunity for their youth.
Youthlinc	177945		/users/profile/234546	Lynette Duenas	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	Youthlinc is a non-profit organization, which is great because when i went on my trip we had to fund raise all the money that we wanted to spend or give to the villagers. This way we know that every cent is going to the people who you are going to serve. This program has changed my perspective on life and i have realized the most important things in life. I came to a conclusion that i want to serve people the rest of my life and because its one of the best things i know how to do. Where much is given, much is expected and i know that this is a fact and makes me work even harder in my life so that i can give back! this is a great program and i would recommend this to anyone.
Youthlinc	177701		/users/profile/234283	Julia Houser	Board Member	5	10/15/2013	My 15-year old daughter introduced me to Youthlinc.  She had a friend who had gone through the program, which encouraged Katie to do it.  She applied, was accepted, and began her journey.  The international trip to perform community service in Kenya at the end of the local community service commitment was initially the carrot, but it was the work through the local community service that impacted her the most. While she had always enjoyed coummunity service, this took her to another level.  She volunteered with cancer patients and a grief counseling center for youth.  She saw what an impact her services made with these two organizations; it made her understand that simply keeping someone company through a difficult time was powerful.   When she returned from Kenya, she related her stories of the children who their most prized possessions were their bar of soap or their blanket.  It has forever changed the way she looks at material possessions.  She has moral struggles every time she admires a piece of clothing she'd like buy but is what she considers expensive.  Even though she can afford it, she will rarely buy something she considers a frivolity.   More importantly, she convinced her dad to do a similar trip.  Never a community-minded person, the trip changed his life and he now understands why community service, even if it's just a financial donation, is so critical to those in need.   Youthlinc has made an amazing, positive impact on our family one family member by one family member.  And our strory is like many others.  
Youthlinc	177658		/users/profile/234227	ajp07	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	I was a student volunteer for Youthlinc, in which I participant in the Guatemala 2013 team in the medical group.  This trip allowed me to put my education to work.  I first found out what the village and school felt was an educational need, which was reproductive health.  I then discussed with others, culture barriers that I should be aware of such as condoms.  It was then suggested to research a more natural means of birth control, known as cycle beads.  Through research and some creativity, I created my own version of cycle beads.  Then in Guatemala I presented my lesson to the 7th-9th graders, as well as a group of women from a nearby village.  Feedback on the project was very positive and the women were fascinated to learn about their own bodies.  After the lessons and projects were completed, it touched my heart to see so many of the girls still wearing their bracelets days later.  I felt empowered while on the Youthlinc trip to Guatemala in teaching my lessons, as well as being an example and a leader to the other students that were much younger.  
Youthlinc	177532		/users/profile/234096	Valjay	Board Member	5	10/14/2013	The years I have spent involved with Youthlinc have be a highlight in my life.  my wife and I have traveled to Kenya, Peru, and Cambodia and seen the impact on the lives of hundreds of young humanitarians as well as on the villages they served in. 
Youthlinc	177513		/users/profile/216123	slickrock	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I absolutely loved my youthlinc experience! I would do this over again in a heartbeat. I love the environment created by the youthlinc group and not just in country. Before we even left for our two week excursion to Peru I had already fallen in love with Youthlinc. It is a great way to learn how to really incorporate service into your life, and not just when you are in another country. I felt completely safe the entire time and would recommend this to everyone and anyone!
Youthlinc	162819		/users/profile/216123	slickrock	Volunteer	5	07/17/2013	I stumbled upon the Youthlinc program and I'm pretty sure it was fate! I absolutely LOVED LOVED it! I went to Peru for just over two weeks and fell in love with everything about it! I The Youthlinc program provides an experience that you can't have anywhere else. You work hands on with the locals in all sorts of projects and you actually make a difference in their life and yours. I love how Youthlinc incorporates service at a local level as well. I had an amazing experience in Peru, but I also had an amazing experience here in Utah. I worked with and met amazing people and still volunteer because I want to. The Youthlinc organization has helped me realize the true value of service and what it really means to serve. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone!
Youthlinc	177433		/users/profile/233987	Kelsey O	Volunteer	4	10/14/2013	Youthlinc is an extraordinary way to engage the youth of Salt Lake in volunteering in your community and internationally. The preparation you go through before your international service takes up time and thought, but also builds strength, confidence, and passion for helping others. I have become exposed to so many great service and learning opportunities because of Youthlinc, and I've had the chance to meet so many new people in my community, and also in my international service site. Sign up for Youthlinc if you want to become engaged in service in your community and around the world!! 
Youthlinc	177432		/users/profile/233986	JHymas	Donor	5	10/14/2013	My son travelled to Kenya this past summer with Youthlinc.  It was such a great experience.  He was able to experience many things he has been sheltered from most of his life.  As a parent, of course I was a bit nervous at first, but the Youthlinc staff, mentors and volunteers were extremely prepared and experienced which gave me so much comfort.  One of the other really great benefits of this program was the required local service hours he was required to complete prior to leaving for his service trip.  We will be sending our teenage daughter next summer, hopefully to her first choice, Thailand!
Youthlinc	177427		/users/profile/233979	TanjaDA	General Member of the Public	5	10/14/2013	My 17-year-old son is a great kid, but has been fortunate enough to have been raised in a safe, sheltered community.  I wanted him to be able to gain some perspective about our world and the vast number of people who live in dire poverty.  So after hearing a rave review from an acquaintance about Youthlinc, I encouraged him to sign up.  At first, he didn't believe that it was possible to travel to a foreign country.  It took some persuasion and a little bit of pressure to get him to actually apply to the program.  But he did and was accepted.   The next nine months were filled with service at a care center, Youthlinc meetings and fundraising.  It was great to have him complete 80 hours of service so that he felt like he "earned" the trip.  And fundraising was another experience that changed his perspective, because he realized how generous people can be.  Finally, all of the preparations were made and Spencer was at the airport going to Peru.  Something he hadn't thought possible was about to take place!   The service experience in Peru was priceless.  Our son enjoyed connecting with the people.  He grew close to most of the kids in the small village and played soccer with them daily.  Upon returning home, he said, "Compared to these people, I have everything, so I want to do everything I can to help and serve them."  He and the other 30 people from Youthlinc were in tears when they left the village after their two weeks of service.  It was definitely a life-changing experience for him.  I can't think of a better way to help him shift his paradigm and perspective about world poverty.   Thank you, Youthlinc, for providing this amazing opportunity!
Youthlinc	177406		/users/profile/233959	jill.austin28	Donor	5	10/14/2013	My daughter had an amazing experience with this organization.  The life lessons she learned and opportunity to participate with the humanitarian efforts, will impact her throughout her life. 
Youthlinc	177376		/users/profile/233927	Mhymas	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	Youthlinc was such an incredible experience for me. I was a participant in the humanitarian group that went to Kenya. And It changed my life in more than one way. Youthlinc encourages groups of all different ages to serve not only globally, but also in their own community. If anyone asks me about my trip I show them our team video and always recommend applying to the program!
Youthlinc	177368		/users/profile/233919	bethanyhurst	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	I was a participant in a humanitarian trip to Peru with YouthLinc during the summer right after I graduated from high school. YouthLinc made sure all the participants were committed to serving their community by only letting those who completed all their community service hours come on the trip, so during my senior year instead of only being caught up in all the fun (but selfish) things a normal senior in high school would get caught up in, I was able to realize all the different places right around my home that needed volunteer work and to learn what real happiness was as I was serving and making a difference in my community.  After spending an entire school year doing service in my community, I spent 2 weeks in Peru the following summer. I was introduced first hand to true poverty and saw that the people there were happier and more grateful than most of the people I knew back home. I saw the difference we were able to make to them and decided right then, as an 18 year old, that I would try to serve people my whole life and also try to show my gratitude for the things I am blessed with.
Youthlinc	177345		/users/profile/233896	Harry N.	Client Served	5	10/14/2013	Our Son introduced us to Youthlinc last year and was with the group that served the people of Vietnam this past summer. I have never seen a better organized and managed group that truly walks it's talk that of building lifetime humanitarians, our son hopes to go again this next year.
Youthlinc	177317		/users/profile/217499	millieolsen	Volunteer	5	10/14/2013	Youthlinc was an amazing experience for me and taught me so much about service. The service year program made me realize how important service is in our community and abroad. I am always looking for ways to serve now because I know the wonderful feeling it brings. 
Youthlinc	163780		/users/profile/217499	millieolsen	Volunteer	5	07/29/2013	Youthlinc is such a great organization for youth. What I really liked about it was that I was required to do so many service hours leading up to my trip which really taught me how important service is in my life. My leaders and mentors were so wonderful. They were always prepared and made a strong effort to get to know each team member individually. 
Youthlinc	177305		/users/profile/233838	Betty24	General Member of the Public	3	10/13/2013	Youthlinc is a great non-profit organization that builds young humanitarians.  The program is great in teaching youth to serve their community and their country.  I witnessed a 16 year old go out in the community to solicit help with gaining funds to go to Africa for 17 days doing humanitarian service.  She first served her community by volunteering at a local respite nursery for children.  She grew to love serving her community and felt she was able to make a difference.  She went to make a difference in Africa but Africa made a difference in her.
Youthlinc	177302		/users/profile/233835	MabeyTwin	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	Youthlinc has helped me to be motivated to go out and look for service opportunities in my own community. Through all the hard work that was required of me in order to go on my service trip to Cambodia, I got to meet a variety of new people and I got to learn about each of them as I served them. The trip itself was amazing! I met people with different background and I learned to love them despite the slight barrier between our languages. I have been able to be a part of changing someone's life for the better, and working with others who have the same goal and expectations made it all the more enjoyable.
Youthlinc	177298		/users/profile/233831	emilyk16	Volunteer	4	10/13/2013	I loved my experience with Youthlinc, whenever someone asks me about my trip, I automatically pull out my phone and show them all the pictures I took while serving with my team members. Team leaders do an amazing job to prepare everyone mentally and physically and the opportunity to go on these trips is once in a lifetime.
Youthlinc	177296		/users/profile/233827	action32	Donor	5	10/13/2013	Youthlinc provided an excellent opportunity for my daughter to provide service in Guatemala - it was an amazing program with a lot of volunteer work and just plain helping other people both at home and abroad - they were well organized and I was very impressed.
Youthlinc	177291		/users/profile/233821	Justin21	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	Youthlinc is a fantastic, socially responsible organization with deep local service commitments and sustainable international projects. As a critical consumer of humanitarian work, I have found Youthlinc's mission and support if the upcoming generation effective and the projects they do abroad planned with the long-term development of developing villages in mind. Their local and international partnerships have built bridges among diverse people and has helped hundreds of people in Utah and abroad benefit and have meaningful exchange. 
Youthlinc	177285		/users/profile/233817	annettemabey	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	I have had four daughters that have participated in local and international service with Youthlinc  Youthlinc is an organization that helps to develop a love for life-long service by motivating kids to spend a year serving in their community with a culminating foreign service opportunity.  Each one of my daughters learned to love serving because of the commitment that they each made to do local service .  They learned to love those that they were serving because they spent "time" with them...over 40 hours in one location, along with other opportunities for a total of over 80 hours local service.  Each one of my daughters were able to visit an international service site.  They saw marvelous sites, and learned about other cultures.  But regardless of the location, Peru, Thailand, or Cambodia, all my girls agree that the best part of their trips was getting to know the people, specifically the children.    Many youth and adults have benefited from association with this great organization.  
Youthlinc	177279		/users/profile/233814	crumpbunch	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	Youthlinc has been a fantastic program for our daughter.  She spent time in Cambodia serving the people.  She grew to love them in such a short amount of time.  They became a permanent part of her life.  Youthlinc really does focus on creating lifelong humanitarians.  The focus on local service prior to the actual trip, along with fundraising, helps the volunteers see that there are ways of serving right here in our own community.  The program has been incredible and I would recommend it to anyone interested is reaching out to serve others.
Youthlinc	177272		/users/profile/216017	Alexis W	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	Youthlinc has an amazing program. I loved that they focused on service in your own neighborhood first and then in a less developed country. I loved my experience with Youthlinc. I was able to go Cambodia and I met amazing people who I will never forget both the Cambodians and my team. I loved every second of my trip and would do anything to go back there again.
Youthlinc	162747		/users/profile/216017	Alexis W	Volunteer	5	07/16/2013	Youthlinc was an amazing program. The local service hours that I had to do really made me understand what I was going to Cambodia for. I learned a deeper love for service, made friends across the world, made memories that I will always cherish, and had an experience I wouldn't trade for the world. 
Youthlinc	177271		/users/profile/233805	haubera	General Member of the Public	5	10/13/2013	My daughter grew so much during her time with Yoithlinc.  This organizations conducts service trips to help children and schools in developing countries.  Her trip was to Guatemala.   Her service there and her experience there were wonderful, but she grew the most in performing local service by herself and with her team in her own community.
Youthlinc	177266		/users/profile/233800	brighton.rich	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	I have been on several trips with YouthLinc.  Each trip has been rewarding.  I think the best think about the trip is that our students realize how much they have and how little other people have and they are usually hapier than we are.  YouthLinc has helped many poeple in both overseas and abroad.  It has personally given me the chance to develope many relationships and a great feeling of self help
Youthlinc	177259		/users/profile/233794	gaspari	Volunteer	4	10/13/2013	Youthlinc is an amazing organization dedicated to humanitarian efforts.  I was part of a trip last summer as a mentor and was amazed at the students' dedication, motivation and work ethic.  Youthlinc encouraged them to work hard and become selfless individuals.  I would highly recommend this organization to any student or adult interested in being more involved in their own community and those around the world.
Youthlinc	177255		/users/profile/11278	froglips645	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	Youthlinc is a local non-profit organization with the goal of creating life-time humanitarians. Participants accepted embark upon a year of intense and meaningful service experiences. Students spend a school year volunteering locally and attending monthly meetings where they take on a leadership role on a committee of their choice and are overseen by a mentor with expertise. Students and mentors work together to plan and prepare projects in the areas of: English education, health education, construction, micro enterprise, vocational training, and cultural exchange. During the summer, they then spend two weeks abroad volunteering in a village in great need. The experiences there are nothing short of life changing as students work along side some of the most impoverished, yet happy, individuals.

I learned not only the joy of humanitarian work and the great things I can learn from serving internationally in third-world countries, but also the importance and lasting satisfaction that comes from being involved locally, making a difference within your sphere of influence.  I have always had the desire to be a lifetime humanitarian, but Youthlinc empowered me to take the first meaningful steps in that journey.  Youthlinc's influence internationally is a great model that leads to education and changes that sustain themselves.  It is changing the lives of those the Youthlinc volunteers serve as well as the lives of the volunteers themselves.
Youthlinc	177249		/users/profile/215565	Alex20	Volunteer	4	10/13/2013	Youthlinc provided me with the opportunity to work with a variety of different people from different political and religious backgrounds to fulfill a common goal. Youthlinc helped me to better come to know that i am not only a citizen of the U.S., but of the world and that I need to be as engaged in service in  my own community as I am with national and international opportunities.
Youthlinc	162407		/users/profile/215565	Alex20	Volunteer	4	07/11/2013	Youthlinc is a wonderful organization that really helps students get involved in local and international service.  It requires leadership and responsibility out of participants and it pushes individuals to get out of their comfort zone and get to know new people and new cultures.  I would recommend this organization to anybody who is looking to get involved in their local and international communities.
Youthlinc	166583		/users/profile/221309	Owilliamson	Volunteer	5	08/30/2013	I volunteered with YouthLinc several years ago as a high school student. After many hours volunteering locally at a Boys and Girls Club in Salt Lake, I was sponsored to travel abroad to do humanitarian work in Mexico. The experience both satiated and fed my desire to offer something of myself to my community and to the world. It taught me that I had a lot to offer - time and talents - not only in the global community but also in my own backyard. YouthLinc establishes in young people a spirit of service and mentors that spirit into a lifelong passion. My experience is something I will always hold dear and that I recommend for all, both volunteers and mentors. 
Youthlinc	166518		/users/profile/221215	Maegan M.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2013	Out of all the missions abroad out there youthlinc has the best model for sustaining quality of life where ever they set foot. They build the foundations for our generations future and the next by promoting service within the community at home as well as once abroad. Ever young adult and old should experience the humility and sense of togetherness you get from participating in a youthlinc trip.
Youthlinc	166509		/users/profile/221204	ShaunaMcM	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2013	I have had 3 of my daughters go on Youthlinc trips to Cambodia and Kenya over the last two years.  The change that has taken place in their lives is priceless.  I love the fact that Youthlinc is really big on local service.  It seems that some people just want to do the International humanitarian service because it sounds cool, but the more important part is serving locally.  I love that my girls have become so aware of the local service opportunities because of YouthLinc.  They will be forever lifetime humanitarians because of YouthLinc.  Thank you so much for that.
Youthlinc	166234		/users/profile/220823	Scoma	Volunteer	5	08/27/2013	Youthlinc has made all the difference in my life. The people and experiences I've had while participating with Youthlinc have made a huge impact on me, our community and the community we helped. Through local and international service this organization truly does create lifetime humanitarians. I'm so grateful to be a part of it!
Youthlinc	165209		/users/profile/219609	Sarah129	Volunteer	5	08/16/2013	I had a wonderful experience with youthlinc this past year. I love how the organization doesn't just focus on the international trip. To go on a youthlinc trip as a student you have to do hours of community service. This helped you realize that service can be done right at home. The International trip was amazing. I cherished every second I was there. I went to Cambodia and fell in love with the people. I would go back in a heartbeat. I would love to work with youthlinc again. It changed my life and helped me realize that anything can be done with hard work. I love youthlinc! 
Youthlinc	164924		/users/profile/219227	Polin Phang	Volunteer	5	08/14/2013	It's all my pleasure to work with the Youthlinc team to make a difference in the life of the children and the families in my rural community of Pursat, especially for the Cambodias children.  I am so lucky to know YOU and to work with YOU to achieve the goal of our project. The villagers and students still keep on saying Thank you, thank you! for everything YOU have done together for our community. We will never ever forget the great support you have done for our community.
Youthlinc	164614		/users/profile/218789	Dylan Drescher	Volunteer	5	08/10/2013	Over the course of our two weeks with the Moken people of Thailand, Youthlinc demonstrated to the absolute fullest extent the incredible impact that humanitarian work delivers. Seeing an entire community of people so appreciative and receptive to the work we were doing only solidified my drive to come back to the island every day and work even harder than the day before. I developed a lot of close relationships with members of my team and we all share a special bond now, one that you couldn't have acquired any other way. Our team leaders Carson and Bobby were amazing leaders as well as some of the most funny, charismatic adults I've ever met. To anyone reading this, five stars doesn't even begin to represent how amazing of an organization Youthlinc is.
Youthlinc	164607		/users/profile/218779	Carolyn51	Volunteer	5	08/10/2013	Kenya 2013 with Youthlinc was truly beyond describing with words.  The feelings and emotions I feel/felt before, during and after the experience are ones of deepened appreciation for the simple things I often overlook in my life. Simple pleasures. The "family" I gained both in Kenya and with Youthlinc have all made me a more compassionate ... stronger person.  Youthlinc as the organization that facilitated this experience/opportunity did not miss one detail. They truly know and care about the communities they are serving. 
Youthlinc	164431		/users/profile/218518	Sarah Petersen	Volunteer	5	08/08/2013	I don't really have any other words to describe my experience the past year through the Youthlinc program besides completely life changing. Every aspect of what Youthlinc is about has turned my life into exactly what I have always wanted it to be. Fortunately, you are required to not only prepare to go internationally to serve, but service hours locally are required for your acceptance to go. My service hours started out as me finding the easiest place to get my hours done and ended in me loving the individuals there. I decided to spend forty of my eighty service hours at an assisted living a block from my house. I went there to go help them, and they ended helping me. Such a peaceful and loving place, turned into my sanctuary to get away from life. The wise elderly people there opened my heart and mind and I fell to love each and every one of them. I was actually just blessed a week ago with no longer just being able to volunteer there, but work as a CNA. I am literally getting paid to help those I deeply care about all because Youthlinc pushed me to serve locally each week. That's just in country, in addition to the meetings every month where our team leaders left it all up to us to get everything together. The program isn't just about shaping a new life for those that we are trying to help, but shaping our lives also. As a team, we were in charge of collecting donations, planning lessons, starting fundraisers, and much more on top of getting ourselves individually ready. We had no other choice but to gain responsibility and learn that we can each achieve so much more than we ever thought before. As you can tell, my life already began to change before I even step foot in to the Salt Lake City Airport, but I can admit I never thought how much my perspective on life would change after my experience in Thailand.. I can't put words to my emotions the second I stepped on to Koh Loa Island. It went from excitement to grief and pain for the people there but quickly changed as soon as I met the people. People that live in the worst conditions you could ever think of, but the kids walked every where with a smile, would never let you go as soon as you picked them up, and tell us to come back each day we left. You don't understand poverty and pain until you have seen what people throughout the world live in. People that did not choose their life, but were born in to it. People that had no knowledge of what the world could offer and how far you could go and how much you could do up until the past couple years. You can't even comprehend the feelings of humility until you have worked by side the people that have come to accept that their living situation is okay, even though it is far from it. I thought I had an understanding of how this world worked, I thought I understood that people had it hard and that I have it good, but I had no idea up until this trip, this experience, this eye opener. I had the blessing to live out of a suitcase and realize even that suitcase was still more than what most kids have there. I was pushed to change my passion in life from maybe not making a world change but changing someone's life, anyone's life. I learned that although I may not be able to change the world, I can change someone's world. I have never felt so blessed, privileged, thankful, gracious, or loved than I ever did on this trip. I fell in love with complete strangers seconds I stepped on to that island and left a piece of me there my final time I left. I don't know any other way to put words to my experience because some of it is just to close to my heart to even try to. I'm blessed for being able to go on this experience and it's all because of Youthlinc. I see this program as a lifesaver for kids and the people involved to be angels to give such privileged kids already, the experience to go on such a life changing trip. I love Youthlinc. I love Thailand. I love the Moken people, but mostly I love what I learned.
Youthlinc	164413		/users/profile/218492	Catherine Burns	Volunteer	5	08/07/2013	Because of Youthlinc I had the experience of a lifetime and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world! I was so humbled and I learned so much from serving the Moken people. I will always remember the amazing impact that their sweet smiles had. Not only that, but we had amazing leaders and an amazing team who made it an unforgettable trip! 
Youthlinc	164339		/users/profile/218400	Cricky007	Volunteer	5	08/07/2013	Youthlinc surprised me by being such a well organized and well thought out organization. They gave me the opportunity of a lifetime to make meaningful connections by serving others. I cannot recommend Youthlinc enough to others. It was moving to see the large impact our work had on the lives of others and how it will continue to do so even when we have left our international service site. 
Youthlinc	164314		/users/profile/218360	Alec B.	Volunteer	5	08/06/2013	This organization is one that truly cares. Youthlinc does so much to immensely help the people in which need them most. Their organization is impressive, and the staff even more so. I went to Thailand for the 2013 Moken service trip, and I could not be more impressed with our group leaders,  Carson and Bobby, as well as every mentor with us. Through any problem they were right there, and laughing, and everything could not have gone better. We worked hard, and we loved every second of it, because we had a chance to help these people who so fervently appreciated it. I love Youthlinc, and I encourage anyone who reads this to support them, and participate in any way possible.
Youthlinc	164020		/users/profile/217884	MaAnderson	Volunteer	5	08/01/2013	Youthlinc changed my life! This program gave me the opportunity to find myself through serving others; locally and internationally.  I have memories that I will remember for the rest of my life. They are teaching people like me what true happiness feels like. Youthlinc is changing the world! Thank you for letting us help! 
Youthlinc	163930		/users/profile/217752	carmendurfey	Volunteer	5	07/30/2013	My oldest son participated in Youthlinc 10 years ago. Ever since then his youngest sister has wanted to participate. She got the chance this last service year and loved everything about it.She still volenteers at the hospital  where she did some of her local service hours. She plans on applying to be an alumni leader for next year.It was by far the best experience of her young life.The team leader was incredible, the other menttors were awsome and the service in Guatamala was perfect for her.  She loves the people she met and the one ones she served with and has opened her eyes to a world of service she did not know exhisted. The program just gets better and better over the years and more organized and effcient too.  I hope to be a mentor with them some day  and really give back like my children. 
Youthlinc	163882		/users/profile/217678	Karen182	General Member of the Public	5	07/30/2013	YouthLinc is a youth organization that changes the lives of the youth and mentors who serve as well as those they  serve both locally and internationally. The local service our daughter did to those in need are experiences that will drive her passions for the rest of her life. Thank you YouthLinc for your well thought out organization!
Youthlinc	163747		/users/profile/162675	Jessica57	Volunteer	5	07/28/2013	Youthlinc is by far the most amazing nonprofit organization! They serve both locally and internationally. I've been involved with Youthlinc for two years, Peru in 2012 and Vietnam in 2013. It's a program that loves and supports every single person. Experiencing Youthlinc is such a life-changing program; as we are making a difference in peoples lives, they are changing ours in return. I'll never forget my experiences with Youthlinc and will be thrilled to have further opportunities with them. 
Youthlinc	119659		/users/profile/162675	Jessica57	Volunteer	5	07/31/2012	This is the most amazing program I have been with before. I really love the requirements they have and expectations. I know that I will volunteer much more after serving abroad. The experience was great and Youthlinc overall did an excellent job. I hope to serve more abroad with this program and I truly believe me made a difference. 
Youthlinc	163160		/users/profile/216596	Jordan19	Volunteer	5	07/20/2013	I couldn't be more proud to be a part of such a wonderful and effective organization. YouthLinc has a goal to create Lifetime Humanitarians and I can say they created one in me. My international trip with this group to Kajuki, Kenya, Changed and saved my life."When we serve, we see the unborn wholeness in others; we collaborate with it and strengthen it. Others may then be able to see their wholeness for themselves for the first time."Through the help and many opportunities to serve that YouthLinc has provided, I found the wholeness in me and the potential I have to do good. They have given me a fresh start and a second chance to become the best version of myself. When working in Kenya i had never felt like I had belonged anywhere more. The blessings of living with those people are more than I could ever do for them in return, but I will exhaust my efforts trying to repay them as much as possible for what they did for me. YouthLinc provides a lot of opportunity to raise funds and supplies to each of the international sites. These people deserve anyone willing to help and anything we can provide. They are ready and willing to work together for change and just need the extra help to make it all happen. YouthLinc is making a difference. They're intentions are not to go and put a band-aid over a massive wound but they are there to change a situation; find a solution; and teach the communities to work together and become self-efficient and sustaining. They have long term goals, plans and actions. and I am glad I had the opportunity to be a part of those. 
Youthlinc	163153		/users/profile/216590	erinhogle	Volunteer	5	07/20/2013	My experience with the Youthlinc organization started about 2 1/2 years ago.  My daughter approached us about a service trip to Kenya.  With much hesitation we allowed her to go.  Her experience in Kenya was life changing and she was hooked on service.  About nine months ago she convinced me to go with her on the very first Youthlinc Vietnam trip.  After much planning and preparing with left for Vietnam at the end of June.  We spent a little over two weeks in country and were able to serve the amazing people of a small farming village.  Youthlinc had everything amazingly well organized which is a pretty big deal when you are moving 40 people around.  Our leader Justin, was amazing.  He made the experience so full and rich and we were all in awe of his ability to remain calm and focused under some pretty tough circumstances.  As one of the adults on the trip, it was so fun for me to be involved with so many amazing young people.  I really do think Youthlinc accomplishes their goal of creating "life long humanitarians."  Youthlinc has impacted so many lives around the world and I am happy to be part of this wonderful organization.
Youthlinc	163139		/users/profile/216573	Avenlea	Volunteer	5	07/20/2013	I was involved with the Friends and Family Vietnam Team this year and It was an incredible experience. I went to Kenya last year in 2012 and I couldn't help but continue to be involved with this organization again this year.  It was really exciting how different both trips were but how they each have changed my life so much.  This year the Vietnam team opened the sight in Song Cau. To watch how Youthlinc could go to a village, not know the language or a single person and start to develop a beautiful relationship was incredible. I had always been so nervous to go to a country where I didn't know the language because I was worried I would not be able to communicate with the people and I wouldn't have a good time. But I have learned through this trip that you don't have to speak the same language as someone to become best friends with them. I created many beautiful relationships with the people of Song Cau and became lifelong friends with our wonderful translators that made our trip possible.  I love Youthlinc and I want to continue to involve myself with the organization. Through Youthlinc I have made lifelong friends with the 2012 Kenya Team and the 2013 Vietnam Team. I consider myself very lucky to have had both of the opportunities to be involved and am excited to continue to be involved. Youthlinc changes life's. It truly does create lifetime humanitarians who want to continue with humanitarian efforts locally and abroad. Youthlinc has a way of developing and kindling relationships with students and in result, students fall in love with the organization and fall in love with service and want to continue to serve for the rest of their life. 
Youthlinc	163073		/users/profile/216480	AngWood	Volunteer	5	07/19/2013	My experience in Cambodia was one I will never forget!  The moment we steped off the airplane I immediately feel in love with the people and culture.  We were welcomed with open hearts and hands.  It was an amazing opportunity to work side by side with students, teachers, and survivors.  I learned so much from their examples and stories that my life will never be the same.  I made incredible friendships that will last forever.  I am extermely grateful I had this wonderful opportunity to serve not only internationally but also in my community.  My life has been changed from this experience and I cannot wait to go on another trip soon!
Youthlinc	162915		/users/profile/216258	karlywithak	Volunteer	5	07/18/2013	This experience is definitely one I wish to repeat. There was a great bond formed with the team by gathering in one purpose, to better the lives of people we didn't know we cared about until we met them.
Youthlinc	162911		/users/profile/216252	nicolehales	Volunteer	5	07/18/2013	My experience in Cambodia was so amazing! I first got excited when we had our first meeting and learned a little about Cambodia. I loved how the Youthlinc group had meetings every month to help me feel more prepared as we got ready to go to Cambodia. When we got there we were told that there were probably going to be many changes to our plans and we needed to be flexible. I feel that the Youthlinc group did a good job of preparing us for allowing us to leave a great mark on the people of Cambodia. I am so glad that I traveled with the youthlinc team, I am so lucky to meet everyone I met on my team as well as the Cambodians. I made great friendships I will cherish for the rest of my life.
Youthlinc	162908		/users/profile/216245	Hailey Liljenquist	Volunteer	5	07/17/2013	In our Cambodia team we split up into different committees-I worked on the micro-enterprise team. We planned all year for our candle making project in-country. When we got to Pursat, we taught the students about marketing strategies and the 4 P's. We had the students come up with a logo, and design their candle and promotion poster. On the last day each group presented their product to the rest of the Youthlinc team. Each team did so well and they really understood the meanings of the lessons we taught them. I got so close to my group, and the rest of the students. I'm so proud of everything they accomplished and I hope that they use this experience throughout their life. 
Youthlinc	162896		/users/profile/216222	mmvietnam	Volunteer	5	07/17/2013	My volunteer experience with Youthlinc in Vietnam this year was nothing short of amazing!  Vietnam is a beautiful country with the most hardworking and loving people you will ever meet.  I had the privilege to work closely with a group of women in Song Cao who were ready and willing to learn how to sew.  Even with 4 sewing machines which continued to break down and cramped quarters, 15 women and counting eagerly showed up each morning and afternoon.  I loved watching them teach each other what they'd learned and help one another with the machines.  We ran into road blocks along the way regarding where the machines would go after we left and who would get to use them, but the women's dedication to each other and the project motivated me to work hard and fight for their rights' to the machines.  The most gratify moment came when the women were granted to keep the machines and continue work on them together.  They erupted into a cheer upon hearing the news!  I'm so grateful to Youthlinc for giving me this experience.  I'll never forget my friends in Vietnam and will carry them in heart forever.
Youthlinc	162789		/users/profile/216084	kk.oliver59	Volunteer	4	07/17/2013	Throughout the past year, I participated in a year-long project through Youthlinc, serving the community around me and also internationally. Youthlinc took a lot of preparation and work leading up to the international service trip, but looking back, I realized it all paid off. Going to Per and building relationships with the people there was truly an experience I'll never forget.  
Youthlinc	162759		/users/profile/216032	brookeholje	Volunteer	5	07/16/2013	My Youthlinc trip to Cambodia was the best experience of my life! I had such a great time working with the local people and getting to know them. I have never met better people in all my life. Getting to know the local Cambodians and hear their stories made me realize how lucky I have been in my life to enjoy all the amazing oppourtunities that I do. This was really the experience of a life time. I learned so much and grew a lot as a person. I will never forget it.
Youthlinc	162755		/users/profile/216027	Lisa_32	Volunteer	5	07/16/2013	I loved my trip to Peru. I am so happy I was given the opportunity to serve in Yanamono, and I was taught things I will remember and apply for the rest of my life. I learned so much about service, hard work, dedication, acceptance, and gratitude. I would highly recommend a service trip with Youthlinc to any country, to anyone even just slightly interested. You won't regret it. 
Youthlinc	162749		/users/profile/216019	Macie Boyle	Volunteer	5	07/16/2013	What Youthlinc does is revolutionary. My first experience with Youthlinc was in 2012 when I was on team Kenya. It was Youthlinc's first visit to Kajuki, but it took no time at all to create a tight bond with the people and we were able to help them in many ways. In the words of one of the locals a year after our visit, Youthlinc had "transformed my community." I didn't know what to expect as I left for Vietnam on the 2013 Friends & Family team, being a member of the first team ever to go to Vietnam. Even with our shaky past and the language barrier, it surely exceeded my expectations. The Vietnamese were unsure about us at first, but we slowly built relationships there that began mending a tragic history between the Vietnamese and America. They trusted and loved us, and were truly grateful that we were there to help them. Youthlinc does things that no other organizations can. It truly does have the power to tear down walls and build bridges. I saw it every day.
Youthlinc	162743		/users/profile/216013	Callielynn	Volunteer	5	07/16/2013	Youthlinc is an amazing program. Not only do you get to go to a foreign country of your choice to volunteer and help the people of that country, you also do service hours locally. I loved it because volunteering isn't just for other countries. There are people right in your own neighborhood that need help too, and these are the people that are often forgot about. Youthlinc is about helping both. They help you find a local service site and can help get you set up. These local service hours prepare you for the service you will do in your international service site. I had the most amazing time in my international service site, Cambodia. Everything is set up for you and the only thing you have to worry about is the work. We had the opportunity to teach English lessons to the children and then build a library, make a garden, and paint the school. The hardest part of the trip was not the work we did, but leaving the children. It changed my life. There is no other group I would have gone with than Youthlinc. 
Youthlinc	162685		/users/profile/215915	sophie turok	Volunteer	4	07/15/2013	I think that the experience is great but I wouldn't associate my experience directly with youthlinc. 
Youthlinc	162502		/users/profile/215705	arosenbloom	Volunteer	5	07/12/2013	I don't even know where to being: my youthlinc trip to Peru was, by far, the most amazing thing I have ever done in my entire life. First of all, Peru and being on the Amazon was an incredibly unique and beautiful experiance. The humidity, heat, bipolar weather, and mosquitos were all things that I had to adjust to, but ended up adding to the experiance. The people of Yanamono II were, as a group, the most loving, giving, warm and friendly people that I have ever encoutered. The word "community" takes up an entirely different meaning when applied to the village: everyone does not only know eachother, but takes time out to make sure everyone is doing okay; mothers let their children walk about freely because they know that the whole of the population is looking out for them; the leaders of the community work alongside in contruction projects and other community events. The people of Yanamono let us into this community - or rather, family - and this is something that I will forever be grateful for. Saying goodbye to these incredible people - my new family - was one of the hardest things I have had to do. I am already making plans to return. 
Youthlinc	162488		/users/profile/215685	moynihanlisa	Volunteer	5	07/12/2013	This is my 4th year with Youthlinc. I have participated in nearly every program the organization offers, most of them multiple times. I keep coming back to Youthlinc because not only do I believe in its mission, but I have seen it work. Youthlinc transforms Utah youths into true and lifelong humanitarians. This organization demonstrates to students the need that exists locally and globally, and encourages them to take the initiative to do something about it. It is helping to shape our future leaders into well-informed and compassionate people.
Youthlinc	162398		/users/profile/215554	Amanda86	Volunteer	5	07/11/2013	As I first arrived at the airport and saw all the "young high school kids" I was very worried about my decision to participate with Youthlinc.  After a little note from the youngest student on the Guatemala Team stating that was like a big sister to her, I knew I could play this role as the oldest student volunteer.  From that point on I was able to share my experiences and passion for service with the others on the team.  I feels that I truly gained many new little sisters from this trip!  
Youthlinc	162359		/users/profile/215487	Isaac Puriri	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	Youthinc has now provided me with 2 years of service opportunities, and has had a sincerely positive influence on my life. The way Youthlinc is set up allows for personal local service opportunities, giving you the chance to connect to people with whom you likely would never have crossed paths with, let alone build personal relationships, even though you live in the same area! I really like this because it allows for a better understanding of the community you personally live in. The International service is a beautiful experience. I traveled with Youthlinc to Peru (2012) and Kenya (2013), both locations were completely amazing. You work closely with the locals every day, and playing games with the kids drives the connection deep into the heart. I honestly love my experiences with Youthlinc and hope everyone would take advantage of this impressive organization. Youthlinc provides a well rounded experience that will forever change your life, as you strive to change others. 
Youthlinc	162353		/users/profile/215480	Claire Cullinane	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	Youthlinc has not only broadened my perspective on life but has also taught me a new way to live my life. Throughout my experience with Youthlinc I have gained more knowledge about the world around me and the important needs of others. If you are looking for a life changing experience this is one you should look into. I have gained responsibility and a love for people I did not have before. I traveled to Guatemala this year and learned what the true meaning of happiness is. 
Youthlinc	162351		/users/profile/215478	WhitneyWalton	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	I have never felt as loved as I did while serving in Kajuki, Kenya with Youthlinc. I was absolutely amazed by the kindness, compassion and immense love every single person gave us throughout our journey. The children's bright eyes taught us about faith, the community's giving nature taught us about warm international hospitality, and their country taught us that it is more important to live simply than to simply live.  In Kenya, love isn't just a four letter word either, it is a way of life. Everything someone did for another was because of the love they held for humanity. I was absolutely honored to be surrounded by such an overwhelming emotion and to be able to return the love they had invested in me.  We all see poverty, malnutrition and hardship in the news every day, but nothing compares to actually seeing it in with your own eyes - that's when it becomes reality. Youthlinc was able to teach me how to understand my purpose as a informed global citizen and what I can actually do to help make and inspire change. I am so blessed to have been given this opportunity to be a part of such an unbelievable organization and inspiring community! 
Youthlinc	162348		/users/profile/215474	Ruth A	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	Youthlinc is unique among nonprofits because of the level of student involvement.  Students plan and fundraise for all the projects.  Youthlinc is hands on from the get-go.  In addition, students get to make a difference locally as they serve at a chosen main service site throughout the year.  But maybe the most unique thing about Youthlinc is the change that happens in its participants.  Students join Youthlinc wanting to change the world and come home changed in the process.  No one completes the Youthlinc experience without learning to be a better communicator, team player, and better citizen.  Through hands-on projects and meaningful connections with both my team and the people we served, I came away a much better person.

Youthlinc	162328		/users/profile/215435	adriewool	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	Years ago I volunteered with a group in an international setting whose mission was to create life-long humanitarians. Although the experience was memorable, a key component was missing from their vision: local service. My local service opportunity enabled me to work closely with young children who were struggling with reading. This experience helped me to see the value of continual service at one location. My international service experience in Kenya was awe-inspiring. On our final day of teaching, we visited the Kamuteria Primary School. I had the opportunity to teach in their Special Needs classroom, and from the moment I stepped into the room, I knew my life was changed forever. About 30 individuals with disabilities, ranging in age from 5  20+ years, filled the small and crowded school room. I walked around and shook hands with each one and asked their names. The teacher followed me and helped to voice the names of students that were nonverbal. One boy with autism quickly caught my eye. Paris was a bright-eyed active young boy who couldnt sit still enough to remain in a chair and was fascinated by interactions with others. I knew the moment he threw his crayons out the window and then left the room to retrieve him, that I had a good one on my hands. He and the other students enjoyed looking at pictures of animals and recreating the noises and movements they make. They colored Spiderman coloring pages, sang and danced to Abiyoyo, and thoroughly enjoyed the balloon time. Picture 10 balloons floating around the room and hearing squeals of excitement each time one popped and youll begin to understand the magic of that moment. Just before leaving the class, I viewed a demonstration of how one of the students makes placemats. Not only does she make the placemats, but she teaches other students how to make them. This is an incredibly important aspect to this classroom, to prepare the students to earn money. Finally, the entire school gathered under a large tree and performed several songs and dances for us. We felt extremely honored to be their guests that day. Then the students from the Special Needs class presented gifts in the form handicrafts made by their parents to our group. Several of us accepted gifts and expressed our gratitude to the students as tears filled our eyes. That day was so life-changing for me that since returning to the United States I have begun collecting money to help build a dormitory, kitchen, and extra classrooms for those students with Special Needs. What a beautiful moment in my life that will never be forgotten.  My life-changing experience with Youthlinc has truly enhanced my life-long goals to serve others both near and far. 
Youthlinc	162326		/users/profile/215427	Alyssa B.	Volunteer	5	07/10/2013	Youthlinc is a local Utah Organization that focuses on both local and international volunteer work. I had volunteered abroad before my contact with Youthlinc, and that was an amazing experience, but what really attracted me to Youthlinc was the local service aspect. I loved that as an organization they highlighted the needs of our communities, and helped us as a group realize opportunities to serve are not limited developing countries. I chose to volunteer at a local elementary school that deals with overcrowding and poor test performance. It was an eye opening experience to see that an "inner city" school existed here in Salt Lake. I loved getting to know the children and the teachers. It was also really great to see the difference that one person, a good teacher, can make in a child's life. My experience in Kenya was unlike anything that I could have prepared myself for or imagined. I feel like for the 7 months prior to leaving I read every article and watched every documentary on Kenya I could find, but I couldn't have known what the experience would do to my heart and soul. The people I met and the lessons I learned will forever be with me. I know that we were there to teach, serve, and improve lives, but we learned, received, and improved our own lives and perspectives equally if not greater than the people of Kajuki. I feel that given my fields of study through University that I have a fairly decent grasp on the English Language, but I have yet to find the words adequate to describe my experience. Things like amazing, awesome (in the true sense of the word), poignant, etc... come to mind, but I have and do use those words in my daily life and this was not like anything in my daily life. I will search until I have found the right adjective for Kenya 2013.
Youthlinc	162162		/users/profile/215207	bamber3795	Volunteer	5	07/07/2013	I heard of Youthlinc through a teacher at my school who had been a team leader and was preparing to do so again and also from two friends who participated in the 2012 Service year. I applied and was accepted and have learned so much since. I was required to complete 60 community service hours and by doing so, I learned the value of truly serving others! Traveling to Guatemala opened my eyes to the many ways one person can be of service to others and it was the experience of a lifetime. Serving and helping others as a part of Youthlinc has shown me that I can make a difference in people's lives and change myself for the better when I focus on serving other people.
Youthlinc	162152		/users/profile/215193	c.gregovich	Volunteer	4	07/07/2013	Youthlinc is a wonderful program for young humanitarians. I just recently got back from Guatemala and had the greatest time of my life. It has truly solidified my humanitarian path of my life. I would recommend this experience to anyone. 
Youthlinc	162149		/users/profile/215188	Parker Wilcox	Volunteer	5	07/07/2013	Parker Wilcox  Youthlinc can really make you feel like you can make a difference in people's lives. I was heading home from the 2013 Kenya trip, feeling soooo happy with myself and the work I had done. It was definitely the best thing I have ever done. I made so many new friends, and I learned a lot about myself too. The people of Kenya are AMAZING, with a lot of love and kindness to give. They taught me more about giving than anyone I've ever met has. "Here in Kenya, we don't have much to give. So instead we give our hearts." Everything we did there gave me a new perspective on how I need to appreciate what I have. Now I guess I can call myself a builder, a carpenter, a teacher, and humanitarian. Even a traveler extraordinaire! I will never forget the experiences I had in Kenya, or the love given to me by the people there, especially all the little children. I truly am grateful for the experience of a lifetime, doing service in Africa. 
Youthlinc	162004		/users/profile/214925	Alane G.	Volunteer	5	07/03/2013	I was a mentor on the Kenya 2013 trip.  It sounds cliche, but it truly was an experience of a lifetime and one I know will live within me forever.  The other mentors were amazing people, all with unique gifts to give.  The students surpassed any expectations that I had before our adventure.  They worked tirelessly and always with a smile and a positive attitude.  Their compassion was an incredible model for my young son who accompanied us. Our team spoke often about service as belonging and never was it more true than with this group and with the communities that we visited.  We were welcomed and given more than we brought - always. One of the priests at the school said, "It only takes a minute to know someone, but you remember them for a lifetime."  This has never been more true and I feel blessed to have made this journey in the company of so many stellar individuals.
Youthlinc	161923		/users/profile/214804	Jenna Stone	Volunteer	5	07/02/2013	Youthlinc is an amazing organization. It really gave me the experience of a life-time. It helps you gain leadership, makes you more responsible, and you become so grateful for all the little things in life. I would recommend youthlinc to everyone. It will really change your life like it has mine. 
Youthlinc	161627		/users/profile/214382	hmcmaster420	Volunteer	5	06/27/2013	I went to Kenya on a service trip with Youthlinc. I spent 2 and a half weeks building, teaching, and spent endless hours getting to know the people of Kenya. It was the most beautiful place I had ever been. The love these people give to you is something I had never felt before in my life. I hope that I can continue to stay involved with Youthlinc throughout the years. It was an experience I will never forget. 
Youthlinc	150890		/users/profile/201234	Johnson99	General Member of the Public	3	03/11/2013	Hello - I saw a flyer from a friend and wanted to help out with a donation for a trip.  I was really hoping to see a paypal option on your donation page.  That is my preferred method over credit card on-line payments.  I hope you add that as a payment option. 
Youthlinc	140573		/users/profile/186772	Miriam K.	Advisor	5	11/16/2012	I work as a full-time employee of Youthlinc, and am thrilled to walk into the office each day.  The mission of creating lifetime humanitarians is what initially attracted me to Youthlinc, but it is the effectiveness in which Youthlinc achieves our mission that keeps me here.   Over the course of about a year, our young participants take ownership of positive change, both locally and internationally.  Through mentorship and being responsible for planning service activities, our participants gain leadership experience, an ability to work with others in a group, and a global perspective that will serve them for a lifetime.  Students come into the program excited, but overwhelmed or even lost as to how they might make a difference.  They walk out of Youthlinc feeling proud of their accomplishments, and with a confidence that they're capable of moving mountains.  I don't believe there is greater or more satisfying work than that.  It is truly an honor and a joy to be apart of an organization that is doing so much good in the world.  
Youthlinc	138990		/users/profile/185082	abigurl	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	When I was 16, youthLINC changed my life and has been ever since. I first went on their humanitarian trip to Kenya in 2010. I have truly become a life long humanitarian with the tools and experience youthLINC gave me. 
Youthlinc	138413		/users/profile/184480	localservicerocks	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	Youthlinc is amazing - it sucked me in.  Three years since I started volunteering with Youthlinc and now I am in the office everyday!!!  The best part about Youthlinc is the immense amount of local service that happens in Salt Lake because of it's existence.  What starts as a desire to go on an international trip, quickly turns into a desire to become a lifetime humanitarian.  Youthlinc teaches you that there are many ways to serve and it isn't only internationally.  I started out thinking that I had to go somewhere else in the world to make a difference....and we did make a difference there but now I also see us making a difference every day at home and that is an incredible thing to witness.   
Youthlinc	121921		/users/profile/165923	Jordan N.	Volunteer	5	09/05/2012	I had the most incredible time in Thailand with this non-profit. Anyone interested in having the experience of your lifetime and LOOOOOVES service take time and apply! They offer the cheapest humanitarian trips you'll ever see! I have never met such an organization that is so organized and efficient with their time and resources. I made the strongest friendships and it really gives you an opportunity to reach your leadership potential. 
Youthlinc	121720		/users/profile/165617	BBBBB	Volunteer	5	08/30/2012	This organization is Amazing! I had a wonderful life changing experience. The trip was well organized and I felt safe and cared for the entire time while having a wonderful time. One thing that really makes this organization unique is the fact that they focus on local and international service, this helps to create lifetime humanitarians of the participants. I felt like the trip had a perfect blend of service and site seeing. I felt like I had a cultural experience along with a wonderful service experience. I would and have recommended it to everyone I meet. Join Youthlinc!
Youthlinc	120129		/users/profile/163355	RuthA	Volunteer	5	08/07/2012	Youthlinc is a great non-profit organization that really helps youth become lifelong humanitarians.  Rather than simply focus on a short international trip that, while worthwhile, may not change behavior, Youthlinc encourages service and leadership for an entire year.  Everyone on our team did service in the local community, becoming relied upon volunteers at a site of the student's choosing.  We met as a team once a month giving plenty of opportunities for leadership and growth.  The international service trip was the icing on the cake.  We worked hand in hand with local Thai villagers at a school.  This collaboration ensures that villagers are invested in their future, rather than simply receiving a handout.  Our team had an excellent experience as we built two buildings for the school to use, taught English, provided medical care and health education, and held cultural exchange panels.  The best part was simply interacting with the Thai students and opening our hearts to them!
Youthlinc	120076		/users/profile/163256	aefa177	Board Member	5	08/06/2012	I just arrived back in the U.S. from two weeks in Kenya with Youthlinc.  My wife and I had the pleasure of joining the 41 member team as mentors to 29 teenage kids.  The mission of Youthlinc is to create lifetime humanitarians and now I understand how.  Our team consisted of amazing people and provided an experience that for most, if that all, will be life changing.  We were able to live at a school in Kajuki, Kenya with roughly 250 children (ages 4-12).  Our objectives were to complete a number of constructions projects, provide education, establish micro-enterprise loans, and gain an understanding of the needs in the community to help with future Youthlinc trips.  I truely believe that the above mission is being met and will continue to support this organization.
Youthlinc	120003		/users/profile/163150	caroline.coleman95	Volunteer	5	08/04/2012	Youthlinc is a phenomenal organization which helped make my first experience of international humanitarian work fun, safe, and meaningful.  Student volunteers and adult mentors alike spend eight months preparing through monthly meetings, which also provide great bonding time for the team.  The students' requirement of 60-100 hours of local community service also provides great preparation for going global.  The two weeks I spend in July in Phang Nga, Thailand were the best and most worthwhile of my life, not to mention the most fun, courtesy of the fantastic group of people I was with (all of whom now feel like family)!  I made friendships, both with Thai and Utah students, that I will never forget, and can truly say that I made a difference in the lives of children in a rural Thai village who have so much potential yet so few opportunities.  I always felt looked-after with Youthlinc, our team always had a plan so we didn't waste time, and it was unbelievably fun!  I can't wait to go back!
Youthlinc	119869		/users/profile/162947	Bartavelle	Volunteer	5	08/02/2012	I have accumulated innumerable experiences I will cherish for the rest of my life. Overall, the experience in Kenya has been one of the best i've ever had the pleasure of enjoying.
Youthlinc	119867		/users/profile/162944	Laura Jayne	Volunteer	5	08/02/2012	I love this organization! Youthilnc is a perfect way to become involved in service -- both internationally and locally. As a student on the Youthlinc Kenya 2012 team, I have had a great experience both in my local service sites and the international service. The Youthlinc staff is well organized and easy to communicate with. I always felt at ease, especially in-country. Everything went smoothly, and it was a great experience. Participating in Youthilnc was the best decisions I made! I made life-long friends, dedicated my life to service, and provided meaningful service! It is an amazing experience that I would recommend to anyone.

Youthlinc	119419		/users/profile/162368	Bianca B.	Client Served	5	07/27/2012	Thank you Youthlinc for your organization's consistent communication, flexibility, and all your hard work in securing so many donations!  Thank you for your cultural sensitivity and for purely serving Asociacion Ak Tenamit, not just taking it into your hands, but letting us tell you our needs.  It is important to have that sort of consciousness in a group of people who volunteer internationally-- to understand  how important it is to help in a sustainable way, empowering people to help themselves or giving them the tools to do so. But what most impacted me about working with Youthlinc was the sincere connections your young people made with the students at Asociacion Ak' Tenamit.  There were many language and cultural barriers, but those were surpassed and many beautiful friendships were cultivated ~   Bianca Gras, Asociacion Ak' Tenamit 2011-2012 Volunteer Coordinator
Youthlinc	119236		/users/profile/162102	Kaila B.	Volunteer	5	07/25/2012	I had an amazing 2012 year with Youthlinc. Youthlinc provided me the opportunity of a life-time to do service in my local community and in Guatemala. Our local service had to be an interactive one--as in, one involving other people and communicating--in this case, to prepare us for our international service. I did my local service with Arts-Kids, a youth development program that helps kids with problem solving, communication, and socializing through art. I had a great time getting to know the kids through activities like the opening and closing circle and of course art! Before going to Guatemala we had to earn it, we had to complete a total of 60 hours of community service then raise about $1,400. The expense wasn't much thanks to our wonderful sponsers, and with help of family and friends raising the money was easy. It took a lot of preparation before we left on our life-changing experience. We raised money for school supplies, art supplies, and sports/games to bring. We also gathered glasses to bring for our eye testing. Each of the students going to Guatemala put forth 110% whether it be fundraising, or making a lesson plan. Before we left each student had to create a lesson they were going to teach to the students of Ak' Tenamit (the school we were going to in Guatemala.) The lessons varied from English to Art to Soap Making, and came with photos, posters, and even maps to show the students. After months of preparation our team of 40 students, alum leaders, and committee leaders were off to Guatemala. Once arrive the experience became very surreal. It exceeded my expectations. We were working 24/7 (for the two weeks we were there) and it feel good after the long wait. Faced with this new experience and cultural exchange the team did well, no complaints and just smiling faces. Knowing we were helping took away from all the scary bugs, smells, and humidity.  At the school we did three main projects: we built a path, varnished and sanded an up and coming computer lab, and painted 5 of the girls dorms a bright orange. When first arriving we had an opening ceremony to share some of our culture with theirs, and they did the same. We got to teach our lessons to 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th graders, and also did an agricultural project with the students. We mingled with the students by playing a soccer match (where we lost epically), having a dance, painting nails, and playing other various games. One day we hiked up to a remote village and assembled and gave 32 families water filters--it was one of my favorite experiences. It's so hard to say all that we did in such a short time frame, but I will tell you that you don't want to pass this experience by. In the end of my two week all the sweat and hard work felt euphoric, just such a great relief and joy--so many emotions at once. We were sad to leave our new friends and the beautiful country of Guatemala, but we it will never leave our hearts (as cheesy as that sounds)! Two weeks was enough to change my perspective, I am so open-minded and strive to do more. As a human being I am changed forever and for the better. I will always be grateful of this wonderful experience!
Youthlinc	119214		/users/profile/162082	anniemo	Volunteer	5	07/24/2012	This was the most amazing experience that I have ever had. While in Peru we helped the people by building bridges and painting the medical clinic and school. We also taught the women how to  make soap and how to start a business and they are now on their first trial soap making business endeavor. All these service projects were amazing, but the best part of the trip was working along side the people, getting to know them, and coming to love them. I never knew that you could come to love someone so deeply that you can barely even speak to. Volunteer work brings out not only the best in others, but also the best in yourself as well. The changes that it creates in the people creates something truly sustainable and causes a chain reaction of kindness and charity and that is something you can't put a price on.
Youthlinc	119079		/users/profile/161911	thehector14	Volunteer	5	07/23/2012	We helped built bridges, clinic, paint schools, build a bathroom, etc. It was the most rewarding thing I've ever done in my life, I can't imagine another way to help people and have fun at the same time and really get to know the community, it was amazing...
Youthlinc	119061		/users/profile/161879	Ayrowyn T.	Volunteer	5	07/22/2012	Youthlinc is an amazing program. Well thought out and planned in empowering students and creating sustainable change in developing countries. It is not just a service trip to provide humanitarian aide. It involves students for an entire year. Students must complete the required number of service hours locally in order to go internationally. This requirement ensures that students are invested in the program and truly desire to make a difference both locally and globally. Opportunities for fundraising, lesson planning, project planning are presented for the students which encourages them to do new things, pushing themselves to greater heights. The responsibility is great, but the reward is even greater! It is a life changing experience as in country there is the opportunity to provide physical change while the villagers provide emotional, mental and spiritual change. These people open their hearts and homes to us providing a home away from home. They are family by the end of the two weeks. The examples of pure love, generosity, and genuine kindness while living simply and practically are refreshing and stimulating. 
Youthlinc	119038		/users/profile/161851	gbaby	Volunteer	5	07/22/2012	The overall experience that I had while on my Youthlinc trip to Peru was outstanding. This was one of the most life changing events that I have ever had the privilege to be a part of and now I have decided to continue volunteering and helping others. Youthlinc has shown me how good it feels to help others and receive their gratification and the examples that Youthlinc puts forth and their protocols for dealing with people are very good. I would recommend the Youthlinc program to anyone looking to start  being a good humanitarian. 
Youthlinc	119005		/users/profile/161804	peruvolunteer	Volunteer	5	07/21/2012	I returned to Peru this year from going last year with the Friends and Family Trip, and it was even more wonderful this time! The community in Yanamono is small compared to other Youthlinc  sites that many of the villagers remembered me which was so heart-warming. I enjoyed working hard to help improve their home area with bridges, walkways, painting the school and simply interacting with the people. The students I went with were amazing as they worked tremendously hard and created such bonds with the people. It was a wonderful experience and I look forward to doing it again!
Youthlinc	118995		/users/profile/161793	JessR	Volunteer	5	07/21/2012	Youthlinc gae me a great experience to go to an area in Peru that really needed my help. I got to bond and create great friendships with the people of the yanamono village. Being there and seeing that they did not have anything and yet were happy made me realize that I have everything and should appreciate my way of life. Youthlic truely hanged my perspective on life and I'm sure I will keep doing service projects like these. 
Youthlinc	118967		/users/profile/161752	blackmamba	Volunteer	4	07/20/2012	This is a great opportunity to help out your community both at the local and international level.

And this is the perfect opportunity for a beginner. Because of Youthlinc, I plan on doing these service opportunities my whole life! They were very efficient in getting information out, and being able to see the whole picture. I so appreciate the kindness that each staff member has toward us! I will never forget my experience with Youthlinc, and I can't wait to go again! 
Youthlinc	118545		/users/profile/161219	andekim2	Volunteer	5	07/16/2012	Youthlinc is a fantastic organization!  As a volunteer mentor I was able to watch the already-amazing students who participated in the program grow and learn throughout their Youthlinc experience.  The domestic side of the program gave the students a true understanding of service and its purpose in communities.  The international experience helped the Utah students learn the differences that can be made for others when hard work, planning, and love are involved.  I have worked with other international service organizations and NGOs and Youthlinc is top-rate!  
Youthlinc	118351		/users/profile/160975	Dakota Barber	Volunteer	5	07/13/2012	My trip with the Youthlinc Guatemala team was amazing. I learned so much from the team and the people that we were serving. I feel that this experience helped change me into a better person. We volunteered at a school for the indigenous Mayan people there. We helped with teaching, construction, eye testing, and much more. At first I thought I was going down there to make a difference in their lives, but really they were the ones making a difference in mine. Youthlinc is a truly amazing program and I recommend it to anyone that it interested. Before Youthlinc I knew service was a good thing to do, but I didn't realize just how much of a difference it makes in the lives of those being served and those doing the service. This was the best experience, and because of it I am striving to be a humanitarian for life. Thank you youthlinc for this amazing opportunity.
Youthlinc	118227		/users/profile/87869	Shelly	Volunteer	5	07/12/2012	My husband and I served as the Team Leaders for a two week humanitarian mission to Rio Dulce, Guatemala with Youthlinc.   We love the motto of Youthlinc, "Creating Lifetime Humanitarian."   We enjoyed planning and overseeing this trip but we especially enjoyed watching the growth in the students we served.  This experience truly changed their lives.  We are thankful to be affiliated with an organization the empowers youth to serve both locally and internationally.
Youthlinc	80501		/users/profile/87869	Shelly	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	My daughter Alycia and I both have the priviledge of being associated with Youthlinc and are part of the Kenya 2011 team this year.  Youthlinc is an amazing organization and we are both grateful to be a part of it.  The founder of Youthlinc, Judy Zone, has a remarkable passion for this work, "creating lifetime humanitarians."  Her passion and zeal for this work is contagious to all those who have the priviledge of working with her.  As a mentor it has been a choice experience to watch the youth grow as they prepare for their international service trip.  They have become great leaders.  It has also been exciting to hear about their their local service projects.  They share these experiences with great enthusiasm.  I have been involved with many other humanitarian organizations.  Each plays a wonderful part in the community.  Youthlinc, however, is unique and special because of the change and enthusiasm that is made manifest in each youth that participates.  I will always be grateful for the privilege of this outstanding opportuntiy. Shelly Burningham
Youthlinc	118141		/users/profile/160676	Savannah V.	Volunteer	5	07/11/2012	I loved doing this amazing experience with Youthlinc. I felt like from the very beginning it was a huge commitment. I had to do 80 hours of service before I even went on this trip and that meant a lot to me, it gave me a new perspective. I also loved all of the planning that went into this program. It made such a difference going there knowing that I had planned for this the entire year. I never expected myself to love Cambodia as much as I did. People will tell you that you will have a life-changing experience and I don't think I really realized that until i stepped off the plane, home and realized that I missed them. I missed helping the people in Cambodia, and I missed being with them. I looked at things differently and then I realized that I have changed, I realized that after all of the service hours and planning that it was more than worth it in a million different ways.
Youthlinc	118026		/users/profile/160535	Isabel R.	Volunteer	5	07/10/2012	I have volunteered for over 2 years with Youthlinc and have traveled to 2 different continents with them. Youthlinc is a fantastic organization because it focuses not only on poverty stricken areas around the world, but also creates humanitarians through local service. This helps students and mentors develop a worldly perspective because they are better able to fully understand the struggles in our home town and in far-away places, but still shows that everyone could use a little help.
Youthlinc	117833		/users/profile/160223	Jane32	Volunteer	5	07/06/2012	I was on the 2012 Cambodia team, and it changed my life! I had the opportunity to volunteer at three local sites before our trip, and I was able to understand the role that I have to use my own small talents and abilities to help people, even people that live so close to me. I learned that it's important to spend my time doing things that matter-I'm always busy with work and homework, but I'm my free time, being aware of the needs of others is so much more important than Facebook or just hanging out. In Cambodia, we built a preschool, built a fence, taught health and preschool lessons, installed water filters, participated in a livestock exchange program, etc. Although the immediate relief of the construction wasn't really evident, it was clear that the Cambodian people were so excited to be special enough for us to help them. There were so many incredible moments when I could tell that just my smile turned someone's day around. I would LOVE to be a part of a Youthlinc team again. It was incredible. 
Youthlinc	117759		/users/profile/160111	Hannah11	Volunteer	5	07/05/2012	I served in Guatemala with a group through Youthlinc, and  loved every minute of it. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had, and it has and will continue to have a lasting impression on my day to day life. 
Youthlinc	117729		/users/profile/160066	Zoe Leavitt	Volunteer	5	07/04/2012	Youthlinc truly achieves it's goal of creating lifetime humanitarians.  Because of my local and international service, I have truly been changed for the good.  I have learned through this experience to love everyone despite their color, ability, background, lifestyle... well, just EVERYONE.  I am so grateful to Youthlinc for providing me with the opportunity to lose myself in service, and I know that through this opportunity, teens like me are able to find true joy in who they are.  Thank You, Youthlinc for changing my life, and the lives of countless others.
Youthlinc	117709		/users/profile/160034	aubrey.marz20	Volunteer	5	07/04/2012	Youthlinc is such a fabulous program to get involved with if you have any desire to serve those around you. The amazing experiences that Youthlinc teams have encourage students to continue volunteering and literally become lifetime humanitarians! I have had so many wonderful experiences with Youthlinc and want to stay involved for as long as I possibly can. I love that Youthlinc is unique when it comes to their service year. Not only do participants get to work with their team for many months before going internationally to serve, but they also get the opportunity to become a relied upon volunteer in their community. 
Youthlinc	117632		/users/profile/159920	Rebekah7	Volunteer	4	07/03/2012	Youthlinc is an amazing organization that offers life changing experiences and friendships. I went to Cambodia with Youthlinc this last year and it was the greatest experience of my life. Not only are the international experiences life changing, but the emphasis they put on local service is just as important. The opportunities Youthlinc gave me to serve within my community and abroad have set my life on a new path. I wasn't sure where I wanted my life to go at the beginning of this year, but now I have direction. I know that humanitarian work, work like Youthlinc introduced me to, is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I feel like I have learned more about life, people, and love from the experiences Youthlinc gave me than from anything else in my life so far. Youthlinc is an organization based on integrity and helping people, I hope they are around for years and years to come!
Youthlinc	117489		/users/profile/159738	paige.heyn	Volunteer	5	07/01/2012	I volunteered with Youthlinc in June of 2012 in the Cambodia site. I went with the Friends and Family Team. I loved every minute of my service trip. I came home with a new perspective on the global community and on the happiness service brings to those giving as well as receiving the service. I would recommend Youthlinc to anyone because they give you individualized attention and prepare you so well for the work you will be doing. It is a fun, dedicated group of people that make serving our local and global community a wonderful experience. 
Youthlinc	117438		/users/profile/159674	Quincy B.	Volunteer	5	06/30/2012	Participating in Youthlinc this year has been amazing. I've made so many friends and had a ton of fun. I've learned a lot about service, the most effective ways to help in certain situations and how to get jobs done.  Our out of country trip was fantastic, unlike anything I've been a part of before. Thanks Youthlinc for the unforgettable experience!
Youthlinc	117415		/users/profile/159646	MalPal	Volunteer	4	06/30/2012	I signed up for Youthlinc not expecting to be chosen. When I found out I was selected I was thrilled. I have never been involved with such a hands on service opportunity and I couldn't be more happy with the outcome of my trip. I was able to personally work with members of the village my team went to teaching them and installing water filtration systems. In the days that we were there, my team accomplished so much and truly made a difference to those in the village. 
Youthlinc	116486		/users/profile/158575	Jay_4	Volunteer	4	06/25/2012	I went to Cambodia with Youthlinc's Friends and Family Program in June of 2012. We had a wonderful time getting to know and appreciate this wonderful country and it's people through our service. Youthlinc has developed  a low cost model of delivery humanitarian experiences for young people. 
Youthlinc	113096		/users/profile/153864	Ryan14	Volunteer	5	05/28/2012	Youthlinc is an amazing program that helps impoverished international villages.  This year I will be going to Guatemala on a team to help kids at a school called Ak'Tenamit.  Not only does Youthlinc have an incredible program for international service, but also requires a minimum of 60 hours of local service before the international trip.  Through Youthlinc I have gained a love for service that will last me so much longer than just for this service trip!  I now have the desire to become a lifelong humanitarian!  Thank you Youthlinc for your priceless gift!
Youthlinc	106460		/users/profile/143848	Caretaylor27	Volunteer	5	02/15/2012	I have been involved with Youthlinc this past year preparing for my 2012 humanitarian trip to Kenya, Africa this coming Summer. I am proud to say that I have never had a greater privilege then working with the amazing staff and volunteers that makes up Youthlinc. Judy Zone, Julia Wee, and Miriam Kramer, Youthlincs only three employees, are some of the kindest and most hardworking people I have ever met and I am honored to have the privilege of calling them my friends as well as my mentors and role models. Youthlinc is an unbelievable organization with a main goal of serving other people to the best of their ability. 
Youthlinc	106428		/users/profile/72806	penny	Volunteer	5	02/14/2012	going as a volunteer i had no idea what to expect but it was wonderful. i felt like i did so much and haevenever worked harder in my life. 
Youthlinc	66611		/users/profile/72806	penny	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	youthink has been a great experience. it teaches young people to go outside of themselves and think of others. it teaches how to open up to a new world of different culture and most of all it teaches that just showing you care gives others hope.  i volunteer at a middle school in a underrepresented community with a book exchange program and i have never seen children so happy to own their own books. i only hope that when i go to cambodia to help that i make some kind of a difference to someone. 
Youthlinc	106295		/users/profile/143264	Terry P.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/11/2012	I am a Mentor for Salt Lake County Youth Government.  Many of the YouthLINC students are volunteers with our group.  Our man focus is on youth homelessness.  The YouthINC volunteers are reliable and effective.  My oldest daughter went on a YouthLINC trip to Peru and had a life changing experience.  She is a strong (6ft) woman who gets teary eyed when talking about her trip.  She gets emotional in a good way.  The children on her trip touched her deeply.  My second daughter will be taking a service trip to Cambodia this summer.  It is a relief knowing that she will be a part of a well organized group that will truly make a difference in the world.
Youthlinc	106293		/users/profile/143262	jessoglesby	Volunteer	5	02/11/2012	I am a senior in high school and YouthLinc truly opened my eyes, both to the poverty in my own community and in the world. Last summer I traveled with them to Kiamuri, Kenya. We built new classrooms for their elementary schools, went out and did medical work in the community, taught english, chemistry, math, etc. Not to mention the amount of time and labor that went in to raising money to bring them educational and medical supplies. But even after all we did for them, their generosity and kindness but me to shame. YouthLinc made this incredible experience happen without any worrying on my part about the logistics of travel and lodging. I know YouthLinc has forever changed my life and I am sure all 30+ of my other team members feel the same way. 
Youthlinc	95214		/users/profile/110399	Staci O.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/07/2011	I went as a social work mentor. We did construction projects at two schools in the jungle of Thailand as well as built relationships with their students and faculty. YouthLINC is an amazing program that teaches local and international services in order to create lifetime humanitarians. This experience changed my life. To go to a country that we don't speak each others' language and learn to love, grow, play, and serve each other was incredible. The Thai people are so loving and they will forever be in my heart.
Youthlinc	94793		/users/profile/109736	11KALLEN	Volunteer	5	08/01/2011	Youth linc is an incredible program because not only does youthlinc provide the opportunity to serve globally and internationally but it instills an attitude of service in daily life. Youth linc creates lifetime humanitarians in all their volunteers by having service requirements before you leave on your international trips. It truly is an outstanding program. I just arrived back from my trip to Kiamuri, Kenya 2 days and it was an unfogettable life changing experience.
Youthlinc	94759		/users/profile/109684	Taylor	Volunteer	5	07/31/2011	   The mission of Youthlinc is definently achieved! This program is the most amazing thing I have had the privilege to be apart of. To say that Youthlinc changes lives is an understatement. To describe all that Youthlinc has done is impossible.     You could start by saying this program has affected all the people in these distant lands, but you'd be forgetting about the people doing the service for them and how they have been affected. Or if you wanted to say that Youthlinc changed communities, you are missing the changed countries.     What Youthlinc has done is unbelievable, and what will be able to do is unimaginable! This program is a true blessing to all those who ever come in contact with it!!    I am a lifetime humanitarian, and it is for one reason, and one reason only! That reason is the Youthlinc organization!
Youthlinc	93935		/users/profile/108375	Micah Allgood	Volunteer	5	07/15/2011	The overall experience changed my outlook on my own life and made me realize things i'm truly grateful for! The whole experience was the most emotional thing I've ever done, from building the kitchen, painting a wall mural, playing with the kids at the orphanage, being interviewed in an English school, to simply playing soccer with the village kids. No matter where you are in the world or the language you speak you'll always be able to play sports and have a good time. Also, kids will always be kids and just want to play and stay young forever. 
Youthlinc	93734		/users/profile/108029	Trevor W.	Volunteer	4	07/11/2011	Being a part of Youthlinc has been one of the greatest experiences in my life. I enjoyed all of the preparation that we had to go through before even being able to go to Mexico to serve.  In order to be able to go, each student had to come up with the money one way or another in order to go on the trip.  I also liked that it was required to give 60 hours of local service before being able to go.  Even such local service helped pave the way to giving service to the people of Chiapas, Mexico for just two weeks. Our specific service site was in a village in the state of Chiapas in Mexico.  The name of the village is Bautista Grande.  Our main service project was to help reconstruct the kitchen at the village school there.  Since it is such a close-knit community, the school is a big meeting place for the entire village, so they often have meetings and parties there, and the kitchen is an important thing for both the children, and the adults. It was great to be able to work with them toward reconstructing the kitchen so they can eventually have a clean, efficient, and healthier way to prepare their food.  There is no better satisfaction then that of serving your fellow man.
Youthlinc	93590		/users/profile/13625	jillybeanw	Volunteer	5	07/08/2011	When people ask why I would spend money to mentor kids in a far-away place while so much help is needed here, I am proud to explain that at youthlinc we want to foster life-time humanitarians so we have everyone get involved locally to get involved globally.  It makes a difference here in America, in country (go team Cambodia!) and in the life of the individual volunteers. I had a wonderful time working with the people in Cambodia and mentoring the Cambodia Youthlinc team.  We always felt safe, ate good food, stayed in a wonderful place, and met so many incredible people.  
Youthlinc	11688	10	/users/profile/13625	jillybeanw	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	I travelled with Youthlinc their 2nd year.  It was a wonderful opportunity to take extra time and serve people locally, and then travel internationally to make such a huge difference in their lives and my own.
Youthlinc	93362		/users/profile/107330	Annie T.	Volunteer	5	07/04/2011	I was on the Thailand Youthlinc team of 2011 and had an amazing experience. Before leaving for Thailand, each student participated in 80 hours of local community service. I served at Samuel Morgan Elementary and after working for those 80 hours, I feel I had a better experience and worked for my position in Thailand. We worked at a school building a kitchen, tiling, painting bathrooms and their playground, teaching English, providing a health fair and carnival, and building relationships I will never forget. I will always remember the amazing experience I had with Youthlinc and the Thai people. I would definitely recommend anyone to this life-changing organization.
Youthlinc	93361		/users/profile/107326	es23	Volunteer	5	07/03/2011	I just returned from a Youthlinc trip to Thailand and had an amazing experience there! I really enjoyed the relationships that were made with the Thai people even though we didn't speak the same language.  I enjoyed serving them and I am glad I had the opportunity through Youthlinc to help at their school.  I hope that we influenced the Thai school children's lives because I know they influenced mine! 
Youthlinc	93354		/users/profile/107317	amh3	Volunteer	5	07/03/2011	I just returned from the Youthlinc 2011 trip to Cambodia, and it was such an incredible experience! One thing that I really love about Youthlinc is the preparation that went into getting there. We had to do 80 hours of community service in order to go, and had it not been for this requirement I would have missed out on many opportunities. I was grateful for their push for us to get involved locally as well as around the world. Youthlinc has helped me become a humanitarian rather than just a volunteer, and I will continue to serve all the time!
Youthlinc	93348		/users/profile/107309	nicki.swan	Volunteer	5	07/03/2011	I have recently returned from Cambodia with the 2011 Youthlinc team.  This has been my first international service trip and now I cant wait to go on another one.  The trip has really opened my eyes to an entirely new type of service and has allowed me to have a different perspective on many many things.  Service has always been a part of my life but i know that now it will be an even bigger part of it.  
Youthlinc	93165		/users/profile/106959	Carly P.	Volunteer	5	06/30/2011	I have just recently returned from Youthlinc's 2011 Cambodia Trip. It was my first international service experience, and I could not have asked for a better one. Youthlinc has made me a life time humanitarian. Sometimes we have to take a step back to gain perspective, Youthlinc was my step back. It has opened my eyes, and humbled my heart. I have just graduated from high school and this experience has set the tone for the rest of my life. 
Youthlinc	86934		/users/profile/97481	timothysalazar	Volunteer	5	04/24/2011	I received an envelope yesterday from AXA Equitable. The envelope included a single page typed letter that informed me of the outcome of a scholarship I had applied for with them, one that required having been part of a community service project. I highlighted my experiences with YouthLINC and all of the several projects I completed as part of the program. I was very excited and overjoyed to learn that I will receive the scholarship!  I thank YouthLINC for the opportunity and experience that led to making this scholarship possible for me; thank you so much for making this experience possible for me! I loved the trip and the service, and I now have even greater proof of the good that comes out of doing good. The YouthLINC trip really opened me up to possible careers in the future that would focus on humanitarian aid or simply helping with global or just local issues. Working for one of the United Nations' branches is a dream of mine. I am planning on studying international relations of some form of anthropological study at the University of Chicago, and the scholarship gives some much appreciated help. I cannot fully express how wonderful and amazing the YouthLINC experience was and all the benefits I have garnered from participating; the local and the international service alike have been enormously rewarding. I have learned a lot about what it means to be a part of a community and what it means to serve through the YouthLINC program.
Youthlinc	81107		/users/profile/88663	kajsabmine	Board Member	5	03/03/2011	Youthlinc has changed our family's outlook on the world and service. Meeting Judy Zone, Youthlinc's founder, was an experienc unlike any I've ever had. Her energy and personal power aimed at assisting youth in SEEING the world and the impact they can have on it (the lives they can change and save) is breathtaking! I especially like that within Youthlinc, youth are taught that their impact is vital worldwide--both in their local communities and in other nations. And that they learn this hands on, through service. Also powerful is Youthlinc partnering those within the community with youth humanitarians in the form of funds to help with their trips. This brings power in service to everyone involved--as well as energy and awareness to the need we all have to be of worth, and the opportunity we all have to heal our world. I'm honored that this year my daughter, Ashley, is serving refugees, and abused and neglected children within her community--and then is going to Cambodia this summer!
Youthlinc	73631		/users/profile/80463	maryswami	Donor	4	02/23/2011	My daughter came home from school one day and asked if she could apply to the Youthlinc international service program. I am so glad that we let her apply because this has been such an amazing experience for her and us. She has not been on the trip to Thailand yet but she has been volunteering in the community on a weekly basis. She works with local refugee children, planning activities with them and being a constant friend to them. I don't know who benefits more, these refugee children or my daughter. Youthlinc requires that members commit a certain number of hours volunteering in the local community in order to qualify for the international trip. Team members also must fundraise to pay their way. Youthlinc wants to create lifetime humanitarians. The rewarding feeling of helping others is invaluable and by completing these volunteer hours, members get hooked on the way it feels to do something for another human being, one who you may not have encountered before, one who you may not have understood before.The international trip will be eye-opening for the participants as well. It will be an experience that our kids will share for years to come and have such an impact on the people they visit. I cannot recommend Youthlinc highly enough! It is such a good cause and helps so many people. 
Youthlinc	73341		/users/profile/80153	xxxx	Donor	5	02/22/2011	My daughter has participated with Youthlinc in many ways for a number of years. She has seen and experienced things that have helped her see the world more clearly, and more importantly, she has more clearly seen her place in that world.
Youthlinc	73313		/users/profile/80126	Shandy Smith	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	I am lucky enough to be a part of the Youthlinc team this year. I am on the Thailand team, and although I haven't even been on the international trip yet, Youthlinc has already helped me become a better person. Because we must get a certain amount of service hours to qualify for these trips, I have been spending more time thinking about those around me than myself. This organization has opened my eyes, and has helped me become a lifetime humanitarian.
Youthlinc	72834		/users/profile/79618	Mallory D.	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	YouthLinc changed my life! It taught me how to serve not only in my local community, but the world around me. It really helped me realize how I CAN make a difference. YouthLinc really forced me to learn how to become involved and recognize the need in my local community, and helped me gain relationships so I can continue serving in my community. 
Youthlinc	72704		/users/profile/79474	richard	Volunteer	4	02/22/2011	My son is going to this year to Kenya through the Youthlinc program.  I have been very impressed with the organization and commitment to service.
Youthlinc	72673		/users/profile/79441	grateful	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	I am completely sold on Youthlinc's program.  As a parent I was a little concerned when my daughter wanted to join youthlinc and travel to Peru to help there.  I loved the idea but wanted to make sure she was with a good organization that would keep her safe as well.  Youthlinc provided the support structure along with good leaders and medical personnel, all there for the volunteers to keep them healthy and safe.  They took good care of my daughter when she did get sick upon arrival in Peru, and she went on to have a fabulous experience. Along with the service in Peru, my favorite part of the program is the hours of service they are required to put in to their own community before going abroad.  Youthlinc is the best organization of its kind that I have found.
Youthlinc	72219		/users/profile/78964	marisa	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	There are many organizations out there that take teens on humanitarian trips. After much research I decided YouthLINC was an organization I wanted to be involved with. The purpose is to create lifetime humanitarians, which reaches far beyond the 2 weeks of service I did in Mexico. I absolutely loved picking a local service site to go to each week. As part of YouthLINC I was able to become more involved in my own community before I even left for an international service experience. YouthLINC allows students to take action for problems locally and internationally. It was a benefit to be divided up into committees and have specific responsibilities in planning and preparation. I am SOO grateful for the opportunity I have had to be involved with YouthLINC. I have become more aware of local and global issues. I have been able to meet a variety of people and learn from their example. I have been inspired to continue serving for the rest of my life. 
Youthlinc	72115		/users/profile/78853	carolyn	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	There are many organizations that provide service in far off places. Youthlinc does that, but that is just part of what they do. The international service they give is great, but really is a secondary goal of their main objection--"Creating long-long humanitarian." Once a young person is selected into the program, they have monthly meetings planning and preparing. They learn how to organize things and work as a team. Individually, they are required to give local volunteer hours to go on the international trip--anywhere from 60 - 100. Many of these incredible young people serve well beyond their required time.  While the international trips are about two weeks long, participating is about an 8-month commitment. It is an incredible learning, growing and service-oriented experience. 
Youthlinc	72013		/users/profile/78742	Britnie Powell	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	Youthlinc is a non-profit set out to create life-long humanitarians while impacting the lives of those who cannot change their circumstance on their own.  Youthlinc changes people and makes exponential differences in this world.  I have traveled with several humanitarian organizations and this is the one that I always finish KNOWING that I have made a difference and that I am a better person for having participated.  I go to bed with an exhausted body but a rejuvenated soul.  It truly is a one of kind organization! 
Youthlinc	72012		/users/profile/78741	estephens13	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	Youthlinc is a wonderful program that helps young people become lifetime volunteers.  They really helped me and gave me a wonderful experience in Peru, serving people and making friends!
Youthlinc	71872		/users/profile/78584	Kevin E.	Volunteer	5	02/20/2011	In 2008, the summer after I graduated high school, I went with YouthLinc to Santa Rosa, Peru, where we built a school, set up a medical and dental clinic, and taught health and hygiene classes. The experience was unforgettable. YouthLinc focuses on making personal connections within the community we served, so not only did we have the opportunity to see the huge needs that exist in other parts of the world, but also to learn from the values and examples of the local culture. YouthLinc also requires each volunteer to do extensive volunteer work in their own communities, helping us learn that there are always opportunities to serve meaningfully, whether at home or abroad. 
Youthlinc	71871		/users/profile/78583	youthlinc enthusiast	Volunteer	4	02/20/2011	Youthlinc is a great program because it shows youth that they can be involved in their communities and gives them opportunities to serve both locally and abroad. I have had a great time working with little kids and teaching them tennis which has really gotten me active in my neighborhood more and has given me a chance to get to know a lot of adorable kids. Youthlinc overall is just a really great experience. 
Youthlinc	69348		/users/profile/75781	iluvharry	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	Amazing. Youthlinc required local service and then allowed me to do international service at a price that I could afford. It instilled in me the importance of serving locally and making that a part of my life and going on the humanitarian trip opened my eyes and changed in me what is important in life. AMAZING.
Youthlinc	68654		/users/profile/75016	Teresa	Donor	5	02/15/2011	Simply put, Youthlinc is a stellar non-profit organization, and I will attempt to tell you why, though there is not enough space here to mention everything that makes this organization so great. I was introduced to Youthlinc several months ago when my 15-year old daughter's membership application was accepted and she was asked to join.  She is one of the youngest students of Youthlinc this year and will be participating in the service mission trip to Mexico this summer.  Within just a few short months, she was warmly welcomed with open arms by Youthlinc, and has gotten to know some wonderful fellow members.  She is already having a great humanitarian experience and thoroughly enjoys her local service work at the Real Life refugee center in Salt Lake City.  Having observed her sister's experience thus far, my 13-year old daughter is 'waiting in the wings' to apply to Youthlinc as soon as she is eligible. One of the best things that sets Youthlinc apart from other "youth service organizations" is the fact that there is the requirement for students to commit to completing a minimum number of LOCAL hours of community volunteer work, in order to be eligible to serve at an international site in the summer.  The exposure to both local and international community needs is a giant step toward Youthlinc's goal of creating LIFETIME HUMANITARIANS, something that few non-profits accomplish, and that more high school and college students should pursue. Through my daughter's involvement, I have become very fond of Youthlinc and have also gotten to know some of the Youthlinc staff and students.  Because of the heart-felt dedication and clearly established goals of this organization, I decided to become a member of their Annual Benefit Planning Committee.  Every person I've met at Youthlinc is nothing short of incredible and commited.  It is instantly obvious that they truly love what they do.  The Director/Founder, Judy Zone, is a contagious force of enthusiasm and passion, which funnels down to the office staff, the international team leaders, the alumni members, and of course the students and volunteers of this organization.  Judy and her small, dedicated staff truly keep this organization performing at top-notch levels and continually aim for success.   Having volunteered and worked with various other non-profits, I can tell you that Youthlinc is one of the "smartest", most well-run, well-supported and most dedicated organizations there is, that is committed to bettering both our youth AND the needs of local and international communities.  I strongly encourage all high school and college students and their parents to take a much closer look at Youthlinc.  You will be very impressed.
Youthlinc	67688		/users/profile/73983	beheshti	Volunteer	5	02/13/2011	If I didn't travel with YouthLinc to Kenya in 2009 (and again in 2010, because I fell so in love with the experience) I would not be the person I am today. It changed my life. Not only does the 'field work' that YouthLinc does (health seminars, primary and secondary education, microfinance loans, building classrooms - all in developing countries) impact communities in the most sustainable, empowering of ways, but above all else, it makes the deepest change in the most important place of all: the hearts of the volunteers. What is perhaps the most important aspect of humanitarianism is the change that occurs in the heart and drive of the volunteer - how their act of kindness creates a lifetime humanitarian, how their act of kindness changes not only the Kenyan or Cambodian or Mexican child's life, but the YouthLinc participant's life. YouthLinc doesn't just save the life of the impoverished child - it saves the life of the volunteer.  I was a volunteer on the 2009 Kenya trip, and then upon my incredible experience working with primary and secondary school students in the classrooms, building a library onto a local school, holding health seminars for local women, and distributing microfinance loans, I was a changed person. I was the Alumni Leader of the 2010 Kenya team, and returned with an even bigger heart, brighter smile, and eager passion to help the world I live in. I applied to completely different colleges, researched completely different majors. I now attend Seattle University and study International Economic Development and International Studies. I'm pursuing a career in Microfinance or Human Rights Law. I know what's important now.  I'm also traveling to China this summer for two months through Harvard University's WorldTeach program to teach English in the Hunan Province. Had I not worked with YouthLinc, how would I know to channel my time, research, expenses, and energy to programs like these? Programs that help not just the children in need, but help me grow into the person I want to become - compassionate, informed, motivated, and eager to help. YouthLinc has altogether changed my life for the absolute better. They couldn't get a higher endorsement from me, and I can't thank them enough!

The fact this group requires you to contribute to your own community before reaching out globally helped plant a seed in her that service is needed everywhere! We are going to be life long volunteers with YouthLinc!
Youthlinc	67659		/users/profile/73946	Liz Smith	Volunteer	5	02/13/2011	Youthlinc is an absolutely fabulous nonprofit that successfully instills a love for humanitarianism amongst Utah's youth. 
Youthlinc	67626		/users/profile/73907	Debbie Matheson	Donor	5	02/13/2011	Youthlinc provides great humantarian service opportunites for youth and adults.  They encourage service in our community as well as in other countries.  Humanitarian service trips are available in many parts of the world.  This is a great opportunity to mold our youth and to help them develop care and concern for the less fortunate in our world and to give back to others when they are blessed with so much. 
Youthlinc	67579		/users/profile/73861	creede	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2011	THe work that youthlinc is doing is amazing.  It's great to see NPO like them making a difference.
Youthlinc	67505		/users/profile/73784	Amy O.	General Member of the Public	5	02/13/2011	My daughter Jessica, who is 16, chose this organization after carefully researching all of the non-profits in our area.  Youthlinc is creating life long humanitarians through their program.   Youthlinc implements a program that gives me great hope for the future.   The monthly meetings have great purpose.  These children will easily lead and teach and serve our communities of tomorrow.  
Youthlinc	67467		/users/profile/73741	Erin O.	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	Youthlinc is an amazing organization. Their philosophy is one that is truly remarkable, to create lifetime humanitarians. Through their program students are required to do local service hours in order for them to create bonds with their communities. all in all it is awesome. 
Youthlinc	67449		/users/profile/73720	Montana F.	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	I am a volunteer for Youthlinc, a non-profit organization that works to create life long humanitarians for young adults. We do service in our own communities before travelling to an international site and giving our service there. I have been volunteering with disabled adults in my community, and later in the year I am going to Baustista Grande, Mexico to help build a kitchen for their school.
Youthlinc	67379		/users/profile/73645	Megan H.	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	Youthlinc is an amazing organization and it has helped me fall in love with doing service work! 
Youthlinc	67188		/users/profile/73431	kmp18	Donor	5	02/11/2011	Great organization, developing young people to be lifetime humanitarians.  My son was involved with Youthlinc, and we are now ardent supporters.  He earned his scholarship for a trip to Peru by volunteering with a local organization mentoring elementary hispanic students.  He then went to Peru and was involved in construction projects, health education projects and youth mentoring.  His Youthlinc experience is an experience he will never forget, and has encouraged him to continue his volunteer work in the community.  Currently, he is volunteering at our local hospital, as he is considering a career in the medical field.
Youthlinc	67036		/users/profile/73265	Anna H.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I first volunteered with Youthlinc in 2002 on a trip to Kenya. It was one of the best experiences of my life and has forever changed the way I view the world. I would love to work with them again and if I ever move back to Utah it's the first thing on my list to look in to. Youthlinc gives their volunteers the opportunity not only to make a difference in other people's lives, but to meaningfully change our own lives for the better. 
Youthlinc	67029		/users/profile/73259	Meliss	Volunteer	4	02/11/2011	Working with YouthLINC last summer was one of the best experiences I've ever had! 
Youthlinc	67024		/users/profile/73252	Amy S.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I first got involved in Youthlinc in 2002, on the trip to Kenya. It is amazing to see how much the organization has grown over the years. When I moved back to Utah in 2010, I just had to be involved again. Youthlinc is an amazing program aimed at creating lifetime humanitarians, and I think they have definitely succeeded.
Youthlinc	66955		/users/profile/73182	McKay M.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	youthlinc is such an amazing program. I was involved with it in 2009 when I went on a humanitarian. trip to Kenya, it was life changing. The process that youthlinc has is incredible. They don't just send youth over seas on humanitarian trips, they get them involved in the community first. They get them serving in their own back yard, and that is one of the things that I love so much about youthlinc. I love them so much that now I have come back and I am the alum leader for the Thailand team. It is amazing to see the youth that are involved grow as people, because they really do. Love youthlinc!
Youthlinc	66947		/users/profile/73171	Julia W.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I Volunteered with Youthlinc in 2010 and it was the one of the best experiences of my life.  I was a mentor to the Thailand team and I watched the students accomplish amazing acts of service and leadership throughout that program year.  The Youthinc program offers a unique and important mixture of local and international service that anyone with any level of passion for service can appreciate.  It allows students to claim ownership in their community and encourages leadership. This program could probably turn a selfish person into a lifelong humanitarian.  Its in fun and fulfilling to work with this organization.  
Youthlinc	66923		/users/profile/73144	Shauna H.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	Fabulous organization! My daughter is headed to Cambodia this year for 17 days of service. The best part is she has to do 80 hours of service in our local community to meet the requirements to go. She is learning early what a difference serving makes in your life! As a result, she will learn to serve and give back for the rest of her life. She is also learning how to organize her time and the strengths that she has to share with the team she will be serving with. You don't just pay your money and show up. You have to be extremely committed and willing to do your part to make this trip successful
Youthlinc	66919		/users/profile/73140	tejae	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I have been involved with many non-profit organizations over the years and have gone on several service missions. This group impresses me as it gets corporations and Rotary to sponser kids to do 100 service hours in exchange for a scholarship to help them pay for part of a trip to do a service mission experience in several other countries. I like that they teach teens how to serve not only in 3rd world countries but how to serve in their own communities. Very impressive organization.
Youthlinc	66894		/users/profile/73112	Kelsey_babe27	General Member of the Public	4	02/11/2011	This organization is wonderful.  It provides youth with the experience of witnessing the lifestyle of others around the world.  It allows the youth who participate to help out those who are less fortunate while learning about other cultures and beliefs.  
Youthlinc	66846		/users/profile/73058	Rhonda P.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	Youthlinc has a wonderful reputation.  Their goal to create "life time humanitiarians" is the best.  We highly recommend them for your youth program of choice.  
Youthlinc	66833		/users/profile/73045	doug	Donor	5	02/11/2011	There are many groups who travel around the world performing wonderful acts of service to those in need.What sets Youthlinc apart is the requirement for service on the home front. Being able to build a school in Kenya, or help with sanitation needs in Peru is generally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Becoming service-minded and working to address the needs around you is where a lifetime of change can occur.Youthlinc works to open the minds of young men and women to the service possibilities all around them. It also encourages these wonderful youth to stretch and grow and see what they can do to truly affect change.
Youthlinc	66740		/users/profile/72946	kka66	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I learned about YouthLINC at the 2007 Rotary International Convention in Salt Lake City and thought it would be a good fit for my Rotary Club in Rochester, MN.  The Board agreed and I had the priviledge of being part of the first YouthLINC MN team in 2007/2008, doing local community service as well as service work in Kiamuri, Kenya.  It was an amazing experience!  We are now working with our fourth team from MN; this year they will travel to Bautista Grande, MX with the Utah team.  The relationship with YouthLINC has been fantastic - everyone there is amazing to work with and they're allowing our students and mentors to have an experience that otherwise is not available in our state.  Kudos to YouthLINC - you guys ROCK! 
Youthlinc	66732		/users/profile/72939	Sandy G.	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	This is a great organization that teaches our children in the USA to be more giving to each other, to those in the community and open minded to those from other countries!!!  Wonderful organization for our youth!
Youthlinc	66632		/users/profile/72827	Jaclyn B.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	Youthlinc is such an amazing program! I am going with one of their teams to Kenya this summer and I know it will be a blast! The people who run it all are amazing!
Youthlinc	66626		/users/profile/72822	Annalisa B.	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	This program is a very outgoing, fun, and dedicated organization. It is connecting us volunteers/participants to local agencies with needs for services. Doing local service also gets us a sponsorship amount towards the costs of our trips, which is very beneficial. I think this local service will further give us appreciation for the international service we will do in the summer. We do monthly meetings and the time is flying by as we prepare in 5 separate committees--education, cultural, medical, vocational/micro-financing, and construction. Youthlinc takes a fairly comprehensive approach in planning for the summer international experiences so that we can be more effective in our short time-period internationally. Those involved in Youthlinc must go through an application process, so that those who are in the program, are dedicated, outgoing, and hard-working.  Overall I am very pleased with my experience with Youthlinc so far and am anticipating the summer international service we will be doing to connect our local service growth to international service.
Youthlinc	66584		/users/profile/72779	l0v3	Volunteer	4	02/10/2011	YouthLinc really does create life long humanitarians. It mixes local and international service. YouthLinc gives young adults the opportunity to travel and experience life in a positive and fun way. The organization changes the lives of everyone involved. It was a great learning process for me and i met beautiful people here and around the world.  
Youthlinc	66500		/users/profile/72683	Stephanie W.	Volunteer	5	02/10/2011	YouthLINC is such a well organized program for both high school and college students. The young adults are in charge of the lessons they teach and I think that made the trip more meaningful to me. I spent months planning and preparing to teach CPR in Spanish, so it was fun to finally present to the villagers. All the kids in my group were amazing and the leaders were really fun. I loved my service site and the YouthLINC experiance.
Youthlinc	66487		/users/profile/72670	Judy Z.	Board Member	5	02/10/2011	Youthlinc allows young people to have meaningful local and international service experiences that will impact them for a lifetime. It creates a culture of service that amazes me every single day. It's a gift for me to be associated with hundreds of youth and mentoring professionals who care so much about others in need. I'm a better person for being around such positive energy, creativity, compassion, and determination to make this world a better place. 
Youthlinc	49003	4	/users/profile/50250	kylermcgee	Former Volunteer	5	07/31/2010	Youthlinc is the most amazing organization out there. I am so grateful to have been a part of it. There focus on making you lifetime humanitarians truly changed my life. I was able to complete 100 hours of community service at the Sandy Boys and Girls Club of America, where I worked with Kids less privileged. Upon completing my 100 hours of service, I received a $1,000 sponsorship towards the cost of my trip. I was able to travel to the most amazing place in the world, Kiamuri, Kenya, and work with the people there. It was a cool experience for me, because you are part of the people for 2 weeks. Its not some tourist site. You are part of the village for 2 weeks, sleeping where they sleep, eating what they eat, helping them out in their schools, building classrooms and, and much more. The village accepts you as their own. I have never met more loving people in my life. Its because of Youthlinc that my life has been changed in so many ways. Thank you Youthlinc. I would also recommend this program to EVERYONE! I can only imagine the impact it would have on the world if it was a national program.
Youthlinc	11894	20	/users/profile/13856	janettec	Volunteer	5	10/03/2009	Youth linc is a phenomenal organization! I am thoroughly impressed with its efforts to go beyond providing service to less fortunate third world countries, but also "creating lifetime humanitarians" and doing service locally as well. I do beleive that privileged people are given the responsibility of reaching out and providing for those who are not as privileged and are in diar need of help. I also agree with youthlinc's stance that even in this industrial country, there are people in need, and I love that youth linc teaches their youth volunteers to help those in their own communities before helping people abroad. It is wonderful to provide huge releif to impoverished people in hurting countries, but it is magnificent to teach the future ruling generation of this country the habbit of helping their neighbors and instilling in them the permanent desire to serve those all around them. Bringing a warm meal to an ill neighbor may not make headline news, but it may mean the world to that ill person; it is little quiet acts of service like this that truly help a community to work together and feel that they are a part of something greater than themselves. I am astoundingly impressed with youthlinc's efforts to provide service from the largest to the smallest scale, especially because they do it by means of teaching the value of service to youth. This is truly a selfless, exemplary organization.
Youthlinc	11880	21	/users/profile/13843	Pamalestu	Volunteer	5	10/03/2009	YouthLinc is a great organization because it gives th oportunity to young students (high school and college) and adults to do volunteer work.  Students do not only serve their own community locally but also international.  In addition, they learn leadership each one with its role in and out of country.  Adults are able to mentor the students giving them the tasks to perform when in the community site and showing them the best way to do it.
Youthlinc	11783	20	/users/profile/13732	monique	General Member of the Public	5	10/02/2009	YouthLinc has found a way to make an extraordinary marriage between service within a community and service abroad.  They have integrated this profound approach of humanitarian work and service into the lives of youth in an effort to create lifelong humanitarians.  I find this to be a unique and incredible organization for those reasons, I have worked with countless non profits and none of them have been able to successfully improve the lives of youth, those in need in our community, and those suffering in third world countries all at the same time.  Their method is beyond impressive and extremely successful.  I truly believe they just might be the best non profit organization I have ever encountered.
Youthlinc	11717	20	/users/profile/13652	alohagene	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	I have been associated with YouthLINC since its inception and have been supportive with all of its efforts.  Last June (2009), my wife and I went with a group of 25 young people on a YouthLINC Team to Thailand to work with an orphanage, several elementary schools, numerous communities and other projects.  The bottom line is that YouthLINC develps Humanitarins of the future.  Each one of these young people worked hard and with a focus of Service. As a Past District Governor of Rotary International for the State of Utah, I believe in the purpose and the success of this organization.
Youthlinc	11705	20	/users/profile/13641	Ryan Margetts	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	I served in Kenya in 2006 through the YouthLINC program.  It was an experience that not only changed, but completely shaped and molded my life.  I learned so much more than culture and service.  YouthLINC requires its participants to serve a minimum 100 hours of community service prior to departure to the site.  This provides an opportunity to remind us that service and humanitarian efforts are not limited to 3rd world countries...everyone around us needs help in some form.  YouthLINC helps selfless individuals realize just how much of a difference they can make whether it be in Michigan or Meru, Kenya.  I am indebted to YouthLINC for the experience it gave me.  I fully support and am dedicated to this program.
Youthlinc	11699	11	/users/profile/13636	sjuchau	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	My experience with YouthLINC was incredible! My service in Peru definitely made a huge impact on the way I see the world and the people around me, and my required 80 local service hours have made me a life long humanitarian. Thanks to the habits and the experiences I had while working with YouthLINC, I have been changed forever, for the better.
Youthlinc	11696	11	/users/profile/13633	Shontol	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	I worked with YouthLINC for one year during the 2007-2008 Academic year. I was on the Peru Team and worked on developing programming aimed at providing health education. Topics included First Aide, female reproductive heatlh, stress managment, and lifting safety. I volunteered at a local elementary school prior to traveling interntionally where I mentored third-graders. The service component both locally and internationally is what makes this organization so great. Providing an opporutnity for youth to become engaged in their community and make a difference in the world. While we prepared and met regularly it was hard to get everything done prior to traveling abroad. Yet, this is a challenge of many non-profit organizations.
Youthlinc	11694	11	/users/profile/13631	nicoleaw	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	YouthLinc has completely changed my outlook on service. Before I was involved with them, I was pretty active in volunteering, but I never realized how much of a difference I was really making. This is such an amazing program that allows youth to experience, understand, and serve others in need. I was able to participate in a service trip with this group in 2008 and it was such a life changing experience. Our group worked so well together and we were able to complete even more projects than planned.
Youthlinc	11692	10	/users/profile/13628	Dr. Mike	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2009	I served both as a dental professional and a mentor for the young adults volunteering for this humanitarian experience.  Along with providing basic dental and surgical treatments, time was also dedicated toward both adult and child oral and systemic health.  I led a team of young adults interested in the dental field that served as assistants and educators of oral hygiene.  Mentoring the students was an important and extremely satisfying component of the experience
Youthlinc	11687	3	/users/profile/13624	sunshine	General Member of the Public	3	10/01/2009	Our daughter served YouthLinc in Kenya summer 2008. She designed a micro finace program to share with the women in Kenya. She absolutely loved her experience. She is now serving in the Peace Corps in Paraguay.As a parent I felt the cost for the time there was extremely expensive to be paid for by the person. I also felt that some of the organizational details were not as detailed for a group going off to work as volunteers by themselves. YouthLinc has great aspirations and want to do good in many places. They have new ideas they want to incorporate and it may be too many at once without much experience.
Youthlinc	11685	3	/users/profile/13621	halleberryex	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	Youthlinc changed my life immeasurably!  There is not a single day that passes that I don't think of my experiences that were given to me through my service expedition.  I show up 110% in my life and honor everyone in their magnificence because of the lessons I have learned by and through Youthlinc.  What a huge impact this made on my life.  (Not to mention the lives that I was able to connect with in Africa)Youthlinc does more than teaches kids to give service and become connected with their community.  They provide an atmosphere that allows everyone to flourish. Giving back to man kind and showing people how to open their hearts and share everything you have in this lifetime.  It's truly a remarkable program.  Thank you Thank you thank you for being a part of my life a higher entity brought us together.  For you have shaped the path I now take in life.  For that I am forever grateful.
Youthlinc	11682	4	/users/profile/13617	kate	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	The International Leadership School at East High School is a new program for 2009-2010, with the goal of preparing students to lead and serve in a global community. We believe that students learn leadership by serving others and we looked for an organization to partner.  We wanted to provide our students with a local service experience that could lead to an international service experience. The philosophy of the YouthLINC program was a perfect fit and we are pleased to have partnered with YouthLINC.  The YouthLINC program has generated a real excitement for service among our students.  I look forward to serving as a YouthLINC mentor in the summer of 2010 because it is a program I really believe in.
Youthlinc	11679	4	/users/profile/13615	marissafloodman	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	My experience with YouthLinc took me to the Amazon River in Santa Rosa, Peru, 2008.  I have never met so many amazing people more than I did on that trip, the villagers have touched my life forever.  It was amazing to see people  with so little, give so much.  Nothing made the kids smile more than when they gave you a present that they made, or shared something of theirs with you.  It was also great for me to see my hard work paid off: the painted medical center was being used, and the mixing and laying of cement allowed sidewalk so that kids did not have to walk barefoot in bacteria-infested mud to school.  Not only did we work hard, but YouthLinc gave us the opportunity to explore the foreign land of the Amazon as well.  For two weeks I explored the jungle, floated down the Amazon, helped those in need, and saw what poverty really is.  I know I will go back to the Amazon, I miss the people, the smells, and the sights so much!
Youthlinc	11677	4	/users/profile/13612	Brittanywells	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	Just like hundreds of other kids, YouthLINC has changed my life. This organization gave me a passion for service! I believe it's always been within me to be outgoing, understanding, and driven, but my trip to Peru in 2003 gave my innate characteristics a reason and a meaning! We went on this excursion with the intentions of bettering the living and educational situation of the people in Yanamono, but the best changes happened within myself. I realized how fortunate I am and am determined to give back to mankind. I have made my career choice based on the experiences I had with YouthLINC. I will forever be grateful to YouthLINC for the person I have become.
Youthlinc	11674	4	/users/profile/13610	waylo13	Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	I went to Kenya the summer of 2008. It was an experience that changed my perspective not only on the world, but myself. Youthlinc may only be a two-week trip, and yes, we may not accomplish very much. But what is accomplished is a foundation in young people's lives to serve. I have always loved doing community service but have rarely looked beyond my own community. Youthlinc opened my eyes to look beyond and to not be afraid to change the world. I learned that as an individual I still can make a difference, as a student I can teach, as a woman I can show other women to be strong, as an american citizen I can improve lives. Youthlinc gave me the chance to realize my potential-something I will always be grateful for.

Youthlinc	11669	7	/users/profile/13606	monsonwave	Former Volunteer	5	10/01/2009	YouthLINC is dedicated to not only aiding underserved international communities and building lasting relationships, but also to develop lifelong humanitarians who will continue to change the world.  I have participated with YL in Mexico for the past two years and have loved the experiences that I had.  It was eye opening to be exposed to the issues that international communities may have, but more beneficial to understand that every little bit helps and as youth pulling together we can truly make a difference.
Youthlinc	11658	7	/users/profile/13596	ashley44	Former Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	my experience with youthlinc was amazing! it was soemthing that changed my life and the experiences from it will stay with me forever. i went with youthlinc to peru this summer and learned to love the people of peru. it's amazing that people with so little can still be genunily happy. i also learned from youthlinc that i can make a difference, not only to the peruvians i served but also my community. i learned that service is a great way to go out and have fun.
Youthlinc	11655	13	/users/profile/13594	driggs1025	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I went on a humanitiarian trip with Youthlinc to Peru this summer.  It was by far the best trip of my life.  We, as a group, brightened so many people's lives in Peru.  I will never forget my experience.  It was very sad to leave all of my friends I met in Peru.  Even though the the people we helped were extremely poor, they still had a great attitude.  They were the happiest people I've ever met even though they have basically nothing.
Youthlinc	11653	4	/users/profile/13592	floodman	Client Served	5	09/30/2009	Our one time involvement with YouthLinc lasted from Aug 07 thru July 08 about once per month until our daughter left on her service mission orgainzed by YouthLinc. Our experience with YouthLinc was fulfilling and rewarding for us, and especially for our daughter Marissa.  We felt confident of YouthLinc providing adequate supervision and guidance to facilitate our teen-age daughter to travel to Peru and boat up the Amazon River to the village of Santa Rosa with school supplies, clothing donations, and to work on some building & pathway improvements in the village. In her quest to become a doctor, she saw first-hand the need for the "haves" to help the "have-nots." She returned home as a young woman with a differend perspective on life and how each human can have an effect on others.  The organization required that she raise all the funds herself (about $2,500) needed for the the service mission...teaching her the skills required to raise donations for worthy causes.  She solicited building supplies from local builders for some of the improvements and organized the sock donations to go with all the shoes that others collected.  Each youth took an extra bag full of clothing donations for the children of the village. She held an giant Anaconda on the Amazon, a huge trantula found in their barracks, and caught piranha with the village kids as they gathered water to drink direct from the Amazon River. The skills and memories she acquired will be beneficial throughout the rest of her life.
Youthlinc	11647	3	/users/profile/13591	j05	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I loved my experience with youth linc. I went to Thailand last summer and was very impressed with how organized the program was and how well every one worked together. It was an experience that will stay with me. Our team worked with teaching English classes at a school, medical classes, donations, and construction at an orphanage called home and life. Most of our time was spent at home and life where we got to interact with the children there and while we taught them some things I felt like they taught us more.
Youthlinc	11641	3	/users/profile/13581	RR	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I traveled to Thailand with YOUTHLINC this last summer as a volunteer, mentor, and translator. Having lived in Thailand before, I was impressed with YOUTHLINC's ability to find and reach out to communities that had a true and sincere need for help. YOUTHLINC's mobilization of students, volunteers, and supplies was very impressive as they were able to accomplish more than the locals ever expected. The students' work ethic was outstanding and a great example to the locals. Many local Thai people expressed to me the gratitude they felt for the assistance they received in their community. I had a wonderful and positive experience with the people involved with YOUTHLINC. Thanks to Dana Curtis and Judy Zone for extending to me an opportunity to participate with YOUTHLINC.
Youthlinc	11639	3	/users/profile/13579	Jim Clark	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2009	Top notch organization that directly involves young people one on one with people in other countries.  A fine organization, well run.
Youthlinc	11638	3	/users/profile/13582	sconger66@yahoo.com	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	Soon after I first met my wife...she went on a YouthLINC trip to Peru.  I wish I could have been involved in her experience.  She came back so inspired! YL has become a permanent fixture in my life as my wife is now the YL accountant.  We now have a beautiful daughter who I know will have her life changed by an YL experience.SConger
Youthlinc	11634	7	/users/profile/13577	MBC	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2009	I have had the wonderful opportunity to see this organization change lives first hand.  For the past two years my wife has been heavily involved working with Youthlinc as a volunteer, mentor, and employee.  I have seen the lives of the people they help change, the teenagers who participate mature into young humanitarians, and our local community benefit.Thank you Youthlinc - you definitely make a difference!
Youthlinc	11630	5	/users/profile/13580	Derick	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I went on a YouthLINC Alumni trip to the Amazon jungle of Peru.  As a Rotary Club member, our club has supported YouthLINC for the last six years, so I've heard many students report of their experiences. I decided to see just what they were doing.  Now I'll be a member of their Board.
Youthlinc	11626	9	/users/profile/13569	shuefner	Former Volunteer	4	09/30/2009	YouthLINC's idea of having people earn the opportunity to participate in a 2-week international humanitarian aid event by doing community service is great!  I spent a school year doing service for various organization in my community, to earn the opportunity to spend two weeks helping kids at a school for the deaf in Kenya.  It was a great experience.  YouthLINC has also organized other international service sites in Mexico, Peru, and Thailand, and I would encourage everyone how likes to make a difference to help others through YouthLINC.
Youthlinc	11625	9	/users/profile/13568	akay	Donor	5	09/30/2009	As a mother of 2 students who have participated in this group all I can say is WOW! The experience changed their lives in more ways than I could have ever imagined. The service they offered both locally and internationally touched their hearts and instilled in them a rich desire to continue to serve. More compassion, greater empathy and a love of all mankind was the result of their experience with Youthlinc. Kudos to Judy Zone for a well run organization that empowers kids to get involved.
Youthlinc	11623	6	/users/profile/13567	TukiTuki	Former Volunteer	3	09/30/2009	I participated 2007- 2008 in the first Thailand trip. Overall I had a great experience. I felt at times that it was unorganized and I had no idea what was happening. There were select few who were in the loop and the rest seemed to just drift along with it. I felt that I could have offered much more to making the trip a success if I were given the chance. Once in Thailand I was able to jump in more and be productive. I had a great experience with the people in Thailand and feel that we did make a difference and I hope that the program continues to grow. Maybe have to trip leaders to help organize people and make sure everyone is contributing as they can.
Youthlinc	11614	2	/users/profile/13558	ddkingut	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I participated in early meetings for a Kenya trip as a possible mentor, and was very impressed with the well organized nature of the program, as led by Judy Zone and Dana Curtis. As it turned out there were too many mentors and I was not able to attend, but my friend Catalina and her daughter Andrea did, and they returned with very good reports on how valuable an experience they and the students had, they saw a variety of social aspects and issues facing rural Kenyans today. The trip was well organized, and they were able to help build a school.  Youthlink is a top-notch organization.
Youthlinc	11603	2	/users/profile/13546	kiminutah	Donor	5	09/30/2009	My son was a participant in the Thailand experience.  It was a chance of a lifetime and he learned so much! He was able to go to the land devastsed by the tsunami and help the people and children.  This organization helps youth become global citizens who are compassionate future leaders, who will definitely make a difference in this world!
Youthlinc	11602	3	/users/profile/13545	lbf	Donor	4	09/30/2009	We had two of our daughters go to Africa with Youth Linc.  I think the hundred hours of service they were required to give at home was the best thing for them.  It helped them feel comfortable giving service.  I also think the meetings they attended in advance helped them both learn to love the people of Africa.  In fact our oldest daughter is now living in Botswana.  I'm not sure how much the short two weeks of service they gave in Kenya really helped the people there, but the experience was a blessing to my girls, and hopefully they will continue to make a difference in the world.
Youthlinc	11600	3	/users/profile/13543	APrazen	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	YouthLinc is a fabulous organization with a respectable vision. I know they have positively affected students lives and have given many students wonderful opportunities. I feel all the staff of YouthLinc truly care about the youth of today.
Youthlinc	11598	2	/users/profile/13541	lucam10	Volunteer	4	09/30/2009	youthlinc gave me a chance to experience life like I have never known.  I do not think that I would have been able to experience giving to such a small community in Kenya if I had not gone through Youthlinc.  I can say that I have been changed because of the experience and I will never forget the lessons that I learned.
Youthlinc	11590	2	/users/profile/13532	Jaimie	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	YouthLINC, I can honestly say changed my life. Their goal of creating lifetime humanitarians, is a high one at that, but its happening. I am involved in my community and look for ways to make the world a better place. I am slightly addicted to service asa result as well. I have learned important leadership skills and really learned what it means to care. Not just for my community but for everyone. People all need something and its up to you to find what they need and help them get it. It's an incredible program, bringing humanitarianism full circle.
Youthlinc	11576	2	/users/profile/13519	wanjiko	Former Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	My participation with YouthLINC was my first significant experience with volunteerism and international humanitarian work. It has inspired me to live with more compassion and awareness of the needs of my global community. I have learned to be less consumer-driven and more producer-driven in how I live my life. It's been over seven years since my last international service excursion with YouthLINC, and I still compare the price of everything I buy with the cost of education for a Kenyan child.
Youthlinc	11567	3	/users/profile/13511	Chela	Volunteer	4	09/30/2009	My experience with YouthLINC has two sides. I absoluetly loved the entire Thailand experience, but as for the at-home experience, it could have been better.When in Thailand our schedule was well planned and we had good amounts of down time after working so hard at the orphanage. I also appreciated our expedition leader and the fabulous job she did. She and Judy were always giving 110% when it came to helping us or those we were there to help.
Youthlinc	11563	2	/users/profile/13504	SFM	Donor	5	09/30/2009	Our local Rotary Club has been involved for years sponsoring youth in their humanitarian work locally and internationally.  We also have two daughters who have been participants.  It was a life-changing experience for them.  The local work that they do is at least as valuable as the international experience.
Youthlinc	11560	2	/users/profile/13501	bardywuf	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	My wife and I have been involved with YouthLinc for 5+ years and have seen and heard the many positive results from both the young people actually doing the work for the needy in our country and abroad but with those volunteering and raising funds for the programs.  Our hats are off to Judy Zone and her great staff!!Ron and Barb Stevens
Youthlinc	11558	2	/users/profile/13499	Gayle	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	As a volunteer, leader and mentor with Youth Linc in Piedras Negras, Mexico in 2003 I found this organization to really care about where they spent time helping internationally.  It has taught so many of us the real value of what is really important in life.  The students and volunteers in the program can never imagine this wonderful experience without participating in the program.
Youthlinc	11556	2	/users/profile/13497	bvpetersen	Donor	5	09/30/2009	I have worked with Judy over the years and haveseen the results of this program of creating "life long Humanitarians" I have seen the presentations of the adults and have heard their stories of some of the best experiences of the lives. However, the most exceptional results are realized in the youth.... as they have stated over and over " Youthlinc is truly a life changing experience"
Youthlinc	11552	3	/users/profile/13492	Brent Parkin	Donor	5	09/30/2009	Youth Linc gives young adults and youth the opportunity to provide local service with a goal to serve internationally.  This is a very worthwhile program and my daughter really enjoyed her experience.  I recommend all youth look into this opportunity.
Youthlinc	11548	3	/users/profile/13487	finnegan	Donor	5	09/30/2009	I heard so much about the good projects from YouthLINC. I would like to contibute my services inn health education and perhaps collaborate?
Youthlinc	11546	3	/users/profile/13485	dgardner	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2009	Youthlinc is a youth-oriented service organization with it's primary purpose to create life-long humanitarians. The local service the youth engage in is an excellent way to have them connect with their communities. The international experiences are incredibly life-changing. My daughter went to Kenya and Mexico with this group, and it has truly helped her become a more global citizen. I love the connection with Rotary as well! Many of my high school students have also been involved, so I have seen many lives changed because of this program! Very well organized as well!
Youthlinc	11542	7	/users/profile/13483	14	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I was appart of the 2008 YouthLinc Kenya trip! This summer i helped raise money to build a library there. I am looking forward to volunteering for YouthLinc this year.
Youthlinc	11531	8	/users/profile/13472	ldrnoyes	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2009	Very well run non profit designed to gine youth life changing humanitarian volunteer experince at home and in third world countries.  I was a volunteer physician on a trip to Africa and was most impressed with the dedication of the adult leaders and enthusiasm of the kids in helping change lives in rural Kenya.  The work at a deaf school is ongoing with many return trips helping this segment of the population in many untold ways.  This experience has layed the ground work for many of these youth to continue volunteer humanitarian work well into adulthood and for the rest of their lives.
Youthlinc	11527	7	/users/profile/13467	mylilshrek	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	A great organization with an even greater cause.  This experience was life changing for my daughter and has instilled in her a great love of doing community service no matter where she calls home.
Youthlinc	11523	7	/users/profile/13463	hun6de	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	Best service group I have ever been involved with.  The service learning locally coupled with international service, is an excellent way to make a lasting impact on communities in the US and in developing countries.
Youthlinc	11519	8	/users/profile/13457	Linda	Board Member	5	09/30/2009	I have been a board member and mentor for an international trip.  These are experiences that are life enriching and take individuals out of their usual element.  It is an opportunity to role model for the next generation and work with amazing young people.  There is a strong mission to create humanitarians for life and they really are successful in fulfilling their goal.
Youthlinc	11516	8	/users/profile/13454	Alison	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	YouthLINC has been an incredible part of my life for the past 3 years. Through this organization whose mission it is to create lifelong humanitarians, I have stretched myself beyond limits I ever knew existed within myself. I have grown as both a leader and a humanitarian. Through completing local service I began to recognize the great need for leadership and dependability within our own communities.  International service trips with YouthLINC have opened my eyes not just to international needs, but inner strength and devotion among the community members that has had a lasting impact on me. I know that through my affiliation and participation with the YouthLINC program, I have been equipped with the skills necessary to affect my community for the better, no matter where in the world I may be.
Youthlinc	11515	11	/users/profile/13453	Katie D.	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	The definition and mission statement of YouthLinc- "Creating humanitarians for life." I am living proof of this. Before I became introduced to this organization, I had always tried to make service a part of my life. It wasn't until I joined this amazing group that I truly came to love serving my fellow men. I was able to go to Thailand to dedicate 2 weeks of my life to serve the people of Thailand. But what is most amazing about this organization is not just the international service we do, but the dedication to serving those in our own communities as well. The required 80 hours of community service we do before we go on our trip taught me that service does not have to be some huge effort like traveling across the globe to help out victims of a devistating Tsunami. Serving food to the homeless, ringing the bell for the salvation army, and any small act of service you do truly builds character and makes you realize how truly blessed you are. It has changed my life for the better and I would recommend this organization to anyone and everyone! Thanks Youthlinc!
Youthlinc	11512	8	/users/profile/13450	thpslc	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I love YouthLINC!  My daughter went on the Peru trip and it changed her life.  She knows that service will always be a part of her life...and both of us are very happy about that!  The value to the community is immeasurable!  The international service experience in unbeatable!
Youthlinc	11511	8	/users/profile/13449	mccandless	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I was able to go to Peru through youthlinc when I was in my Junior year in High School. I was very fortunate. I was able to learn varius things that really build character and set a direction for life. One of the best parts about the program, is the commitment it has us make before going to our humanitarian project site. I had to give 80 hours of meaningful service to the community in the six months prior to the trip. This really was beneficial in for me to realize how much work needs to be done in our community. Also, I realized the importance of service to others through this community service. I was able to interact with children and help them in many different aspects of their lives. this was really rewarding. I also did not realize this until much later on. Also, the trip was amazing. I did not realize how easy it can be to love others in so short a period of time. THat is what service is about. Thanks to youthlinc I was fortunate to learn it young.
Youthlinc	11509	8	/users/profile/13447	kenya04	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I went to Kenya in 2004 with youthlinc and it changed my life.  The experiences locally were great, but once you arrived in Kenya, your entire world changes!
Youthlinc	11505	7	/users/profile/13444	kenya09	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I recently traveled with YouthLINC to Kenya and had an amazing experience. I never imagined myself in a third world country, and I'm grateful for YouthLINC because they gave me the opportunity to see how fortunate we are. Staying in the village of Kiamuri was the ultimate experience and I am so honored to have spent a week there. It's amazing how such a small toy can have such an impact on someone's life. Kenya will be forever in my life, thanks my pen pal from Kiamuri.
Youthlinc	11503	5	/users/profile/13442	1234abc	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	YouthLINC Is a wonderful Organization! One that is full of hard working people and it truly has changed my life forever. I know that many people want to serve and change the world but through YouthLINC I know that I am closer to reaching that goal. I have traveled with teams from YouthLINC and have met people that are much like me and have made life long friendships. YouthLINC has grown over the years that I have been involved and I can't wait to see where they grow. So many students from all across Utah and hopefully the nation can join in on this surge of Synergy! People are starting to see how important service is and hopefully someday it will become apart of everyone's lives, but I know that YouthLINC has helped me to see that.
Youthlinc	11501	4	/users/profile/13439	Allison19	Former Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	Prticipating in Youthlinc helped me see the world in a different perspective, and showed me that it really is possible to make a difference in it.  Youthlinc's goal is to create lifelong interest in service and it definitely has done this for me.
Youthlinc	11500	7	/users/profile/13438	sammi	General Member of the Public	5	09/30/2009	I have worked with and around through Youth Linc and our Rotary Club.  I also have worked with them at a leadership conference.  I have seen so many wonderful accomplishments and life changing developments of the adults and youth that have been involved with them in their projects.  All ages and communities are better for their efforts.  I would always support their efforts.
Youthlinc	11499	7	/users/profile/13437	yanamono-alum	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I participated in a service project in Peru. The work that went into setting up this project was amazing yet seamless for the participants. The YouthLinc staff put considerable effort into creating an rewarding and effective plan to improve the lives of villagers along the Amazon and changed my life forever. My group was the first to perform a service poject in the village. We built a secondary school, installed playground equipment, taught classes - both crafts and schoolroom, provided medical care and training, and provided clothing and supplies for the school.  Looking back on it, it was amazing all the of improvements we made in a few short weeks.  I believe we truly changed the lives of those villagers through our improvements.  An amazing way to provide service yet fun, fun, fun.Don't know how YouthLinc does it but they are amazing!
Youthlinc	11497	7	/users/profile/13435	Badger	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I traveled with Youthlinc to Kenya in 2002. It was one of the best experiences of my life and has truly inspired my continuing service efforts. I honestly do not go a day without reflecting on my community service hours and service abroad I had with youthlinc and the wonderful friends I made in the process. This organization helped my dreams come to reality and have helped make me a better person.
Youthlinc	11495	8	/users/profile/13434	Jenna	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	Youthlinc is dedicated to creating humanitarians for life.  Judy Zone is a sterling example and has influenced the lives of youth and adults alike.  Youthlinc is an amazing program!
Youthlinc	11492	8	/users/profile/13431	justkindness	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	My daughter has been forever influenced by her service trips with youthlinc as a highchool student and later as a mentor. I thoroughly enjoyed being able to participate in a trip to Kenya. Youthlinc is an exceptional program for all who are involved in its mission to change the world.
Youthlinc	11480	3	/users/profile/13421	avehill	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	Youthlinc is AMAZING!  I enjoyed service before, but my experience with Youthlinc really just got me hooked.  The organization is well thought out and the projects that youth do are both meaningful and an excellent learning opportunity.
Youthlinc	11475	7	/users/profile/13416	Scott Leckman	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	This organization turns young people into service minded humantarians. It is unlike any organization that I know. It changes the lives of not just the served in countries all over the world but changes the lives of the youth doing the service. The thank you letters I get from the students I have helped support in their desire to make a difference has showed me that this is a life changing organization.
Youthlinc	11473	7	/users/profile/13414	wbell23	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I was involved with YouthLINC several summers and it was such an amazing experience!! It helped me get out my comfort zone and experience life in a whole new way!
Youthlinc	11472	7	/users/profile/13413	sarachinn	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I traveled with YouthLinc to Kenya in 2002 and it was an opportunity that I will never regret taking and an experience I will never forget.  I appreciated that we were required to do service in our local areas first in order to receive a partial scholarship toward the service experience in Africa. I met great people, I learned a lot about the culture, and I still use the things I learned to share with others.  Serving locally and internationally within the same year helped me understand the variety of needs that are in the world and that there are so many different ways we can serve our fellow man, even if it seems a small thing.
Youthlinc	11452	5	/users/profile/13394	vardm	Former Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I participated in the Youthlinc trip to Mexico this past summer as a volunteer mentor.  I was very impressed with the way Youthlinc motivates youth to get involved in service--both locally and internationally.  This creates 'life-time humanitarians', contributes to our local community, exposes youth to diverse populations, and fosters cultural sensitivity, all in the context of service.  I would highly recommend getting involved with Youthlinc.
Youthlinc	11449	7	/users/profile/13391	ritamcneil714	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	As I went through the daily life in the impoverished town of Ocotlan, Mexico, I realized the importance of service all over the world. Something I noticed about YouthLINC is that it isn't the type of service that once you leave the service site, everything goes away. We helped the people build a foundation for their lives that will continue to affect them and the ones after them. Not only that, but the local service required for the international service changed me as a person and I realized how much help is needed right outside the door of my home. The program is extremely organized and all the mentors and leaders are constantly in contact with you. You are in collaboration with an amazing group of individuals who have a passion for helping people. You can be in this program and spend virtually no money. There are so many generous people that are willing to donate to make an international experience possible. YouthLINC has given me means to be a life long humanitarian which I absolutely plan to do. Thank you so much for the experience of a lifetime!!
Youthlinc	11432	8	/users/profile/13377	ajackson	Volunteer	4	09/29/2009	I have been with YouthLINC on two trips, both times to Peru. My second trip was a part of my Thesis research for Cultural Anthropology. YouthLINC was a case-study for a broader, critical, investigation into the relationship between non-profit groups and the communities they visit. Specifically focusing on the water treatment systems YouthLINC supported in two communities, I found that YouthLINC is an incredibly culturally-sensitive organization, with very thorough and well thought out programs. The water systems and the education programs were helpful, sustainable, as well as community-driven. Over the span of my research (4 years) YouthLINC had instigated profound change in the communities they helped. The communities were able to sustain that change, and saw results. The individuals who participated in YouthLINC were not only volunteering as a part of another Eco-tourism trip, or exotic volunteering. All volunteers had significant volunteering experience within their own communities in the U.S. prior to the trip, something YouthLINC requires. YouthLINC continues to adapt their practices to better serve the communities and their volunteers. As an organization, they are aware of the issues that go along with international service. Their program is not one that pushes a biased agenda, they work to provide aid based on each community's needs and wants. YouthLINC, like any non-profit involved in international service, can always work to create a more sustainable and culturally sensitive program, but through my research I see YouthLINC as an organization that seeks and welcomes growth, an attribut that will help them to learn and continue to improve.I value my experience with YouthLINC, and through my time with them I know that they have achieved their goal by creating a "lifelong humanitarian" in me.
Youthlinc	11414	7	/users/profile/13360	tawnyreagan	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	I worked with YouthLINK my senior year of high school & traveled with them the following summer to Peru. Of all the experiences in my life, Youthlink was one of the most impacting and far reaching. It made me a more focused and dedicated student in school because I knew I was working towards a valuable goal. It opened my eyes even more than I expected to the cultures of our world and the effects of service to one another. Judy Zone is easily one of the most sincer, hardworking, inspired, dedicated, and caring leaders I've worked under. She has created such a balanced service program. The idea of working locally so we don't forget service can be done in our own towns, working with rotary to better understand the large humanitarian organizatins, and serving abroad on large scale projects that we've all prepaired and put together is a tour de force for teaching and strenghening our youth (and myself at that age.) My sister-in-law was involved later for a project in Kenya, and it too set her on a course of success in her life! The program instilled in me confidence, joy, and dedication in life.
Youthlinc	11398	7	/users/profile/13344	kathmasch	Former Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	I have traveled with Youthlinc three times and each experience taught me something new about myself and the need in the world for volunteers and organizations like YouthLINC.  I love that YouthLINC is creating life time humanitarians!  I'm a better person for having been a part of this amazing organization!
Youthlinc	11378	5	/users/profile/13322	messa	Volunteer	4	09/29/2009	YouthLinc was my first experience out of a country and my fitst time volunteering. I throughly enjoyed working with the people in the program as well as the other volunteers. I had worked with the staff a lot before going to Kenya and while in Kenya. It has defianetly brought me to be more of a humanitarian. I have since continued on to volunteer in China and other locations here in Salt Lake City. This program had some problems at the beggining with communication among volunteers but it gave us all a chance to show leadership and to take part instead of following.
Youthlinc	11352	7	/users/profile/13297	Lily Marsden	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	I participated in YouthLINC both as a student and as a student leader. The first summer I went on a trip I was to start medical school the following fall. YouthLINC had a huge impact on the type of medicine that I have decided to practice. My experiences in the Amazon pushed me towards pediatrics and infectious diseases in the hopes of working towards improving the increasing rates of death due to infectious causes in resource poor areas where effective treatments are unavailable. Though I commend YouthLINC for it's incredible projects in the third world, I do hope that as the program expands it will begin to offer it's services to the resource poor areas of the United States, which are as much in need of assistance as those countries that it currently serves. Thank you YouthLINC for enriching my life and introducing me to the changes that just one person can make in this world.
Youthlinc	11336	7	/users/profile/13282	BRKeith	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2009	My son participated with YouthLinc in 2006 on a project in Mexico to help build a school.  The project involved about 20 college age individuals, some spoke Spanish while others did not.  I was impressed that so many young people would volunteer their time and pay their own way to do something like that to help people they didn't even know.  People like them are what makes America so great. We are the most generous country and people in the world.  Way to go YouthLinc!
Youthlinc	11329	7	/users/profile/13272	cactus.smoocher	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	I have volunteerd with YouthLINC since I was 15 - 8 great years of being involved with an incredible organization. I think the best thing these guys do is get people involved locally! You really can't understand the whole picture of being a service-minded individual without understanding how that connects you to your own community. Add the educational experience of traveling abroad and seeing some of the most incredible things you'll ever see, and this program is the real deal.
Youthlinc	11318	5	/users/profile/13261	brl	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/29/2009	I went to Ocatlan Mexico as a professional mentor -- i am a social worker. I was able to provide consults to families there that had children with disabilities.  I learned so much about the wonderful Mexican culture.  It was difficult to see how the children's lives were affected by poverty in that they were unable to get many of the services that we take for granted in the US.  The Rotary group that sponsored us was so welcoming and helpful.
Youthlinc	11312	10	/users/profile/13243	service for life!	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	YOUTHLINC has made me a humanitarian for life!  I absolutely love everything about this organization and will continue serving locally and internationally!!! They do an amazing job!
Youthlinc	11310	9	/users/profile/13255	Angelfan	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	I had the privilege of helping Youthlinc organize clothing and other goods for transport to Peru where it would be distributed to the people there.  My wife also went with the group as a teacher mentor.  We were impressed with the groups organization and hard work.  The group leaders and other volunteers were pleasant and eager to help.  It was a great experience.
Youthlinc	11308	9	/users/profile/13252	butlerbrandee	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	YouthLINC is life changing!  I went on the first service trip to Kenya.  I was so moved and wanted so badly to return, I worked two jobs and saved for a year so I could go back.  YouthLINC opens your eyes to service opportunities you didn't know existed and to opportunities in your own backyard.  If YouthLINC participation was required for all youth, this world would be a very different place.
Youthlinc	11303	10	/users/profile/13247	HanahGillman	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	Youthlinc was an amazing and unique experience. Not only did I get the once in a lifetime experience to serve internationally, but I was able to serve locally also. This balance of local and intentional service is one thing that puts Youthlinc above the rest. At the age of 17 I was able to travel to Mexico in the Summer of 2006 and work at a school. It is an experience that has shaped my life in a phenomenal way.  I wouldn't trade this experience for anything!
Youthlinc	11299	9	/users/profile/13244	CourtneyW	Volunteer	5	09/29/2009	The opportunity to serve with Youthlinc was one of the greatest experiences I have ever had.  It has been a lifelong goal of mine to travel to Africa to live the culture and provide any help I could, and YouthLinc was the best way I could have reached this milestone.  I felt like such an important part of our team throughout that whole year, and I knew that I was making a difference. I was part of the microcredit team, and as such, I was required to create an outline for one of the business lessons we were to teach while in Africa.  Not only did we get to create those outlines, but it was incredibly fulfilling to talk to the Kenyan people upon arriving about their business plans and ideas for the future.  The counselors were all so encouraging and helpful, and I loved the whole atmosphere of the organization!
Youthlinc	11201	6	/users/profile/13142	tmg00	Volunteer	5	09/28/2009	Youthlinc provides a great opportunity for students to get involved and help their own communities.  They also get to help developing communities far away from their homes but not their hearts.
Youthlinc	11174	6	/users/profile/13115	lolo88	Volunteer	5	09/28/2009	YouthLinc is a great program that helped me realize how much of a difference I can make.  This program taught me how to serve those around me and to serve those abroad.  I will never forget my YouthLinc experience.
Youthlinc	11150	6	/users/profile/13093	kaitlindorius	Volunteer	5	09/28/2009	YouthLINC provides such a fulfilling and addicting service experience! With its focus on service not only abroad, but at home as well it really helped cement in my mind the need that is abundant everywhere, and while service abroad is more exotic, the need locally is just as pressing.  The service trip abroad was amazing. I was able to see a part of the world I might not otherwise have ever gotten the opportunity to see. For almost two entire weeks I got to know the people of this small village on a first-name basis. Although there was a language barrier, I was struck by how universal so many emotions are and you don't need a translator for that. YouthLINC enabled me to provide myself, through hard work and a dedication to the greater good, a wonderful and touching experience that I will never forget.
Youthlinc	11135	5	/users/profile/13075	miadexter	Donor	5	09/28/2009	I think this organization does a fantastic job capturing young people's desire for adventure and turning them into lifelong humanitarians.  I also love the link between local service and international service.  The integrity of the people involved with Youthlinc is right up there at the top of all organizations I've donated to.  I will continue to support Youthlinc!
Youthlinc	11119	10	/users/profile/13060	kenyavolunteer	Volunteer	5	09/28/2009	This organization is amazing! YouthLINC provided me with my first international-based volunteer experience and has since propelled me to continue with this kind of work. Thanks to YouthLINC I learned about the needs of my own community in Salt Lake City by volunteering regularly with a local children's museum and then saw the effects of volunteer work while in the village of Kiamuri, Kenya for two weeks over the summer. YouthLINC changed my personal awareness of what it means to care and love and showed me just how much I can do with my own life to help others.
Youthlinc	11113	9	/users/profile/13053	cgbechtold	Donor	5	09/28/2009	Our Rotary Club in Utah awarded scholarships to high school students in our service area so they could attend Youthlinc activities. We also participated in gathering shoes and other items for their target communities. The most rewarding thing for us was seeing the growth in the students we sent as they reviewed their experiences. This is a remarkable program for everyone involved. Win, Win, Win, straight down the line.
Youthlinc	11108	10	/users/profile/13047	tamsen	Volunteer	5	09/27/2009	Youthlinc is an incredible organization that sincerely works to change the world, one student at a time.  The actions of each member of the organization comes directly from the heart, thereby making Youthlinc's goals a reality.
Youthlinc	11103	10	/users/profile/13042	michechapman	Former Volunteer	5	09/27/2009	I have had many very positive experiences with YouthLINC in the last 8 years since I first got involved.  I have served as a mentor to the 2001 Kenya group from Utah and the 2009 Peru group from Massachusetts.  I have watched the lives and attitudes of my students change for the better as they learned to live in a more self-less way.  I have also seen, first-hand, the impact that these students make in their local communities and also in the villages abroad.
Youthlinc	11102	9	/users/profile/13041	spath27	Former Volunteer	5	09/27/2009	I first went to Kenya in 2007 to fit hearing aids at a deaf school.  I then became a leader and went to Thailand in 2008 to help an orphanage and school children affected by the tsunami.  YouthLINC has inspired me to always keep an open mind, embrace new cultures, and always give of my time.
Youthlinc	10889	14	/users/profile/12823	Lily R.	Volunteer	5	09/24/2009	I went to Peru in 2006 and my experience there influenced me in so many positive ways. The people of the village we served in were some of the happiest people I have met and they had practically nothing. I learned about the culture of these people; their beliefs, lifestyles, focuses, and traditions. Helping the people out in this community made me develop my own opinion on the importance of service. Prior to this trip, my mom emphasized the importance of serving and giving back to one's community, but it wasn't until my experience with Youthlinc that I realized the importance to me personally. I created life-long friendships with some of the people in the group, regardless of age, or where we may be living in the country. I'm still in touch with two of the villagers. There's not a day that goes by where I don't think of my experience and gratitude with Youthlinc.
Youthlinc	10887	9	/users/profile/12821	peru06	Former Volunteer	5	09/24/2009	To be completely honest, the enjoyment I got out of my YouthLINC experience was a complete surprise. I was pushed by a parent to apply for a spot, and looked forward to the prospective hours of suffering. The monthly planning meetings for the Peru trip were my first involvement in the project, and these quickly became fun as I made a number of new friends. I expected to have hours of horror stories for my friends from completing my local service. Again, I was pleasantly surprised when going to work at Shriner's Hospital became my favorite weekly event. Despite my good experiences, I was still unhappy leaving my normal life behind when the trip came around. As was the trend with YouthLINC, the experience surpassed my expectations in more ways than I ever could have expected. My experience helped me mature a great deal. I realized my unbearable level of selfishness, I found the compassion for humanity that I had lacked for so many years, and above all, I was free to rethink my position in life.
Youthlinc	10884	14	/users/profile/12816	dfishr11	Donor	5	09/24/2009	Our daughter went to Thailand last year and it was truly a life changing experience for her.  She developed a love of service doing her local service to qualify for her scholarship.  Then she was greatly moved by the opportunity to help the people of Thailand.  She has continued to give service after her return.
Youthlinc	10877	16	/users/profile/12810	teacherheart	Volunteer	5	09/24/2009	Between my two daughters they have traveled to Africa twice, Peru and Thailand with YouthLINC. Each of the trips have developed their character and compassion for helping other people in those countries. It has also extended their vision for service when they returned home. As a single parent I found that when both of my daughters got involved with YouthLINC in high school that it developed a maturity towards life that now has benefited both of them in their college and post-college lives. I would highly recommend the YouthLINC experience to any young person.
Youthlinc	10834	14	/users/profile/12759	precieuse	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	I was one of the first students to ever go on a YouthLinc expedition.  This organization has and always will be exactly what it is...organized.  There are so many experienced professionals looking out for the program and everyone involved; the volunteers and those they are serving.  It's not only a well-oiled machine, there is so much heart and soul to it as well.My life has been forever changed because of the experiences I had in Kenya in 2000.  Seeing how happy a people can be with so little, receiving true respect from those I was there to help, and etching in my heart a lifetime love for service.
Youthlinc	10833	9	/users/profile/12761	House Powell	Donor	5	09/23/2009	Youthlinc is a fantastic, one-of-a kind volunteer opportunity for young adults to contribute both locally in their communities and internationally in a foreign country.  I like how Youthlinc leverages the hours that a student volunteers locally to incentivize them to serve overseas.  Our son will never be the same because of his Youthlinc service.  Youthlinc builds dynamic and caring future leaders!
Youthlinc	10832	11	/users/profile/12757	Kandi89	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	YouthLINC is an amazing organization that allows students to serve their own community and one (or more) abroad. Students learn so much about themselves from serving others and from learning how other cultures live. My experiences with YouthLINC have stuck with me for years and will be a part of who I am forever.
Youthlinc	10827	11	/users/profile/12748	thedather	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	My experience with Youthlinc was amazing.  This organization works with young adults to mentor them in becoming life long humanitarians.  I had the fantastic opportunity to go to Africa on the 07 trip, as an adult mentor.  It change my thinking about the world and the people in it.  The people I met adults and children will be in my heart forever.  I saw the teenagers that went on the trip change from privileged kids to young adults with open hearts and minds.  It was a truly life changing experience.
Youthlinc	10826	11	/users/profile/12741	schil	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	I had an awesome experience with YouthLINC, I love the program and the people!!  I couldn't have asked for antyhing more!
Youthlinc	10820	7	/users/profile/12727	SLC1	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	Judy Zone, the heart of this organization, is absolutely passionate about "growing" young people who are committed to and have valuable experience with both local and international service.
Youthlinc	10807	7	/users/profile/12709	robin.marcus@hsc.utah.edu	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	My volunteer experience with YouthLINC has been perhaps one of my most memorable and meaningful of my life.  The opportunity to do both local community service and international service is one of the characteristics that makes YouthLINC unique.  Serving as a mentor, I was able to see first hand what a difference this year-long experience was able to make in the lives of our youth.  YouthLINC is a quality organization.
Youthlinc	10806	7	/users/profile/12707	andreacorwin	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	Youthlinc exposed me as a young highschool student to service in my community and in Mexico. Later I came back to serve as the alum leader to Kenya. The cultural exchange we got to experience with the kenyans was magical. I feel so blessed have been a part of such a special trip. Youthlinc is a unique organization the value of simple service to our communities locally and abroad is its whole purpose and heart.
Youthlinc	10804	7	/users/profile/12706	nancyk12	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	The greatest 3 summers of my life!  YouthLINC offered me a chance for a life altering experience in Kenya and I will never be the same.  Because of my association with the YouthLINC team leaders, students and service recipeints, I am a better person.  Thank you YouthLINC!
Youthlinc	10803	6	/users/profile/12705	julieb	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	YouthLINC has been an encredible experience for me, my daugher, and my Univeristy YouthLINC Chapter Club at UVU.  After participating a year ago with my daughter, we developed a club on our university campus and included and additional 8 students this year.  The experience was outstanding for all of us.  Just emagine having this humanitarian service expedition on your resume along with your degree credentials.  Each one of us could simply live this experience over.  And this is the altimate completment when there is little a person would want to go back in life and relive.
Youthlinc	10802	7	/users/profile/12702	Heidi	Donor	5	09/23/2009	Our family has been blessed many times over by our participation in the Youthlinc program.  Two of my children, my husband, and my father have all spent time preparing and serving in the Peru program.  Our younger children at home helped gather clothing and educational supplies to go in the luggage.  We are so grateful for the opportunity Youthlinc has provided for our family to look beyond ourselves to our local and world communities.
Youthlinc	10799	6	/users/profile/12700	pingle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/23/2009	As the trip leader to Mexico for 3 years, I had the opportunity to really experience Youthlinc. This is an amazing organization for so many reasons. 1. The participants are wonderful people with lots of energy who understand the work it takes to make service effective.2. The mentors who devote their time, energy and finances, to helping youth from Utah and from the international service sites3. The Rotarians, both in Utah and abroad, who work so diligently to make the experience a successful one. 4. The communities who open their hearts and their doors to us. The groups from Utah get as much or more than we bring. 5. The mission of Youthlinc goes beyond service to working with communities to help them to be self sustaining in their efforts. A lasting change. I am thankful for all the wonderful relationships and experiences I have had as a result of my time with them and highly recommend Youthlinc to others.
Youthlinc	10797	7	/users/profile/12699	landonderu	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	I have had the chance to work with Youthlinc seveal times.  My experiences have been outstanding.  In 2006 I traveled to Mexico with Youthlinc and spent some time there helping others in way I never could have imagined.  Youthlinc has helped me broaden my horizons and be more of a service-centered person.
Youthlinc	10794	6	/users/profile/12697	David	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	Youthlinc is a program that keeps students involved not only internationally but with their home communities.  This program has helped me build certain relationships and friendships that I will carry with me for life!
Youthlinc	10790	7	/users/profile/12695	clark	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	Youthlinc is an amazing program. Getting involved with youthlinc was probably the greatest thing i've ever done. Serving in my community and getting to serve in Peru changed my life and i'll never forget it. Thanks to YouthLINC
Youthlinc	10788	5	/users/profile/12694	nekberg	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	This is an amazing an life-changing program. I have been involved with it since high school 8 years ago and plan to stay involved.
Youthlinc	10786	5	/users/profile/12691	Erica	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	I went on a youthLINC mission to Thailand 2 years ago and I don't think a day goes by that I don't think about my experience there. The trip was awesome and the life lessons I learned were (and are) priceless.
Youthlinc	10785	5	/users/profile/12690	Nicki	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	As a young teenager I alway had the personal goal to serve internationally. I imagined myself as a college graduate finally being able to do. YouthLinc gave me that opportunity as a high school student and 17 year old girl and the expierence couldn't have been more choice. It completely changed my life. Serving those who need it most, not only in Peru, but in my community, softened my heart and created an insatiable desire to do more. Years since, I look back on my time in Peru as one of the greatest times of my life.
Youthlinc	10782	5	/users/profile/12688	mhw	General Member of the Public	5	09/23/2009	My daughter had the kind of experience I had always hoped to find for my children.  This organization combines local volunteer opportunities with international volunteer opportunities along with the support needed.  We loved it!
Youthlinc	10780	7	/users/profile/12685	Kara	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	The experiences I had in Kenya still influence my life to this day. It will always have a place in my heart. I continue to talk about it every opportunity I get!
Youthlinc	10774	6	/users/profile/12680	GPSMITH	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	I watched my son commit a year of local service before his trip to Kenya.  Even after the incredible international trip, he continues to serve his local community, as it has become a natural part of his life.  The trip to Kenya opened his eyes to the plight of humans just an airplane ride away.   He came back with incredible respect for the joy and hard work the Kenyans are known for, and a new definition of beauty.
Youthlinc	10771	7	/users/profile/12674	paule0417	Former Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	Youthlinc afforded my wife and daugther an opportunity to go and serve.  It changed our lives in a funadmental and visceral way.  It offers youth an opportunity to serve, look outsides themselves and to expand horizons beyond their bounds.  A wonderful organization.
Youthlinc	10738	8	/users/profile/12646	tait	Volunteer	4	09/23/2009	YouthLinc has made it possible for me to complete community service internationally.  They have created a fun and unique program that allows many students to get a once in a life time opportunity!
Youthlinc	10680	9	/users/profile/12573	henry	Donor	5	09/22/2009	I really like Youthlincs' philosophy of teaching youth to get involved and volunteer.The long term effects of getting students involved in helping others has long term benefits to both the local and world community. Sort of like teaching a man to fish rather than giving him a fish. This is a very special group.
Youthlinc	10671	8	/users/profile/12565	dreamynizing	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	Honestly, when I started, I had no idea what I was in for. I'm a regular local volunteer but I had never really considered anything global. I joined the Kenya trip in 2006 hoping to burst out of my bubble and gain new insights. I was not expecting much at all, but what I got out of it was beyond imagination. YouthLINC opened up a whole new world for me. Not only was I able to experience the lifestyle/hardships/limitations of living in a developing country, I was able to help teach and guide the new generation of that country to greater heights. But it wasn't me who changed them, it was them who changed me, dramatically. I learned how to look from the eyes of a different person, a deaf person, a mute person. Whoever it is, I learned to communicate in a more straightforward yet caring manner. YouthLINC has definitely helped shape who I am today. By all means, whatever I become, I will never ever forget YouthLINC. Whatever it takes, I'll travel with the group again. Did I make a difference? A dot here and there, yes. Is YouthLINC making a difference? You bet. It's a black hole.
Youthlinc	10644	9	/users/profile/12537	Ally D	Volunteer	5	09/21/2009	YouthLinc was the most amazing experience of my life! It started off my summer with a bang. The children were so  humble and friendly. I made so many friends! The people are beautiful and very hospitable. I will never forget Home and Life Orphanage and the schools we worked with. Humanitarianism is definitely a big part of my life from now on.
Youthlinc	10626	10	/users/profile/12519	Jennifer G.	Volunteer	5	09/21/2009	My husband and I were given the opportunity to be involved with Youthlinc through our Rotary Club.  This program is one of the best I have seen in creating life long humanitarians.  I was very impressed with the efforts the students made in having an impact in the lives of people in their own community as well as our world community.  We went to Piedres Negras and were deeply touched by the people we were able to help there.  We can't wait until our son is old enough to participate in a Youthlinc program!
Youthlinc	10624	7	/users/profile/12517	lisa	Volunteer	4	09/21/2009	I was able to go to Thailand to the village of Ban Talae Nok with a YouthLinc alumni group. We were able to interact with the villagers and teach dental hygene, personal hygene, share cultural and social experiences and financial accounting.  The villagers were very hospitable and I think they that we learned from them as they learned from us.
Youthlinc	10618	9	/users/profile/12510	kadams	Volunteer	5	09/21/2009	As a Rotarian, I was thrilled to learn about the YouthLINC opportunity for youth when I was attending the 2007 Rotary International convention in SLC.  YouthLINC's mission of 'creating lifetime humanitarians' aligns perfectly with the Rotary motto of 'service above self.' The Rotary Club of Rochester, Minnesota has partnered with YouthLINC for the past two years to include Minnesota students in the program, and is looking forward to continuing to do so long into the future.  I was fortunate to be an adult mentor to Kenya in 2008 and have nothing but high praise for the way this organization is run and the unrivaled opportunities it provides to youth, both locally and internationally.
Youthlinc	10609	14	/users/profile/12500	llarkin	Donor	5	09/21/2009	I am so impressed with what Youthlinc accomplishes.  They build future leaders by expecting responsibility in accomplishment thru service.   Desire to serve is essential at Youthlinc. A determined amount of service within their community before any young adult can travel to have the unusual experience of serving and working for those in need in a foreign country.  This is a Win Win Win approach for all involved. What an opportunity for our youth to grow into responsible caring adults.  Their program is awesome!!
Youthlinc	10564	10	/users/profile/12454	cmstratton	Volunteer	5	09/19/2009	I went on a YouthLinc Trip several years ago with my oldest son to Mexico. This trip was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. The time that I was able to spend with my son, and the other YouthLinc volunteers is priceless. Not only were we involved in a worthwhile humanitarian experience, the time spent bonding with my son was most rewarding. I would unequivocally endorse this trip to any parent to take with their child.
Youthlinc	10559	13	/users/profile/12447	bad dog	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2009	My daughter was a Youthlinc volunteer to Kenya in 2008. Overall, the program was well run and the focus on developing lifetime humantarians was well-conceived.  As parents we observed the positive impact of the program on our daughter's development, and have only positive comments on the program. Although the culmination of the project is a volunteer trip to a developing country, it is the day-to-day experience of volunteering locally, and the guidance provided by Youthlink staff and mentors during the formative months which is the most meaningful. I would highly recommend the program to young people of all ages.
Youthlinc	10554	14	/users/profile/12438	mary6547	General Member of the Public	5	09/19/2009	I am a parent to two Youthlinc participants.One daughter went to Yanamono, Peru and the other daughter went to Thailand this past summer.  Each has become more fully aware of the lives of others and has gained more insight as to the bounties we have here.  On both trips the girls were out of their comfort zone, both physically and emotionally.  In Peru, the team worked to complete a "schoolroom" as well as prepare an hour lesson and activity for the school children.  The school was completed and the children now have a room with a roof over their heads, and some rough shelves for books and benches to sit on.  The youthlinc group also learned much about the construction trade and about the people they live and worked with.     The group that went to Thailand did much the same, but different.  After an 18 hour flight and an attempt at rest in a foreign hotel, they were assigned a villager to live with and help.  This village had had been in the path of the Tsnumi that hit Thailand several years ago.  This village was quite close in promimity to Puequet, the resort area of Thailand, and most of the villagers make products to sell to the visitors.  The group also prepared educational lessons for them, and for those who needed it - computer skills were taught.  Once again, there was a language and cultural barrier that needed to be overcome.  Youthlinc provided the people with the skills and abilities to help the group be successful in their mission of service.  The knowledge and skills that each team member gained will be theirs forever.  Youthlinc provides a way to help those who want to do more than wish they could do something.
Youthlinc	10532	10	/users/profile/12419	segjessen	Volunteer	5	09/18/2009	I joined Youthlinc in 2005 to help out with computer issues. I became fascinated with their objectives and the obvious impact this organization has on young people. In the summer of 2006 my husband, son , and I went to Kenya on a humanitarian trip with Youthlinc. It was an amazing experience that changed our lives. The following year I went back with another son. Then I returned a third time in 2008. Youthlinc definitely turns young students and anybody who goes as a mentor into a life long humanitarian. The impact on the communities in the countries Youthlinc serves are as positively impacted by the service rendered as are the students and mentors rendering the service. The organization is well organized and runs very efficiently!
Youthlinc	10479	13	/users/profile/12357	Victor	Volunteer	5	09/17/2009	Youthlinc is and continues to be the leader in humanitarian work within my community in Meru, Kenya.I have watched it convert my late Dad into a one man humanitarian force and through its programmes bring hope and joy to the very needy ie Kaaga deaf school, Kiamuri and Huruma children's home.Viva youthlinc,through your efforts you are creating more humanitarians way across the Atlantic.
Youthlinc	10280	14	/users/profile/12147	Lindsay	Volunteer	4	09/12/2009	YouthLINC is an incredibly influential program that I feel blessed to have had experience with, and hope to continue to be involved with.  My year of service with YouthLINC was demanding and a period of growth.  The local service I participated in for the year before I went on an international service trip helped me to find a place in my local community that I loved to serve.  My international service experience in Yanamono, Peru, taught me about the bonds that are formed when serving with and for almost complete strangers that I have come to love.  YouthLINC has been an instrumental program in valuable growth that I have experienced, and the commitment that I have made to lifelong service.
Youthlinc	10058	17	/users/profile/11922	MikeandHeather	Volunteer	2	09/08/2009	This is tough to do because I truly feel that Judy Zone and Youthlinc ultimately want to make a positive impact on the world.  Unfortunately, this is supposed to be honest and candid.  I have had two experiences with Youthlinc and Judy Zone; both leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  The international service trip to Kenya, I was a part of, was incredibly unorganized.  I understand that trying to work out logistics with people half way across the world is a challenge, but this was ridiculous.  Time was wasted, there were detours to unnecessary rotary meet and greets, funding of shady characters, and promises not kept.  Myself and two other firefighters were excited to go help with the burn injury epidemic in Kenya.  Our focus was on prevention and care of burn injuries.  After raising a little over half of the required funds for our trips the trip was postponed to a time when the other two firefighters could not attend.  Unfortunate, but understandable due to the political strife.  Youthlinc and Judy decided to keep the deposits regardless of the decision being theirs. We were OK with this.  The problem was getting some of the donations back to the people that were sponsoring us.  In addition, the extra funds that were supposed to be allocated to future trips by members of our department were misappropriated.  Judy Zone appears to be blinded by money. And by that I mean, she cares so much about getting funds to her projects abroad, that she forgets about the people who raise money, and donate time and hard work.   We have done nothing but give and Judy has done nothing but take and act rudely.  I hope she takes a look back some day at why she started down the humanitarian path and begins to remember the people that make her organization work. Youthlinc will be that much better off.
Youthlinc	9973	12	/users/profile/11821	beaupalmer7	Volunteer	5	09/05/2009	YouthLINC is not a quick humanitarian fix.  It requires a year of local service near your home, monthly meetings with your team, and becoming service leaders BEFORE the exotic humanitarian work.  The beauty of the organization is exactly this.  The hard work and love of service gained is key to becoming a lifetime humanitarian.  Thanks YouthLINC!
Youthlinc	9874	14	/users/profile/11699	jacsprat	Volunteer	5	09/02/2009	My son went to Thailand with Youthlinc this past summer. He had the opportunity to work with the kids who had suffered great losses in the Tsunami. This experience was life changing event for him and I believe he will be a life long humanitarian because of it.  Youthlinc teaches kids how to do service both locally and internationally and they learn commitment and responsibility. Youthlinc is awesome!
Youthlinc	9843	11	/users/profile/11667	Becky	Former staff	5	09/02/2009	I worked with YouthLINC for ten years and I can say without a doubt that it brought me to the place that I am today, about to get a Masters in Sustainable Development.  It is an excellent organization that allows students to see the needs in their local community, experience another culture in an up-close and personal way, and give them leadership training during an entire year. It really meets its mission of building lifetime humanitarians.
Youthlinc	9835	8	/users/profile/11659	marisa.nicole	Volunteer	4	09/01/2009	I had the opportunity to be involved with youthLINC for the 2008-2009 year, and travel to Ocotlan, Mexico in June of 2009.  Initially, I was not even accepted into the program because of the large number of people who applied and not enough scholarships.  When I was accepted to go to Mexico though, I was absolutely thrilled! One of my favorite parts was being able to choose a local service site, (an assisted living center), and go there every week.  This helped prepare me and give me service opportunities before we actually traveled to Mexico.  When we did in-country service I was able to form a different perspective of the world and humanity in general.  I'm grateful for youthLINC, and the opportunities this program gave me.  I have been able to grow immensely, and have been just as excited about doing service after my Mexico trip because of the experiences I had.
Youthlinc	9814	8	/users/profile/11638	daniellepalmer	Volunteer	5	09/01/2009	I was privileged to mentor a team of 28 High School and College students during the 2008-2009 school year, and lead the trip to Kiamuri, Kenya.  Watching a young person's life change before your very eyes is awe inspiring.  My students learned the power that lies inside themselves by the 100 hours of local service that they each donated in our community.  During the 2 weeks we were in Kenya I watched perceptions change, attitudes mature, and most importantly, compassion for the global community grow.  These kids know what the world is like for so many billions of impoverished people throughout the world, and they know that through their efforts and service they can literally change the world.  I was humbled to be a part of this transformation.  The YouthLINC program is genius! They truly fulfill their mission of creating life long humanitarians.
Youthlinc	9803	7	/users/profile/11627	Beatriz	Former Volunteer	5	09/01/2009	I had the opportunity to be part of YouthLINC in 2002 and 2003. As a physical therapy student, I was able to help children and families of children with disabilities. If I still lived in Utah, I would continue to work and volunteer with YouthLINC. Judy Zone has done an amazing job of providing life-changing and meaningful volunteer experiences to hundreds (thousands?) of people, young and old. The monthly meetings created a cohesive team ready to work together. Adult mentors and professionals provided guidance and leadership. YouthLINC also stresses the importance of building partnerships in the communities to which it travels so that all parties involved are equally committed to the projects. YouthLINC focuses not just on giving generously but on teaching those in need how to better their lives and giving them the tools to continue the work once YouthLINC has gone. Traveling to Mexico with YouthLINC has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life.
Youthlinc	9778	5	/users/profile/11598	lamsden	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/31/2009	As a member of a local Rotary Club in Thailand, I have had the opportunity to work with YouthLINK on several community service projects.  I have been inspired by their enthusiasm and professionalism in helping rebuild schools and orphanages, and in conducting community based health and hygine programs.  Their mission of "creating lifetime humanitarians" truely seems to be working, not only among their volunteers, but also the communities they help.
Youthlinc	9745	5	/users/profile/11565	wooohooo	Former Volunteer	4	08/29/2009	Youthlinc helped me more than I ever thought it would.  After my local service was done and especially after my international trip was over I truly understood the importance of helping others.  Its the greatest gift you can give and Youthlinc helped me to see that.  My entire experience was nothing short of great.  The people I met, relationships that were built, and fun times I had were something that will be carried with me the rest of my life.  The program was a lot of work but was totally worth it because, hey were all young adults if not adults and so there was a lot of responsibility that came along with the trip, which was a good thing.  Youthlinc helps so many people its unbelievable and definitely is a program that should be recognized.

Youthlinc	9670	6	/users/profile/11485	Jenele	Volunteer	5	08/27/2009	YouthLINC helped prepare and provide me an opportunity to serve a ten day service trip in Ocotlan, Mexico. This was a major highlight of my life! Through YouthLINC I was motivated to serve many hours of service in my community. I was then able to go to my service site and learn of a new culture, how to teach people with disabilities, teach the community about hygiene and distribute hygiene kits that we made, repair an orphanage kitchen, paint and fix an orphanage playground, fix up an under privilaged preschool playground, provide a carnival for the kids of the community and the special education school where we did most of our service and much much more! I would highly recommend everyone go on a trip with YouthLINC and experience what it feels like to really help others less fortunate than yourself.
Youthlinc	9630	8	/users/profile/11442	savekenya123	Volunteer	5	08/27/2009	YouthLinc was absolutely amazing.  I did 100 hours of local service in the community, and the trip to Kenya was the greatest experience of my life. I loved Youthlinc and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
Youthlinc	9606	8	/users/profile/11421	drags	Volunteer	5	08/27/2009	My son served the community and then went to Peru this summer.  I saw many changes for the good as my son got out of himself and served others.  I think Youthlinc provided a great opportunity for my son and I am grateful for the experiences he was able to have because of this organization.
Youthlinc	9532	7	/users/profile/11352	im4byu2009	Volunteer	5	08/26/2009	If I had to say the one thing that has changed my life most dramatically thus far, it is YouthLinc.  My year-long service with a local retirement home and then the humanitarian trip with this organization to Kiamuri, Kenya were unforgettable experiences.  Because of YouthLinc, I have changed my minor to international studies so that I can better understand and help people around the world.  Because of YouthLinc, I look for service opportunities and revel in the sheer joy of being a part of something--of being a part of making someone smile, lending a helping hand, and doing something that takes my focus entirely Off of myself.  Thank you, YouthLinc, for the amazing journey, not only to a far away land to people I now love, but to becoming the better person I am today.
Youthlinc	9499	7	/users/profile/11315	b-rad	Volunteer	5	08/25/2009	If Youthlinc dedicated themselves to only organizing groups with the intent of providing service trips throughout the world, they would be like most other non-profit organizations. What makes Youthlinc better than that, is their commitment to developing life-long humanitarians. I am aware of no other non-profit organization that mandates their volunteers to accept a sponsorship by providing local community service. This truly is the miracle of Youthlinc!  Unlike any other organization I have affiliated with in the past, my experience with Youthlinc did not end looking back on a great week or month of providing service! Instead a desire to serve on a weekly basis and a continual stream of memories has been created!!!
Youthlinc	9492	6	/users/profile/11309	PFrost	Volunteer	5	08/24/2009	YouthLinc is set a part from other international service organizations in that it requires its members to first be dedicated to recognizing and doing local service before they venture to do international service. YouthLinc provides great opportunities to serve in your own community and then to gain the skills and know how to serve in an international community.
Youthlinc	9485	8	/users/profile/11302	Lindsee	Volunteer	5	08/24/2009	I have been involved with YouthLINC from the very beginning! It is so hard to talk about this organization because, well, really...where do I begin? YouthLINC has simply and honestly changed my life! I was first introduced to this program when I was in high school and ten years later, I am still involved. Because of this program, I have volunteered hundreds of hours making a difference in my community and internationally, in Kenya and Peru. Despite serving others, I find the person who has benefited the most has been myself.I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE YouthLINC!
Youthlinc	9474	9	/users/profile/11287	Sarah Law	Volunteer	5	08/23/2009	Youthlinc provided me a humanitarian opportunity of a lifetime.  Thanks to their positive and encouraging organization I have grown into a person who has found tremendous value in serving others across the world. And due to my experience in Kenya I have not stopped serving others across the world, and have a burning desire to teach this same value in my own children.
Youthlinc	9445	5	/users/profile/11255	Ashton Palmer	Volunteer	5	08/22/2009	YouthLINC is truly amazing. Traveling to Peru was the best experience of my life, and I have learned so much from it. YouthLINC has changed my life and I love it so much!
Youthlinc	9433	8	/users/profile/11243	meggie marie	Volunteer	5	08/21/2009	Most incredible life changing experience ever. I highly suggest anyone and EVERYONE to do something like this. Youthlinc has got it all set up so great- helping you learn everything you are going to be doing, teaching, and helping with. This has opened so many doors for all who have gone and will go in the future- I know I plan to return!
Youthlinc	9416	9	/users/profile/11225	lbeheshti	Volunteer	5	08/21/2009	What do you say about the organization that changed your life? What can you even say? I could barely even rate it with five stars because it simply wasnt enough! Out of all the amazing things I could say YouthLinc, one thing I simply must mention is that it completely changed my life. Once an irritable and confused teenager, I seldom found activities outside of dance and socializing even remotely interesting. I was always cognizant of my interest in helping people, so I finally looked into humanitarian work. I was immediately informed of YouthLinc, hearing it was life changing, amazing and such a great experience. After being accepted into the program as a participant on the 2009 Kenya Team, I attended my first meeting and almost instantly knew it was one of the best choices I had made in my life so far. From then on I looked forward to Saturday monthly meetings; to me, it was ideal: I was with a group of people who shared the same interests and goals that I did (many of whom turned out to be true best friends that I still keep in touch with), I was planning fundraising activities, developing my lesson plan to teach at the primary schools in Kiamuri, and discussing in country festivities and plans. There was never a dull moment for me, and never a moment where I wasnt completely involved and excited for the experience ahead of me. Through YouthLinc I also met another amazing group of people in my local service opportunity (a 100-hour requirement is asked of Kenya participants, a standard I believe to be both an interesting and fun opportunity), including my little sister Lucy Medina, via the Big Brother Big Sister program, which I came across in the YouthLinc Service Directory. Before I knew it I was a week away from my highly anticipated departure for Kenya, and I was more excited than ever! The experience in Kiamuri is so beyond words that I can barely even begin to describe it. All I can say is that I am humbled, changed, and truly amazed because of the things I saw, people I met, and things that happened to me in Kenya. After meeting the all the kindest people literally in the entire world, I felt that building onto their secondary school wasnt enough! By the end of the trip I wanted to sit down with every person in the village to hear their story, and offer them any help I could. In Kenya, through teaching Geography in the primary schools, building at the construction site for the secondary school, donating the soccer jerseys, working with the villages women for Micro Finance, and donating supplies for the health fair, I unquestionably experienced a life-changing trip.  I am without a doubt a changed person  I have even declared my major on my college applications as international nursing, and have applied to community service oriented schools, as it is now my chief interest and goal in life. In fact I had such an incredible experience that I decided I simply must return. So, after applying for the Kenya Alum Leader position, I will return to Kenya in the summer of 2010 as the Alum Leader! I truly cannot say how thankful and excited I am to reunite with my brothers and sisters I met in Kenya once again. Theres really not much more I can say about such a remarkable organization, only that prospective students have my most sincere encouragement and congratulation. Amongst all the lessons I learned from my time spent in Kenya, I must say that I have learned to live more simply and love more freely  one of the most valuable lessons in life. Thank you for such an amazing experience YouthLinc!
Youthlinc	9414	8	/users/profile/11223	jroberts	Volunteer	5	08/21/2009	I have been fortunate enough to travel twice with Youthlinc to Kenya. These trips have paved the way for what I have decided to do as far as schooling and career goals are concerned. Interacting with, and teaching the children in Kenya was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had. Not only does this organization help you see the need for service in your local community, it opens your eyes to the influence you can have on an international scale. The things I learned from Youthlinc have helped me to have more of a desire to consistently serve in my own life.
Youthlinc	9413	5	/users/profile/11222	stephen.ly	Volunteer	5	08/20/2009	I can honestly say that YouthLINC has changed me for the better. I first came across the organization in 2007 when I spoke with a past volunteer. After finding out a little more about the program, I knew it was for me, so I signed up. Throughout the 2007-2008 service year, I volunteered in my local community at various organizations. From there I learned to be relied upon volunteer and the relationships and connections that I made will be remembered forever. In the summer of 2008, I traveled to Peru to work in Santa Rosa. I assisted the Team Dentist in doing tooth extractions to relieve pain. The people were so grateful of our services and it definitely put a smile on my face. I thought going down to Peru, I would be inflicting change. Actually the change was done on me. Working with the villagers and seeing the hardwork they put into maintaining the village and the love for their neighbors, and for YouthLINC volunteers, really opened up my eyes. The comaraderie they have for one another and their will to live on the very little necessities definitely humbled me. After the trip I realized that I needed to return. I served as the Alum Leader for the Peru 2009 team and I will be serving as the Team Leader for the Peru 2010 team. I really love the program and strongly encourage those who want to make a difference to join. The program has definitely turned me into a lifetime humanitarian!
Youthlinc	9399	5	/users/profile/11205	dbaugh	Board Member	5	08/20/2009	YouthLINC is quite simply the best youth service organization I have ever worked with.  It is such an amazing thing to watch young men and women change over the course of a year as their eyes are opened to the reality of the needs that exist in their local community as well as the rest of the world.  Every youth who participates in the program is changed for the good in a very profound way.
Youthlinc	9394	5	/users/profile/11199	Jane	Volunteer	5	08/20/2009	YouthLinc, is so amazing!! I know that it's helped me become a better person.  I learned that they care about eachother, the reason I know this is because of one little girl. She when we were giving clothes away would only take one shirt instead of two, because she new that there were so many others behind her who needed the clothes more then she.  Because of her example, it made me become so much more greatful for all I've been given and all that I have.  They have nothing, but yet they are happy and the most caring people I know, and who I want to strive to be more like them.  They are Giving and Loving to everyone around them, it doesn't matter where your from or what you look like, they will always love you.  I know by this expirence I am more willing to show people my love towards them.
Youthlinc	9393	5	/users/profile/11198	eguymon2	Volunteer	5	08/20/2009	I have had the opportunity to travel with Youthlinc to Thailand just over a year ago and it was the most amazing and life changing experience of my life. Without the Youthlinc organization I would most likely have never had such a positive experience that has continually proven to change my life and broaden my horizons.
Youthlinc	9363	5	/users/profile/11161	mgjessen	Volunteer	5	08/19/2009	I have had the opportunity of traveling with youthlinc to both meru kenya and ocotlan mexico. Because those trips have impacted me so much in the next year I will go with youthlinc to chiapas mexico as well as peru. Youthlinc is an amazing opportunity for youth to discover what it means to serve others. I was able to see for myself how fortunate i really am to live where i do and have what i have and because it made me aware of the needs that others have youthlinc has allowed me to want to continue to serve others throughout my life. This organization is all about helping but it is also an opportunity to learn leadership, work, and teamwork skills that are invaluable. I'm grateful for youthlinc and what it has done for me.
Youthlinc	9358	5	/users/profile/11155	SB	Volunteer	5	08/19/2009	I have traveled with YouthLINC on two occasions.  Both have been unforgettable, life changing experiences.  This organization is one of the best of its kind!  It truly makes a difference in the lives of everyone involved!
Youthlinc	9356	5	/users/profile/11153	Peace NOW!!	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/19/2009	My daughter went to Africa three years ago with YOUTHLINC.... changed her life forever - she came home with a humanitarian heart on fire!  YOUTHLINC changed our whole family - we all have the bug!   I went with YOUTHLINC on a Alumni trip this spring to  Thailand and my life was transformed!  I saw and did things i did not believe possible.  Stood and cried as i entered my first buddhist temple, threw my heartache into the indian ocean and stood back and watched my daughter grow and  stretch her arms open even farther to embrace the people of thailand.  We had an amazing time.  It connected us in a way that is hard to describe!  When you go on these trips you think you are going to make a difference when really the difference happens in you!   I met so many wonderful americans on the trip and we bonded...... it is a highlight of my 47 years!   Youthlinc inspires and creates a place for people to find their soul and expand that to reach places unknown!  I am pleased to be part of the youthlinc family!  I feel blessed and honored to have spent time with 'youthlincers!'  The spirit of humanitarianism is alive and well with this group!  they head out with the hope and desire to do good deeds and they do... changing lives one heart at a time!  I  find it pure joy to watch my one and only daughter find her way in this life through helping others.... no better gift and she means it from her toes to her nose!  Youthlinc was her jumping off point and i believe that she is headed to so pretty amazing things in life because of this experience!   Thank-you Youthlinc for allowing me an front row seat to so much hard wok, concern, caring and magic!  it is a beautiful thing!   Much Peace!!! wendy hanson
Youthlinc	9337	6	/users/profile/11132	Tayler 12	Volunteer	5	08/18/2009	The experiences I have had through the YouthLINC organization have been absolutely life changing, and have really made me who I am today.  I started out in the YouthLINC program my senior year in high school.  I was planning on going on the trip to Africa the summer after I graduated.  I worked all through the year to gain my 100 hours of community service by working at a hospital and also with the big brother big sister organization.  Both of these experiences completely changed my life and my view of service as a whole.  I think the fact that youthLINC focuses on community service as well as international is such an incredible thing, with importance that I honestly can't emphasize enough!  I learned what service truly means in that year before my trip, I learned the joy that it gives you, and it completely shattered all preconceived notions I had had about what it mean to serve.  It  changed my life forever!  I think it is so important, especially for youth, to learn the meaning of service, and to realize the importance of serving within your community before going abroad.  The way my life changed while I was in Kenya could never be described in words.  I met people with nothing, who would have done anything and everything for me, a person who seemingly has everything.  They were the most selfless people I had ever met and I was so overwhelmed by each and every person I came across.  I still feel emotionally attached to the children I met at Kaaga, one in particular name Elossi, I think about her little smile everyday and I will never forget her.  My plan after graduating high school was to go to college and eventually medical school, I had always been interested in medicine and while I was in Kenya I had the chance to visit a hospital in Meru.  These visits were painfully emotional, you begin to wonder why...why do these people have to suffer, why do I have so much, why was I born where I was born into a place with so much while these people were born in a place with so little, why can't we help them, why, why why?  I struggled with these thoughts, and have continued to struggle with them.  This has been the driving force behind my passion and my education for the last few years.  I am still a pre-med student at the University of Utah but I am now focusing also on Public Health and International Medicine.  I have been involved with a program in the Honors College called Global Health Scholars.  Through this program we research global health issues all over the world, work on publications, and plan various different humanitarian aid trips to places like Ghana, Thailand, Guatemala, Peru, China, and many more.  YouthLINC was the root of every bit of passion I have for service and the issue of global health.  This is an absolutely incredible organization that has changed the lives of people in the community and abroad in ways that no one could ever explain or describe in words, and I am so grateful I got to be a part of it!
Youthlinc	9312	5	/users/profile/11092	BP	Board Member	5	08/18/2009	Youthlinc challenges youth to serve in thier local community for an opportunity to give service in a foreign country. Their mission of creating Life Long Humanitarians is unique but I have witnessed year after year young people changed as a result of giving of themselves. Their hearts are made larger and the world is made smaller as participants learn the joy of humanitarian service both far and near their homes. Working and planning with others goings to poor areas in Peru, Mexico, Thialand or Kenya members of the group meet monthly to organize their service and to report on the local service they have provided. My daughter went to Kenya five years ago. To this day, she is constantly giving service to someone. She is just one of hundreds that Youthlinc has helped to become a Life Long Humanitarian.
Youthlinc	9310	8	/users/profile/11091	enazzal1	Volunteer	5	08/18/2009	YouthLINC has changed my life forever! You start out in highschool thinking that you can change the world and change peoples lives, and through YouthLINC, i can truly attest to the power of service. Service is not a chore it is apart of my everyday life and this is the main lesson I learned from youthLINC. I traveled to Kenya in 2007 and Thailand in 2009 and was able to truly make an impact on peolples lives but the best thing that I took home with me was that I gained knowledge about the world around me. I grew up and understood that there is a huge world outside of Utah and saw things that have touched my heart forever. This program helps youth have a hands on experience, they are guided for a year and truly begin to understand what it means to be a HUMANITARIAN! You make connections with your teammates and share memories that will help mold you for the rest of your life. I love this organization and I can't imagine my life without the amaing people that YouthLINC has brought into it. Youth from all over Utah change every year and become the leaders of the future through this program. Through your team commitees you step up and get to make huge projects happen, with your one on one Local service hours you understand what it means to be a relied upon volunteer and through see true poverty in both your community and communities across the world you truly realize what it means to be grateful. So many changes happened to me during my time with YouthLINC, i was able to help a child read, take hundreds of hand knit caps and booties to babies in Kenya, lead a medical fair, make cement, paint classrooms, create a mural, learn a new culture, try different food, teach hygiene lessons, and make life long friends.
Youthlinc	9304	7	/users/profile/11085	ambrass	Volunteer	5	08/18/2009	My experience with YouthLiNC has absolutely changed my life. I was given the chance not only to make a constructive difference in my local community through the service hours requirement, but to influence the lives of people in the beautiful community of Santa Rosa, Peru.  The experiences I shared with the Peruvians and my fellow volunteers will never be forgotten. I was able to help start a micro-finance program, build a library, and teach education lessons to the children. I will leave YouthLiNC a more culturally aware, caring, and dedicated lifetime humanitarian.
Youthlinc	9289	7	/users/profile/11069	lynnekerr	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	My son and I went to Peru with Youthlinc, he as a student and I as the group doc.  What an amazing experience - we worked hard and hopefully helped in a small incredibly beautiful village on the Amazon.  It puts the recession in perspective.  I will never forget dancing (with everyone else dancing too) to the goodbye celebration hand in hand with the local medicine man, for what seemed like miles, in the hot sun, laughing at the fun.  I want to go again some day.
Youthlinc	9276	7	/users/profile/11057	justin_tuan	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	My wife has been involved in YouthLiNC since it first began.  I was lucky enough to get involved after we got married.  I have been impressed with how much YouthLiNC participants can accomplish during their humanitarian trips compared to any other overseas volunteer programs.  Many people I've known get to an overseas service site and find that there isn't a lot to do due to lack of resourses, lack of organized leadership, or that the humanitarian trip is actually just tourism.  YouthLiNC does a great job finding/raising funds to accomplish meaningful projects and organizing them in a way that the participants can have a personal and effective experience. For example, this past year in Thailand we had a few people on the team that raised a couple extra thousand dollars that went 100% to additional projects, such as tiling and painting a run down jungle school and digging a fish hatchery at an orphanage.  The students and mentors that raised that extra money were directly responsible for the success of these projects.  If they wouldn't have raised that money, we wouldn't have done the projects.  You own your actions and the outcomes with YouthLiNC rather than just having a random one-time humanitarian experience.
Youthlinc	9274	7	/users/profile/11056	smithmonson	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	My experience with YouthLINC has been phenomenal. I am amazed at how effective the mission of fostering service and compassion in youth while providing effective international humanitarian support. One of the most impressive facets of the program is the fact that the organization not only focuses on service in developing areas, but allows people to see service opportunities in their own communities. Since it is a small organization, with little overhead, the international work YouthLINC carries out targeted to specific populations, making it one of the most effective organizations I have encountered.
Youthlinc	9266	7	/users/profile/11049	deeannaphelps	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	My experience with YouthLINC has exceeded my greatest expectations. The relationships i formed while in service, both locally and internationally, still remain with me to this day. I thought that i might be able to give the people of Peru something to improve their lives, but instead they instilled in me the importance of valuing life. The YouthLINC organization is headed by some of the most amazing people, i have no doubt that YouthLINC will continue to bless people around the world for many more years to come.
Youthlinc	9260	7	/users/profile/11045	DC	Former Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	I love Youth Linc! I first went to Kenya as a student volunteer after I graduated from high school, and went three years later as an Education Mentor to Thailand. It is such a great organization. The local service combined with the international experience makes it unforgettable! It changes your outlook on the ability you have to serve and change the world.
Youthlinc	9256	7	/users/profile/11041	Wendy Wall	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	I have served as a Mentor for the Mexico trip and a Trip Leader for the Kenyan Alumni trip with Youthlinc.  This is an awesome opportunity for youth to understand other cultures and economies and acquire a service ethic that will serve them their entire lives.  Both trips were safe, well-planned, and orchestrated with the utmost integrity. I would send my children on one of these trips in a heartbeat, and I feel that the beneficiaries in the countries we visited were also very pleased and grateful.
Youthlinc	9254	7	/users/profile/11039	hpaul	Former Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	I loved working with the special needs children in Ocotlan. The community really made us feel welcome, and seeing the school improve was extremely rewarding. I would recommend this program, especially because the pre-volunteer work prepared me for serving abroad. Few other programs prepare you to reach out of your comfort zone, to help you reap the full benefit of the experience.
Youthlinc	9249	6	/users/profile/11035	1cobra55	Former Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	I had a chance to work with some of the Youthlinc students on a trip to Mexico to set up a special need swing set we send down. The 10 days we were there and the way it changed the lives of some of the students was heart wrenching to say the lease. These students lives were changed forever with 9 month preparing to go and 10 days of working with special need children, this could not have been a more wonderful time of their life's.
Youthlinc	9246	1	/users/profile/11033	dhale	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	I got involved with YouthlINC as a volunteer mentor to Peru back in 2007. I had been involved with other humanitarian foundations and service organizations in the past, but I was absolutely blown away by the time and effort these students had put in just to be able to come on this trip and then work thier hearts out in 95 degree heat for two weeks straight. The teamwork, the donations, the education, the love that these students brought to this community was astounding. I hadn't realized how much we could truly accomplish if we could just put our minds to it. Since then, I have been a dedicated member of the YouthLINC team as the Peru Team Leader and have the opportunity to oversee about 35 new students participate in the program every year, learn the value of service, and see their lives change through a year of selfless experiences. YouthLINC truly accomplishes it's mission to "create life-time humanitarians". Just ask any alum.
Youthlinc	9243	1	/users/profile/11029	maciii	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	I was introduced to YouthLINC by my wife (one of the participants from the very first group).  I have always known that YouthLINC did good work for the villages they help with, but it wasn't until I went on my first experience in 2008, that I realized how great this organization was.  To know that the work that is needed and completed each and every year in these locations has been a huge eye-opener to how important it is to volunteer.  The most exciting part of YouthLINC is to know that they are working towardas shaping life-time humanitarians and not just looking for one-time volunteers.  I know I will once again help YouthLINC increase its success in volunteering and changing the world one village at a time!
Youthlinc	9233	1	/users/profile/11019	garybrimley	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	In my second year of college, Fall 2005, I was invited to participate in YouthLINC as a volunteer participant to provide humanitarian service in Mexico the next coming Summer (2006). I was told this was an opportunity where I would work to earn a "sponsorship" (that would pay for part of the expense of traveling down to Mexico) by performing 60 hours of service in the local community. I signed up for it and decided to work 60 hours at an elementary school; I helped a teacher in her 1st grade classroom by working with some of the students as well as organizing materials and helping with classroom preparation. I spent 3 or 4 hours a week, on multiple days, between my college classes, going in to the class to help with whatever the teacher needed, for about 4 or 5 months (until I reached at least 60 hours). Then, when the Summer came around our international service group made up of about 30 young high school and college participants, all of whom had each spent their own minimum of 60 hours at local service sites of their choice, went to Ocotlan, Mexico, to work at a school for disabled children, and, separately, an orphanage. Our two projects at the school and orphanage involved both physical work such as painting, as well as social-oriented work, directly with the children. We played with them and taught them. (Many of us, myself included, know Spanish to a certain degree, but even those of us who didn't know Spanish still played and spent time with the kids.) This experience built me up and has made me come to see the opportunities to serve all around me and understand peoples' situations, and have a desire to help them improve their lives.
Youthlinc	9229	1	/users/profile/11014	mikedenison	Donor	5	08/17/2009	When our oldest daughter was accepted to participate in a YouthLinc service trip to Peru three years ago, we had no idea this amazing organization would become such a big part of our lives. Now our second daughter has just returned from her service trip to Kenya with life-changing experiences. We have full confidence in sending our teens on YouthLinc trips because of their in-depth planning, focus on safety, and willingness to let these young people carry much of the burden of planning and serving.
Youthlinc	9221	1	/users/profile/11007	Joanie	Donor	5	08/17/2009	I have been impressed how YouthLinc provides the opportunity for young adults to make volunteerism a part of their lives, enablihg local and foreign communities to benefit from their altruism for many years to come.
Youthlinc	9218	1	/users/profile/11006	Papa John	General Member of the Public	5	08/17/2009	Judy, it has been a delight to witness first hand your dedication to YouthLinc and to see the difference it has made in those who have participated in its programs.  I am sure you will keep up the good work whether I ask you to or not.
Youthlinc	9216	1	/users/profile/11004	erinobvious	Volunteer	5	08/17/2009	YouthLINC is a magnet for caring, motivated, intelligent young adults.  It gives hands-on, experiential training in how to be a leader and change the world around you.  There aren't many places you can get an experience like that.
Youthlinc	9209	1	/users/profile/10999	npoland	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/17/2009	YouthLINC is a wonderful organization! I had the opportunity to participate as a student and then again as a professional.  It was a great experience serving and being served by the people in Mexico and then returning to see them a second time.  I also appreciate YouthLINC's value on local service as well and finding ways to better our community.
Youthlinc	9205	1	/users/profile/10994	ceebear1	Volunteer	5	08/16/2009	I have had two children and have personally gone on two of these wonderful humanaitarian trips.  The students need to volunteer 60-100 service hours to receive a scholarship sponsored by our Rotary Club in Utah.  They work hard in their local communities then give service in 3rd world countries.  My son and daughter will never forget their esperience working in a small village on the Amazon.  It taught them that it is a big world out there with many wonderful people, just less priviledged that we are.  We have traveled extensively as a family but they both say it was the best trip and experience of their lives.  Humanitarians for life!
Youthlinc	9202	3	/users/profile/10992	YLMB	Volunteer	4	08/16/2009	Thank you YouthLINC for teaching me that now is the time to serve. Even when everything seems busy, it is important to take just a little time out of your day to help your friends.  There are so many ways that you can make a difference in someone else's life, especially when we work together as an organization.  YouthLINC focuses on community service as well as international service.  Both are so important because there are needs everywhere.
Youthlinc	9201	5	/users/profile/10991	nelleriffic	Volunteer	5	08/16/2009	YouthLINC is a life-changing organization, for both the volunteers and recipients of service. As a high school student, I had my first international humanitarian service experience in Ocotlan, Mexico and loved every minute of it. Serving children with special needs opened my eyes to the needs of communities outside the US and got me addicted to humanitarianism and philanthropy. The wonderfully unique thing about YouthLINC is how everyone works together to first serve locally in preparation to serve internationally. There is an amazing sense of unity among the volunteers and staff and everyone is genuinely motivated to serve. When I have the time and means to do so, I want to travel to their other locales and participate with YouthLINC again. It is truly a special non-profit organization that is long overdue for significant public recognition.
Youthlinc	9197	4	/users/profile/10987	hippie123	Volunteer	5	08/16/2009	youthlinc is an amazing organization. amazing people are involved with this program. through my trip ive learned to live more simply and love more freely.
Youthlinc	9195	4	/users/profile/10984	Kenya Lisa	Former Volunteer	5	08/16/2009	Youthlinc quite literally changed my life and gave me new viewpoints on what it truly means to help yourself grow through helping others.  I was an adult mentor for 2 Youthlinc trips to Kenya.  I had never traveled in a developing country before, and had never done international service.  The unique way that Youthlinc combines local with international service, the one-year mentoring experience with young people from high school through graduate school, and getting to work with incredibly talented and capable adult mentors combined with carefully chosen projects and contact people at the host site, makes for an experience that simpy can't be beat.  The Director, Judy Zone, is driven to excellence and responsible non-profit management.  Not only is not a penny ever wasted, she takes tiny resources and couples it with networkig to make every dollar come back to the organization many times over! I went to Costa Rica on an Outward Bound trip in March - I chaperoned and the skills I learned in Youthlinc came in very handy! We did home stays and service work with families in the rainforest. It was a life changing event for Erin, I think, as she now talks of going into the Peace Corp and not so much about things she wants.

Youthlinc	9193	6	/users/profile/10982	Home support	Donor	5	08/16/2009	I have been a part of Youthlinc since its inception 10 years ago.  The programs have steadily moved forward and continue to grow.Initially there were only 20 students and 1 site.  Now there are 4 international sites and countless local sites and over 100 students.The organization needs to continue to expand its leadership.  Involvement of graduates and their families will provide a solid base for future growth.
Youthlinc	9190	1	/users/profile/10979	PorterIlli	Volunteer	5	08/16/2009	I went as a student with the Peru team in 2004, and continued with YouthLINC this year as the Mexico team alum leader to Ocotln.  Both experiences have been unforgetable and quite life changing.  YouthLINC is designed is such a way that the participants are submerged in service (both locally and abroad) so much that life styles are changed, cultures are connected, appreciation is created and lives are enhanced permanently.
Youthlinc	9189	3	/users/profile/10958	Judy	Board Member	5	08/16/2009	When you are surrounded by enthusiastic young people who want to make a difference in their world, by parents and donors who believe in the mission of the organization enough to be truly generous, then the job of Executive Director becomes a daily joy. Every day, this organization bears witness to the power of a great idea: creating life-time humanitarians through a unique combination of local and international service -- and the sponsorship that both not only holds young people accountable for their leadership and commitment, but makes the accomplishments of YouthLINC possible.
Youthlinc	9187	2	/users/profile/10977	melwebbspencer	Volunteer	5	08/16/2009	There is a place in my heart that I keep life- changing experiences.  Only a few events are kept there. My wedding day, the birth of my children and my experience with Youthlinc. I was able to participate in some of the most selfless service. It changed my global perspective on humanity. I gained a greater love for the human race.
Youthlinc	9183	2	/users/profile/10974	mdeniso7	Volunteer	5	08/16/2009	As I have volunteered with YouthLINC for the past several years in various capacities, I am constantly amazed at how this program truly changes lives. By combining the elements of local and international service, student participants develop a lifelong passion for humanitarian work. Because of my participation with YouthLINC, I have learned countless important life skills: love, service, leadership, and teamwork.
Youthlinc	9181	2	/users/profile/10972	chelsea a	Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	My experience as a member of the 2008 Peru YouthLinc team was one of the most amazing opportunities I have ever had.  As I worked throughout the year as a regular volunteer, I learned to love serving others.  Getting outside of myself and working on making someone else's load lighter became addicting!  I fell in love with Peru and its beautiful people . . . I still think about it often.  Today, I'm driven to help as many people as I can, whether it be locally or internationally.  YouthLinc changed my life and I'm so grateful for the chance this program gave me.
Youthlinc	9180	2	/users/profile/10971	Thaylene	General Member of the Public	5	08/15/2009	Two of our children participated in Peru trips with Youthlinc.  It was a fantastic experience for both.  Youthlinc reinforced their desire to serve within their community, as well as around the world.  They came back with a sincere love and admiration for the people of Yanamono Village in Peru, as well as for their Youthlinc peers and leaders.  Service is a big part of what defines them--thanks to Youthlinc for providing fantastic, meaningful service opportunities.  Thaylene Rogers
Youthlinc	9179	5	/users/profile/10970	lindsay	Volunteer	4	08/15/2009	I have been to Peru, Mexico, opened to the Thailand site, and have participated in some way or another in every local and international aspect of the program and I can say that the organization has a truly wonderful and inspirational mission. The idea of creating a service ethic in a young person is world changing and has exponential potential for good. I adore YouthLINC's mission, the people invovled, the wonderful partners world-wide, and the general blessing these things have been in my life.
Youthlinc	9178	6	/users/profile/10969	kkarg	Volunteer	4	08/15/2009	I am so thankful for the experience i had in Meru, Kenya because of YouthLINC.  I got to experience something that most people never get to in their lifetimes- seeing people living in third world conditions with smiles on their faces.  Although we were disorganized sometimes, everything seemed to come together at the end of the day.  I loved this organization because each member of the team was invested in the projects due to the monthly meetings and local service requirements.  I will always remember the children I met and how much they loved having their pictures taken!
Youthlinc	9177	6	/users/profile/10968	Loucan	Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	The experience I had with Youthlinc was the most rewarding of anything I've ever done in my life. They are a great organization that is organized, efficient, productive and offer life altering experiences. Every student that participates in youthlinc receives a sponosrship to help pay for their trip. They want to help youth participate in great things!Also each student is required to complete local service hours that get them involved in service throughout their community. My trip to Peru with Youthlinc is something I will never forget. It has motivated me to continue serving. You won't find a better humanitarian organization out there.
Youthlinc	9175	6	/users/profile/10966	dannorocks	Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	I loved my experience with YouthLinc, and it helped me decide to become a Registered Nurse. In fact, today I was telling someone about my experieces with YouthLinc when I went to Kenya 8 years ago. Definitely a life altering experience, and you couldn't find a better group of people to work with! Amazing!
Youthlinc	9174	3	/users/profile/10965	avanhoose	Former Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	I participated in two YouthLinc expeditions - one as a student and again 6 years later as a mentor.  I was one of the lucky few who got to go on the very first expedition to Kenya, a week after graduating from high school.  It was an experience that set the tone for my life.  I was in charge of arranging lessons in the school.  While there I also helped with construction and cultural exchange activities.  I then went on to become a teacher and joined the 2006 expedition to Peru as a mentor.  I helped the students do what I had done in Kenya.
Youthlinc	9173	3	/users/profile/10964	pj	Donor	5	08/15/2009	I was president of the Murray Rotary Club which supported two students to particpate in the youthlink project.

Youthlinc	9169	3	/users/profile/10962	elkaiser	Former Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	I was a Translator for YouthLinc on a mission to Mexico. I have never been involved with another organization that so effectively brought local and international service together for High School and College students. It is truly a unique organization. I dream of the time when my life will allow me to go on another trip with YouthLinc.
Youthlinc	9168	3	/users/profile/10959	a5865	Former Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	YouthLINC is an incredible organization that has lasting impacts on the local community, internationally, and most importantly, the individuals. As a high school student, I was impressed in the opportunity to serve in an expedition in Kenya that summer, but it was the service we performed before that made it one hundred times more worthwhile. We were required to to perform at least 100 hours of service to help earn part of a scholarship to go, and for a 15-year-old, nothing could have been better to help me think less of myself and more of the world around me. And now, nine years later, Kenya was one of the most life-changing experiences I've ever had. And I am so grateful that I traveled with YouthLINC--the program was incredibly organized, really focused on us students connecting with our community, and allowed us to have a well-rounded, safe, and enriching experience on our trip. Would I do it again? It a heartbeat. Especially with YouthLINC. And after going with other group on different service trips, it's hard not to compare them with YouthLINC. If you want an amazing organization and the experience of a life time, go with them. You will remember it for the rest of your life.
Youthlinc	9166	4	/users/profile/10957	u2thed_y	Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	YouthLINC is an amazing program that provides opportunities to serve locally as well as internationally. Through this experience I developed a habit of service and really made it a part of my life. I learned that there are people everywhere to serve and if you make it your lifestyle there is no greater happiness.
Youthlinc	9164	7	/users/profile/10956	raiders133	Board Member	5	08/15/2009	As a board member, I see the outstanding experience this organization provides the youth in our community. They truly creat "Lifetime Humanitarians"!
Youthlinc	9163	9	/users/profile/10954	sarahg	Volunteer	4	08/15/2009	As a mentor and Youthlinc trip leader it has been my pleasure to experience the growth and awe of dozens of youth from around the state of Utah.  The experience is one of hands on development of community, skills and knowledge.  Students have the amazing opportunity to make a difference in their own community and then become a part of less fortuante communities world wide.  To be touched in such a way at such a young age truly binds most students to lifelong service that is rewarding, fun and makes a positive difference at home and abroad.  I commend Youthlinc for its persistent work toward a positive human connection at home and afar.
Youthlinc	9160	9	/users/profile/10952	JuelsJ28	Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	I wasn't sure I wanted to go to Peru, I didn't speak Spanish and I didn't know what to expect. All I can say is that I made the right decision.  I had an amazing time learning about a new part of the world.  I loved being able to help those abroad and learn about myself.  I wish I could go on all of their trips!
Youthlinc	9159	10	/users/profile/10949	css0516	Volunteer	5	08/15/2009	YouthLINC gave me a great opportunity to utilize the business concepts I had been learning in the classroom in order to help create micro-enterprise loan lessons for women throughout the world.  YouthLINC offers an incredible outlet for young people to get involved with service in their community, but don't quite know how to direct their desires to serve in an effective way.  The organization really focuses on people, and looks to not only better those in our communities and the international community, but also to better the students involved in service.  My international trip with YouthLINC to Thailand opened my eyes more fully to the realities of life.  I was so grateful to have been able to help individuals in many aspects of their lives; we helped them economically, we helped them how they could be more healthy and take care of themselves, we helped them to rebuild their infrastructure, and we helped them to remember the good that comes from laughter and a helping hand.  I would definitely recommend YouthLINC to anyone wanting to make an impact beyond their direct scope of life.
Youthlinc	9158	9	/users/profile/10948	clarktmabey	Donor	5	08/15/2009	Wonderful organization.  They give students the opportunity to do international humanitarian service, after they earn the rite by providing much service at home.  They partner with other service organizations making any donations go farther then they would otherwise.  I have had two daughters give hundreds of hours of service each in our local community to have the opportunity to travel internationally to give more service.  It has change our family.  We ended up adopting an infant boy from Africa after one daughter helped children in Peru and another helped children in orphanages in Thailand.  This organization is making a difference in youth, in families, and in the world.
Best Friends Animal Society	307726	2	/users/profile/399074	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	10/03/2016	26 people were killed by pit bulls so far this year (in the USA.)Best Friends promotes pit bulls, and the fact is, how a pit bull was raised does not matter.Pit bulls have a unique biting style (gripping and grinding) and a stronger jaw than other dogs. This makes them more of a caution, and Best Friends should be honest about that.Public safety should trump the lives of dogs.
Best Friends Animal Society	300470	2	/users/profile/391327	Subhunter	Donor	5	08/14/2016	I'm so glad I found this organization.  I've been a giver to Best Friends for years and never had a moments doubt about their intentions, goals or ability.  They truly care for all animals and do their very best to save every one.  This large and well run charity sole goal is the protection and betterment of animal lives. To that end they give their all.  You simply will never find a more worthy and worthwhile charity in which to invest your hard earned dollar.  I'd give them a six star recommendation if it were possible on this site.

Best Friends Animal Society	291182	6	/users/profile/381560	Denise139	Volunteer	5	05/26/2016	My first visit to this amazing sanctuary was May 2016. Can't say enough about the beautiful sanctuary, the staff,  how well run and organized it is and the animals ..... It moved me deeply to be involved in some small part of this worthwhile organization and to see how and where my donations are used. I was deeply moved at Angels rest and left his whole experience a different person. The sanctuary has left an indelible mark on my heart and I can't wait to return next year.
Best Friends Animal Society	291013	3	/users/profile/381358	dparker17	Donor	5	05/25/2016	I had been volunteering at Best Friends since I first found out about them in 2007.    I have also participated in all of their workshops and many of their annual conferences.  I have taken much of their shared information back to the shelter that I volunteered at.  I eventually decided to apply to work for Best Friends and I am now the Animal Area Volunteer Coordinator Team Lead.  This year we will probably exceed 10,000 volunteers.  Many of them come on an annual basis.

The staff there is very friendly, working with the animals is just amazing and you won't find any more beautiful scenery anywhere. The only bad part of the whole trip is when you leave :(
Best Friends Animal Society	290548	6	/users/profile/380908	Susan461	Volunteer	5	05/22/2016	Each time I volunteer at Best Friends it is better and better. I work in Dogtown. The caregivers and staff spend so much time helping dogs, some from horrendous circumstances, become ready to go to a loving home. I stay in the on-site cottages. It is so uplifting to spend time helping animals in such a beautiful place. 
Best Friends Animal Society	290537	3	/users/profile/380888	nancyinnj	Volunteer	5	05/21/2016	Volunteering at Best Friends is a stunning, life-changing, amazing experience. We were surrounded by beauty - that of the landscape, the animals who find sanctuary there and the incredible Founders and caregivers.  One thing I noticed beyond the compassion of the staff and volunteers was the combined joy and peace the animals exhibited. I am honored to be a supporter of and volunteer at Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	290409	1	/users/profile/380734	JackieSeal	Volunteer	5	05/19/2016	I have been going to volunteer at Best Friends almost annually since 2005, it is such a magical place.  The setting is spectacular, there are so many wonderful animals to volunteer with, the staff is friendly and always grateful for volunteer help, and - of course - everyone is an animal lover so it's easy to make new friends.  I cannot recommend it highly enough - a fun, rewarding vacation. Even if you don't have time to volunteer, you can take one of their free tours around the sanctuary and see the good work they do. Can't wait to go back!
Best Friends Animal Society	290349	2	/users/profile/380664	4567	Volunteer	5	05/19/2016	I have volunteered and toured Best Friends several times - each time I do I am so impressed with the wonderful work they do.   The staff and the volunteers are so friendly and love the animals so much -   The animals that are at Best Friends have a wonderful home until they find their "furever home"   It is a great organization
Best Friends Animal Society	290221	2	/users/profile/380516	leelee54	Donor	5	05/17/2016	I cannot wait to visit and volunteer.  I love reading the magazine.
Best Friends Animal Society	289919	4	/users/profile/380183	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/14/2016	I started volunteering at Best Friends Animal Center in Mission Hills CA when they opened in 2012. I worked in the laundry room, cat kitchen, & finally decided fostering kittens was my favorite job.  I take them home for socialization  & keep them until they weigh two pounds, then they are returned, fixed, micro chipped & put up for adoption. I've fostered over fifty kittens & will continue fostering, it's my passion now.  
Best Friends Animal Society	289875	2	/users/profile/380135	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/13/2016	There is so much to say about each and every wonderful experience I have had with Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, UT. I have been volunteering at the sanctuary for 10 years now! My first trip was a week long stay right in one of the cabins and I spent time at each location within the sanctuary. On each visit, every staff member has been friendly and has really taken the time to make sure I feel welcome. With every visit, there is always something new at the sanctuary to enjoy.  I have volunteered with the animals and I have job shadowed the staff and helped with staff duties. Each time, I learn new skills and come home with new ideas to enrich the lives of my pets at home. In addition to the fulfillment of working with these dedicated people and the animals, the sanctuary, being set in the wilderness of beautiful southern Utah, is truly a sanctuary. No matter how busy the day gets, I always feel peaceful and at ease because of the surroundings. All of the animals look happy and healthy. And as strange as this sounds, even the stressed and sick animals look healthier than I would ever expect them to look - the level of care they receive at this sanctuary is by far the best I have ever seen. I do not travel as often as I would like to anymore, but when I do, I make sure that my trip passes though Kanab to have a chance to spend even a few hours at Best Friends!  
Best Friends Animal Society	289601	2	/users/profile/379851	funkyfrank	Donor	5	05/12/2016	Best Friends is an amazing organization. I love how the mega adoption events they hold and their stance on saving lives. I especially enjoy their animal clinic in the san fernando valley that gives animal operations at affordable costs. This is truly a first class group and I am happy to have gotten my cat Wilfred from them.
Best Friends Animal Society	289587	2	/users/profile/379839	Melissa308	General Member of the Public	5	05/12/2016	Best Friends realizes it's about changing the way we currently handle homeless pets and really is working to change the publics preception so that we really can save them all and stop the sadness and suffering. Thank you Best Friends 
Best Friends Animal Society	289566	3	/users/profile/379819	dkirky07	Donor	5	05/11/2016	my husband and i visited Best Friends in September 2012 for the 3rd annual blessing at Angels Rest. what an amazing place.  so many animals and so many wonderful people to help those animals recover enough for most of them to have  a second chance at a home they should have always had.  Angels Rest was so surreal and peaceful, even with so many wind chimes ringing out. it is a place where your soul can be comforted. it was a place that i longed to visit ever since i saw the first episode of dogtown. although i didn't get to meet the 2 people that i wanted to, it was still a very enriching experience and i recommend anyone and everyone should visit at least once in their lives.  
Best Friends Animal Society	289434	3	/users/profile/379686	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	Best Friends is such an amazing organization! The work they do for animals is unbelievable! They have such a great networking system to help in the adoption of pets. Their no kill initiative is so powerful and they are doing a great job in teaching people how they work and what we can do to aid their work.I visited Best Friends  in Kanab last July. All of the workers there have one thing on their mind at all times- How can I make this animal have a better life. Their animal teams are amazing and I feel that they deserve this award! 
Best Friends Animal Society	289430	2	/users/profile/379682	Writer	Client Served	5	05/11/2016	I sought out a pet from Best Friends because of their reputation, after having a poor experience elsewhere. Best Friends staff were quick to respond to my questions, and ensured I was ready (and educated) about the two dogs I adopted. I filled out an application after finding a few pups I was interested in. One had been adopted, but the other two were available. Jessica, the adoption specialist, was forthright with information about both dogs, their positive qualities, and areas training would assist them in. I suggested a couple different dates I could come pick the dogs up and she asked that I delay my trip so the dog's caretaker, Mel, would be around to talk about the dogs with me. I am so glad I delayed the trip. It is apparent the staff cares about, and values, each individual dog in their care. Mel made sure to stop by for quite a while to discuss both dogs needs, and to say goodbye to the dogs before I left with them. Jessica made sure I was comfortable with the amount of information I had on each before I left.A few days after adopting I had a follow up question that I emailed to Best Friends that required information from the medical staff. A prompt response came from Jessica, then a couple hours later, another email came from the medical staff with an answer to my question.The Best Friends grounds are neat, and are a comfortable place to tour, or to adopt a new pet. Best Friends definitely knows what they are doing, and make sure adopters are comfortable, and know all about the dogs they are adopting. I would highly recommend anyone to adopt from Best Friends! 
Best Friends Animal Society	289399	2	/users/profile/143308	Guilbault Carol	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	It is the best. I have been there 6 times to volunteer and it continues to win my heart each time.
Best Friends Animal Society	289386	2	/users/profile/379631	rescuespups	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	My friends and I have driven from California to Best Friends in Utah to volunteer at this incredible sanctuary several times. Although all of us are involved in animal rescue, Best Friends is where we turn when we need our spirits lifted. Best Friends is where we can see success with animals that were deemed beyond hope by others. Best Friends not only rescues animals, they help other rescue organizations become and maintain success. They give animals and people the hope (and tools) to make successful rescue and rehabilitation a reality.
Best Friends Animal Society	289368	1	/users/profile/379609	colleenmbruce	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	I have been a supporter of Best Friends for several years and follow their social media closely.  Earlier this year, I finally had the chance to visit the sanctuary and spend a week volunteering.  I still can't believe how meaningful and fun the experience was, even though most of what I did was cleaning up various kinds of animal poop!  The staff is so amazing and so dedicated to their mission of achieving no more homeless animals.  I can't wait to go back!  I tell ALL my friends and family about Best Friends and the great work they do!
Best Friends Animal Society	289366		/users/profile/379605	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	I visited Best Friends outside Kanab, UT as part of vacation a few years ago - it was my favorite part of the vacation!  I asked if I could volunteer to pet cats for a couple days and they actually said yes.  I spent 2 blissful days w/ a number of cats at Benton's, petting, holding, playing with and even walking them.  Benton's is a house w/ a wide variety of mostly special needs kitties.  I am so grateful that many cats who might otherwise not even be alive are being cared for so well by BF staff and the lucky volunteers who visit them.  It was inspiring too to see various projects that some long-time volunteers had taken on in order to help out.  Finally, BF's mission of kindness to all beings included not only the animals at the sanctuary but also the volunteers who came there.  It really was a privilege to be there.   I haven't been able to go back to the SW since, but when I do, I'll spend more time w/ the amazing cats and staff at Best Friends.

Best Friends Animal Society	289360		/users/profile/379598	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/11/2016	My husband and I have interacted with Best Friends in a few different capacities. First, we attended a NKLA (No Kill Los Angeles) super adoption event, which was sponsored by Best Friends. It was here that we rescued our sweet boy, Zion, from a Best Friends partner group. A few years later we decided we wanted to volunteer at the Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah. Our trip was this April and I am already planning when to go back! We spent our time at Dogtown walking dogs and attending a puppy socialization class. We had an overnight with a dog named Lottie and we spoiled her with snuggles and kisses. Because of Best Friends Lottie, Zion, and thousands of other dogs and cats have been saves. (Fingers crossedottie finds a home soon.) I will begin my volunteer shifts in a few weeks at Best Friends LA location, having been inspired to do more locally after volunteering in Utah.
Best Friends Animal Society	289356		/users/profile/379595	Moira P.	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	Hi, I just finished watching a documentary about the rescued dogs saved from Michael Vicks deplorable dog fighting compound. The show was called The Champions and it depicted how Best Friends Animal Society Sanctuary took in 22 of these abused dogs in attempts to help them recover and find forever homes. Though I've never been to Best Friends personally I was very impressed with all the work and care that goes into each animal that I saw on the show. I also loved their closing statement that all life matters and is not for us to abuse, exploite or exterminate it. If more people shared their vision I believe animals of all kinds would reap the benefits. 
Best Friends Animal Society	289354		/users/profile/379593	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/10/2016	I love this Sanctuary and the caring people who run it and work there. The health & happiness of the animals are the most important thing in their lives.  We have visited & volunteered several times and can't wait until we can return. Am always telling people it is a magical place for the animals. Check out the Guardian Angel segment for the most amazing care given to the animals who need it the most. 
Best Friends Animal Society	289353		/users/profile/379592	cschuz	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	Best Friends works tirelessly to make sure everything that could has been done to find these pups a loving, forever home.  I have followed them for a few years now and the devotion to pets is an awesome, selfless, and extraordinary endeavor to match them with folks that can accept the responsibility to make a home for them.  They deserve all of the support we can offer. 
Best Friends Animal Society	289349		/users/profile/379589	Luna1116	Client Served	5	05/10/2016	We found a pup we liked, filled out the form and set up a ship date!  The staff was friendly, helpful and very easy to work with even though we lived in Massachusetts! Luna came in a clean crate with some food and water, all her papers, a leash and a collar! She's now one of our family! We will always go through best fiends in Utah!!!!
Best Friends Animal Society	289345		/users/profile/379586	Nancy250	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	Witnessing how Best Friends has partnered there city shelters of Los Angeles to turn it around as a "no kill" shelter , a daunting task, is a testament to its mission of no kill partnerships
Best Friends Animal Society	289341		/users/profile/379584	Joy-Lomdon	Donor	5	05/10/2016	My experience with Best Friends has been extraordinary.   I first heard of the organization in a simple mailing they did.  Since then, through their other mailings and magazines, their efforts  on keeping every animal alive and well cared for is evident.  And the love they share with all kinds of animals is incredible. The many, many other volunteers that go there to assist them is testament to how well they attract like-minded people to to their cause. If I had more money,  Best Friends would be the first place would give it to. They deserve all the support they can get.
Best Friends Animal Society	289339		/users/profile/379582	Tanamom	Volunteer	5	05/10/2016	The Best Friends team is dedicated, caring, nurturing, and patient.  Animals in their care receive the best life possible u til they find forever homes.  They change the world!
Best Friends Animal Society	289338		/users/profile/379581	cwesney712	Volunteer	5	05/10/2016	I have been contributing to Best Friends for years. Last October I traveled from Ohio to Utah to volunteer at the sanctuary. It was the trip of a lifetime. I left there with tears in my eyes for all the abused, neglected and abandoned animals, but thrilled that places like Best Friends exist, with people who have devoted their lives to rehabilitating animals that others would have given up on. If I thought this was a great organization before my visit, I now know that it is beyond extraordinary, run by angels on earth. People truly devoted to what they do for these animals. I will continue to contribute and I will hopefully visit again. #savethemall #nomorehomelesspets
Best Friends Animal Society	289335		/users/profile/379577	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/10/2016	 I can't say enough good things about best friends especially after spending one week volunteering a few years back with my sister it was like a bucket list dream come true .   It was great to see the Michael Vick dogs doing so well and especially great to see how well kept these animals are and how of the volunteers truly love the mall and how the board at best friends really does work together .  The photos are truly special group of people and I hope years from now their legacy lives on but in a different way because by that time we really should be no more homeless pets.  
Best Friends Animal Society	289330		/users/profile/379570	Debbie198	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	Can't actually say enough good things about all the things they do to save lives that are broken and unwanted! If the world adopted their philosophy all lives would be better and earth would be safe!

General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	Focused 4 prong mission, dedicated people, unrivaled success, locally invested and globally dedicated. I've been to the sanctuary 4 times over the past 16 years and it's growth is logical and their charity is financially sound.
Best Friends Animal Society	289324		/users/profile/379562	ecrhodes	Donor	5	05/10/2016	I rescued my kitten, Black Finn, from a shelter. These people do an amazing job with limited resources. Help them out, donate some food, some snacks, they are always in need. Don't forget, we are their voices.
Best Friends Animal Society	289323		/users/profile/379561	Robin146	Volunteer	5	05/10/2016	I learned about Best Friends from the Dogtown series on National Geographic.  When I was visiting Utah, I decided to make a stop at the Sanctuary.  I was so impressed with the work they were doing, I went back with 3 friends to volunteer for a week.  This inspired me to go back to my community of Jacksonville, Florida and volunteer as well.  In my work with the Jacksonville Humane Society and First Coast No More Homeless Pets, I discovered how much help Best Friends had given to Jacksonville in their strategic plan to achieve a city-wide "no-kill" status.  Monetary grants as well as planning assistance.  And Jacksonville has now been no-kill for two years. (meaning 90% of dogs and cats leave the shelters alive).  I have been back to volunteer at the Sanctuary as well and learn more everytime I visit.  I have also attending their annual conference where they provide seminars and speakers to help shelters across the country achieve a "no-kill" status.  All within their goal "to Save Them All".  They have made tremendous progress in helping to change the country's mindset in how to treat homeless pets.  I cannot say enough good things about the work they do.  And one of the main things I love is knowing my contributions don't just stay at the Sanctuary and disappear in someone's pocket - it is spread around the country to help all communities. The founders can sleep at night knowing they have truly made a difference!
Best Friends Animal Society	289319		/users/profile/379557	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	Best Friends is amazing! I brought them a broken kitten -- a stray that had been hit by a car. Her leg was broken and her tail had separated from her spine. Best Friends not only took in the kitten and fixed her broken leg, they also found a home for this sweet little cat. This was no ordinary feat -- since her tail had been separated from her spine, she would be incontinent for the rest of her life. Best Friends was able to find her a home with someone who had other incontinent cats. :)
Best Friends Animal Society	289318		/users/profile/379556	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	Best Friends in an amazing organization that has been leading the way for a long time towards a no kill nation!  
Best Friends Animal Society	289316		/users/profile/379554	Murly	Donor	5	05/10/2016	I follow Best Friends on Twitter and through email and I never fail to be moved by their commitment to saving animals.  Whether it's rehabilitating the Vick dogs (and proving that pit bulls, even those trained to fight, respond positively to love and care), rescuing animals from natural disasters and unnatural abuse, or providing health care to animals who are suffering, Best Friends is truly a best friend to those who are vulnerable and don't have a voice.  
Best Friends Animal Society	280894	5	/users/profile/370884	Dan_83	Donor	5	02/25/2016	If you ever looked for an animal shelter or group to donate to please go check Best Friends out. The job that this group does is beyond compare. The staff and volunteers in my humble opinion are the best that could be found. The job, no calling, that they do is a blessing that will I surely  earn them "Mega Points" in Heaven. You see that from the first time you read, or see or hear there story. The love that is given to any animal,regardless of size is unconditional. The care that is provided to them, is done only through the support of and by those of us that care. Be it ever so small or large it all helps. So help out and make the gift if you can that will help to bring hope and comfort to animals in TRUE need.   
Best Friends Animal Society	253094	10	/users/profile/341244	DMBslave	Volunteer	5	08/16/2015	This is my all-time favorite charity. I love all of the work they do for the animals in their care, as well as for other animal charity groups. It is clear to see that their motives are completely altruistic. 
Best Friends Animal Society	251130	12	/users/profile/339037	flashie1010	Volunteer	5	08/01/2015	Visiting Best Friends in Utah was one of the best experiences of my life.Not only did the scenery move me but the love and care from the caretakers brought me to tears.These animals have hit the jackpot so to say for ending up at Best Friends. I appauld their victory in rescuing the Victory dogs when no other organization would step up to. I am in awe for the CEO running 170 miles in the desert to raise funds.And lastly, I am so greatful that there are those kind people there that rescued  my babies(1 cat 1 dog), so that they could find their forever home with me.
Best Friends Animal Society	250905	8	/users/profile/338803	jackandjill	Donor	5	07/31/2015	I love Best Friends because they offer hope for  animals in need. They have worked to change legislation and the mindset regarding shelter animals. I appreciate the  Sanctuary and remembrance for pets that we have lost and will continue to donate to Best Friends. 
Best Friends Animal Society	248852	7	/users/profile/336641	daviskatia	Volunteer	5	07/19/2015	A place as dedicated to animal rescue as you can have it. A peaceful place which restores belief in humanity and hope for "Saving them all". Educated professionals and staff who make it easy to volunteer, learn, benefit and give. A wonderful place to visit. I attended a workshop and volunteered. My daughter volunteered while I was attending the workshop. It was a wonderful experience for both of us and us together. This place was started 31 years ago and grew and keeps on succeeding in saving, rehoming, healing, training animals with an incredible crew. To me it is a MUST to visit and a very wonderful experience as well as a place to come together as a family and unite interests. Please consider visiting Best Friends in Kanab. You won't regret it. Also, it is the center of fascinating National Parks and landscapes. A win/win!
Best Friends Animal Society	248584	6	/users/profile/336327	MarieGoble	Donor	5	07/15/2015	Best Friends is by far the hardest working group, and most effective group I know!  My sister and her husband take their four dogs and drive with every year with them during the summer to stay at Best Friends.  My sister cries every time her week at the sanctuary with the animals is up and it's time for them to return home. I donate to this non-profit at holidays, in honor of family and friends who are also animal lovers, and on loved ones' birthdays in place of things they neither need nor want.  The recipients are always so happy to have the donation made in their name.  Best Friends Animal Society takes excellent care of every species at their sanctuary and turns no animal in need away.  There are so many unwanted animals, and so many who are killed in shelters each year -- Best Friends is always working hard to change that.  They deserve this award and a ton of recognition. REMEMBER EVERYONE TO SPAY AND NEUTER -- its the RIGHT thing to do and prevents over-population!!!  Sincerely, Marie G.
Best Friends Animal Society	248279	7	/users/profile/335984	Nursey2	Donor	5	07/13/2015	I first became aware of Best Friends while searching for a rescue organization to support, after I discovered my local SPCA was NOT a No-Kill shelter as I believed.  I was intrigued by their mission to "Save Them All", and once I started receiving their magazine and reading about all the amazing programs this group has initiated, the legal avenues they have pursued to change laws regarding breed discrimination etc.,  and the assistance they provide to help communities realize these same goals, I was sold!  I made my first visit to the Sanctuary last Fall, where I volunteered for five days, and was blown away by the magnitude of their operation, the amazing people who work with and for these hurting animals, and the education they provide to those of us lucky enough to pass through their doors.
Best Friends Animal Society	247893	9	/users/profile/335534	Leslie78	Volunteer	5	07/09/2015	I volunteered for a week at the Utah sanctuary in May and "far exceeds expectations" is an understatement. I would give it 10 stars if I could.  I had known of the sanctuary for a few years and followed it online.  I felt like I knew what to expect from checking out the website numerous times for visitor information/ maps/ photos/ etc.  Boy, was I wrong.  The vast scope of the grounds is the first thing I had not anticipated.  The sanctuary covers a huge area and is incredibly scenic.  I was blown away by the cleanliness of the enclosures, the enrichment available, the organization, and amazing care givers and volunteers.  There is not only love and compassion behind the care of the animals, but plenty of research and science in terms of how they train, socialize, give the animals quality of life and the best chance of finding a forever family.  My group had two educational presentations with Dr. Frank McMillan, which I had not expected as part of the week, but which were extremely informative, thought provoking and made our week well-rounded in terms of what we took away from our experience.   Our volunteer program coordinator was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and just radiated joy and kindness.   Most of the sanctuary volunteers we encountered were the same.  The energy, fun and compassion was everywhere we went, and you couldn't help feeling the same way - it was like a giant lovefest!  The whole place is very definition of symbiosis - the people who visit want to play with and interact with as many animals as possible.  They get to do this when they clean enclosures (free labor, allowing money to be used elsewhere), when they take a cat out for a walk (socialization and enrichment for the cat), when the take a dog home for a sleepover (good training and enrichment for the dog) or any other number of activities.  What an amazing place!  I had wondered prior to visiting if I would feel sad throughout the week seeing abandoned and/or special needs animals, but after seeing the level of care the animals receive and knowing that 80% will be adopted (and the other 20% have a home at the sanctuary forever), I felt happy and hopeful for all of them.  I really can't say enough about this incredible organization.  I will definitely be back to volunteer again and again!
Best Friends Animal Society	247697	4	/users/profile/335295	BFASVolunteer	Volunteer	5	07/07/2015	I have been a volunteer for Best Friends Animal Society for 7 years. In that time, I've visited the sanctuary in Utah, worked at special adoption events, written for their website, and participated in seminars. I can attest that Best Friends "walks the walk." Everyone involved in the organization -- from the greeters to adoption counselors to caregivers -- believes that each animal is has intrinsic value. They will go to great lengths to make sure that each animal is treated with respect and great care. They do believe that we can "save them all" and they've made me believe it also. 
Best Friends Animal Society	247621	7	/users/profile/335203	dodgergirl222	Donor	5	07/06/2015	I used to get horrible mailers from other animal welfare organizations showing pictures of abused, neglected, sad animals in an effort to get me to send them money.  I threw them away without even opening them.  Best Friends Animal Society is the exact opposite:  I know when I see an email or mailer from them I am going to smile and feel good, so I open it right away!  They tell the success stories, and show pictures of the happy, healthy animals that they have helped to get that way.  It is exciting to be part of an organization that has great goals and a plan to get there.  I love to send them my donations, knowing that I am a part of something really special that is making a real difference all over the country!!
Best Friends Animal Society	247459	6	/users/profile/334998	BestFriendsSuperFan	General Member of the Public	5	07/04/2015	Wow!  These people believe in what they do, generate enthusiasm when they promote their cause, and inspire us animal lovers to do whatever we can to help.  They have a vision for the future and uniquely creative ways to get there.  Their No More Homeless Pets campaign has made such an amazing difference across the entire country in just a few years!  Even their animal photographers are the best.  I'd read so many good things about them that  I couldn't believe it was all true.  I finally had a chance to visit and volunteer for a week after they'd been in business 10 years  and I was awestruck.  It's even better than I could have imagined!
Best Friends Animal Society	247296	2	/users/profile/334813	Becca2617	Volunteer	5	07/02/2015	Best Friends will help us get to "no kill"! Their understanding of all animals is invaluable to the rest of us in trying to protect the animals and "Save them all". I have visited them twice to volunteer with their animals, and it is the best experience I have ever had! I will be back to volunteer again. I also have adopted a dog from them, one who needed work, and she was given that training before she came to me. They understand what the animals need, so they will go to their forever homes. The animal rescue movement would have stalled by now, if it weren't for Best Friends!!!
Best Friends Animal Society	247295	2	/users/profile/334812	cheekeymonkey	Donor	5	07/02/2015	Positive....one word to describe BFAS. There stories don't dwell on the bad...only the good and the changes they have made towards a better world for animals. They are inspirational!
Best Friends Animal Society	247225	1	/users/profile/334727	charlestonhist	Donor	5	07/02/2015	Best Friends fills such an important role in the animal rights/care community.   They advocate for and care for animals and educate the public about so many aspects of animal care and concerns.  This is one of the great charities in the U.S. and viewed highly by so many.
Best Friends Animal Society	246968	2	/users/profile/334427	caseyt	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	My friend and I volunteered for the first time this last weekend and were so impressed with the quality of the facilities. However we were even more impressed with the skills, devotion and loving kindness of all the caretakers we worked with.  We are in the process of building a fence so that we can adopt a dog  and we will definitely be back to volunteer again soon.  Kudos to Best Friends.   Karen Tomlinson 
Best Friends Animal Society	246915	1	/users/profile/334372	DocNDee	Volunteer	5	07/01/2015	My wife and I first heard about the work of Best Friends Animal Sanctuary ( that's what it was called then) early on in there existence from a friend of ours, and as people who always have loved animals, have watched them grow and become a national force, thanks to the commitment of those young animal loving young founders.We have been supporters for decades and honestly believe there is no finer animal charity in the country, or perhaps in the world. The compassion of the people of Best Friends is evidenced by their actions every day.Surely they played a major role in the movement of change for the better in the way we in this country view other sentient beings, those who share the planet with us. Like them, we hope for a day when there really are "No More Homeless Pets". As they at Best Friends say, "Together We Can Save Them All".We would encourage all who care about animals to give strong consideration to Best Friends Animal Society for their hard earned charitable donation dollars. Sincerely,Doc and Dee WheelerBay Village, Ohio

Best Friends Animal Society	246854	1	/users/profile/334302	LisaLeesa	Donor	5	06/30/2015	I had heard about Best Friends a few years ago through some fellow animal lovers and a couple years ago I bought the book "Best Friends" which tells the story of how they started out to what they have accomplished and grown to be now. It was amazing to read that there are actually people out there who are as crazy about animals as I am and it was incredible how much devotion and dedication those men and women had towards this cause that they all deeply believed in. I was blown away by the love that the founders of Best Friends, and all of those who helped them, had for animals and to see what they continue to do for animals to this day has completely restored my faith in humanity. Best Friends truly and genuinely care about the animal welfare and I admire the hard work and big hearts of all of those who are a part of it. They show that there really is a lot of good still left in the world and I respect and thank them for all that they do. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246814	2	/users/profile/334258	Llama	Donor	5	06/30/2015	I have visited Best Friends 3 times and there is a special sense just going onto the property.  Love for the animals is everywhere.  They save animals with profound problems.  Additionally they provide support to shelters all over the US.  Their goal is to save all animals.  If I have a problem or questions about my animals they are quick to answer my email.  I LOVE Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	246787	1	/users/profile/334230	Buster914	Volunteer	5	06/30/2015	I have volunteered at Best Friends for 8 years.  Not only is this a beautiful and peaceful place, it is the best 5 star rescue for animals.  The care and love the animals receive here is unbelievable.  The animals are  worked with so that they can be adopted to a forever home.  If that does not happen they have a great home for their life time.  Becoming a volunteer was one of the best decisions of my life.
Best Friends Animal Society	246785	1	/users/profile/334226	LHbydesign	General Member of the Public	5	06/30/2015	Best quality of care, no-kill shelter for all types of animals. They offer educational programs, TNR programs, work  against breed discrimination laws and are working with other cities helping them become no-kill. An amazing organization that is the model for all other shelter and rescue groups.
Best Friends Animal Society	246670		/users/profile/334076	saralonh	Volunteer	5	06/29/2015	Hi, I have volunteered at Best Friends and I loved it !! I spent one day with dogs and one day with horses. They were very organized, clean and helpful. They made the work we did fun and I felt so good about it I can't wait to do it again!! They deserve this award for all the caring and love they have shown all the animals they rescue.
Best Friends Animal Society	246630		/users/profile/334016	Janine6	Volunteer	5	06/29/2015	As both a donor (20+ yrs) and active volunteer (3+ yrs), I have watched this organization grow and thrive. They always do the right thing and do it right. They are great stewards of our donor money, making wise decisions for growth and expansion. And they provide volunteers with the support and training we need. They never lose sight of their mission - all of their plans and actions support their theme of 'Save them All'. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246622		/users/profile/273141	Smilenez	Donor	5	06/29/2015	I love this group, I love everything they stand for and everything they are doing to make the world a better place for animals who are so often overlooked. They ARE making a difference.  I look forward to the newsletter and the magazine and read both from beginning to end.   I am going on a road trip in July and am making it a point to stop and visit the home base in Kanab Utah.    
Best Friends Animal Society	246620		/users/profile/334005	JaniceLynn	Donor	5	06/29/2015	Best Friends is such an amazing place and cause for the animals. Like so very many wonderful animal nonprofits Best Friends is dedicated to all animals living the great lives that they deserve.  Best Friends however goes far beyond this great misson and is the leader in the field. BF helps other non-profits become non-kill shelters further contributing to the cause. They play a key leadership role with animal legislation. I often struggle to find ways to help the animals as the challenge is often overwhelming. Best Friends keeps me up to date via e-mail on both my state and national pending legislation that could affect the animals. They even go one step further and provide me with the contact information for my legislators so that I too can let my voice be heard. On a personal note - every year - in September - a special ceremony is held to remember all of the special animals who have crossed the sanctuary grounds.  The public is given the opportunity to send a memory of their animal friends to be included in the ceremony. I always look forward to including my 4 footed family members who have passed on in the special memories service at such as special place. Thank you Best Friends for all of the amazing work that you do!  
Best Friends Animal Society	246618		/users/profile/334002	gomiller5	Donor	5	06/29/2015	We took in a cat who turned out to have FIV and was too feisty for our other old cat to handle. Since most shelters won't take cats with FIV, we thought we'd have to put him down. But after exchanging emails with Best Friends, they agreed to take him! I drove the six hours to the sanctuary and left him in good hands, and after a year in their facility he was adopted. I got to tour Best Friends while I was dropping off the cat, and boy are they amazing! So much space, so many happy animals. They're just wonderful. I've been a donor ever since.
Best Friends Animal Society	246614		/users/profile/333996	lindamaymay	Donor	5	06/29/2015	I can't think of a place I'd rather donate to. How can you help but love every animal and want to see them in a forever home. This is what Best Friends does. They are the "BEST" ever and do what they do for love. God bless all of the people who work and volunteer to help the helpless.
Best Friends Animal Society	246612		/users/profile/333993	THuffman	Volunteer	5	06/29/2015	My visit to Best Friends in Utah was a highlight of my life. Spiritually uplifting, such a gift to humans as well as the thousands of animals that they protect and love....I can't wait to go back.  These are people with a mission, on a mission, and hearts as big and beautiful as the canyon they inhabit.  The Best Friends folks made sure that I was able to visit every area I hoped to see (the pigs! the pigs!) because I'd come from so far away (NYC) and my time there was limited.  Because of a disability, I volunteered walking the senior dogs, and had two dogs on sleepovers in a Best Friends cottage.  (Bless you Redbone & Marmaduke.)   I was made to feel that my contribution was every bit as important as the daily caregivers.  To say that the time I spent there was magical is not an exaggeration.  I was especially touched that the delicious Thanksgiving Feast served in the Best Friends restaurant was completely vegetarian, but the dogs in the kennels were treated with fresh turkey that day.  That said it all for me.  You can't visit Angels Rest without feeling the abiding spirit of the thousands of souls that have been saved and loved.....it is truly sacred ground.  Knowing that Best Friends will continue their very important mission makes me smile, with grateful tears.  These are beautiful people who above all, truly believe they can SAVE THEM ALL.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I will be back.
Best Friends Animal Society	246608		/users/profile/227352	NES1	Donor	5	06/29/2015	When it comes to helping animals of all varieties there is no place better than Best Friends Animal Society. They have for example, separate areas for dogs, cats, horses and pigs. They have a special area for wild animals too. Not only to they rescue and rehabilitate animals in need, but as in the case of the Michael Vick pit bulls, they retrain them to be the best pet they can be. They help, shy, agressive or just play scared dogs to be loving and sociable companions.
Best Friends Animal Society	246600		/users/profile/333975	MWvolunteer	Volunteer	5	06/29/2015	Best Friends is an amazing place to volunteer!  I would go back every year if I didn't live so far away! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246596		/users/profile/333969	DogsRule125	Donor	5	06/28/2015	I am constantly amazed at the scope of work done by Best Friends.  From the on-the-ground  work of caring for the physical and psychological needs of thousands of animals at their facility in Utah, to coordinating and supporting the efforts of other animal welfare organizations, to educating the public and advocating for animal welfare issues - this organization does it all.  The action they take everyday to create a nation in which no adoptable animal is killed in a shelter is incredibly inspiring to me. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246595		/users/profile/333968	peebjay63	Donor	5	06/28/2015	This is the most wonderful organization for the protection of  and help for helpless animals.  They truly love animals of all sorts and have their best interests at heart.  The lengths to which they will go to save the most desperate cases is truly heart-warming.   The love they show to animals is not political but heart-felt.   I thank them for their heroic efforts, and Jehovah God approves of their just actions.  Prov.12:10 
Best Friends Animal Society	246592		/users/profile/333965	FarmerGal	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2015	I have followed this charity for more than 25 years and one of the few that I trust to use the money for the animals.  Their good works are legend and growing every day.  I only give to charities for animals and war veterans as there have been to many people charities that have ripped off the contributors by using donations for salaries, advertising, meetings in Vegas, etc..  Best Friends is the best of the best!!!!!
Best Friends Animal Society	246584		/users/profile/333960	Sapphire D.	General Member of the Public	5	06/28/2015	I see their wonderful stories and how happy and cared for the animals are they deserve all the help they can get cause so many animals need rescued and to know they are loved. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246577		/users/profile/333953	Thisisstupid	Volunteer	5	06/28/2015	I first found out about BF when vacationing in Utah and visited there by accident.  Since then I have been an ardent fan and supporter as they are dedicated and have helped saved countless animal lives.  In particular, when the horrors of Michael Vick surfaced, BF rushed in to help, knowing the consequences may not have turned out well.  They also help in many national disasters and spend many, many days there to help the pets after Hurricane Katrina.  I look forward to  volunteering at BF in Utah one of these days.
Best Friends Animal Society	246572		/users/profile/333948	Rin15	Donor	5	06/28/2015	The thing that drew me to Best Friends is that it was started by a bunch of animal-loving friends who just wanted to make a difference in the world.  A critical element of their success is that they educate the public about and advocate for matters that make the most difference in the animals'  lives that they care about.  They reach out to communities, groups, and even to individuals when needed, and they have indeed changed the world.  Thanks Best Friends!!
Best Friends Animal Society	246565		/users/profile/333943	kemasica	Donor	5	06/28/2015	Best Friends????   You've gotta be kidding, right?   Well, let ME tell you about Best Friends.   First, I am the "parent" of eight (8) yes, eight "fur babies".... 4 dogs (Bailey, Murphy McTuffy, Tobey and Gabriel); 4 cats (Shamus, Baxter, Bella and Diva (the last two belonged to my brother but he could not take them to his new residence so, I took them in)  {What's one more fur baby].   Anyway, Best Friends has helped me through some rough times when one of my fur babies went on to Rainbow Bridge.   Best Friends is where I found this resting place.   I try to donate as much as I can because we really need to "SAVE THEM ALL".   Shelters can be so cruel and non-loving.   Any non-profit organization should really stand up and cheer these people and be proud to do so as well.
Best Friends Animal Society	246564		/users/profile/333942	purplecats17	Donor	5	06/28/2015	We visited Best Friends while on vacation in Zion a couple years ago.  We changed our trust to allow Best Friends to care for any animals we have at our deaths if other homes are not found for them.  We are also regular contributors and are changing to a monthly donation today.  Not only is Best Friends an incredible stand-alone facility with state-of-the-art care, but it's outreach programs assure a nation-wide approach to saving and training as many animals as possible, making sensible legislative changes to puppy mills and breed-specific laws, and educating animal caregivers across the country.
Best Friends Animal Society	246539	1	/users/profile/333920	Irisp	Volunteer	5	06/28/2015	The  care given to  these animals is outstanding,   My blood pressure lowers, my breathing slows and I just enjoy the warmth and love that surrounds me at the sanctuary.  Every visit it to short.
Best Friends Animal Society	246538	1	/users/profile/333911	dog_mom_in_utah	Volunteer	5	06/28/2015	I have supported BFAS financially since the 1990s and visited the sanctuary several times to volunteer.  The work they do on behalf of homeless animals is nothing short of amazing, and the sanctuary itself is a magical place.  I love BFAS so much that my husband and I spent our honeymoon volunteering there in 2006, and our anniversary there several years later.  We adopted dogs on both occasions; they continue to fill our lives with joy and remind us of daily of the mission to Save Them All!
Best Friends Animal Society	246537	1	/users/profile/333910	Leae	Donor	5	06/28/2015	As a senior citizen, sometimes I get a little "blue".  I go to the Best Friends sight to give me a reason to keep on going.  Just looking at the wonderful things they do for pets that wouldn't have a chance otherwise, it keeps my spirits up.  Best Friends helps me much more than I help them with my donations.  Thanks, Best Friends, for making me feel part of something larger than myself, and something so good.
Best Friends Animal Society	246532	1	/users/profile/333902	Pat_65	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	I first leaned about Best Friends many years ago.  As a volunteer with various  animal welfare organizations, it seemed as if everyone i worked with  knew about Best Friends and admired the organization.  And, of course, I watched National Geographic  Dogtown series featuring  Best Friends rescue of Michael Vicks' dogs.  Each episode increased my admiration for Best Friends.  They are undoubtedly one of the few if not the only animal welfare organization that has the expertise to rehabilitate these dogs.   But beyond their expertise is the kindness and compassion that is so evident.  Several of my fellow volunteers who have visited Best Friends describe it as a wonderful and special place.  I intended to visit myself---even had the plane ticket-- but due to some health concerns at the time I was not able to come.   Friends who have visited jokingly say that maybe it was a good thing that I had to cancel my trip because if I went , I would never want  to leave.  Seriously, these are the absolutely glowing remarks I hear.  My friends and I all agree that we look forward to receiving Best Friends' magazine because it makes you feel good to know that such a place exits and is dedicated to helping all animal regardless how much medical attention and care they need.  When deciding which animal welfare organization to give my granddaughter (she is ten) a membership Best Friends immediately came to mind.  So for Xmas I gave her a Best Friends' t-shirt, a membership and a copy of the book "Best Friends: The True Story of the World's Most Beloved Animal Sanctuary".  After reading the book she asked if we could visit sometime, so hopefully the two of us will  be making the trip to Angel canyon someday.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246531	1	/users/profile/333901	Katstar	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2015	Anything and everything related to Best Friends never fails to put a smile on my face and warmth in my heart--no matter how down I am.  Just like my furry children.  I have never felt more sure of giving/donating to an organization.  I always know that Best Friends will use it wisely.
Best Friends Animal Society	246530	1	/users/profile/333900	Beachmom	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	Best Friends  Animal Society is doing remarkable work to save animals at its facility in Utah as well as in other locations across the country. I attended Best Friends No More Homeless Pets conference in Vegas in 2009.  This was one of the most inspiring events in my adult life.  I wish all shelters could adopt the no-kill standard , especially the county shelters in the South that destroy thousands of companion animals every year.  Best Friends' magazine is another example of greatness in that it provides  such interesting, informative articles but never in a sad, depressing way.  The tone is always positive -- none of those terrible pictures of abused, suffering animals that turn people away.  Best Friends Animal Society is the best!
Best Friends Animal Society	246524	1	/users/profile/333897	Kathleen97	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	I discovered Best Friends from a copy of their magazine at the giveaway table at the local library.  I decided to take a workshop with them in 2012 and the visit was magical!  Here was a place were I could go on vacation and bring a dog home with me every night from the shelter (in pet friendly accommodation, of course!).  I was in heaven working with dogs each day as a volunteer but it didn't feel like work.  And the setting is humbling and peaceful - you truly get away from it all.  We are truly blessed that these baby boomer/groupies pooled their resources all those years ago to form the sanctuary.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246518	1	/users/profile/333891	DMB1	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	Best Friends has spent 30 years helping the animals that have no voice.  This organization has taken over 6 cats that would never be adopted in our local shelter and having just visited them I have seen first hand how wonderful the environment is for these otherwise disposable animals.
Best Friends Animal Society	246515	1	/users/profile/333888	bje41	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	As a long time visitor to Best Friends Sanctuary I can truth fully  say it is Chicken Soup for the Animal lovers Soul.  Thanks to the fantastic visions of the founders this sanctuary is a place to visit when you get overwhelmed with animal rescue in your area.  To know that there is actually a place where unwanted pets can go and find fantastic forever homes is truly soothing to your soul.  My granddaughters and I have many wonderful memories of our trips and come home willing to continue the battle.
Best Friends Animal Society	246514	2	/users/profile/333886	dgard5055	Donor	5	06/27/2015	Best Friends is one of the few consistent and unwavering organizations that is a true savior of all animals. Their no-kill sanctuary is a huge and necessary God-send for animals and all humane humans who care about the well-being of animals. Best Friends has gone above & beyond to not only save the abused, tortured, terrorized and society discarded innocent lives of all animals but also work diligently and relentlessly to change laws and change societal misconceptions to protect all innocent and unfortunate creatures. It is an honor and pleasure to be a small part of supporting them with my annual, yet small donations. They very much deserve to be recognized and rewarded for all that they do and have done for many, many decades.  True angels of love & mercy!
Best Friends Animal Society	246512	1	/users/profile/333882	MaxTone	Client Served	5	06/27/2015	We adopted our beloved Aussie from Best Friends Animal Society.  We traveled 1,500 miles to adopt Balou and that was the best trip we ever made!  He was cared for lovingly by his caretakers, as are all the animals at BF.    If the animals can't be in a permanent forever home, this is the next best place they could be.  The sanctuary is clean, well-organized and very well-run by the caring and dedicated staff.  We were so impressed at how the housing for the dogs, cats, birds, horses, farm animals, etc. were designed for maximum comfort for each species, and how each animal got special attention from their caretakers.  The accommodations on-site are great, and the fact that they let their animal residents have overnight visits with visitors and potential adopters is a wonderful policy.  They take in animals that would be turned away elsewhere and rehabilitate them, such as the Michael Vick dogs and animals with special needs.  I can't say enough good things about BF.  They do so much for homeless animals and try so hard to find them forever homes.  I only wish we lived closer so we could be regular volunteers.  We love BF!
Best Friends Animal Society	246510		/users/profile/333880	Narrowdog	Donor	5	06/27/2015	Compassion, understanding, educating, caring and sharing - what a wonderful organization.   The caring extends from life's beginning to life's inevitable end for the creatures who make out lives whole.  Had I known about Best Friends when I was younger, I'd be there as a volunteer!   Great leaders, great organization with a wonderful mission - Save Them All!!
Best Friends Animal Society	246503		/users/profile/333876	edtowner	Donor	5	06/27/2015	Best Friends is an amazing charity.  I believe they are responsible stewards of the money that I can donate.  Their dedication to the animals and their well being is apparent in their mailings and websites.  I also appreciate that the facility is open to the public and visits are encouraged so that donors can see what their money is doing!  Keep up the great work.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246501		/users/profile/333873	Judy141	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	I have visited Best Friends Animal Society over the years and have always walked away with both a smile on  my face and heart. All the employees and volunteers are sincerely loving individuals whose soul purpose is to provide comfort, love, compassion, friendship and an extra cuddle and kisses when needed. They have always taken in the "unwanted", injured and ones that had "given up on love"!  It is my opinion, as I have worked in the animal industry for years, the last angel these animals have!  God bless everyone at Best Friends for what you do on a daily basis!

Best Friends Animal Society	246489		/users/profile/333862	dbon	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2015	I have known of and donated to Best Friends for almost twenty years. I love the fact that all the animals live in a real sanctuary, while waiting for their forever homes. And should they not be adopted, those animals will liveout their lives in a safe and loving environment. And all animals are welcome. I know people who have spent their vacations volunteering at Best Friends. They said it was one of the most worthwhile things they have ever done. I hope to make it out there one day as well, to help with the great work Best Friends does. I know that when I donate to Best Friends my money is being spent wisely and well. Thank you to all who have made Best Friends a success.
Best Friends Animal Society	246488		/users/profile/227199	HikerLinda	Donor	5	06/27/2015	I've been a supporter of this outstanding nonprofit for years and years. And I had the opportunity to visit the sanctuary last year. Wonderful! The people are truly dedicated to the welfare of animals. They led the animal rescue effort after Katrina and are the linchpin of the No More Homeless Pets program. Since that program started the number of homeless pets that have been euthanized has dropped by millions. Best Friends saves lives of innocent animals and, for that, I have made them one of the nonprofits I always donate to. Wish I could afford to donate more.
Best Friends Animal Society	246487		/users/profile/333858	RJillDickman	Donor	5	06/27/2015	I have been donating to Best Friends since the 1980's, and they have never failed to impress me.  Not only have they rescued thousands of  animals, they have been instrumental in changing the the country's attitude toward animals.  It used to be considered abnormal to think of animals as cognizant beings who deserved  our respect, attention, and care.  Now people are much more likely to be called into question and held accountable if they don't.  I attribute this change  almost entirely to the efforts of Best Friends.The no-kill movement, elimination of puppy mills, and trap/neuter/return program all originated at Best Friends and have been extremely effective.  But the change that I think has been underrated can be seen in the newsletters, emails, and other fund-raising literature sent from Best Friends,  which contain happy stories and lovable pictures of the animals saved.  This approach pulls people in and shows them what animal advocacy can do as opposed to the horrifying stories used by so many other rescue organizations that elicit an avoidance response and turn people away from animal rescue.I have only been able to visit the sanctuary once, but seeing the work of Best Friends up close confirmed my positive opinion of the organization.
Best Friends Animal Society	246479		/users/profile/333846	Sandy405	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	The Best Friends Animal sanctuary in Kanab UT is a must-visit destination for animal lovers and those involved in animal rescue. However, what most impresses me about BFAS is their outreach to shelters nationwide, sharing information, training and resources with a network of smaller shelters. One example is their "Back in Black" adoption event which promotes the often overlooked black cats and dogs with reduced adoption fees. I'm proud to shout out for Best Friends!
Best Friends Animal Society	246478		/users/profile/333845	Tess22	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2015	Outstanding communicators and advocates. First learned of them during Katrina aftermath and have followed their work since as well as donating. I think they are unique in their ability to influence through their gift for presenting the stories of animals who need help and whom they have helped through their large network.
Best Friends Animal Society	246473		/users/profile/333840	Eyoung22	Volunteer	5	06/27/2015	I wanted to do something meaningful for my 65th birthday, so my husband and I decided to volunteer for a few days at Best Friends.  What an incredible, heartwarming experience.  We plan to go back with our grandchildren, so that they can get into the spirit of giving back and paying it forward.Evie Young
Best Friends Animal Society	246471		/users/profile/333836	isomtodd	Donor	5	06/27/2015	Best Friends is truly a friend to all animals. This is the place that should set an example to all shelters, to the world that 'they can all be saved'. Writing a review is terrifically hard because I cannot say enough about their wonderful staff, their ideals, their high level if caring...well, I could go on and on. They deserve all the help they can get to carry on their wonderful work.Thank you 
Best Friends Animal Society	246470		/users/profile/333833	Fluiditiess	Donor	5	06/27/2015	Best Friends is differnt from other animal rescue organizations. Instead of focussing on all of the pain and suffering that the animals are going through, trying to guilt me into giving to their group, Best Friends celebrates the animals and shows me the amazing things my money is doing for them. They focus on the loving things instead of the hateful things-- something that I feel makes them quite unique. I love giving to them, talking about them, helping them in whatever ways I can because I know that they are helping the animals that I love-- and really, they are helping me. It's rare for me to find an organization that I can get behind 100%. I trust Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	246468		/users/profile/333831	Uggi2015	Donor	5	06/27/2015	Best Friends is an awesome organization.  If you have read any of their newsletters, you can see the wonderful things they do for all animals that cross their path and are lucky enough to be taken to Best Friends for care, feeding and a loving place to stay until their Forever Home comes along.  My husband and I visited Best Friends in Angel Canyon, Kanab, Utah, several years ago.  After a tour, we went home and had a Family Trust drawn up, leaving all of our assets  to Best Friends since all of our children have fur and four legs.  My faith in this being a good move is renewed with each and every newsletter.   
Best Friends Animal Society	246462		/users/profile/333826	AnnePal	General Member of the Public	5	06/27/2015	WE visited Best Friends while on vacation and I was so impressed with their organization. Their compassion is clearly seen in the treatment of the animals and how they speak to the public about what they do and why. Their hearts are huge and they re proud of their facility and what they accomplish there. All the areas were spotless and all the animals were secure and safe and as happy as they could be until they find their forever homes . Best Friends is prepared to give them all the time they need and all the special training they need to live in a home environment  or to keep them on sight if they need a place to live out their lives. They are an awesome organization and I hope to go back next year and spend a couple weeks volunteering.

The love and kindness that goes into caring for these gentle souls is unsurpassed and their mission statement should be that of all animal welfare agencies in the country.
Best Friends Animal Society	246457		/users/profile/333821	DDmom	Client Served	5	06/26/2015	I adopted a dog (DD) from Best Friends in 2011 and had him brought up to Canada. I told them where I lived, what my life was like and about my other dog Trevor and my cat Chloe. I was really honest..to the point I thought that they wouldn't adopt to me or have a dog that fit. I lived in an apartment, in a small tourist town (lots of people at times) and my other dog had leash reactivity to lots of things. DD was on his way and reality set in. I was bringing in a dog from another country that I had never met and he needed to be ok with other pets, using an elevator and being around lots of people. I hoped for the best that they knew their animals and that DD would fit in or somehow I could make it work. DD arrived and he joined our family like he always belonged. As he was more an alpha dog and protective my other dogs behavior suddenly improved. He let DD take charge and was way less reactive on our walks...walks were now enjoyable!! The whole process was painless, professional and easy. DD was the perfect dog for us and us for him...a match made in heaven...also know as Best Friends. Thank you!!
Best Friends Animal Society	246455		/users/profile/333818	phyllis891	Client Served	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is the only national animal organization that spends it funds on helping animals rather than a large overhead. When the hurricane hit New Orleans then went in and took a staff of 40 people, build a 400 animal shelter and stayed for a couple of months before turning it over to local animal group. Other national organizations went in for a few days, did lots of publicity and then left not really helping the animals much.Best Friends has an outstanding outreach program helping smaller rescue groups and paying for a lot of spay/neuters to stop the birth of unwanted puppies and kittens.
Best Friends Animal Society	246453		/users/profile/333816	gardenspirit	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Being the largest no kill animal sanctuary in the country Best Friends provides extraordinary services  to heal all animals in a loving & caring way. Their goal to save them all is truly a matter of ethics and guidance of the heart. A moral obligation that is acted out over & over again by their continued efforts to stop the killing of all companion animals. This is a rescue community that constantly finds ways to move thru challenges, turning tragedy into a living success. They have changed the face of animal welfare by giving every animal  a chance to rightfully survive and live to their fullest potential. My support for them is ever constant & it is an honor to do.  I cannot thank each and every individual enough for their courage & strength to always do the right thing. The spirit of hope is amazing!

Staff was very welcoming and the animals were well cared for and seemed happy. my wife and I felt such a connection to the place we are considering a permanent move to Kanab. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246448		/users/profile/333811	Caterina826	Donor	5	06/26/2015	My husband and I are donors and volunteers. All of the work that Best Friends does is amazing! As an organization, they're both passionate and productive. They identify the top issues and face them head on to make a difference. We always look forward to receiving their newsletters, emails updates and magazine, and we can't wait for our upcoming trip to the sanctuary. Thank you for being so awesome and making such a difference in the lives of so many animals!

Help to stop puppy mills and to get the word out to adopted not buy . I tell everyone I meet about Best Friends and tell them it is a wonderful place to visit and donate. Thank so so much !! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246446		/users/profile/333808	casadebliss	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends represents to me the ultimate goal we dog rescuers/fosters can aspire to. I'm involved in a very small network of fosters for abandoned dogs and puppies in northern Mexico, and for three years I have followed Best Friends' activities and read about their accomplishments via their website and emails, hoping someday to travel to Utah and see it for myself.  They inspire me with hope that we can make a difference in our community, with new ideas and projects like the Strut Your Mutt, Back in Black, Pit Sisters training program, and the promotions that make it possible to fly new adoptees to their new homes for free. I've studied and learned from their guidelines for fostering and for putting on successful adoption events. We have nothing like the resources here that Best Friends have developed, but I'm hoping that what we've learned from them will help keep our enthusiasm and determination alive.Bliss Cochran, Secretary/Communications Officer, San Carlos Pet Adoption (San Carlos, Sonora, MX)
Best Friends Animal Society	246445		/users/profile/333804	Marty V.	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I've been a donor for many years and can only marvel at how far-reaching Best Friends' influence has become. I was born in Los Angeles and lived there for 46 years; seeing them start NKLA just amazes me. This organization rescued animals after Katrina, even when they weren't allowed to do so - bravely doing the right thing at the necessary time. They step up to rescue animals from hoarders and were instrumental in saving the lives of Michael Vicks canine victims from court ordered euthanasia. Their experts have testified in breed specific lawsuits to stop that insanity and have proven the TNR way to handle feral cats is the right thing to do. I can't do the work they do, all I can do is support them to to best of my ability. We need to recognize not only the work of Best Friends but of all the other organizations with whom they partner across the country 
Best Friends Animal Society	246439		/users/profile/333794	JBHB	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I have volunteered with Best Friends on 2 occasions in Kanab, UT.  The location is gorgeous and peaceful.  The staff is very dedicated and very appreciative of any help a volunteer can give.  Under their guidance working with the animals is a terrific experience.   Although you give your time, you gain a lot of experience  and knowledge of  animals.  They also have an hour plus  tour program where you visit some of their animal housing and are acquainted with their goals.  This is a great introduction for all ages and you leave feeling you want to return to be a volunteer.  Keep up the good work Best Friends!!  
Best Friends Animal Society	246438		/users/profile/333793	Stacy62	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	When my daughter was 10 she found a Best Friends ad online and asked if we could vacation and volunteer there. It was never a vacation we could afford, flying the whole family to the west coast, lodging, meals, rental car, etc. But I always kept it in the back of my mind and vowed that one day I would get her there. Fast forward to June 17, 2015, two days after her high school graduation. Walking into Cat Headquarters to check in for our first volunteer shift we knew we had found our home away from home. Best Friends is not your typical animal shelter. It truly is a Sanctuary. A place of refuge and safety. A place of love and healing. A place of second chances. The care that is given to these animals blew me away. The complete commitment that every single caretaker  (be it grounds caretaker, maintenance caretaker or animal caretaker) exudes is extraordinary. I felt their positivity and love for not only the animals, but this sacred place known as Angel Canyon. I also observed just how much it must cost on a daily basis to keep Best Friends running at this standard. We observed feeding times, and how many animals require special diets for medical reasons. Having two pets at home on prescription diets, I know first hand this expense. We cleaned puppy and bunny runs and witnessed just how much laundry is done each and every day to ensure the animals are kept clean and comfortable. We watched as one of the two washing machines in the bunny house had to be replaced. Not surprising considering the workout these machines get 365 days a year. We spent time with cats who are living with treatable but incurable illnesses and realized that they are getting exactly the medical care that they individually need. And having had my own pets with special needs, I know how staggering the vet bills can be. Not to mention the power bills to keep the runs cool in the desert heat, the water bills to keep the laundry and dishes clean, the list goes on. One thing that really impressed me was the amount of toys and "entertainment" available to the animals. I've never seen this at an animal shelter. Proving to me that the animals mental wellbeing is being nurtured as well as their physical wellbeing. I have never committed to giving on a regular basis to any charity or organization. However Best Friends is doing "it" right and I wi support them. This sanctuary should be the model for all animal shelters around the county.....around the world! I am writing this sitting in the airport on my way home from Kanab. It was a truly life-changing trip for my daughter and I. What I thought would be a one-time "graduation trip" will now be an annual trip for us. I am so thankful for Best Friends and everything they are doing to Save Them All.

Best Friends Animal Society	246437		/users/profile/333791	buttercup180	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I have supported Best Friends for several years.  I spread  the information about no-kill by sharing the magazine in my medical practice.  I enjoy seeing kids get the magazine down and read it while I see Mom,Dad or siblings. I encourage the kids to take the magazines home.   I applaud their selfless hard work and they do deserve to be a member of the GreatNonprofits community.
Best Friends Animal Society	246435		/users/profile/333787	hannahplus2	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends Animal Society is a wonderful organization.  I recently volunteered in Kanab, UT.  I was impressed with the sanctuary and all of the staff.  It was easy to see that all of the animals are well cared for and that the staff are there because of their love for animals.  Whenever I send a donation to Best Friends, I know that my money is going to help the animals, so I love to give whenever I can.
Best Friends Animal Society	246434		/users/profile/333785	babycleo1	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I went to Best Friends about 4 years ago.  I have been involved with a volunteer organization in PA for about 13 years, so I had some experience.  I was just so mesmerized by what they did there and how organized, clean, attentive they all were.  This place is unbelievable and what they do for EACH ANSD EVERY animal is amazing.  I vowed when my daughter was old enough 9 6 years) that I would return and volunteer there.  trust me, we will be planning a family volunteer vacation within the next few years.  I am a proud supporter of best Friends and everything they stand for and everything they do...from a small mean cut into small pieces for the cat who has no teeth...to the senior dog who cannot walk that they carry outside - their hearts are for the animals.
Best Friends Animal Society	246433		/users/profile/333784	weanut	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I have known about & supported Best Friends Animal Society for many years now. I knew they had a big sanctuary for many different domesticated animals out in Utah. I only found out by chance about a year ago that they were taking root here in my hometown of NYC! All our animals come from the city shelter, NYCACC, which is an open-admission and sadly the last 'kill' shelter left here. They are then fostered or boarded, & we have a group of resident cats at a Petsmart store in East Harlem. We have as many adoption events as possible, including 2 'Super Adoptions' each year, where hundreds of homeless pets find homes. I also volunteer with ACC, & have seen the impact that Best Friends as well as other groups have made on their live release rate, it has skyrocketed over the last couple of years. It is a truly wonderful thing to watch. Best Friends slogan is 'Save Them All'. There are Best Friends efforts in other cities such as Los Angeles, so the slogan is well on its way to becoming a reality. Thank you Best Friends!
Best Friends Animal Society	246432		/users/profile/333783	BirdLady3	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	I love Best Friends because they are a no-kill shelter and provide a great,loving home for ALL  animals!
Best Friends Animal Society	246428		/users/profile/333779	Deba55	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I have been a donor of Best Friends for many years.  I love that they are a no-kill animal rescue.  I got the opportunity to volunteer there for a few days last year with my human "best friend".  We planned a vacatioin so we could meet and go there.  It was such a wonderful time. We got to see the beautiful grounds and meet the people that care for the animals.  Each animal is treated with the utmost care and respect.  It was wonderful to see.  The facilities are so clean and set up for the needs of the animals.  So much love and kindness is hard to find in any one place.  I am a huge fan of Best Friends and the work that they do for the creatures that need our help
Best Friends Animal Society	246427		/users/profile/333778	Martin2015	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Two of my siblings have volunteered for and also adopted from Best Friends. We love the spirit of everyone connected to this group. In our village , the library has the best friends magazine which is full of good stories. The children especially love to read about the animals and birds living at Best Friends. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246423		/users/profile/333774	Gretchen12	Client Served	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends Animal Society is awesome, not only because I adopted my wonderful dog from there, but because they do everything in their power to help the animals! No matter the issue with the animal, be it physical or behavioral, they spare no expense (time or money) to help the animal, and the animals are only laid to rest when it is truly in the best interest of the animal. The well-being of the animal is always the number one priority and the care the animals receive at Best Friends is the best in the world! And if an animal isn't able to be adopted it can spend the remainder of its life safely at Best Friends, without the risk of euthanasia (unless medically necessary). The Best Friends Animal Sanctuary is such as amazing place that when I adopted my dog I felt bad about taking him from such a loving & enriched environment! But then they reminded me that my dog deserved to have a home (and couch!) to call his own and that his departure meant that they would be able to take in and help another dog. Thank you to ALL of the Best Friends staff, volunteers, donors, and supporters! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246421		/users/profile/333771	Jenseely	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is indeed an impressive organization that cares for 1700+ animals at any given moment. Their methods of care are positive, as well as successful and the education provided to anyone who might be interested is invaluable. I have also been impressed with their ability to greatly affect change on a large scale with things such as the No More Kill Movement through example of how to do this, use of funds and again, effective education. They truly set the gold standard for the very difficult job of rescuing and rehabbing animals of all types and teaching all of us why it is so very important!
Best Friends Animal Society	246419		/users/profile/333767	Lesneff	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/26/2015	I have known about Best Friends for years.  They have made such a HUGE impact on So. Cal. animal problems with adoptions, spay neuter programs and other general programs.  I am director of a small non profit cat rescue and they work hand in hand with us and so many others.  They lead in team building in making us all better and more effective.  I can't imagine a world without Best Friends!
Best Friends Animal Society	246417		/users/profile/333766	cmantello	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I have been a donor to Best Friends for many years.  They do everything for an animal in need.  I'm constantly amazed at the conditions and injuries that can be taken care of at Best Friends.  The fact that they are working toward more no-kill shelters and also no more homeless pets is one of the reasons I donate. But the thing I like best is what my small amounts of money can do,  I feel as if I'm helping projects like NKLA and NKUT from my small town in Washington state. These people are angels. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246415		/users/profile/333764	DeborahCox05	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is the only animal charity that I donate to because I am confident that the money goes to helping animals, and not into someone's pocket.  Their dedication to animals of all species goes above and beyond every single time.  Their efforts to educate people, and their motto of "together we can save them all" is right in line with my personal beliefs; therefore, I willingly give as much and as often as I can.  Best Friends Animal Society deserves the title of a great nonprofit.
Best Friends Animal Society	246413		/users/profile/333763	jsacco	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends really appreciates their volunteers which makes me feel great about giving time and money to this organization.  They give us lots and lots of training, are very flexible about our availability, and give us appreciation parties and other things frequently.  They are one of the best places I give my time, and it makes me smile when I'm there, knowing I am part of such a great organization accomplishing such a worthwhile goal.

Best Friends Animal Society	246410		/users/profile/333759	tfrazier55	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I have been a Best Friends Animal Society member for many years! I am so proud of everything this group does for animals! I was able to volunteer one summer for two half days with the cats & dogs. It was one of the most rewarding things I have ever done! I am now a Board member of the Oologah Animal Shelter and Adoption Services (OASAS) in Oologah Oklahoma because of what Best Friends has taught me about caring for abandoned animals. The society supplies so much information, the magazine, online, answers if you email or call. I am also amazed at the work the society does with other shelters and states. I now have 2 rescued dogs and would have more if I could. Thanks to all! Teresa S. Frazier, PhD, RN
Best Friends Animal Society	246409		/users/profile/333758	Woody0218	Volunteer	4	06/26/2015	I have been volunteering for Best Friends Animal Society for 6 or 8 years. Sure, it's because I love animals. And because I love seeing homeless animals find permanent, loving families. But here's what makes Best Friends special: They're not just another animal rescue group. They run SuperAdoption and Strut Your Mutt events that help small rescue groups with few resources participate in big and well-publicized events. And that means even more dogs and cats find even better homes.
Best Friends Animal Society	246405		/users/profile/137845	Nance K.	Client Served	5	06/26/2015	Many years ago I saw a cat on the Best Friends Website.  Bailey was 8ish years old at the time, declawed and had been found on an LA street.   She had stomatitis and all of her teeth had been removed after she got to Best Friends, though she still needed a checkup by the dental vet in Phoenix following the last extraction.  I drove up to Best Friends, meet her, and brought her home.  She was a big sweetheart, and got along with my other cats right away.  She passed her dental checkup with flying colors and lived to be 18 here, happy and healthy.  I missed her whole bunches when she crossing the Rainbow Bridge while I was on vacation. Without Best Friends Bailey Paws would probably have been euthanized.
Best Friends Animal Society	246404		/users/profile/333753	chlmetaxa	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is the best at what they do on a daily basis - save lives. They not only save lives of a variety of animals, but sometimes it even may help save a human life. A person can come to Best Friends just to volunteer and realize that they have made  connection with an animal. That person adopts that animal. Some of these animals have been waiting many years to get into a home where they will be loved - although they receive love everyday at Best Friends Animal Society. They are a no-kill sanctuary. They also have helped with many initiatives to help save animals and to educate the public about animals in shelters, and those that have been abused and neglected. They truly reflect the goal of saving all lives.
Best Friends Animal Society	246403		/users/profile/333749	tiford	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	My role is not just volunteer.  It is adopter, donor, and biggest fan all rolled into one.  This place is so very special and so important for our 4 legged friends.  Without Best Friends, so many amazing animals would have no chance.  But with Best Friends, every day is a joyful celebration for so many of our best friends.  My beautiful Lia was adopted from BF and I know for a fact, without their no kill policy, their amazing care and other resources, and their incredible commitment to our furry friends, Lia wouldn't be here today.  As it is she is spoiled rotten ... and my life is full of joy and hilarity (she's a mischievous nut and I love it!).  Thank you BF for all you do, most notably saving and enriching the lives of so many of us 2 and 4-leggeds!  
Best Friends Animal Society	246402		/users/profile/333747	Madeline8	Donor	5	06/26/2015	everything I've read about best friends  and have seen in their mag. and one the site , indicates they're a top rated  organization . if I  lived closer and were in better health I'd be the first one at the door to volunteer . we need more caring people like the ones at best friends .
Best Friends Animal Society	246401		/users/profile/333748	Carolyn93	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I love this nonprofit for so many reasons! 1) they have an amazing mission to "Save Them All". 2) They share their financial success with other nonprofits that share their vision, spreading the knowledge, money, value and inspiration from 31 years of effort. 3) Best Friends has started something fantastic from nothing. A vision to help homeless animals has grown into such a movement in animal rescue with an amazing sanctuary and several adoption centers (and beyond). 4) Best Friends location in Kanab, Utah is heaven on earth - the staff love what they do and it shows in their efforts, they way they treat the volunteers, the condition of the animals, the upkeep of the sanctuary, etc. Then, on top of all that, they offer to share with anyone that wants to see it, experience it, live it! Truly inspirational! 5) You can see from many places in the Sanctuary how much they really do with their donations. Best Friends is always looking for ways to be better and smarter with engaging their staff with innovative and educational outlets, and thinking of new and creative ways to enrich the animals lives with walks, pools, sprinklers, toys, tree branches, stroller rides, mud puddles, play, love, etc. Not to mention the upgraded and growing facilities for the animals and staff, wonderful care, feeding and condition of the grounds, educational outreach and truly inspiring marketing efforts. 6) Engaging volunteers from any and everywhere! Even if you have never been to a Best Friends facility, you can feel like such a big part of their mission. If you have been to the sanctuary, you count the days until you can get back there again.  It is such a wonderful organization, they do so much for so many, animals and people alike!  Thank you Best Friends for what you do! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246400		/users/profile/333745	Vicki61	Donor	5	06/26/2015	When in Utah, my husband and I visited Angel Canyon and it  was breathtaking!  The people there do soooo much for animals of all species and the facility is amazing.  Animals of all ages either find homes through their programs or live out their lives in comfort  with loving folks to care for them.  I can't say enough for the people, the place, the cemetary, the love that abounds there!
Best Friends Animal Society	246399		/users/profile/333744	carlahamill	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends Animal Society has my complete  love and support.

Providing medical care, medicine, surgeries, emotionalsupport.....whatever it is for the animals they do it.......and with love.  I support this charity in any way i canand when i die they get half of everything i own.  Life is so much better for our beloved animals with BestFriends in the world.

Best Friends Animal Society	246397		/users/profile/333741	4HorseLover	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends goes to the nth degree to save an animal's life, if it's at all possible. It's wonderful to watch the reports of progress on their Guardian Angel animals! They also go all out to make the animals' stays as comfortable as possible...be it a shy cat or an aggressive dog, they know how to help.
Best Friends Animal Society	246395		/users/profile/333738	barneshd	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I have donated to Best Friends for over 20 years and have never been disappointed with how they spend the money. They stretch each dollar to the maximum and help so many animals. Their impact on the pet  population all over the world is beyond amazing. They are the only pet animal charity I will donate to because of their mission statement and initiatives. For me actions speak louder than words and the actions of Best Friends are nothing short of miraculous. The number of animals they have saved from certain death then rehabilitated and rehomed is astounding. I have nothing but utter and total respect for all the staff and volunteers of Best Friends and trust them implicitly with the money they receive.
Best Friends Animal Society	246393		/users/profile/333735	anuthm	Donor	5	06/26/2015	When my dad, who loved dogs, died, we wanted people to donate to a truly worthy charity instead of sending flowers.  We found Best Friends and have been huge fans ever since.  The money donated is used effectively, and they truly help not only the animals they care for directly but millions more through their no-kill efforts.  We visited the sanctuary ourselves when we were out west on vacation, and were thrilled to see their efforts in person.   When my mom passed away, our friends again donated to Best Friends, and they couldn't have made a better choice!
Best Friends Animal Society	246392		/users/profile/333734	Debby9	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends not only helps ALL abandoned animals, but also helps the ones that would be put down by law if they didn't take them.  They allow grieving pet parents to post good-byes to their beloved pets and help any animal in any way they can.  They're fantastic.
Best Friends Animal Society	246391		/users/profile/321421	CLK5	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I have been a member of Best Friends Animal Society for years. I have visited the sanctuary several times and I can attest that it is one of the best sanctuaries in North America. What the society has accomplished is amazing and something to be very proud of!! If you are ever in the area of Southern Utah, i.e. visiting the Grand Canyon which isn't terribly far, you must make it a point to stop in and take a tour. Better yet, I suggest you arrange to stay a few days either at the sanctuary or in Kanab and volunteer at the sanctuary. No matter what you decide, you must consider donating to the society and/or write the sanctuary into your will.
Best Friends Animal Society	246390		/users/profile/333731	susieheardlee	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I recently spent a week volunteering at Best Friends in Kanab. I've been around the world and seen some wonderful sights, but I've never had a better week that the one I spent at Best Friends. Sitting in the dirt, scratching a pig's belly and hearing his appreciative grunts was more rewarding than I could have ever imagined. Scooping poop so the horses could have a clean home was way more enjoyable exercise than going to the gym. Walking in the desert sand with handicapped cats and dogs so they could explore just kept me smiling. They could teach us all a lesson in finding joy wherever you are. My monthly contribution to Best Friends is a pittance compared to what these furry and feathered friends need, but if everyone gave just a little, we might just "save them all."
Best Friends Animal Society	246388		/users/profile/333728	windrider	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I've been a donor of Best Friends for a very very long time. They do more for ALL animals and in EVERY situation around the States, well you find them  rolling in and taking charge to help all animals in need. They go beyond the everyday shelter routines. They have the money and backing to do the most good all the time. I support them more then any other organization that helps or shelters animals. They started small stuck with it and now are a world class nonprofit. their staff is the very best around. They never stop looking for ways to stretch and do the most good all around and in every state. I could write a book on these great people. Words here just do not give them all enough credit.

Over the years, they have rescued a variety of countless animals in the USA as well as in other countries that have experienced catastrophic weather, such as flooding and earthquakes.  I have always wanted to visit Best Friends to help out.   But when I was working, I didn't have much time.  And now that I am retired, I don't have extra money to travel.  Best Friends is such a wonderful place that some people who work choose to spend their vacation time there volunteering.  If I had enough resources to spend a week or more there to help out and to enjoy the animals and the people who work there, I would take my animal-loving granddaughter with me.  I have been a member of Best Friends for years, from the moment I learned about them.  And I thank them from the bottom of my heart for all the love and care they give to our animal friends.  Best Friends helps make the world a better, kinder place.

I hugely appreciate their commitment to all animals and especially to oft-neglected rabbits. And it's a no-kill shelter!
Best Friends Animal Society	246385		/users/profile/333724	Molly-s-mom	Client Served	5	06/26/2015	In 2002, my husband and I had just retired and were planning on traveling with my beloved poodle Muffin.  However, that was not in the cards.  After about 4 months of grieving the lost of my beloved companion, I started  searching adoption sites for a new fur baby.  I came across  the Best Friends Animal Society website where I saw the picture of Molly a toy poodle whose picture just jumped off the page and said adopt me.  We were camping in West Columbia, Texas and I could not access the adoption application on my computer so I went to the local library and filled out the application online.  After a couple days, I received a call saying that I was approved to adopt Molly and the sooner I could pick her up the sooner they would be able to save another dog.  My husband and I packed up the truck with our cat and drove from West Columbia, Texas to Kanab, Utah leaving our travel trailer in the campground.  Once we got to Best Friends, we did a sleep over with Molly just to make sure she was the right fit and to see if she would get along with our cat.  The minute I saw Molly she jumped into my arms as if saying "What took you so long".  Needless to say Molly came with us and has been a delight and joy in our lives ever since. The whole process of adopting Molly was so easy and I believe in their process of checking out potential adopters to make sure that the match works for both the human and the animal.  Should I need to adopt again, I will be using Best Friends. Thank you,Aurelia Fisher
Best Friends Animal Society	246381		/users/profile/333721	TomeKnitter	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Our visit to Best Friends in Kanab, UT, left us filled with awe and commitment to an organization that has harnessed love, great minds, determination and a superior professional cadre in the service of our creature companions. Medically, emotionally, physically, in every way known, they have found ways to take care of those most ignored, abused and unloved in our "throw-away" society. The Victory Dogs are but a small example of the total dedication and professional care that is given to any animal lucky enough to land in their hands. Their expertise has been applied across the US in some of the most difficult and "high kill" facilities...with amazing success and change! They are designated beneficiaries in our trust.
Best Friends Animal Society	246380		/users/profile/333719	dogdaddy1988	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	My best friend  shares his life with me, sleeping, eating with me , he goes everywhere I go and tells me what is really important and what isn't that important. Plus, he helps me find lost items, keeps me warm during the winter, walks err exercises me in my senior years, helps me find-meet new friends, protects me from dubious folk. Stops me from crossing the street against the traffic. He always is talking to me, wiggling his cute upright ears and wagging his bushy tail. He helps me discover new areas, new creatures and loves to be photographed. Unconditional love both ways. No human can ever do that for next to nothing in costs. Unlike humans, he never hurts me, never ever lies to me, never steals from me.  He lowers my blood pressure, sometimes he tells me when to go to sleep and when to wake up. He makes for a great pillow. What more could anyone expect or get from a such great awesome Best friend!?

Best Friends Animal Society	246377		/users/profile/333716	summersnowj	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I have been a financial supporter of Best Friends for 20+ years.  Best Friends maintains an excellent performance rating with the various charity rating organizations who rate how donated monies and other resources are used and how successful they are in performing their stated objectives.  Best Friends also  leads the pack (no pun intended) in successful physical and emotional rehab programs and rehoming 'throw away' animals.  I want my time and monies to be used successfully and so will continue to financially support this well run, well managed and well considered operation.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246372		/users/profile/333707	zeewiz	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I visited Best Friends several years ago because I was in the area while on a vacation to the Grand Canyon.  I must say it was not what I expected. Everyone there has a true love for the animals they care for. For the many animals the take care of on adaily basis this is truly the happiest place on earth! I wish all shelters had the commitment and funds to operate this way so it would not be such a sad experience and more people would get involved and adopt. Thank you Best Friends for setting the standard!
Best Friends Animal Society	246371		/users/profile/333705	James167	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends Animal Sanctuary is the best animal rescue, rehabilitation, and adoption organization, paws down! What makes them stand out is their unparalleled location in Utah's red rock country and their volunteer program, which allows visitors to stay on the site and volunteer their time and efforts in exchange for a place to stay. My family and I plan on making the trek east (in our case, since we live in CA) soon to enjoy their hospitality and give back to the animals.
Best Friends Animal Society	246370		/users/profile/333704	cmarshall	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is simply the best thing that has ever happened for unwanted and or injured animals and wildlife!!!!  A few had a dream, they turned it into a reality and they have a wonderful vision for the future for all animals concerned.  They also educate and help communities learn to do the same!  They truly are BEST FRIENDS and one of God's Caregivers!
Best Friends Animal Society	246369		/users/profile/189215	Sally34	Donor	5	06/26/2015	As a volunteer for a small cat shelter in Massachusetts, I appreciate what Best Friends Animal Society is doing to make the U.S. a no-kill nation.  For years so many groups thought this was only an impossible ideal and continued their old ways of doing things.   Many more animals were euthanized.  But Best Friends' response to non-believers was to say, "Hang on! Here's how no-kill can be done!" and then they proceeded to show it was possible. Because of Best Friends, large cities, like Los Angeles, are now striving to meet a no-kill goal in just a few years time and they are succeeding.  Some of the large humane groups that for many years were silent on the no-kill issue are now joining the bandwagon and working with smaller groups to achieve a no-kill status.  I credit Best Friends' enthusiasm, determination, and practical guidelines for making this whole movement possible. I am a big fan of what Best Friends has done and what they continue to accomplish.  I'd give them a 10 star rating if I could!
Best Friends Animal Society	246367		/users/profile/333702	LorraineM	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I first heard of Best Friends right after Katrina.  I discovered that they were one of the first groups that went to NOLA to rescue the animals that FEMA forced owners to leave behind.  I started donating money to support their work.  By September I wanted to see for myself that they were saving and caring for animals at the Sanctuary like they advertised, since it seemed too good to be true. I headed out from Los Angeles to Kanab by myself, which was not an easy thing for me to do.  When I arrived at the Sanctuary, I could not believe the beauty of the place.  After volunteering for  4 days, I came to understand that it was overwhelmingly better than I could ever have imagined.  The animals were cared for in  such a loving manner.  Knowing that all the animals were safe and would not be killed, just because they were old or injured, was a very comforting feeling for me.  I returned many times after that to volunteer, and I ended up adopting two dogs.  I wish I could save them all, but I do it only one at a time.  If we all did one at a time, they would all be saved.  Thanks to the leadership of the founders, I know this will happen, which makes the world a much happier place to be in. Lorraine MalsburyLos Angeles

Best Friends Animal Society	246361		/users/profile/333695	Wrecks	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/26/2015	Over the years, Best Friends has come through for many other small, struggling rescues across the country, offering the best possible example, innovative approaches, and a leg up.  By focusing not on themselves but on helping animals, they have made a huge contribution toward a time when there will be no more homeless pets.
Best Friends Animal Society	246360		/users/profile/333694	ahill4591	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is amazing! I was able to give my mom the PURRR-fect Mothers Day gift by donating in her honor to help homeless animals. As a volunteer for a farm horse rescue and an overall animal/animal rights lover, this charity means the world to her and I. Thank you for everything Best Friends Animal Sanctuary! Keep doing what you do! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246358		/users/profile/333692	veganbaker	Donor	5	06/26/2015	I love Best Friends Animal Society because they walk their talk and they stay for the long run. After Hurricane Katrina, I spent a week of my vacation helping with animal rescue in Waveland, Mississippi. After I had to return home, a fellow volunteer who stayed on said that Best Friends Animal Society volunteers came and stayed to help for a long time, something like a year after the hurricane and  long after other rescue groups had left.
Best Friends Animal Society	246357		/users/profile/333689	68Stang	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is an amazing nonprofit charity - a wonderful combination of a beyond words sanctuary in beautiful Angel's Canyon in Kanab, Utah and a "society" that reaches out to other organizations and areas in need.  Watching the growth of the No-Kill Movement has been so inspiring. I've had the pleasure of visiting/volunteering at the sanctuary FOUR times with a great friend and it's not a quick trip from the East Coast!  We are looking forward to our FIFTH trip next year and we are bringing another friend with us, her first trip and we can't wait to show her Best Friends and the surrounding national parks.  I've been a member for almost as long as Best Friends has been around and I can't believe how much they've grown and how far they reach out - even across the globe....the story of the beginning itself is one of friendship and lifelong callings.  They don't just talk the talk - the employees/volunteers there walk the walk each and every day.  I just can't say enough about Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	246355		/users/profile/333685	JustDebra	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is simply the BEST!!!  They have changed (and continue to enlighten) the way we think of animals.  Through their selflessness, we are slowly moving away of our antiquated thinking that using animals  as resources, property, commodities or things to be exploited, harmed or killed at an "owners" whim is no longer acceptable.  They are doing great work and we hope their strides will continue to inspire others.
Best Friends Animal Society	246354		/users/profile/333683	Tercel	Donor	5	06/26/2015	 I learned about Best Friends from their wonderful TV show years ago. I was so impressed with the love and caring everyone exhibited, I have been a donor ever since.  I look forward to their magazine and reading the great stories about the animals they have saved. The work they did with the Victory Dogs went far beyond anything any other group could have done. They are very special group of "friends" and deserve all the help and support anyone can give.
Best Friends Animal Society	246353		/users/profile/333681	MKlem	Donor	4	06/26/2015	Our family first learned about Best Friends because of the Michael Vick dogs.  A member of our family is pit bull.  The Michael Vick tragedy affected us quite a bit.  Thank goodness for Best Friends - they saved so many of the victims from Vick's horrible crime.  We sponsor one of the heroes - Tug.  Giving money is great, but I wanted my children to see the great work Best Friends does.  This summer, our family went to Kanab and volunteered at Dog Town and Cat World.  We had a great time.  Every animal we met will stay in our hearts forever.  Best Friends and the animal care givers truly make this world a better place.  My children can't wait to go back.  Keep up the life-saving work!
Best Friends Animal Society	246352		/users/profile/333679	jgovind	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Truly amazing organization.  My wife and I truly appreciate what Best Friends is doing. Compassion and kindness towards all animals is a wonderful objective and Best Friends has truly gone a long way towards accomplishing this goal.  Saving all animals and working towards helping communities across the entire country accomplish this goal is a truly great objective.  We are very happy to be associated with them.
Best Friends Animal Society	246351		/users/profile/333677	godogs	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	I had been watching this rescue for a long time and when I moved west I finally got to visit. I remember a story about a law that forbid dogs to chase horses and a dog that couldn't stop. the judge was going to have this guys dear dog killed until Best Friends stepped in and took the dog so he could have a good life and the owner could come visit. What a beautiful solution. The facility is awesome and inspiring and I would work there if I lived closer.

Every adoption event they've put on has been incredibly organized and uplifting, even to the very important point of offering vegan fare, which shows just how truly dedicated they are to ALL animals.  I'm sure I speak for all animal advocates when I say that Best Friends stands out as a hero among heroes.  Thank you to everyone  involved with Best Friends!!!
Best Friends Animal Society	246349		/users/profile/333674	Mary348	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is my all-time favorite animal charity!  Their positive energy and spirit are what originally drew me to them and have since captured my heart.  Best Friends is genuinely dedicated to creating a world where animals are not considered "throwaways," but are respected and valued for the unique and wonderful creatures that they are.  Their work on behalf of animals is tireless and enthusiastic, and in my opinion, unmatched.  For these - and countless other reasons - Best Friends has won my ongoing support in working to Save Them All! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246348		/users/profile/333672	nestapleton	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Years ago my friend Scotts pig, Penelope, had been separated from him for a time out of necessity, and although she had been boarded at a place for pigs, when he was able to get her she developed some behavioral problems, like messing on the floor.  Having just started a new job and a new life and a new job, Scott was emotionally sensitive, so when his beloved pig was so unhappy with him, it was very hard for him to cope with her issues, but he would never have given her up.  I knew that Best Friends had pigs, so I emailed about the situation, and your employee at the time, Elaine McIntyre, was amazing.  Elaines response was to view the situation through Penelopes eyes, so I would understand what was upsetting her.  It sounds simple, but it was terrific advice.  That advice served us very well, it helped to pull Penelope out of the anger she was feeling and to let her understand Scott would never be away from her again.  It also helped me establish trust with her, and Penelope and I developed an awesome relationship.  She has been one of my closest friends until her passing this year at the age of 17.  Best Friends not only helps the animals in their care, their outreach program has helped so many animals across the US, their philosophy is affecting the was animals are treated in the US and probably the entire world, and their reach even extends to making life great for wonderful animals who are not part of their system, like Penelope.  Best Friends started our with a very ambitious mission and in my opinion has established themselves as the leading animal care society.  Best Friends is awesome!
Best Friends Animal Society	246347		/users/profile/333671	bkelsey	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is the BEST! Before I ever got into animal rescue in my own hometown area, I was an avid follower of Best Friends - always watching and reading to see what life saving activities they were up to. Their innovative ideas for pet parent care information, fund raising, adoption events, health and well being facts, national events to help local shelters, etc., made me a firm believer that they were "All In" to save and rehabilitate animals everywhere. I am never hesitant to donate to their causes as I know they have the interest of the animals at the front of their heart. What a great organization to! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246346		/users/profile/333670	Cherie8	Volunteer	5	06/26/2015	I have been a member of Best Friends for many years, and while I strongly believe in their standing as a non-profit and their goals, what touches me most is their actions - helping those us who have lost a beloved pet to remember, helping to find homes who have been mistreated or taught horrible actions, helping those who have lived in the wild their whole lives to have happy and peaceful completions of those lives, etc.  The list goes on and on, and their actions to help other shelters in many states to find a way to save them all is not only admirable but truly becoming reality!  Just amazing in so many ways - thank you!

While many individuals will stop to help animals, Best Friends as set a benchmark for all of us to follow to make the world a better, more caring and compassionate place.  All animals are sentient beings and deserve the respect any living creature should be given.   The world deserves to have Best Friends, and organizations like it, assisted to the wonderful work they are doing.

Best Friends Animal Society	246341		/users/profile/333664	Bree3	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	I visited the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in August of 2014 - I was blown away by their complete dedication to the well being of their animals, as well as the transparency they provided to visitors - I returned in March of 2015, and hope to continue to make regular visits. I love that they engage with the communities they serve on such a deep level - with efforts like NKLA and NKUT. After becoming a member, I joined their mailing list, and they even sent me an email notification letting me know that the town I live in (Sandy City, UT) was having a council meeting discussing whether or not they should make the local shelter no-kill, along with helpful speaking tips. Overall, I am completely impressed with this organization, and the care they provide to animals in need.
Best Friends Animal Society	246340		/users/profile/333662	reshwett	Donor	5	06/26/2015	Five stars because:  Best Friends is the best kind of classic American success story; because they succeed and show every sign of continuing to succeed in the future; because they had the inspiration to provide positive PR to encourage adoptions and their happy-after-ever-stories; because they believe in themselves; because I ardently share their mission and have on my lap this minute a Chihuahua of the most superior and beautiful and worthy kind who rescued us even as we rescued him from a completely senseless and useless death by euthanasia in a crowded shelter with no more room and a tight deadline  --and I guess I have to mean it when I say "dead"line.
Best Friends Animal Society	246339		/users/profile/333663	greylady	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends Animal Society has been doing wonderful work for years and we have been fans for some time.  One of the key things they do that is important to me is keeping me in the loop on the animals I choose to sponsor throughout the year - they send me notices on dogs finding their forever homes, updates on their status at BFAS  HQ, and the sad news when one of these dear dogs travels to the Rainbow Bridge.  Over the years they have kept the importance of the individuality of each dog who passes through their care - these beings are not statistics to them, each one is loved and they have not wavered in sharing these valuable lessons to young and old.  They truly believe that one day, we would have no more homeless pets.

The patience they had with those abused dogs really touched my heart. Been donating ever since!  They also have great publications that share the stories about the many animals they help.

Best Friends Animal Society	246334		/users/profile/333655	Barbara216	General Member of the Public	5	06/26/2015	Best Friends is one of the most outstanding and significant animal sanctuaries in the U.S. Their work has saved thousands of lives and they deserve recognition for this. They have spread the no kill message far and wide and their dedication to continuing to do so is one of the greatest hopes I have for making the U.S. a no kill nation. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246254		/users/profile/333530	Anna98	General Member of the Public	5	06/24/2015	This no kill shelter is a one of a kind. They care for all animals, large and small, not just dogs and cats. It's on my bucket list to one day spend a week volunteering there. They deserve all kinds of awards. I have been spreading the word about this place for years. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246217		/users/profile/333490	Debbie168	General Member of the Public	5	06/24/2015	I am in awe of how tireless and focused Best Friends is in their ultimate goal to end the killing of animals in shelters to have no more homeless pets!  My dream was to visit and volunteer at the Sanctuary to at least get a glimpse into the amazing work they do for all the animals.  My husband and I spent 2 weeks volunteering at the Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah last may and we were blown away.  It truly inspired us to continue advocating for all animals and to get much more involved in our own local shelters.  The compassion and true love for these animals is inspiring.  Many of these animals have been treated as if they are not worth saving....but Best Friends knows that is not true....not only are they worth saving but it is our human and moral obligation to do so in a kind and loving manner and Best Friends is a shining example!
Best Friends Animal Society	246174		/users/profile/333419	Skybluedog	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends is an astounding organization that seeks to "Save them all!". I first started reading theiir materials and donatong money when they first opened the Kanab, Utah facility.  Now they are the leaders in providing pet rescue at weather events and figting the evil of dog fighting and puppy mills.  Their efforts to make a viable volunteer program has created a venue for many to help animals all over the country.  Although I have not yet joined the volunteers, I plan to in the future.  Best Friends inspires me as well as many other.
Best Friends Animal Society	246173		/users/profile/333418	Suzanne73	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends does amazing work- they really get the word out there on how regular people can help get pets adopted, even if you can't adopt yourself.

Best Friends Animal Society	246171		/users/profile/333415	SAlice	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I learned about Best Friends after seeing the TruCar "joy ride" initiative to send shelter animals to Best Friends adoption centers and was moved to begin donating to their organization. Since then I have learned about their exceptional dedication to advancing the no kill movement and their donation to help my hometown of San Antonio reach their no kill goal. I love seeing the YouTube videos of their success stories. They are pioneers with years of great accomplishments behind them and yet still much more to do. Please support their tireless cause. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246170		/users/profile/333414	fiona6279	Donor	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends is the most wonderful organization helping countless animals for 30 years.

Everyone there is dedicated to the welfare of the hundreds of animals in their care, and the organization has made great strides in networking across the country and even internationally to promote the No Kill movement and they are having a very positive effect!  They have always promoted "the good news about animals and the earth," which is another reason why I love Best Friends!!
Best Friends Animal Society	246167		/users/profile/333409	cnel03	Client Served	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends is a tireless animal rescue organization that works around the clock to rescue and care for thousands of animals in jeopardy. They also have an extensive outreach and adoption program supported by expert fundraising and volunteerism. I regularly donate to their cause.
Best Friends Animal Society	246164		/users/profile/333406	mori31us	Client Served	5	06/23/2015	I emailed you, BFAS, May 25th at 636pm CDT to tell you about Torrey and how you took her in after she was found in Torrey, Utah, starving, by two women hikers with their two dogs. Torrey was the black one, who went to Best Friends in Oct 2002. The red one ran away and likely met a bad fate in the mountain/desert landscape without a companion. You guys brought her back to life, spade her and prepared her for adoption from SFSPCA. I adopted Torrey from the SFSPCA on April 7, 2003; she had been there a week? She was and still is my best friend!!! I said goodbye to her May 23, 2015. I miss her every day! BFAS are one of my beneficiaries on my accounts. I'm not ready to join Torrey yet, although sometimes I think they should taken us together...Your work is not forgotten. I love all that you do! And, one day, when or if I am ever ready, I will adopt/rescue another dog from you!Thank you for all you do!Please check your email from the above date!!! There is a PDF attachment of Torrey's story!Feel free to contact me. I have been hoping you would!THANK YOU!
Best Friends Animal Society	246162	1	/users/profile/333404	HeatherGraham	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I have volunteered with Best Friends in Utah and in California. Aside from being an animal lover, BF volunteer, and BF donor, I have over 25 years experience in the nonprofit sector--mostly grantmaking (including assessing nonprofit management and results), with several years combined at other U.S. nonprofits and an INGO. Can't say enough about Best Friends--highest quality care, outstanding volunteer opportunities and management, tremendous outreach to public and policymakers, and excellent support for other programs working throughout the U.S. They do it all well and they get great results. Please support them if you are able.

Best Friends Animal Society	246157		/users/profile/333397	Sandysongy	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I first became aware of Best Friends after Katrina when they were majorly involved. They had also previously taken a basset hound when I worked with Golden Gate basset rescue. They have now opened up satellite offices in Los Angeles and other cities with a large stray animal population. I have been a donor now for several years and hope to volunteer soon.
Best Friends Animal Society	246154		/users/profile/333394	Krys W.	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	I have been to this awesome place!  Attended a seminar several years ago and was so impressed by the beautiful place and it's very friendly and caring personnel.  Every animal was loved and well cared for.  The sanctuary is clean and well maintained.   I would love to go back in the near future as a volunteer and to interact with the animals.  I would give it 5 stars!!!

I hope to someday travel to Best Friends if the opportunity comes to be.  Would be so proud to say that I contributed to this great organization and helped donate my time to the love and care they obviously provide for all animals in need!
Best Friends Animal Society	246146		/users/profile/333384	KaraToon	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends began with a small, idealistic yet realistic, enthusiastic and goal-driven group of animal lovers. They've spread the idea of SAVE THEM ALL through every communication medium out there, always fun and positive. The beautiful sanctuary is a loving home to thousands of rejected animals, who are set up for adoption success by training and socializing. They are THE model that other sanctuaries aspire to, and they provide mentoring to other sanctuary staff members. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246143		/users/profile/333381	Keatonidgie	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	I have often seen them step in and assist high kill shelters learn ways other than killing to assist companion animals  to find homes, help get those processes going, and the results shown by dramatic decreases in kill rates at these shelters. They help out at Paws Humane and Columbus (GA) Animal Control to provide a TNR program for community cats in that city/county, only 30 miles from my home in Alabama. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246135		/users/profile/333375	CassieWelsh	Donor	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends Animal Society has been doing an amazing job saving animals and raising awareness of animal welfare for over 30 years. The rehabilitation work for the Michael Vick pitbulls is just one example of their successes. I am certainly a proud supporter of their work!
Best Friends Animal Society	246133		/users/profile/333373	KKG30	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I started volunteering for Best Friends when I learned about them from the National Geographic Dogtown TV show.  It's an amazing organization that is truly the only one focusing on the killing of animals every day in America's shelters.  Now I'm so proud to work for Best Friends.  We have amazing benefits and an atmosphere that is hopeful as we try to help out as many animals as possible.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246131		/users/profile/333372	jogo	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends Animal Society is probably the best animal organization there is. By fighting for putting an end to killing innocent animals that have no voice..they will create a kinder, more loving and caring world. Animals are our friends and should not be abused, tortured, killed, starved, chained or left alone..Best Friends Animal Society WILL HELP SAVE THEM ALL..

They go to great lengths to heal them and to find  forever homes!  They go above and beyond. And what a beautiful place. It touched my heart so much that I actually cried - good tears - from the heart

Best Friends Animal Society	246117		/users/profile/333356	Chantellfortyone	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I have been following Best Friends and been a contributing member every since a group of people who were doing animal welfare on their own, banded and formed Best Friends in Utah.  Since then what they have accomplished is unbelievable  From sitting at tables on the street to raise funds in order to continue, to having Best Friends all across the United States to assist injured animals, and ones needing homes, to ensuring that their no kill policy becomes effective through all the states, and hopefully all over the world.  There are not enough good words to express how grateful we are to them the founders and to all the wonderful people who volunteer their time and to all the fantastic people who have given so many a forever home.  Thank you. from the bottom of my heart.  keep up the great work you are doing..  
Best Friends Animal Society	246114		/users/profile/333350	yetismith	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	When I first heard about Best Friends, many years ago, I was keen to support them as I am a passionate animal lover. After I had made a few donations I was surprised to get a call from them one day, not to ask for more money, as so often happens with charities, but to say thank you and to encourage me to pay a visit to the sanctuary in Utah. Not long after I took a week's leave and flew to Kanab where I spent a few days helping the staff to clean, feed and clean up the cat facilities. The staff were so appreciative of their volunteers and it was such fun to be with like-minded people. The facility was immaculate, the animals all seemed so happy. (Best Friends cares for many kinds of animals and birds) As someone who is not easily impressed, I was overwhelmed by the Sanctuary. A couple of years later I was able to pay another visit and could not believe the progress that had been made, so many new shelter buildings, so many more animals living a great life while waiting for their "forever" homes, unlike so many less fortunate animals that merely survive in their overcrowded shelters which is not intended as criticism of those shelters. Best Friends seems to have found a formula for success in this endeavor. Their magazine is full of upbeat, happy stories and pictures of animals having a great time. This was what particularly appealed to me in the first place, and having seen first hand where my donated funds were being spent, I was became even more dedicated to the cause. The really wonderful thing about this society is that they share their success not just around the country but around the world. They are constantly sending rescue teams to areas that have been devastated by forces of Nature and war. They also offer wonderful training courses for people who want to join the crusade. Best Friends has been my favorite charity for many years now and I cannot see a time when that will change. When I think Best Friends, I think PEACE, LOVE, HAPPINESS as well as patience, tolerance and friendship. May God always bless this very special society.
Best Friends Animal Society	246108		/users/profile/333342	gosack	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I have been a volunteer and donor for Best Friends for many years. The impact of their work in reducing the number of pets euthanized each year in the U.S. has been phenomenal, and it continues to grow steadily. They perform their mission effectively, efficiently, and with so much love as they partner with rescues across the country. They are truly unique! 
Best Friends Animal Society	246101		/users/profile/333336	JoyfulLotus	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	I am so impressed by Best Friends Animal Society. They do such important and life-saving work for so many animals across the country. I have friends who take their vacations at Best Friends. I want to retire there, living out my life sharing in the goodness.
Best Friends Animal Society	246094	1	/users/profile/333327	Karen340	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends does wonders for our animals. Their proactive stance in furthering adoptions and their spay/neuter programs help save shelter animals and make strides in controlling over population. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246093	1	/users/profile/333326	Ele T.	Donor	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends is one of the organizations that has made the no-kill movement so successful. By reaching out to other communities, Best Friends has created a No-Kill LA, No-Kill Utah and other areas. It also assists small local shelters create better adoption events and helps them build their own local no-kill movements.  Best Friends is an example of a great non-profit that endeavors to achieve the seemingly impossible - a no-kill nation. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246092	1	/users/profile/333325	jsuppin	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I joined Best Friends  back in their early days  in the 1980s.  They have been a the forefront of animal rescue from their very beginnings.  They have always nurtured the idea of a no-kill nation.  At that time, no one thought this was a possibility.  But Best Friends has persevered that it could be done!  These many years later, they are the shining example of an animal rescue that uses every option and possibility to help, not only the animals, but all the rescue groups that have come to believe in the no-kill effort.  They partner with so many rescue groups all over the country to help them implement procedures that will one day bring us to the dream of "No More Homeless Pets"!
Best Friends Animal Society	246090	1	/users/profile/333322	wondermouse	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends in Kanab, Utah is an extremely well-organized and well-run organization. I had the pleasure of visiting twice, and both times I was so impressed with their staff, programs, and acreage, where animals have room to enjoy their lives after some heartbreaking circumstances. The network of Best Friends members across the U.S. is another achievement of this fantastic organization. Finally, most of the donations they receive go directly to the animals rather than administration. They have truly made a difference in so many animals' lives.
Best Friends Animal Society	246088	1	/users/profile/333320	sonjalazear	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Several years ago I came with 3 friends to volunteer at Best Friends.  We fed horses, cats, pigs and rabbits.  Each time we were warmly greeted by the permanent caretakers who carefully explained our assignments.  The housing areas, feed dishes, litter boxes, etc. were always clean.  We were served lunch that was a vegetarian masterpiece and I had occasion to chat with the chef.  Their knowledge of how to care for animals and their willingness to go to any length to help an injured or sick animal is amazing.  I describe it as "performing miracles everyday".

Best Friends Animal Society	246084	1	/users/profile/333316	Lisa451	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I visited Best Friends earlier this year and was blown away by the beauty, love and majesty of the place.  It is the gold standard by which all shelters, of any kind should be measured.  The thoughtful planning and execution in the design of the place is nothing short of amazing.  I would love to retire there, as many people have.  The care and dedication of the staff, along with the integration of volunteers is heartwarming.  The animals who reside there are beyond blessed and it shows in their demeanor.  A place of our joy!  Having the opportunity to have sleepovers with an animal is brilliant!  What a fun experience, that also provides insight into the animals behavior. Love, Love, Love this place. Cannot wait to go again?
Best Friends Animal Society	246082	1	/users/profile/333314	murph1	Donor	5	06/23/2015	The animals are smiling!  Such love and dedication by this group!The goal is that no animals should be euthanized, and they will do everything they can to make it happen.

I have visited the Sanctuary in Utah, and am amazed at the wonderful care and love they have for the animals. I truly believe in their mission, and their passion for a world where we can save them all.   They are PROACTIVE in their cause, and want to make changes to the laws and society. They have such a positive vision, and have done a great job projecting their message in a positive light.
Best Friends Animal Society	246072	1	/users/profile/333304	Sehh62180	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Fulfilled a dream to visit Best Friends yesterday; amazing place! Hope to be able to come back and volunteer in the future. It is so evident that these animals are loved and well cared for; gives me hope in face of stories of abuse and neglect. The staff so obviously have a passion to "save them all" and it is heartwarming to see how they have rehabilitated animals that many shelters deem unfit as pets. Very impressive to see the growth of this organization in the past 30 years; they are doing such good in the world.
Best Friends Animal Society	246071	1	/users/profile/333303	Dixiegirl05	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	There should be more organizations like Best Friends Animal Society!  They are saving and caring for God's precious creatures!  They deserve the support of all people who care for and support the loving and loyal gifts from God!  
Best Friends Animal Society	246070	1	/users/profile/333301	Doreen L.	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I have donated to Best Friends for 25 years. My mom and I started to receive hand written thank you notes and a one page "news letter" detailing the goals and progress. The original founders gave up everything to help homeless and abused animals. We encouraged others to donate because we knew the money was really being used to create a safe home for animals that would have died or been put to sleep. The sacrifices made by the founders helped to create a model shelter for ALL animals, not just dogs and cats. I now volunteer at a small No Kill dog & cat shelter in Florida, inspired by years of reading Best Friends news letters. Everyone should read the book Best Friends The True Story. In my opinion it will inspire everyone to gladly vote for Best Friends. Bless them all.
Best Friends Animal Society	246069	1	/users/profile/333300	Vicky14	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I first heard of Best Friends Animal Society when they were featured on the cover of People Magazine! I was sitting in a doctors office and read the article about the father and daughter who started this amazing organization to help animals, big and small! I would love to tour the property one day, I know someone who did and they said it was the best experience! I try to donate to them and even if it is a small donation all of our small donations add up to big donations in the long run! Please read about them and donate whatever you can, it makes such a big difference! Thank you Best Friends for ALL you do every single day to help animals thrive and live happy lives!

Best Friends Animal Society	246066	1	/users/profile/333297	Noreen V.	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	I am impressed just how hard these animal shelters work to save the life of a dog or cat that seems nearly dead. Often it is their greatest reward to discover a wonderful pet for some needy person.  This was my sister's experience. It was a lovely small dog trained as a care dog but he was sick in cars so was discarded. She cashed in on a beautiful friendship. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246064	1	/users/profile/333293	RlVaughn	Donor	5	06/23/2015	Always believed in every animal has a right to a happy life and Best Friends Animal Society is the epitome of this belief.

Best Friends Animal Society	246062	1	/users/profile/333291	Julie218	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I don't have a story to tell.  I just think Best Friends Animal Sanctuary rocks.  I wish all states would crave to follow its motto:  "Save Them All!"  I contribute regularly to their work and have them listed in my will to receive part of my estate when I pass away.  One of the things that I desire to do and will do is to visit the sanctuary and volunteer my time and to give my love to the animals living there.  Thank you Best Friends for saving all of the lives that have been saved.   Julie Lowery
Best Friends Animal Society	246061	1	/users/profile/333290	highway99	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/23/2015	What can I say about Best Friends Animal Society?  Through their boundless, continued, heartfelt dedication to saving animals, they bring comfort and peace of mind to those of us who love animals, and life, warmth and love to the animals they save.   What else can you say that about?
Best Friends Animal Society	246059	1	/users/profile/333288	chickadeelinda	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I have been a supporter of Best Friends for years. They have done the best job of promoting awareness of the state of animals in this country. Their unending diligence in saving the uncared for and unwanted is to be praised. They deserve every bit of help they can get. Looking forward to my first visit there this fall.
Best Friends Animal Society	246058	1	/users/profile/333287	melissamyer	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	I have been a member of Best Friends for several years and their efforts to "Save them all" is incredible. They are always providing updates on the latest efforts, laws and how we can help. I also do a little volunteering in my area and Best Friends is affiliated with a few of the shelters I work with. They're all over, and I love that about them. From what I've seen they are a very professional organization, and every volunteer seems to have a heart of gold. Just the fact that they're volunteers actually makes that last statement wholeheartedly true. I commend each and every one of them, as well as volunteers throughout the country. Best Friends gave me the motivation to want to help in my community.  I've heard so many great things about Best Friends and the work they're doing all over the country. I can't wait to plan a trip to Utah sometime in the very near future. I love that they share photos, send out newsletters, update their Facebook page regularly because it gives us all a glimpse of what takes place in the shelter on a daily basis, and the hard work everyone puts in to make Best Friends such a wonderful sanctuary for animals. I wish everyone had the gumption and heart that those volunteers exhibit every day - this world would be a much better place. Kudos to you, Best Friends, for wanting to "Save them all"! My admiration is endless.

I am very grateful that they exist and that I am able to be a part of the work as well. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246050	1	/users/profile/333280	Susan Ann D.	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	An absolutely fantastic animal society, putting animals to sleep is not what they are about, they are about changing the way people look at companion animals, how they are treat, giving them the respect that they deserve and doing the almost impossible every day, how do i know this! i suport them as do many, they need everry voice to speak up, every voice counts, dogs have no voice, so be an animal advocate, if you can't adopt then foster, if you can't foster volunteer, if you can't volunteer donate, and help this fine society to help animals, they are not born to be abused, used, and dumped on death row in shelters which is sadly the case for literally thousands of dogs cats and other animals every year, if you can do non of the above then share and suport best friends animal society today.

Best Friends Animal Society	246046	1	/users/profile/333275	inflorida	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I first heard about Best Friends from my aunt in Branford Connecticut. She is an avid animal lover that has had a household pet her entire life. The motto to "Save Every Pet" is the ultimate goal. No pet should be killed just forbeing born. In the immediate future to cut back on shelter euthanizations, we need more foster care. We need a national register of foster homes. This can save lives if foster care rotation is needed until a foster home can be found or a forever home. This is the next step  to save more animals.

We were amazed at the beautiful forever homes they extended to so many wonderful animals. We were especially touched by the melodious cemetery made possible by the windchimes alongside each gravesite. It took my breath away.   They are the gold standard for animal rescue.

Also worked with rabbits & horses ( seemed more like play) Care givers were caring, calm & dedicated. The animals were well taken care of. Will return someday to volunteer & adopt 2 older cats.Joan London

They are loved unconditionally and given the very best care possible.

They are such a blessing to all creatures that GOD created.
Best Friends Animal Society	246040		/users/profile/333270	Waya2000	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2015	Osiyo, I would like to thank you for helping me rescue kittens last year that had no homes.  One of your emploees is very nice and told me all about your spay and neuter program and I can get it done for a dollar.  All the Kittens were fostered out and got homes.  I used to think that the shelters were just kill jars for pets.  It looks to me now that they are honestly trying to find homes for them.  Myself I have a cat that is 20 years old.  There are three more kittens in my back yard that I am going to try to trap and give them to loving homes.  You should tell people who are adopting cats to not let them wander around outside, especially in the winter.  The cold is deadly. Anyway, I love that you are out there trying.  I hope other states will do animal rights.  Is there anybody in Oklahoma that is trying to save pets?  Keep up the good work.  Thank you, Jennette
Best Friends Animal Society	246039		/users/profile/333269	Tonya18	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	I've volunteered for Best Friends twice and have had the most amazing, transformative experience both times. They do so much for the animals in their care. The animals have a great deal of space to run free, and they get such good care and love both from the employees and all the volunteers who come to help. It's so peaceful to spend time with the animals in the gorgeous canyon. Best Friends has become a kind of mecca for me and other animal lovers, a place to come to mourn the loss of a beloved pet or just to come to peace with something in your life by helping those in need. Best Friends has saved so many animals by transporting them from shelters to their wonderful facilities. Hopefully someday they can save every one of them.
Best Friends Animal Society	246038		/users/profile/333268	MissMartha	Donor	5	06/23/2015	I am a Guardian Angel (monthly contributor) for Best Friends Animal Sanctuary because of the respectful and determined way they have fought to save the lives of so many of God's creatures.  And continue to fight for No-Kill for all.Beyond that is Angels Rest -- an exquisite lasting memorial to the animal members of our families that have died.  This nonprofit organization has carved out a true sanctuary in the beauty of southern Utah to honor hundreds of animals that have nowhere else to be cared for and live. I am honored to support this fine organization.

Best Friends Animal Society	246036		/users/profile/333266	Skamper10	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends changed my career and my life! They give so much to the communities that may need a one time grant, volunteers, adoption and spay/neuter events. They keep an eye on other rescues to lend a hand or educate them on feral cat TNR. They provide much needed legislation information and help regular people understand the impact to them.Best Friends is by far the greatest example of a well organized, responsible and caring non-profit.
Best Friends Animal Society	246035		/users/profile/333265	Lisa450	Volunteer	5	06/23/2015	Best Friends has always been super helpful and VERY affordable with getting our own kittens as well as our foster Mom cat & 3 kittens vaccinated, spayed/neutered, and microchipped.  Vaccinations are on walk in basis, fast, and simple.  Spaying/neutering appointments are easy to schedule online and they provided me with excellent post surgery advice and answered questions when I called about any concerns.  I like that appointment reminders and which SPECIFIC vaccines needed for future appointments as well as hours/pricing are printed on their receipts & make it easy to understand when your next appointment is.  They are very informative about what your pet needs.  I can tell they are committed to the animals that come in.  I strongly believe in their goal to end euthanization in shelters, less animals on the street, and providing more animals with loving homes & happy, healthy lives.  I highly recommend them to anybody.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246033		/users/profile/333262	Dhalya M.	Client Served	5	06/23/2015	I Adopted my furry baby from Best friends, and definitely u fell in love with the staff and the facilities,  the animals are in good shape and everything is so clean and organized. It seems like if you're looking a pet hotel. After I adopted my friend I decided to support the organization, by making monthly donations to help and save them all.
Best Friends Animal Society	246032		/users/profile/333261	Spicecat1953	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I first visited Best Friends in 2002. Since then I have been back several times. I can't express enough how thankful I Am for this wonderful  place. So many animals have been given a second chance at life, because so many people care enough to take in these lost souls. I have seen what Best Friends has done to help the Vick dogs over come a terrible dog fighting situation. Also, many other animal, through no fault of their own, were thrown away, or owners could no longer care for them. Thank you, Karen J. Currie 
Best Friends Animal Society	246031		/users/profile/333260	Sherrycook522	Donor	5	06/22/2015	My first introduction to Best Friends was the Michael Vicks Pit Bull Dogs documentary that showed what Best Friends Animal Society did to save these animals.    It was so moving and I was so impressed with the way they handled the dogs.  They were wonderful and I believe saved all but one of the dogs.  That started my love affair with this group.  We have to pick and choose who we give to - there are so many wonderful causes - but this group touched my heart and I try to support them as much as possible.  Rock on Best Friends - you make me laugh and cry. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246028		/users/profile/333257	tracylovesthemall	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I visiited Best Friends for the second time this past May. And I am continually amazed at how much the staff cares for each animal, knows each of their stories and their individual journeys as they become more comfortable, happy and nurtured at Best Friends. It was such a positive interactive experience, that I truly can't wait to go back and learn more. I only wish I lived closer and could visit more than once a year. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246025		/users/profile/333251	Abby1961	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I have volunteered with Best Friends for about 15 years in Salt Lake City and at the Sanctuary in Kanab. BF is unique because of the ability to take on big issues like feral cats, puppy mills, and breed discrimination and offer constructive ways to solve problems. The other thing that makes BF special is the positive approach they take. No depressing videos here; instead you will actually learn about the good news in animal welfare. Thanks Best Friends!
Best Friends Animal Society	246024		/users/profile/333250	Dmakma1	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends is incredible!!!!!!!  They have come through in animals' time of need!   They saved the "Victory" dogs and showed the world that Pit Bulls are beautiful and gentle even after their HORRIBLE ORDEAL at the hands of a disgusting idiot!  Hats off to Best Friends and the incredible loving work they do!    Number 1 in my book!!!!!!      Donna AndruskiewiczBest Friends Supporter!
Best Friends Animal Society	246023		/users/profile/333249	kc1kid	Donor	5	06/22/2015	While I have never been to the facility in Utah I am a monthly contributor to this wonderful organization who does believe they can save them all.  Their work is well known across the county and the good they have done with animals so abused and cast aside is a true testiment of their passion to save them all. I believe in the work they are doing and hopefully others will also feel as passionate as I do to try and assist Best Friends in saving all these deserving animals who just want to be loved. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246021		/users/profile/333246	Armtice	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I visited Best Friends back in 1991 when it was just getting started and have been a follower of this inspiring organization since then.  I have been amazed at the influence Best Friends has had on the United States and especially Los Angeles and CA in getting the non kill movement to be the goal of all animal shelters. I volunteer with a few animal shelters in southern CA and we all look to Best Friends for ideas, assistance and leadership in adoption campaigns, advice on ways to promote no kill policies in our shelters, and helping in taking in hard to place animals.  Best Friends is the role model for all shelters in the USA.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246018		/users/profile/333243	craziestcatlady2	Donor	5	06/22/2015	We adopted our kitten from Best Friends. She was a graduate from the kitten nursery who initially was labeled failure to thrive. We scooped her 2 pound little body into our arms and brought her home. She is 9 months old now and a whopping 7 pounds. She went from a sad depressed little kitten to an active, funny, playful, crazy kitten. She is so brave being the peacemaker between our older cat and dog. Our family is forever thankful she was given the chance to live and saved by Best Friends. #NKUT
Best Friends Animal Society	246017		/users/profile/333242	K6cats	General Member of the Public	4	06/22/2015	Best Friends Animal Society is an AMAZING organization that is dedicated to the welfare of ALL animals. No animal is ever too small, too weak, too handicapped, too old, or too sick to be offered a loving and caring home. I admire this organization tremendously.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246016		/users/profile/333241	Gabriele W.	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I have seen what happens to pets no longer wanted or lost for more than 30 years - BFAS is the place I would want my dearly beloved pets to go if I were unable or dead.  Please help them - they need all the help they can get 
Best Friends Animal Society	246015		/users/profile/333240	Kvogel1	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends takes animals that are not adopted from other shelters.  Their work has and continues to expand under the banner of Save Them All.  Their outreach efforts are making a difference.
Best Friends Animal Society	246014		/users/profile/333239	Shannon96	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends is a wonderful organization, not just because they rescue animals no matter their health (physically and mentally) or background but because they are addressing a bigger issue.  That issue is the number of innocent animals who are killed everyday in shelters all over the country.  They are championing this cause that very few have addressed in both words and in action.  
Best Friends Animal Society	246013		/users/profile/333238	85302nan	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I love this place!  I drove across Utah to volunteer one day when my husband was at a conference, and didn't arrive in time for the first orientation.  I was a bit pouty, but someone had just brought in a tiny dog that had been blinded by some sadist, so they asked me if I would hold her for awhile.  I sat in the floor holding, petting, humming, and singing to her.  ( and crying, too.)   I went off to the afternoon session for volunteers and enjoyed it, but that small dog is the most vivid memory.  They thanked me profusely and assured me that the most important part of my day had been that small pup.  I donate to them; I have a brick somewhere in the new clinic that I will someday see, and I think they are the most caring group of folk ever.  (I've also left instructions that when something happens to me, (if my husband isn't still around) my pets are to be taken there or no one will inherit anything!). 
Best Friends Animal Society	246012		/users/profile/333237	Karen339	Client Served	5	06/22/2015	Had it not for the help and assistance of Best Friends Animal Society I would not have been able to learn or participate in the TNR (trap neuter/spay & return) program for all the feral cats where I live! They brought out & loaned me humane cat traps, showed me how to safely trap the cats, helped me set up the traps, taught me how the whole process works'and they also fund the costs of spay/neuter and rabies shots for the feral cats! For low income people they help pay or cover all costs of spay/neuter & shots for ones own pets! because of Best Friends I have been able to feed and take care of the feral cats in my neighborhood and help & teach others as well!  Eat friends de has made it possible for me to feed the feral cats & my own when I was unemoloyed with no income. Thank you too for helping me spay & neuter my own cats & dogs with vouchers when I could not afford to do this! I am able to care and keep more cats because of you keeping these cats out of shelters & a have homes! I am an active animal caregiver everyday now because of Best Friends!  Thank God for Best Friends in educating the public in the need to trap neuter & return reducing unwanted animals and strays in the community! I could not and would not have learned the need or how to help the feral cats had it not been for Best Friends! We now have 24 less cats where I live because they took the newborn kittens including ones who lost their mothers and all the cats who would have had more cats had they not been fixed! Best Friends are animals best friends and they do help save animals from being euthanized. They go above and beyond thanks to all the mployees & volunteers for the wonderful work you all do. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246011		/users/profile/333236	sqz1121	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I love thar Best Friends has come to Los Angeles, with a no-kill shelter. They're helping to convince the rest of the country that no-kill is the way that shelters should be run. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246010		/users/profile/333235	Susan385	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best friends is a group that springs from the joy of helping without asking for anything in return. they work so hard and protect those who cannot protect themselves. Spreading their message will help bring more help to more animals. they need all of our support whether financial, volunteering and time or spreading their message.  please help them reach more people and more people means more support and more support means more animals are saved.
Best Friends Animal Society	246008		/users/profile/333233	Kathy210	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends Animal Society are truly inspiring, helping animals everyday. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246006		/users/profile/333231	sauclair	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	This is the most magical wonderful animal rescue/sanctuary in the world!!!  They take in the broken and teach them to be whole again so that they can find their "forever" homes.  They took in 22 of the Vick dogs and made them whole again.  I cannot say enough about the work that is done in this wonderful, wonderful place!!!  Please visit best friends.org.
Best Friends Animal Society	246005		/users/profile/333230	Christina105	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Our whole family has been inspired by Best Friends Animal Society.  My husband and I have rescued as many animals as we can, of all types, for years.  When our daughter came along we shared our love and respect of animals with her.  She knows all about Best Friends and the work they do for animals.  She, and we, have dedicated ourselves to supporting Best Friends and supporting and volunteering for our local no kill shelter.  Respect of animals and of life is one of the most important thing to teach a child.  The Best Friends Sanctuary is a wonderful place to let the whole family the gift of sharing love and saving lives.   
Best Friends Animal Society	246004		/users/profile/333229	Jennpur	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I have visited Best Friends and volunteered there many times. It is a clean, caring, well-run place. Their initiatives, such as Save Them All & TNR Cats, impact the entire country and all the homeless pets in it. If every pound, humane society, rescue, shelter...would follow what Best Friends there would soon be no more homeless pets. I highly recommend learning more about this organization, and visiting if you can. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246003		/users/profile/333228	SLC_Kitten_Foster	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I foster orphaned kittens for Best Friends. I had one particularly tiny guy last summer. Late one night, he suddenly couldn't move; he cried if anyone even touched him. I called the coordinator after midnight; she immediately authorized a visit to the regular emergency vet. When I got there, they were extremely busy. Afraid he wouldn't last, BF sent us to another vet. I was fairly sure we were going to lose him - he had developed a high fever, and his respiration was dropping. BF could have just let him go - he was terribly ill, the vet bills was going to enormous, and the kitten nursery was full of more than 100 other, healthier kittens. But they didn't. A few weeks later, this little one found his forever home through the Pet Adoption Center. I am  proud to say that "Save them all" isn't just a slogan - Best Friends truly lives this goal. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246001		/users/profile/333226	16littlepaws	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I love this organization. They truly care about animals. All of the volunteers I've come into contact with are lovely. They always put animals first and I love following them online to see the good they've done. 
Best Friends Animal Society	246000		/users/profile/265866	JoEllen E.	Donor	5	06/22/2015	This group has done amazing work with animals. To think millions of cats and dogs are put to sleep every year in shelters breaks my heart. Best Friends works tirelessly on behalf of the animals and they need a voice in their court. I hope someday to visit the sanctuary in Utah but for now donating let's me be a part of the solution to find homes for all animals. They have so much love to give!
Best Friends Animal Society	245999		/users/profile/333225	Colleen54	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I went to Best Friends Animal Society a few years ago and was awed at what they do to save animals.  Also, if an animal is not adopted at their facility, he/she will live the rest of his/her life being loved and cared for at Best Friends.  They are a superior example of what an animal sanctuary should be - full of love and kindness for all abused and unwanted animals, a best friend! Thank you and God Bless Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	245998		/users/profile/333224	Yoganana	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends is the gold standard for animal rescue.  They are pivotal in the no kill movement with the no more homeless pets campaign.  They take animals who have nowhere else to go. They support local rescues.  Keep up the great work.  You are my heroes.  
Best Friends Animal Society	245996		/users/profile/333221	Shell V.	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I follow this society on Facebook. I always enjoy reading about how they have rescued an animal from being abused, or about the updates on animals that they are helping. There needs to be more animal rescues like these around! 
Best Friends Animal Society	245995		/users/profile/333220	Roxanne10	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I have been watching and supporting Best Friends for 20 years now. i have watched them grow from a small "sanctuary" in Utah, to a national advocacy group for NoKill shelters across the nation. Their outreach has influenced a generation to adopting shelter pets as opposed to those bred in puppy mills. They have been influential in changing attitudes and laws regarding  breed discrimination.  When ever there is a natural disaster, Best Friends, is there making sure the animals are also rescued. they are the #1 animal rights organization in the US.
Best Friends Animal Society	245994		/users/profile/333219	osterberg	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I first heard of Best Friends in 1998 and have been a contributor ever since.  This is not just a shelter, but a real loving home for every species that needs one.  The animals' needs are met.  They get excellent medical care and their staff loves the animals like their own.  I was particularly touched by the loving, tender, and relentless dedication to rehabilitating the pit bulls known as "Vicktory Dogs".  I wish every state had a Best Friends."
Best Friends Animal Society	245993		/users/profile/333218	TerryS	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I first met the founders of Best Friends in 1991 when they were fundraising in my small town in the San Francisco Bay Area. Two years later, I visited the sanctuary for the first time.  I was captivated by the people and the place -- and especially by the animals. Since those early times, I have visited the sanctuary every summer for the past seven years.  I am constantly impressed and awed by the love and commitment everyone associated with Best Friends demonstrates.  Every year when I visit I stay in a cottage behind Horse Haven and I spend time in all the animal areas.  I work with the dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and pigs.  I talk with the caregivers and with other volunteers. And all I hear from others -- and see for myself -- is that the sanctuary continues to be a miraculous haven for homeless, abused, and abandoned animals. I cherish my time at Best Friends, and consider myself fortunate to be associated with this extraordinary organization.  
Best Friends Animal Society	245992		/users/profile/333217	Joan68	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Best friends is providing a great environment for those that cannot speak or care for themselves.  It is something that I have dreamed of doing since I was in grade school a sanctuary for animals!
Best Friends Animal Society	245991		/users/profile/333216	Volunteer1961	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	The mission, the people, the canyon landscape along with the animals that get to live their lives with no threat of being harmed make Best Friends the happiest place on earth. Volunteering at Best Friends is highly rewarding - more lives get saved because of volunteer participation, I always learn something new, I always feel valued, and because Best Friends has an extensive network program my efforts here actually help to save lives of animals throughout the country. I found a way to ease my sadness of leaving after a volunteer stay; I schedule my next visit!
Best Friends Animal Society	245989		/users/profile/333214	allouallou	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I visited Best Friends in October 2009 and was most impressed with the dedicated knowledgeable and caring people there.  All the animals needs were being met including food, shelter, exercise, play and human interaction. Visiter are greeted upon arrival and given a tour of the site.  There was a variety of animals that we saw including dogs, cats, pot bellied pigs and horses. We were  invited to interact with the animals either by walking dogs, playing with cats etc.  visiters could take dogs to their hotel rooms for an evening and were given food, toys, bedding and instructions on how to look after the dog we were taking home.  We were permitted to walk our  'dog' so that the animal could be socialized to the street and to other people.   It was an amazing experience visiting Best Friends.  Most impressive of all was how well run, clean and inviting this no-kill shelter was.   This letter by no means does justice to the  fantastic organization, the many volunteers and staff who make a great quality of life for the many animals they look after.  Please visit their website for a more in-depth view of Best Friends.  I am hoping to return there in the near future - this time with my 87 year old mother!   
Best Friends Animal Society	245988		/users/profile/333213	Sally63	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I have been supporting this non-profit from afar for a very long time and I felt they were a good organization.  In 2014 I visited the sanctuary in Kanab and was blown away by the magnitude of the effort, the serenity of the canyon, the happiness of the souls that are saved and the tirelessness efforts by the care givers!  Reading the national volunteer facebook pages validates my emotions both during and after my first sanctuary volunteer outing - it is simply a life changing trip to a life changing organization in a truly life affirming location. GREAT WORK BEST FRIENDS ! 
Best Friends Animal Society	245987		/users/profile/333212	tobiola	Donor	5	06/22/2015	This amazing nonprofit is truly "no kill" for all the animals it saves.  In addition, they share their knowledge with other's so that maybe in my lifetime no healthy animal will have to die.
Best Friends Animal Society	245986		/users/profile/333211	sibot7	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends is an inspiring facility! Their "Save Them All" moto is true to their mission. My family's favorite vacation spot is a stay with Best Friends and an opportunity to volunteer with the animals.
Best Friends Animal Society	245985		/users/profile/333210	cariwat1	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I have followed, supported and donated to Best friends for many years.  They have helped lead the nation in promoting a no-kill philosophy through their tireless efforts of rescuing, providing medical care, and rehabilitating all manner of wonderful creatures,  including dogs, cats, horses, birds to name a few.  They took many of the most severely abused "Vic" dogs, eventually adopting  out many to loving homes. They are there during natural disasters and take extreme cases of abused animals. This is an organization consisting of caring individuals dedicated to improving the lives of animals suffering from abuse and neglect.  They truly represent the goodness in mankind.
Best Friends Animal Society	245984		/users/profile/333209	Aprylbw123	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best friends always steps up to help some of the toughest babies recover when others can't or won't. They are rock stars!
Best Friends Animal Society	245983		/users/profile/333208	jb1016	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I visited Best Friends several years ago. As a lifelong animal lover and rescue mom, I found their sanctuary to be a little piece of heaven. It is a beautiful place not only because of their location (Angel Canyon), but also because of all the lives that are saved.  The work that they do at Best Friends is truly inspiring. All animals are given a safe loving place to wait for their forever home, no matter how long that wait may take. It was very apparent on my visit that the staff and volunteers truly care about the animals in their facility...God bless them all for the good work they do!
Best Friends Animal Society	245982		/users/profile/333206	Samara28	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Best friends is an awesome organization that saves many lives. I donate monthly to them . Please consider donating to continue to allow them to help the helpless ! 
Best Friends Animal Society	245981		/users/profile/333205	Diane2e	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I have been following Best Friends for a few years now, I have read their book and will be spending a week and a half out there in October to take a class and volunteer.   I would love nothing more than to do what they are doing for these animals, it is a ton of work but very much needed.   They are the charity that means the most to me. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245980		/users/profile/333204	Christine Joy D.	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I have known of Best Friends for more years than I can remember, I have been inspired by their stories and their generosity to all animals  without asking for donations.  I , when I can, send whatever change I have and know that it goes to support Best Friends (Dogtown, the Rabbit homes, kittens and so forth).  Their name is known everywhere because of their wonderful work and giving care to all creatures (including the human ones who show up needing an uplifting experience).  To see the dogs, cats and other critters thrive in this enviroment makes my heart swell with the knowledge that there are animal safe havens such as Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	245979		/users/profile/333203	Rosie327	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	This no-kill shelter really works with each animal, helping to get them ready for a forever home no matter how long it takes. They run a beautiful facility that is clean and welcoming, and everyone is very nice. So many success stories come out of there!!
Best Friends Animal Society	245978		/users/profile/333202	Shyma M.	General Member of the Public	3	06/22/2015	So I was never close to any dog or cat growing up, I never hated them but one day something happened that changed my life forever.  I was working in a building and people who had dogs were coming and going and I stood outside and asked myself  "Who could love a cat or dog?"   The question suddenly popped up in my head. Then about two months later there was this young man who lived in the building and  was given a brown and white pit bull pup.  The first time I saw the pup it was as if something hit me over the head and I fell in love, ironically it seemed as if something was proving to me that the very question that I asked myself a few months before was being answered right there and then.  I need no more proof that dogs and cats are something more that just  meets the eye.    She was so in sync with me it was so magical.  I still think of her every day, but the story is a long one, I am writing a book about this story, but in narrative fiction,  Hoping to donate some of the profits to charity. I have a long way to go. But I try to write a little bit everyday.
Best Friends Animal Society	245977		/users/profile/333200	Lynn93	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	The work that Best Friends does is exemplary. They are a true model for what a charity should strive to be. What they do for the creatures of this world is amazing!!!
Best Friends Animal Society	245976		/users/profile/333198	Erin98	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I learned about Best Friends many years ago and I send small support to them every month. I wish I had lots to give but I don't. I have a sister who is an animal lover in West Virginia. I live in Arkansas. My sister called me to ask me how to take care of baby opossums whose mother had been run over. I immediately called Best Friends in Utah and they connected my sister to a lady in West Virginia who came to my sister's home, took the babies and raised them. We will be forever indebted to Best Friends. They really do everything possible for animals. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245975		/users/profile/333199	Jennajo	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Love the work they do, wonderful charity. I hope they are able to continue for a long time as they made a big difference so far. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245974		/users/profile/333197	janjan	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I am so moved by everything that Best Friends does for animals and ultimately, for people.  They dedicated themselves to a goal (a very difficult one indeed) and they are getting there.  There is no way to do that without a lot of blood, sweat, tears, donations and grants to support their efforts.  Oh, and volunteers.  I just became one because I believe in them.  100%.
Best Friends Animal Society	245973		/users/profile/333196	Verano15	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends Animal Society has been around for a long time helping animals when others wouldn't/couldn't. All animals deserve a chance. Best Friends educates the public, assists other shelters and leads the way in saving companion animals. I spent several days at their sanctuary in Utah this spring. I was overwhelmed by their commitment and care to saving the animals. Every single worker was dedicated to the animals in his/her care and educating the volunteers. Great organization with tremendous heart. I have been to many shelters and usually leave heartbroken. However, at the end of my volunteer experience at Best Friends, I  was, for the first time, hopeful for the animals I left behind. They have a very clear mission and everyone is working toward the same goals! Love them.

Best Friends Animal Society	245970		/users/profile/333193	Janis6	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Giving animals a safe place to live out their days when shelters kill them is a magnificent thing. Maybe one day all shelters will be no kill by example. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245969		/users/profile/333192	Erin97	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I went to Kanab to visit and volunteer at Best Friends years ago and was so impressed by the caretakers there, the doctors, the trainers, everyone I met.   I participated in the program they had that allowed volunteers staying in the area to take one of the dogs with me at the end of each day to help  socialize them and give them some individual  attention.  Each day I took a sweet dog back to my hotel room in Kanab, walked them, took them to the shops and restaurants in Kanab, and filled out the evaluation form for each dog to give the caretakers feedback on each dog.  The last dog I took touched my heart so much I absolutely fell in love with him.  Ace was a sweet, previously abused pit/lab mix who was so fearful and shy I had to carry him into the hotel room - he was so frightened.  He trembled for hours.  But by the next morning, when I dropped him back off at the sanctuary, we had already bonded.   The look on his face as I left to drive back to the airport just ripped my heart out.  The next day back in New Jersey, I called the sanctuary and began the adoption process.  Ace had already had ACL surgery at Dogtown hospital and he was about to have surgery on his other back knee.   Two months later he was on the mend and on his way to New Jersey to live with me.  He had to rehab his knees and work on his manners to fit in with my other dog and he had many, many fears to overcome.  The trainers and doctors at BF continued to work with me as long as I needed them by offering support and advice.  Ace was a beautiful soul who just a few years later saved my life when things turned dark and hopeless for me when I lost my job and then lost my home.  Ace was there to keep me going ... for me, for him, for us.  So I will forever be grateful to Best Friends for sending my angel Ace to  save my life.  God bless.
Best Friends Animal Society	245967		/users/profile/333190	doxielover	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I spent a week-end at Best Friends Animal Society with a couple of friends and was so happy to be there!  We volunteered our time to help where needed, and got to know a few of the dogs by keeping them over-night in our on-site cabin!  We visited all areas of the campus, enjoying the birds, pigs, horses, cats and other animals housed there.  The staff is so friendly and professional, and our days were so busy the time flew by to fast.  I will definatly return!
Best Friends Animal Society	245965		/users/profile/333189	Juliana3	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends does an amazing job saving animals and raising awareness to the issues surrounding homeless animals. I live in LA and frequently visit their NKLA adoption center and it is just beautiful!! The staff and volunteers are very knowledgeable and the facilities are amazing. All animals seem to have a great quality of life and are treated the best possible way to help them reach their potential.I volunteer at the West LA animal shelter, and every time one of our animals gets rescued to go to NKLA I just know they have won the lottery.
Best Friends Animal Society	245964		/users/profile/333188	thelmalou	Donor	5	06/22/2015	We are seniors who live on Social Security. Consequently, we are very particular where we donate funds. Whenever I can we donate to Best Friends because I know they do great work and are caring and compassionate. The "voiceless" amongst us NEED Best Friends. They are an abandoned or handicapped animal's BEST FRIEND and I thank them for their relentless work.
Best Friends Animal Society	245962		/users/profile/333186	eejitmail	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Most amazing place I've ever been. I am a donor, a continuing student and a volunteer, not to mention a huge fan and advocate. I also adopted a most wonderful dog from Old Friends. I have never met such warm, caring, generous and compassionate people, from the founders down to the caregivers and admins. BFAS has inspired and empowered me to pave my own path to compassion by starting a hospice for senior and disabled dogs. I will continue to support their work and efforts to teach the world that 'saving them all' is a realistic goal. Love is redefined at Best Friends.  
Best Friends Animal Society	245960		/users/profile/333184	Pamela J.	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends Animal Society is a premier animal shelter, conceived by pioneer philanthropists with HEARTS for the lifelong welfare of animals. These dedicated employees and volunteers take in any animal, from around the world, to help it's ability to live well and not to die a terrible death, either from neglect, abuse, or from being [murdered] in an "animal pound." The stories from this society are legend regarding the amount of lives saved and turned to the better, gross neglect turned to health, and miraculously, loving forever families found. I am not personally a volunteer, but I would if I lived near by. It is my privilege to donate on a monthly basis to this most worthy charity. It is also my intention to leave a generous stipend to Best Friends in my will.  The world is a better place because of Best Friends. I can rest assured that atleast somewhere, animals are treated with the kindness, generosity, and loving care they so truly deserve. I say God bless Best Friends Animal Society.
Best Friends Animal Society	245959		/users/profile/333182	Sharon2665	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	A great and beautiful animal rescue. They have every type of animal possible and are super dedicated to making their lives the best they can possibly be, starting with finding them a family. The place is emmaculate and the animals very well cared for with lots of love. I also love the way the are helping through out the US to make all animal shelters no kill shelters.
Best Friends Animal Society	245958		/users/profile/333181	Happycats	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends is the epitome of animal rescue. They have helped countless animals of all kinds live. By saving them, vetting them, and socializing these animals they give them a second chance at life. It is what I would want to do if I won the lottery. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245957		/users/profile/333180	janbee01	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I have been a longtime supporter of the no-kill movement.  Even though I live in Minnesota, I learned about Best Friends Animal Society from a close friend.  I fell in love with this place from the first day I read about it.  I cannot donate great amounts, but when I can, I donate to Best Friends.  We were driving home from Arizona in April, and I saw the sign for Best Friends.  I did not realize that we would be driving right by!  We stopped there, and I was amazed at what I saw. We drove through the dog town areas, saw the horses and other animals--and saw so many dogs wearing yellow "Adopt Me" vests while walking with volunteers.  My only regret was that we did not have time to stay in one of the cottages and host a guest animal...well, and I do regret that I could not bring one of the "Adopt Me" dogs home with me!! Maybe next year!  I cannot think of another non-profit that touches me the way that Best Friends does.  They are the best of the best, and what they do for our animals is beyond just charity work--it is the work of the soul.
Best Friends Animal Society	245956		/users/profile/333179	janisjsalas	Donor	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends doesn't just "talk the talk," they "walk the walk." I see it in the faces of all the animals that they save. That's why we support all their efforts. Keep up the great work. Thanks for all you do. Jan Salas
Best Friends Animal Society	245955		/users/profile/333177	dafootes	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I have been a donor, a volunteer and adoptive parent to two dogs so from multiple angles, I can tell you that Best Friends is a fantastic organization. Lots of organizations have good causes - Best Friends combines the cause with great use of resources, an impressive system for allowing volunteers to assist for a few hours or days and an amazingly successful campaign to support local organizations doing similar work.  A+!
Best Friends Animal Society	245954		/users/profile/333176	Jrlazydog	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/22/2015	I worked in an open admission municipal shelter for 7 years, before I couldn't cope with the compassion fatigue any longer. I took a break, and worked in social services, but I missed the passion I feel working with animals. I applied to Best Friends, and journeyed there for a 2 week working interview. I was offered a position, but was unable to find housing that would accept my 3 dogs. So, I decided to use my new knowledge and rekindled spark locally. I accepted a position as the director of a local Humane Society. I am using everything I learned at Best Friends every day. From tnr/snr programs, open adoption, behavior work, and never giving up, Best Friends showed me that with enough flexibility, forward thinking, and commitment, we really can save them all. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245953		/users/profile/271032	jklueder	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	I fell in love with Best Friends from the moment I visited the Sanctuary.  The love and care shown the animals is truly outstanding.  Since that visit six years ago, I have supported them wherever I could and spread the word about the wonderful job they do.  As a teacher, it is important that today's youth realize the importance of treating the animals with the love, kindness, and respect they deserve.  I have used the example of Best Friends as how we are suppose to treat our fellow creatures.  I am looking forward to visiting the Sanctuary again this Fall.

Best Friends Animal Society	245951		/users/profile/333173	Ldepietro	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	My husband and I visited Best Friends earlier this month as part of our honeymoon trip to Utah. We ate a delicious vegan lunch at their conference facility, and spent the rest of the day taking a tour of the facility. They are extremely well-organized and the animals are clearly happy and well cared for. We were so inspired that we became members that same day, and even my husband- who is a hard-core carnivore - bought a Best Friends hoodie at the gift ship. We had no idea they were connected to facilities all over the U.S.! We feel good knowing we are contributing to such an amazing organization with a clearly effective plan.

It's closest thing to animal heaven! 
Best Friends Animal Society	95901		/users/profile/111584	Gina A.	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	Hard to put into words,my feelings the day I arrived @ Best Friends,I actually cried. My heart was overwhelmed by the beauty,the people & of course  the animals I met,saw. Something I will never forget as long as I live. I've never had such a feeling of being in the right place,I think I could live in that town. Will absolutely return one day& do some volunteering.I did get to brush some animals. I recall the Angel's Rest area and being so touched by it. God Bless BFAS!
Best Friends Animal Society	245949		/users/profile/333172	Debbie167	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I had been volunteering the weekend some years ago when they had just taken in all of Michael Vick's abused dogs.  They successfully found homes for almost every single dog.  There were people that were working with them helping to get them over their fears.  They were patient and helped them to become adoptable.  If it wasn't for the people at Best Friends..Im sure these dogs would have been destroyed.  What a feeling to save someone's life (be it animal or human) that others might have given up on!!  
Best Friends Animal Society	245948		/users/profile/333171	Jennifer451	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	I have visited a few times.   Their mission is one of humbling compassion.   Love flows from their hearts.   Hey-They even rehab - ed done Michael Vick pitties!  They never give up. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245947		/users/profile/333170	Joanne1021	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	As an animal lover, I watch many animal sanctuaries and rescues and I'm always impressed by the Best Friends Animal Society.  They go above and beyond when it comes to the care and rehabilitation of animals and always to their best to heal and nuture the animals.  It's a great organization.
Best Friends Animal Society	245946		/users/profile/333169	sujaha	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Noone does it better than Best Friends.  Their tagline says it all:  "Save Them All."  And everything they do, everything they say, every mailing, email and Facebook post going out supports that mission.  When you walk onto the Sanctuary and see the work being done there, you know it's not just hype.  When you talk with everyone from a worker in the gift shop to one of the founders, you know the extent of the commitment.  The workshops are superb; their magazine and marketing publications are on target.  When you attend their national conferences, you come across with full minds, toolboxes, and hearts.  We have been BF members, donors, and volunteers for more than a decade, and I am always heartened to know that every dime goes toward getting us further down the road to Save Them All.  No organization can survive with just a good heart and good intentions.  BF has mastered the balance of compassion and activism with superb business sense.  As I said, noone does it better!
Best Friends Animal Society	245945		/users/profile/333167	Boom-Boom	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I don't have an adoption story from Best Friends, but I am a donor and the work they do is far above the call of duty. This is the BEST and Best Friends really are.
Best Friends Animal Society	245944		/users/profile/333166	Marsha18	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I have been a supporter of Best Friends ever since I stepped off a plane in Las Vegas.  Someone was in the airport promoting Best Friends and I have been a friend ever since.  I give what I can and when I can.  We also help some people who support a catch and release program in our town.  He takes care of some cats who live in an area.  We visit to make sure they are  ok , every day.  Best Friends supports all local areas and encourages others to care about the free animals in the neighborhoods.  We have 3 cats and 2 dogs who were all strays.  Our vet bills are high due to our dog having many problems from being an inbred dog of a puppy mill.  Best Friends is about ALL NEIGHBORHOODS  pulling together.  Do what you can and when you can.  Best Friends appreciates all that you do.  Donate to them today and save your local animals.  We can save them all.

When I can,  I buy a  lottery ticket here in S.C. and I always say to myself...if I win big...they will be one of the first ones on my list that I will help. This organization is so wonderful. The team that works there are just an amazing, caring group of people.  If I lived near them....I would love to volunteer.  There are so many animals that are euthanized every day, and Best Friends does more than their share to prevent this ....they can't do it alone...but they help as many as they possibly can. Of all the organizations out there...I have to say...this one has my vote, hands down!!   Sincerely,  Kathy McGuffin
Best Friends Animal Society	245937		/users/profile/262775	Ahminy	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends was one of the first groups in the nation to work towards a no-kill society.  They not only help animals in their area, but have expanded to help rescue groups all over the country.  They educate people, train people to save animals, and work towards laws to protect animals in this country.  They help all kinds of animals - not just dogs and cats.  Their philosophy is a philosophy that I admire greatly and they have helped SO many people and animals.
Best Friends Animal Society	245936		/users/profile/333159	Catperson	Donor	5	06/22/2015	This is the BEST animal shelter in the world!  I visited and volunteered, and I can guarantee you these folks are really making a difference in animal lives.  Their facility is clean, well staffed, friendly and animal oriented.  They do such great work in rescuing animals of every variety, caring for them, and loving every one of them.
Best Friends Animal Society	245935		/users/profile/333158	Judy140	Donor	5	06/22/2015	I truly love this charity and their philosophy. I believe in them so much that I have a non profit business and send 100% of what I make to Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	245934		/users/profile/333157	Cynthia N.	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends Animal Society is an amazing organization and an incredible inspiration to numerous other animal rescue groups. I toured the facility once about 15 years ago and was impressed beyond belief. Though every part of the tour was interesting, I remember feeling so moved by the buildings and staff dedicated to caring for and treating, rather than euthanizing, cats with leukemia and other serious problems. They even allowed my German wire-haired pointer Penny to accompany me on most of the tour and take their beautiful nature hike!
Best Friends Animal Society	245933		/users/profile/333156	kbowser105	Donor	5	06/22/2015	This is the non-profit to which I will leave a substantial trust for my two larger parrots, a CAG and U2, so that they may be either cared for by Best Friends after I pass or adopted out to a great new parront for my babies.  I contribute monthly now, but my plan is to make sure my parrots are well taken care of upon my death and no other rescue in the entire US is as good as Best Friends.  I live in FL and am involved in dog and parrot rescue so I have no other reason to leave this review except that I feel strongly that everyone should know what a fabulous job they do for all animals.  Thanks Best Friends...you are my hero
Best Friends Animal Society	245932		/users/profile/333155	hruth	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Adopting from Best Friends is one of the best decisions I ever made. A few months ago I went on their website and found a cat whose profile I absolutely fell in love with. I emailed them, and they were able to help me adopt her. They paid for the expense of driving her up to me (about a five hour drive) and supplied me with starter food, medical records, blankets, a carrier, and toys--all for free! They also do specials where people can get animals at a reduced cost; I got my cat for free! Best Friends' work helps to save animals lives, but I believe --and know--that it helps to save people's lives too, by easily and efficiently connecting them with animals. I have been struggling with severe depression and my cat from Best Friends is one of the things that has helped me the most with that. It is amazing to see how much time and effort they give to helping animals in need. I LOVE BEST FRIENDS! 
Best Friends Animal Society	245931		/users/profile/333154	Gail113	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends' dedication to caring for animals who are in need is to be admired.  I am so grateful to know that there are still those who find value in every life.  Seeing the remarkable changes they make in rehabilitating what seem to be lost causes is inspiring.  I wish there could be more organizations doing this kind of work on this scale!
Best Friends Animal Society	245929		/users/profile/333153	Lisa449	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends is an incredible organization that saves so many precious animal lives.  Their sanctuary is top notch and so is their volunteer program.  Most importantly, they inspire individuals to DO SOMETHING about homeless pets right where they live.  They are leaders in animal behavior programs that rehabilitate animals that would otherwise be euthanized.  They are what most shelters want to be when they grow up!
Best Friends Animal Society	245927		/users/profile/333151	GayleKirma	General Member of the Public	5	06/22/2015	The BEST FRIENDS organization is just that--the BEST!

Organizations don't come much better than this for animal welfare.  They actually put their money where their mouth is. Always ready to step in to help in a bad situation, and the permanent facility they maintain is just the best and a standard to strive for in the animal welfare universe.
Best Friends Animal Society	245920		/users/profile/333143	Mariew	Donor	5	06/22/2015	My husband and I have been donating to Best Friends for years.  My sister has visited their Utah compound and was totally impressed with all the facilities and care for the numerous rescue animals.  They are spreading out and partnering with other no-kill shelters throughout the US to get more help to those rescuing.  They take in difficult cases of abuse and get them the care they need and help find homes for them.   I love everything about this place and the people who run it.  Kudos.
Best Friends Animal Society	245919		/users/profile/333142	ut90t45	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	Best Friends sets the bar for every animal rescue to follow.  I help local rescues, who are forever in need due to the volume of animals that are homeless, abused and abandoned.  BF covers all that bases - vetting animals for adoption, teaching, spearheading local events to raise money and awareness and encourage the volunteers that are essential to changing things, that there is hope to save them all. I work with other non-profits, but the animal groups are number 1, and BF leads the way.

Best Friends Animal Society	245915		/users/profile/333138	robbim	Volunteer	5	06/22/2015	  I am just amazed at the good work that is done by Best Friends Animal Society.  I help a local cat rescue by fostering special needs cats and at a recent adoption event, I was looking at my Facebook page and was reading a post made by Best Friends.  A woman that was looking to adopt one of our cats saw the post and mentioned that she had adopted a cat from Best Friends a few years ago.  We started talking about all the wonderful work they do, and soon-yet another woman stopped and was talking about possibly adopting a dog she had seen on Best Friends through Facebook.  They may not realize how many people out here have noticed their posts...some even adopting from them...but word spreads very quickly at these events and I keep hearing very, very good things about Best Friends.  Their good work and kindness spreads far and wide.  What a great example they are of what Animal Rescue is all about!  They are the BEST!
Best Friends Animal Society	245914		/users/profile/333137	Val_5	Donor	5	06/22/2015	The life changing work that Best Friends does for animals who have no other place to go has inspired me to get involved locally. I saved the life of a doggie who was near eurhanization and is now the love of my 4 year old daughter's life. They lead by example and are changing the world one paw at a time. 
Best Friends Animal Society	245911		/users/profile/333133	dbros4999	Client Served	5	06/22/2015	In 2009 my wife and I were looking for a rescue Dog and my mother-in-law alerted us to Best Friends Society. We visited their beautiful sanctuary in Kanab, Utah where we found our new best friend. A beautiful black lab, 6 months old was waiting for us with his brothers and sisters who were also looking for a home.  By the time we picked him up he had already been studying hard in his puppy classes and knew how to sit, lie down and "come" on command. He only took 2 weeks to be house trained as well. All thanks to the wonderful people at Best Friends.  6 years later, he continues to amaze us. We could not imagine our lives without our boy. Best Friends has been the most rewarding experience ever in terms of working with a non-profit. We are supporters for life now.  Sincerely, Denis Brosnan
Best Friends Animal Society	235180	16	/users/profile/314489	Rangerman	Volunteer	2	12/09/2014	I have volunteered at Best Friends and found it extremely rewarding. They are doing good for the animals. However, I find their form 990 of their 2012 Tax return disturbing. The total compensation for the officers and directors is around $1,000,000 and their total revenue for 2012 was approximately $64 million with $17 million going to animal care activities and $26 million for salaries and benefits.  Of the officers and directors three of them are paid approximately $190,000 per year. Animal food and medical care is only approximately $4 million. About $6 million goes to fund raising. This seems out of balance to me. They are really good at raising money but not so good at spending it on the animals. I will continue to volunteer my time but not my money.

Best Friends Animal Society	187962	1	/users/profile/245140	kittiesrbest	Donor	5	11/06/2013	I was lucky enough to visit the sanctuary and "work" in the various cat houses every day for a week and I can't tell you how wonderful Best Friends is.  The work they do to eliminate unnecessary euthanasia and to help animals everyone else has given up on is incredible.   I wish there were more places like Best Friends around the world because if there were - this world would be a better place for all of us - especially our animal friends!
Best Friends Animal Society	172418	12	/users/profile/228318	Robin81	General Member of the Public	1	09/30/2013	I felt that this was a very good organization at first. However, they provide money donated by others in instances that deception and unlawful actions take place.  I wrote to them about San Antonio, Texas - Animal Care Services (ACS) unlawful acts that cause the deaths of many animals. Best Friends had no interest, even though they donate a great deal of other people's money to ACS. I sent them a link to my article to outline what is taking place. Animal Care Service's history of deception in San Antonio, TXhttp://www.examiner.com/article/animal-care-service-s-history-of-deception-san-antonio-tx

BFAS was actually originally founded as a cult religion by a few rich British kids. Your read it right. BFAS's original name was the Process Church of the Final Judgment. That's just the beginning..See for yourself at:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Friends_Animal_Society Interviewed Charles Manson and featured him on the cover of their magazine? Yep! Only began "raising money for animals" when they realized more people in England would give donations if they said the money would help animals. Paid board members! That's right, a process illegal in most states - paying your board salaries - the board made up of the founding fathers of the Process Church - they are paid salaries to impartially vote on matters that affect the future of BFAS and how it spends your money. The BBB and Charity Navigator both point this out in their red flag reports. This organization's story is exceedingly sad and the truth hurts. But let this be a lesson - with enough money and great, heart-gripping marketing stories, we all can be duped into supporting something we never would if we just took a few minutes to find out a little more information. Do your research. Google terms like "truth about..." followed by the name of the charity you're thinking of supporting. You may be shocked.

Best Friends Animal Society	152547	4	/users/profile/203515	randirph	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	I had donated to Best Friends for several years before I visited the Sanctuary and volunteered there. Now I donate more. It is impossible to adequately  describe the Sanctuary. It is huge! They have all sorts of animals there divided into different areas. The staff is totally committed to the best interests of the animals and they all seem to love their jobs.That this was developed by a small group of dedicated individuals is phenomenal! Donating to Best Friends is not just donating to this Sanctuary in Utah. Best Friends has outreach programs that impact all areas of the country. There main focus is to bring about a time of no more homeless pets. Best Friends members have made significant strides in Los Angeles where sales of dogs in pet stores is now banned. The New York group rescued a group of Beagles from a laboratory a few years ago. Teams of Best Friends are among the first on the scene at disasters to help the animals. They spent 6 months in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. They are actively working throughout the country to strike down breed specific legislation aimed at pit bull type dogs. They rehabilitated the worst of Michael Vick's fighting dogs and have adopted several of them out into loving homes. The training methods they use are really very simple, involving patience and love instead of domination and punishment. This charity has grown to become one of the"big guys" in the animal world and many people are critical of this. But this enables them to have the outreach I mentioned above and give aid and grants to other groups working toward a time of no more homeless pets. I could go on for days about the wonderful things this group does! My donation dollars go to local rescues and to Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	147740	3	/users/profile/195477	John McAuliffe	Volunteer	5	01/07/2013	My only sadness about Best Friends Animal Society and its sanctuary in Kanab UT is that not everyone is aware of the effort, excellence and enthusiasm by these dedicated animal lovers and caregivers.  Multiple visits, volunteering at the sanctuary, continues to reinforce my admiration for the professional staff and their ceaseless efforts to affect the attitude and behavior of the animals and birds under their care.  Their mission, "No More Homeless Pets" is woven into the fabric of their operations and mindsets.   The flow of volunteers visiting the sanctuary, including myself,  quickly learn that love and best intentions are not adequate to improve the lives of these smallest of God;s creatures.   Instead, I learned about patience and persistence as well as relying on the expertise of the Best Friends professionals: if I wanted to make an impact upon animals who still are wary of humans, due to past experiences.   Stimulated by my experiences there, and informed and educated by Best Friends sponsored Workshops,  I re-enter my own community with commitment to aid local Shelters in any way, too.   
Best Friends Animal Society	133966	2	/users/profile/179732	Jaki R.	Donor	5	11/05/2012	I donated $10.00 to this charity to help out any hurt and abandoned animals from the Hurricane Sandy disaster in New York City. This is a great charity because it make sure they can help out animals without putting them  down. And you don't just choose this charity, but they give you an option to state any specifics on how your donation is used. So many people send money to hurt people, sick people, which is extremely important, but there are so many animals that need help too, and those animals can't help themselves, so I feel the Best Friends Animal Society is doing a great job at making sure those animals aren't forgotten. Please help out these poor, innocent, and defenseless animals are taken care of, and I wish to thank this charity to coming into existence so I can make a donation to do my part. I don't know for sure that anything was done, but I'm sure it was used and made a difference. 
Best Friends Animal Society	126206	1	/users/profile/138864	allmnpch	Donor	5	10/16/2012	I have been donating to Best Friends for a number of years now mostly because of the amazing work they do to help creatures large and small either find a forever home or gives them a wonderful place to call home.  The work they have done with re-branding Pit Bulls is fantastic.  I would love to live closer so I could volunteer to help with the loving environment they create.  
Best Friends Animal Society	126176	1	/users/profile/113178	Judy2345	Donor	5	10/16/2012	Best Friends does incredible work providing a no-kill shelter for all animals in need.  I wish we had more organizations like them.
Best Friends Animal Society	96860		/users/profile/113178	Judy2345	Donor	5	08/29/2011	I love this organization.  I first learned of it by watching DogTown, and I fell in love with what they do.  I wish all shelters could help rehabilitate and provide a no-kill policy.  Seeing what they do makes me want to move to Utah and work with them!
Best Friends Animal Society	119216	2	/users/profile/99614	donnajeanw	Donor	5	07/24/2012	I have been a monthly automatic donor to Best Friends Animal Society for years.  Last week I had the chance to visit the Sanctuary near Kanab, UT.  It was beyond my expectations. They do lovely van tours. The area is just beautiful, and everyone is really nice and welcoming. There is so much love in the air, and you can tell everyone just loves what they are doing.  There are some beautiful things to see in the area, not the least of which are Zion National Park, the Coral Pink Sand Dunes, and best of all (IMHO), Moqui Cave.  If you ever think about visiting Best Friends, don't miss it.
Best Friends Animal Society	116962		/users/profile/159145	1210	Volunteer	5	06/28/2012	i volunteer with Best Friends and have seen first hand how they help in disasters (Katrina) setting up an area to help the animals, providing medical care and shelter for the animals in need. They do more than any other animal organization that i know of. They aslo support other group by giving them grants and offer courses in how others can set up their own rescue. They are incredibly supportive and encouraging. They also help train vets in other countries to learn how to spay & neuter. i can not say enough good things about Robin Harmon, one of their employees who has the biggest heart of any one i know. They are making a huge difference in the lives of many many animals and also humans. 
Best Friends Animal Society	98619	38	/users/profile/117150	marthapowers	Professional with expertise in this field	1	09/29/2011	This used to be the most admirable animal sanctuary in the country when it was managed by Michael Mountain, but it's been a steady downhill ever since. Gregory Castle's background more than 10 years back is a complete mystery; certainly he is not a recognized top-notch animal welfare professional.  He has some vague history in church and accounting prior to his work with No More Homeless Pets in Utah. Recently BFAS conducted a nationwide search (via a pricey head-hunter) for a Chief Marketing Officer and a Chief Development Officer -- both jobs with salaries up to $180,000.  Gregory Castle's wife, a nice lady with breast cancer and no marketing experience, landed the CMO job. Michael Mountain took an extremely modest five-figure salary during his entire tenure at BFAS, so to see six-figure salaries (which in Kanab, Utah, is completely uncalled for) becoming routine is very disturbing. Do you want your donation of $25 or $50 to be just a pittance to these people? And by the way, they make over $50 million/year and care for at most 2000 animals.  Do the math:  that's $25,000 per animal.  Heck, in Kanab, Utah, you could build a small house for every animal with that much money. Where is the money going, Best Friends? 
Best Friends Animal Society	97052	1	/users/profile/113463	Louise R.	Donor	5	09/01/2011	 Best Friends is just wonderful. They help so many broken animals. I love the stories they tell about some of their animals. Plus they send cool videos. I love O. He is not very handsome but he sure is fun!I have been a donor for a very long time. I trust what they do with the money I give. I admire the founders, they are very special. The most important part of BF is everyone who works, volunteers,or just visit for a day love the animals with there whole heart. I thank God for the wonderful place and I thank everyone who care for the animals.    This is send with my heart full of love for the animals and the wonderful people.                God Bless You.       Louise Reardon and my dogs Olivia. Mazie Grace,Penelope, Maggie and all of our cats.

We went out this summer and volunteered for a week.  The place is amazing and it's all about the animals and not the tourists.  I am also a donor and gladly help them with the amazing work they are doing!
Best Friends Animal Society	96946	1	/users/profile/113307	sandidi	Donor	5	08/30/2011	I have watched Best Friends help some animals that people had given up on and come out with such heartfelt results.  They never give up.  The animals at Best Friends get the very best treatment and all the attention, affection, love and training.   They rescued quite a few of the Vick dogs and were able to rehabilitate and give them forever homes.  They have also rescued dogs from hoarders and puppy mills.  They are truly the angels of shelters.  They are actually more than a shelter, they are a community in itself. God Bless the people of Best Friends, they are truly dedicated.
Best Friends Animal Society	96904		/users/profile/113250	Linda2345678	Volunteer	5	08/30/2011	A friend and I visited Best Friends last October.  Visiting there was on  my bucket list and I fulfilled my wish. It is a wonderful place that is set in some of the most beautiful country I have ever seen.  The staff there were so helpful to all the volunteers.  You could see that they loved their jobs - who wouldn't! - and they are so loving and caring toward all the animals there.  All the facilities were immaculate.  The lunches were wonderful and served in a very scenic location.  Angel's Rest was the most spiritual place I have ever been in. A beautiful setting - the chimes blowing in the soft breeze.  What a wonderful place for your pet to be placed.   I can think of nothing that was negative there.  I just wish we could have stayed longer.  I pray that I will be able to make the trip back again.   We traveled thousands of miles to visit there.  I just wish there was a Best Friends close to my home.  I would spend all my time volunteering there.  God Bless you Best Friends for the amazing work you do and the loving care to all the animals in your care there and also all the good work you do around the country.
Best Friends Animal Society	96874		/users/profile/113199	Robyn L.	Volunteer	5	08/30/2011	I have volunteered at Best Friends for the last three years and I could say without any hesitation, these guys are amazing!  Not only do they do a wonderful job of taking care of the animals on their sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, they also offer seminars, and lectures for any rescue group looking for information and guidance on how to run their own successful organization.  The whole volunteer experience at Best Friends is great!  They start you off with an overview (or orientation) of the sanctuary.  Then, they have you sign up to work with the animals you would feel most comfortable working with (i.e. dogs, cats, pigs, etc.)  You can chose a variety of duties, not limited to cleaning, or feeding, but things like walking, brushing, talking a dog on an "outing" or "sleepover".  The staff at Best Friends is incredible.  They make you feel like part of the team.  It is very comfortable.
Best Friends Animal Society	96873		/users/profile/113198	Chancecody	Volunteer	5	08/30/2011	Best Friends is an outstanding organization that literally helps thousands of animals both at the sanctuary where they can live out their furever lives and in the home of the lucky individuals who adopt from them.  I recently took the Emergency Rescue Training and have learned even more about this great organization.  If you haven't been to the sanctuary in Utah you must go and meet the pigs, dogs, cats, birds, bunnies, horses and all the rest.  My favorite part is the exceptional steps they take for those animals who suffer disabilities.  I just can't say enough great things about them.  I am a Guardian and a Sponsor for Squeaky - one of the pigs.  Please join me and help out one of the many, many animals in need. 
Best Friends Animal Society	96870		/users/profile/113194	Jean23	Client Served	5	08/30/2011	It may sound like a cliche, but I found my best friend, King, at Best Friends. King was an older dog and had been in two other homes prior to his stint at BF through no fault of his own.  At most shelters, King would have been put down but not at Best Friends!  He was ere, waiting just for me. That was three years ago and I have loved every minute of my elder friend who hikes, swims, backpacks and snuggle with me.  BTW, I also do volunteer for this organization and it is a wonderful experience. 
Best Friends Animal Society	96869		/users/profile/113193	Ren B.	Volunteer	5	08/30/2011	I had the opportunity to volunteer with Best Friends for a couple of weeks along with some family members several summers ago. I had always heard wonderful things about Best Friends, but the experience vastly exceeded my expectations. I have volunteered for over a dozen animal welfare and rescue organizations, and Best Friends is by far the finest. The animal enclosures are innovative, spacious, appropriate, and well enriched. Animal care, nutrition, and socialization practices are progressive and superior to what most animals receive in private homes, forget in a rescue/shelter environment. The staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and the volunteer program well organized. And finally, the organization's mission and philosophy are admirable and fully reflected by the work they do. As someone who has been doing private rescue for roughly ten years, Best Friends is my go-to standard for how I can improve upon my own practices.  This is absolutely what every rescue should be striving to emulate.
Best Friends Animal Society	96868		/users/profile/113186	Donnita P.	Volunteer	5	08/30/2011	Best Friends is a fine example of collaboration, caring and efficiency. They have an amazing network of volunteers, a well chosen and caring staff and their reach is incredible. From rescuing animals in the wake of disasters, matching pets with forever homes and advocating on behalf of all sorts of animals, they are unmatched when it comes to living their motto..."No More Homeless Pets." Kudos to Best Friends!
Best Friends Animal Society	96866		/users/profile/113184	Shelley Wilcox Young	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	Best Friends is a godsend for animals.  It provides a loving forever home for many animals.  I was worried about volunteering after visiting other animal shelters.  Best Friends was totally different, filled with people who really care about the animals and appreciate the volunteers.  Our favorite place was Rescue Village, with all the rabbits.  We really liked Dave and Terry (I think Terry), who give it their all each day and know all the rabbits, their diagnoses and idiosyncrasies.  I am proud to have volunteered, will do so again.   My husband and I live in Florida, and when we decided to work this summer we Oochose to work at Ruby's RV Park, specifically close to Kanab so we could volunteer.
Best Friends Animal Society	96863		/users/profile/113183	Joanne23	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2011	I think what they do is great. Their memorial tribute and sanctuary to our beloved pets who have crossed the Rainbow Bridge is beyond words. I live in Wisconsin and am unable to come to the area but I would if I could. My Sophie is a young 2 year old yellow lab mix who I hope is with us for a very long time. I can only hope that when it is her time to cross the Rainbow Bridge that it is peaceful and on her terms. I would love to have a sanctuary like this in my area. 
Best Friends Animal Society	96861		/users/profile/113179	Cheryl W.	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2011	I first became aware of Best Friends through the television show "Dog Town".  I saw the love and dedication the staff has for the animals that come to Best Friends , as well as other animals that have a need . But what really showed me what they were made of was when they took in the Vicks dogs. They wasted no energy on Vicks or his actions, what mattered was the dogs. That's when I realized that here was a group of people with singleness of purpose. I admire them, respect them and I'm grateful for the job they do. 
Best Friends Animal Society	96859		/users/profile/113174	Randi R.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I don't remember when I first heard of Best Friends. Having always supported animal causes I began sending small contributions. One snowy winter afternoon I received a call from a member of Best Friends just to thank me for my contributions and for caring about animals. After reading the book Best Friends: The True Story of the World's Most Beloved Animal Sanctuary about a group of friends who envisioned a time of no more homeless pets, I knew I had to visit the Sanctuary. Seeing what they have built from the ground up, knowing the challenges and hardships the founders faced is beyond description. I could feel the love the minute we drove into Angel Canyon. It is a beautiful happy place. The animals are extremely well cared for in separate areas for each species. I worked in Dogtown where the dogs live in octagonal buildings designed by one of the founders with  indoor-outdoor runs and not a cage in site! The caregivers truly care about the dogs and develop a relationship with each one in their care, helping them to adjust and grow with the hope of a forever home. Everything here is positive-no harsh words, no pulling on the leash, no dominating the dogs as other trainers do. Everything is positive reinforcement only and the results are amazing. The first year we went, the rest of the family was dubious about this working vacation and I think they were just humoring me. By the first afternoon, my husband was saying "Next year when we come back..." Neither of us can stop talking about this wonderful place of peace and happiness in the midst of our chaotic world. For me the trip is a spiritual experience. God made this beautiful land and gave these people the vision and determination to achieve their goals. He gave the people who work there the love and ability to care for these animals and increase their likelihood of being adopted. For most of the animals this is their only chance at survival. Best Friends takes the difficult cases-sick, abused, aggressive-who would have been destroyed in other animal shelters. They give the animals top veterinary care and positive training. Many of these animals go on to forever homes but the ones who don't remain at Best Friends for the rest of their lives and are lovingly interred at Angel's Rest cemetery once they cross the Rainbow Bridge. The National Geographic TV series Dogtown  spread the knowledge and good new of Best Friends.  Volunteers from all over the world go there to be a small part of this wonderful vision of a time of no more homeless pets. Best Friends sends crews all over the world to assist in times of crisis like Hurricane Katrina where they spent months in Louisiana rescuing animals. They send crews to puppy mill busts, rescuing and relocating these poor animals. They took in the worst of Michael Vick's fighting dogs, now known as the Vicktory dogs, and rehabilitated them despite others' assertions that this could not be done. This has brought a new awareness of breed discrimination across the country. Best Friends works with other rescue groups and has many affiliate groups across the country to educate people and help bring about a time of no more homeless pets. Mahatma Gandhi said  The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated.  If all animals and indeed all people were treated like the animals of Best Friends the world would be a wonderful place.
Best Friends Animal Society	96853		/users/profile/113167	Nancy2345	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	Best Friends has to be heaven on Earth to the animals that inhabit the sanctuary,,I have been there twice and if one were to ask me for one word to describe my experience,,it would be "spiritual", The beauty of the surroundings mixed with the over and above dedication of those who work there make for an unbelievable experience,,,who else would have a pot belly pig on an overnight? Who else would have men sleeping with their arms around Michael Vick's dogs so they could be socialized? It is a labor of love from these people,,it is a mind altering experience for those who volunteer with these glorious animals,,Wish I lived closer but I do sponsor an animal in their Guardian Angel program,,do yourself and your family a big favor and visit, volunteer and come away in love with the beasties that inhabit Best Friends.
Best Friends Animal Society	96851		/users/profile/113165	bradricksmom	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	best friends is one of the most beautiful and peaceful places on earth!  the atmosphere was amazing and the people were nice and helpful.  i was only able to stay a few days, but i could have stayed forever.  the animals were all so happy and cared for.  the animals' living quarters were fabulous.  i loved being in a place that was open and accepting of my dogs that came along for the trip (i have a pit bull).  there were a million animals to meet and work with.  unfortunately my volunteering time was cut short by a snow storm, but i can't wait to go back.  not only is the sanctuary breathtaking, but also the work that best friends does across the country speaks for itself.  they have helped save countless animals and given them the chance to feel loved.  i love best friends! 
Best Friends Animal Society	96845		/users/profile/113156	djaye15	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I like many ..heard about Best Friends through the NatGeo series "DogTown".  I knew these folks were the real deal.  You could just tell by the way they told stories of rescue and redemption.  I am headed to the sanctuary this October for my 3rd time volunteering!  If you are looking for what has become my favorite vacaction to take.  Go there , speand a couple of days vulunteering.  You wont be sorry.  You will come home knowing you made a difference in an animal's life, and had a really fun time too!
Best Friends Animal Society	96844		/users/profile/113155	Tara O.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	A friend and I spent three days there helping with the dogs. Its an amazing place! Extremely well run and organized. Best experience ever. Any one that is an animal lover and in Las Vegas, should make the short two hour ride up there. Can't wait to go back. We did over night stays with a different dog on each night. Its was just great. So happy to see them just fall sleep in a nice quiet fluffy bed and sleep straight thru the night. I think it feel just as good for me to be able to help. Saying good bye the next morning was hard, but its nice to know how well treated they are. The grounds were beautiful and well maintain. The town was small but offered everything you need. A nice place to get away from the hustle and bustle of bust life. A must for any animal volunteer!
Best Friends Animal Society	96842		/users/profile/113152	Dorothy R.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	A couple of years ago, I visited Best Friends and was OVERWHELMED by the sheer size and reach of the rescue!  The organization and logistic skills they have are AMAZING. I'm a cat lover (and I love dogs too) so I spent most of my time in the cat bungalows.  It was incredible the number of cats -- from newborns to ferals to permanently disabled -- that would have safe, secure and loving places to live for the rest of their lives (if needed).  I was sooo astonished at the buildings and all of the THOUGHT that went into them...in some cases, pure GENIUS! What most impresses me about Best Friends is that they don't define their efforts with borders.  They help all types of animals, both domestically AND internationally!  Shortly before my trip, they had just flown a cargo plane full of dogs (over 100) to Utah from a war-torn area in the Middle East!  The work and diplomacy to get that done had to be immense! It was such an uplifting and positive experience that I've wanted to go every year.  I'm finally managing to get there in a few weeks.  And I KNOW that just like the first time, I'll cry as I drive away because I WON'T want to leave!

Everyone is so happy and cheerful and positive, from the workers, to the pets to the volunteers!  It was awesome.  I think ALL shelters should come for a visit and see why your facility is the tops.   Every single shelter ought to be run like yours.  Then, they would be happy places to visit, adopt from, donate to, and  volunteer at etc... Positive and grateful, all shelter workers could benefit from that attitude, so could the animals in your care. Thanks for being awesome!Ramona Ruhf
Best Friends Animal Society	96834		/users/profile/113146	Erin R.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	The best most loving place in the world! We volunteered there and were overwhelmed by the love the animals recieve. Truly heaven on earth for the animals, and the people too. 
Best Friends Animal Society	96832		/users/profile/113144	Lisa2345678	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I visited Best Friends in Utah a few years ago and was extremely impressed.  Their facilities are terrific and the animals are obviously well-loved.  They have several great jobs for volunteers.  I socialized puppies, walked dogs, cleaned runs and took one dog on an all-day field trip to Coral Pink Dunes state park.  At home in Los Angeles, Best Friends provides great support for the animal rescue group I regularly volunteer with.  I'll be walking in their Strut Your Mutt fundraiser in September.  The people at Best Friends really care about animals and take a lot of positive action.
Best Friends Animal Society	96828		/users/profile/113140	Mary23456	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I became a member of Best Friends when Katrina happened. I visit once a year and volunteer for a week. Words cannot express what BF means to me. BF does great work for all kinds of animals and educates the ignorant public on animals and how we should care for them. So much has been done for animals because of BF. All I know is that the sanctuary is my haven and retreat. The air is different there....it is because of the love being thrown around. Yet, I am not blind to possible faults. But whenever I call for clarification on questions I have, they always respond. I will spend the rest of my life supporting them and making sure they fulfill all my expectations.
Best Friends Animal Society	96825		/users/profile/113136	Susan2345678	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	We just completed our second "tour of duty" as volunteers at the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah.  It is one of the most fulfilling, rewarding vacations we have had -- and we already have our reservations for next year.   It is impossible to put everything into one short review, but this is why we volunteer again and again for Best Friends:1.  They have their priorities right.  Money and other resources go first and foremost to the animals in their care.  Employees and other humans are accommodated comfortably, but very modestly.2.  They take their duty to the animals seriously.  Any animal that comes within the care of BFAS is given the highest quality of life possible -- taking into account the animal's physical, mental and emotional needs.  There is no pressure to get the animal adopted because it is "running out of time," so each animal gets the medical treatment, enrichment activities, training and behavior modification necessary to have a happy, healthy life and increase his/her chances for adoption.3.  Decisions are at appropriate organizational levels.  The people that have the most knowledge, information and understanding of a particular animal and the greatest emotional investment in that animal (the Caregivers) are given a lot of authority for developing his/her life plan, approvals for outings and sleepovers, training plans, etc.  At the same time, BFAS has appropriate procedures that ensure that everyone stays safe. I have never seen an organization that has as much respect for individuals, while maintaining a sustainable business model, and such loyal, devoted employees.  As volunteers, we are always made to feel valued, appreciated and respected.  We end each of our Best Friends vacations wishing we had more time to walk dogs or clean kennels!
Best Friends Animal Society	96823		/users/profile/113133	MissUT	Donor	5	08/29/2011	I became familiar with Best Friends during Hurricane Katrina.  They were the first group there to help the animals.  I made my first donation during that time and have maintained my membership with this wonderful organization.  I checked them out and realized that they are a NO-KILL shelter!  At the time, I didn't know those existed.  Many of the other organizations euthanize animals instead of trying to find them homes and give them medical care.  Best Friends has the most compassionate caregivers to the animals.   They are loving, caring, and selfless.  Everyone I have ever had any contact with has been extremely nice, helpful, and patient.  God bless them all....Although I am disabled and unable to help physically, I try to send money as often as I can and have even give memberships as gifts.  In my opinion, they are simply the BEST!
Best Friends Animal Society	96822		/users/profile/113131	Cindy V.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I volunteered at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab, Utah along with my daughters who were 10 and 11.  It was one of the best experiences we've ever had.  Everyone was kind, helpful, and this organization really has a handle on what they do - they are top notch.  We are involved in animal rescue at home, and being able to see their facilities first hand, and how they handle animals, was such an education.  
Best Friends Animal Society	96821		/users/profile/113130	Kirk B.	Client Served	5	08/29/2011	After trying to deal with several shelters/rescues, I turned to Best Friends. From that first contact with them , I felt I was their main concern. The help they provided me really made the experience great. No run arounds, just answers. I only wish all businesses and shelters worked as well as they do.  I have a dog that is like they said he was, and in some ways better. And to have one of the founders call me and say thank you, well they are the best.
Best Friends Animal Society	96820		/users/profile/113129	Leah F.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I volunteered at the sanctuary twice in the past year. Not only do you feel like you are making a difference in the lives of all the animals there, but the staff and volunteer coordinators are so welcoming and helpful. They all want to make sure the volunteers have a great experience. The sanctuary is a little slice of heaven on earth, for both the animals that call it home and the people who visit! I am hoping to make the trip on a yearly basis! I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone that is an animal lover!
Best Friends Animal Society	96819		/users/profile/113128	Judy234	Donor	5	08/29/2011	Best Friends saves the unwanted, the helpless, the hopeless.  They were instrumental in helping and saving many of the dogs involved in Michael Vick's dogfighting case. They go to areas in crisis such as New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and overseas in wartorn areas and earthquake areas to help people and animals. They promote TNR for community cats to help control feral populations
Best Friends Animal Society	96818		/users/profile/113127	Deercats	Client Served	5	08/29/2011	A more dedicated group would be hard to find: and their work reaches well beyond their sanctuary in Kanab, Utah. Their influence and actions have reached across the country and around the world. Best of all, you'll never get a heart-rending "Send $5 or this cat will die" appeal from them: it's always "Look how happy these animals are now!" "No more homeless pets" may become a reality: and if no-kill spreads throughout the country and the world, it will be in large part due to Best Friends and their partners around the world.
Best Friends Animal Society	96817		/users/profile/113126	Kimberly23	Donor	5	08/29/2011	Top notch, well run organization that places it's entire focus on caring for animals in need. Highly trained staff who love their jobs. Plus they work with animals with behavioral issues so they can find homes. Also provide sanctuary to animals that can't be placed. They serve as a model for all other animal organizations. I've been a donor for years a d will continue to be one.
Best Friends Animal Society	96816		/users/profile/113125	Heather23456	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	Best Friends Animal Society is the most tranquil place I have ever been. I've only been able to go once, and for just two days at that, but the experience is life-changing. The innovative designs for the housing for the dogs and cats were amazing. The cats can go indoors or outdoors because each cat building has an enclosure outside of it complete with rafters for those kitties that prefer to be high up. The dogs, cats, horses, pigs, and goats were all very content and extremely well cared for. I was so very fortunate to meet a cat I had sponsored over the years, Scooter, who has since passed away. I volunteered at Kitty Motel, where he and other special-needs cats reside. It was obvious that the people who work at Best Friends deeply love these animals, who often come from neglectful and abusive situations. Many of the cats at Kitty Motel have to be bathed multiple times per day due to their incontinence. The workers and volunteers do not let this phase them one bit - these animals have a chance at a life they would have at very few places elsewhere. Something I got to do that was very neat was a dog sleepover. At Best Friends, they allow volunteers to take a dog or cat that is adoptable on a sleepover to help that animal get more socialization. I'll always remember B.G. (short for Big Guy), the black lab I had the pleasure of having for one evening. One of the most memorable parts of my visit was the trip to Angel's Rest, the cemetery for about six thousand animals. I was crying before getting through the gate. This area is designed so beautifully and is so peaceful. There are windchimes with memorials to beloved pets and markers for each pet who rests there. The place is so well maintained. All animals at Best Friends are loved, whether they are living or have already passed on. I hope to be able to return some day. 
Best Friends Animal Society	96815		/users/profile/113124	Michelle2345	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I wish there were more than one option I could choose in the pulldown menu. I began volunteering 7 years ago with everything from reuniting pets and owners after Hurricane Katrina, worked at high volume feral cat spay/neuter clinics through Best Friends Catnippers, worked information booths at Super Adoption events and participated in Best Friends Brigade clean-ups and repair of shelters and rescues.  But I've also donated and, worked at a marketing and direct mail company that had Best Friends as a client.  That company I worked for had a lot of non-profit clients and, from my experience, Best Friends is the most budget conscious and their executives do not take the normal executive salary. Everyone who works with Best Friends, either as an actual employee or volunteer, is there for the animals. They are the most organized, conscientious organization I've worked with either as a client, volunteer or donor. 
Best Friends Animal Society	96814		/users/profile/113123	Florence M.	Client Served	5	08/29/2011	Best Friends Animal Society really strives to help animals. They are positive and upbeat. They run the nation's largest sanctuary for abused and abandoned animals. They help with low cost spays and neuters.  They are very proactive about getting word out about adoptable animals. They are action oriented and not just about sharing information!
Best Friends Animal Society	96812		/users/profile/113121	Lynda2	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	I 1st heard about Best Friends when I got a donation request in the mail.  I sent in a donation and they sent back a Thank You (no additional money was requested).  I continued to support them and then decided to go for a visit.  This is the most wonderful place!  They have given great thought to what is best for all of the animals in their care.  I have been back for 2 other visits and am planning one for next Spring!  Everyone is super nice when you arrive!  They show you what you can expect when you are working with the animals!  It's such a great experience!  I've worked with the dogs, cats, bunnies and horses each time I've been there!  It's sad when you have to leave because it's such a nurturing environment, but you know they will continue to care for each and every animal that comes to the sanctuary to the best of their ability!  My BEST vacations ever!!!         
Best Friends Animal Society	96810		/users/profile/113119	Ilana M.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	The best "vacation" I have taken in a few years was a trip ito Best Friends Animal Sanctuary. I brought my dogs and stayed n the cabins and cottages that are on the sanctuary property. They rate was reasonable it was so nice to be able to volunteer for both morning and afternoon shifts while my dogs were fine in the cabin/cottage. i walked dogs, played with cats and fed nd walked pigs. I hiked around the area with my dogs and met so many nice people. I have networked in LA with Best Friends to help further my personal animal rescue endeavors.
Best Friends Animal Society	96809		/users/profile/113118	Wendy2345	Volunteer	5	08/29/2011	The Best Friends Animal Society is awesome.  I have donated for about 7 years now.  They are a no kill shelter that takes in abandoned animals, often with medical problems, and rehabs them and tried to find the adoptable ones homes.  They also rehab wild animals and release if able.  My daughter and I spent a week volunteering and it was an experience that neither of us will ever forget.  The animals are amazingly well cared for - nice beds, long walks, toys, playmates, clean homes, nutritious food and LOVE!  Animals that make it to Best FRiends are the lucky ones and so are we for having them.  My husband always makes one of my Christmas presents and BF animal adoption where he donates money to help specific "adopted" animals.  The BF gives us updates on our adoptees.  This place is amazing!  God Bless them for taking such wonderful care of the precious creatures!

As a volunteer, I was taught the correct way to do some things I thought I knew.  My trip to see this sanctuary was the highlight of my vacation, and I hope to volunteer for them again--perhaps even long-distance!
Best Friends Animal Society	95929		/users/profile/111629	MMc_JMW	Donor	5	08/18/2011	Not only does Best Friends help the animals there in marvelous ways, but they also share everything they learn with other groups. For example, they've been a major player in getting rescue groups to work together to develop effective strategies for animal rescue after disasters.
Best Friends Animal Society	95925		/users/profile/111622	johanna1967	Volunteer	5	08/18/2011	I recently spent a week staying at and volunteering at Best Friends and was amazed at their Sanctuary.  NO CAGES!!  All the animals were loved, well taken care of, happy, and socialized.  There couldn't be a better place for them besides going to a forever home.  I'm proud to say I support Best Friends and will be making more trips there to volunteer.

Their video updates bring tears of joy to my eyes regularly. The staff and volunteers at Best Friends are the true heros of today, taking actions for our little friends who cannot help themselves.
Best Friends Animal Society	95918		/users/profile/111611	Robin33	General Member of the Public	5	08/17/2011	   The beauty of Angel Canyon is indescribable!  Once I entered the main building and watched the video everyone was so friendly and willing to answer my questions.  I went on the tour, which was very informative, then I went by myself to Angels Rest for some quiet time to just take in how amazing this place is, and how truly special the people are who provide this much needed service to the animals.   It is a bit of a drive from Las Vegas, but it is so worth it.  If you ever have the chance to visit Best Friends, I highly recommend it,  your heart will thank you.
Best Friends Animal Society	95905		/users/profile/111590	Dion	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I am proud to be a volunteer for Best Friends.  I have been involved with them for many years and have never seen them do anything but put the interests of the animals first.  They promote kindness and compassion for both animals and humans.  Best Friends has worked tirelessly to not only help the animals in their care, but have worked on far reaching programs to improve animal welfare everywhere.  Their staff works very hard and diligently.  Best Friends was one of the first organizations helping animals after Hurricane Katrina and stayed there for over a year.  They helped save over seven hundred cats caught in the nightmare of an institutional hoarding situation in Pahrump, Nevada.  They sponsor spay and neuter programs, humane education, and also support, guide and work with local animal rescue organizations.  They helped to save and rehabilitate the dogs that were victims of Michael Vick's dog fighting ring.  This is only a few of the things this wonderful organization does to promote animal welfare.  They use their donations judiciously and treat their volunteers like angels.  I can only wish more humans were like them.

The animals are extremely well cared for and the staff is awesome. I got to work with what is known as the bully breeds. Taking the dogs for walks, cleaning their play areas and brushing and petting them. Being able to take the dogs for an overnight sleepover was so much fun! I tell everyone I can about Best Friends. The way the sanctuary works is just so amazing. We also spent time with the cats and enjoying playing and brushing them. As soon as I can I plan to go again. My husband and daughter are now interested in going too.
Best Friends Animal Society	95894		/users/profile/111575	lynn boenau bonilla	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I was honored to be able to volunteer at BFAS in August 2010. It was amazing to me how organized the whole operation is from signing in to volunteering and everything in between. It is obvious how dedicated the employees are to the sanctuary and to the animals. Every animal is treated as an individual. All the caretakers know each animal as well as they know their own pets at home. I was able to help by walking some dogs and helping to prepare their food as well as helping to clean some of the cat rooms in Cat World and walking some of the cats who enjoy being outdoors. We were also able to help out with the horses not only cleaning but with the feeding. The employees are extremely grateful for the help the volunteers provide. When I said I would be happy to was some dog dishes after the feeding they were visibly surprised that I would be willing to do such a menial chore. With all that they do for all these animals, it was a small thing for me to do for them. I cant say enough about the work that is done at BFAS. I am in awe of the dedication and tireless work on the part of everyone I met there. I would welcome the opportunity to return to BFAS and lend whatever hand they would need. Thank you BFAS for everything that you do on behalf of animals of every type. If anyone wants to make a small difference in the life of an animal, just visit BFAS and take the tour, you will be signing up to volunteer in no time!!!
Best Friends Animal Society	95893		/users/profile/111574	slauzon	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	      I volunteered at Best Friends in Utah, with my boyfriend, last September after watching the National Geographic show called ''Dog Town''.  We were amazed at how well organised they are, like a well oiled machine.  Friendly and welcoming staff are there to explain and patiently answer all questions.  They also inquire about us, where we were from, how long we were planning on volunteering, what our experience had been like so far which made us feel like we were actually building relationships with them and working together toward a common goal.       We volunteered exclusively at DogTown and helped in many ways: walking dogs, cleaning runs, feedings, grooming, socializing dogs and puppies, taking some on outtings and every night, we took a different one back to the rented cottage for a sleepover. Although we knew we could not adopt one, we felt that we were making a difference to the dogs, one at a time.  I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!  We regretfully left after a two week stay and I admit that I cried a little upon leaving, feeling like I was leaving after having fallen in love...but it gave us a new drive.     We came back from Utah with the desire to built such a place in our home province of Quebec and have worked diligently toward that goal since.  We are headed back to Best Friends in October for another two weeks of volunteering and I could just burst in anticipation!  And this time, we are planning on bringing my 18 year old daughter to this magical place so she can experience it for herself. I can't wait!
Best Friends Animal Society	95891		/users/profile/111573	Lynn23	General Member of the Public	5	08/17/2011	I do not have a personal experience with Best Friends. However, i know of the work they do and I think it is one of the greatest organizations around. My dream since childhood has been to somehow do exactly what Best Friends does. 
Best Friends Animal Society	95883		/users/profile/111564	Terry Burch	Donor	5	08/17/2011	Having been a member for quite awhile, I was fostering a declawed sieamese that had been abandoned that had a very aggressive nature with biting tendencies and was desperate for help.  The staff at Best Friends gave me several contact names and numbers that could possibly assist.  The search proved to be successful and I was able to find a home for my foster.  I have admired Best Friends, the staff, and volunteers since I first heard about them.  In my opinion, there are angels that walk among us and a good many of them are located there.

Best Friends Animal Society	95878		/users/profile/111558	Cat Artist	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I've volunteered at Best Friends during my vacations over the past few years. It is the most amazing place! Every animal area is kept extremely clean.  The animals are provided with plenty of food, veterinary care, cozy beds, toys and other environmental enrichments. Even though they specialize in caring for animals who would be considered unadoptable elsewhere, they have a 75% adoption rate! This should be the model for all sanctuaries. Every animal should have the right to live in a safe environment, and Best Friends gives that to all their animals, even those with missing limbs, manageable illnesses and behavioral issues. The level of care and love shown by the staff are just awesome.

Best Friends Animal Society	95872		/users/profile/111549	fagnard70	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I came to know Best Friends through the National Geographic show 'Dogtown'. I realized the dream to go and volunteer in Utah last fall. It was an experience of a lifetime. So much that I have decided to repeat the experience, and even further to build a place like Dogtown in the province of Quebec, Canada. The people there are awesome. The caregiver were reaslly listening to us and kind and comprehensive. Even though I saw that I sometimes was a little bit of a load for them, they kept their patience and answered all my questions. And after all that, they granted me with a big thank you... Best Friends is a really good organization and their follow up is really great.

Best Friends Animal Society	95870		/users/profile/111546	mc78	General Member of the Public	5	08/17/2011	My husband and I adopted a puppy from Best Friends in March 2010.  There was a very thorough screening process prior to our adoption being approved, which I think is very important--they obviously want to make sure that the animals they've cared for will go to a good home.  The adoption fee was very reasonable, communication was great, and our puppy was even delivered to us (in California) from Utah.  She is incredibly well-socialized and had obviously been through training prior to her arrival.We couldn't be happier with our experience with Best Friends and would recommend them to anyone.

Best Friends Animal Society	95865		/users/profile/111541	Cindi N.	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I was first introduced to Best Friends Animal Society by a friend more then 10 years ago.  In lieu of "presents" for Christmas, birthdays etc I sponsor animals at the sanctuary for my family and friends. I have managed to get several of them on board with donations as well. Shortly after Christmas in 2009 my sister and I decided it was time to make the trip to volunteer. We anxiously counted off the days until October 2010. We arrived at the information center on an unusally cold rainy day and were transported to a majical place you can only understand once you are there. We worked every opportunity available and had the most incredible time.  We were so amazed that we are returning again this year for another week and bringing our Mom and another friend with us to experience the magic. In our eyes this is the most incredible no-kill sanctuary on the planet.

The place is beautiful. The animals need volunteers. The staff is friendly and helpful. The cottages are nice. I love going there. I've taken several dogs on sleepovers and all have been adopted within a few months of my meeting them. Puppy classes are fun too!
Best Friends Animal Society	95862		/users/profile/111535	beach	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I visited Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in November of 2010 and was absolutely blown away by the genuine, heartfelt desire of everyone at the facility to do good work.  This organization does amazing work with a very positive outlook.  It's actually impossible to put into words the feeling of being there and seeing first hand the incredible facilities, the incredible staff, and the amazing results of their work on behalf of homeless, abandoned, abused animals.  This is a place of pure good.    My day volunteering at Benton's House was particularly heartwarming.  This is a building dedicated to cats with a range of disabilities - from incontinence to missing limbs, blindness, neurological disorders, etc.  These cats make a mess!  Every day staff and volunteers scrub the place, clean the cats, manually express bladders, give meds, all on top of regular cat care (and socialization/love).  Every day.  And they think nothing of it.  They view all animals as having value and being worthy of care and love and they've built an organization that can provide that.  It's really extraordinary. While having lunch in the cafeteria on one of our volunteer days we had the fortune to sit with two of the founders of Best Friends who were very friendly and chatted with us about our experiences at the Sanctuary.  They seemed very interested in knowing how we heard about them and what prompted us to visit, and were just generally fabulous.
Best Friends Animal Society	95861		/users/profile/111528	SarahV	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	Best Friends can be described with one word - MAGICAL!  The staff and volunteers are completely devoted to the animals in their care (as is should be) and respect them for the wonderful creatures that they are.  I have volunteered at a number of animal shelters but the Sanctuary is in a class of its own.  I encourage anyone who loves animals to visit Best Friends!
Best Friends Animal Society	95858		/users/profile/111525	outdoor_pup	Client Served	5	08/17/2011	My fiance and I bought a house this last year and decided that this year was the year to get a dog to add to our little family.  We definitely wanted to adopt but there are few adoption opportunities in our small town. We knew the kind of dog to fit into our lifestyle (active and busy all the time). We were looking for a cattle dog mix of some sort (Heeler, Aussie or Border Collie all would do).   In researching I came across Best Friends Animal Society and was amazed at the work that they do for animals. Not only do they give the community an opportunity to adopt but they commit to the life of the pet.  This means they will keep the animal until it dies, take care of it, love it and give it the best life possible even if no one adopts it.  What an amazing policy!   On their website we came across the dog that was perfect...we emailed one of their facilitators, gave them tons of information and they set up some one from our town (volunteer) to come over and check out our place. This meant a lot to us because they truly  care where these special animals go.  Its more than just their job, they really care.  After the visit all was a go and we made the trip (6+ hours) to Best Friends to pick up our pup.  We were immediately struck by the beauty of the surroundings. The canyons are gorgeous (especially in snow when we went) and the facilities blend in and fit so well in the landscape.  Due to snow we were only able to go to the puppy area and the visitors center.  We could tell though that the rest of the facilities were incredible.  In going into the puppy area the cleanliness and friendlyness of the staff was great.  We enjoyed talking with the caretakers and checking out the other animals housed there. It really was amazing the attention to detail they have.  Our pup was brought out to play, we got to know him.  He had just had shots so he was a little lethargic but the in house vet stopped by, checked him out and gave us tons of tips on how to care for him that night and what to look out for after vaccination.  They also gave us phone numbers and trainer numbers to call any time, even in the middle of that night if somthing went wrong due to the vaccination. Luckily all went great. We met with Marti our adoption coordinator and filled out the paperwork. Spent a little longer with the staff and they sent us off for the night with our pup.  We had a great time visiting and were excited to go back to the hotel.  Next day the called and checked up on him and thanked us for adopting him.  In the following months they have called, emailed and showed what genuine compassion and love they have for every animal that comes through their doors.  We are so grateful to them for allowing us to give our pup a home and they will always hold a special place in our hearts. Thanks Best Friends
Best Friends Animal Society	95853		/users/profile/111520	thumbsrocks	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	This is, by far, the best-run non-profit with which I've dealt. They focus on the positives of what they are doing, rather than the abuse that some of these animals have gone through. Yes, we know that many of the animals come from a rough background. Why dwell on it? I love the "everyone can make a difference" attitude they possess. This transfers over into their volunteer program at the sanctuary. They rely heavily on volunteers to help with the daily chores, and they have to coordinate and manage thousands of volunteers each year. No small task. I am amazed at how well their program is run, and how each staff member treats them with respect and appreciation, even if they have no experience working with animals. I have volunteered at the sanctuary 4 times over the past 6 years, and it's always one of my favorite trips, not just for the animals, but to work with a fine organization. Every organization can learn from Best Friends on how to run a great non-profit, and they are willing to share their experiences to help other rescue groups be successful. Best Friends is one of my top picks for donations and volunteering.

I found the whole experience simply wonderful.  From the minute my husband and I arrived we were greeted by great folks who were friendly and knowledgeable.  The animals appeared to be well taken care of and happy and were treated as individuals.  There were many volunteers who were there feeding animals and walking dogs and cats.  I wouldn't hesitate to tell anyone to support this fine group of people.  They are some of the most compassionate and caring people I've ever met.

Best Friends Animal Society	95845	1	/users/profile/111509	Christine2345	General Member of the Public	4	08/17/2011	I visited Best Friends in 2006. The sanctuary is beautiful and all the animals I saw appeared happy and healthy. It is great to see a place where special needs animals are not turned away or euthanized. It was also nice to see that there is an area maintained for rehab of local wildlife. Allowing members of the public to visit and volunteer helps spread the word about animal needs and also benefits the sanctuary financially. I voluteered in the rabbit area, which at the time did seem in need of expansion, but I understand that it has been renovated since then.    
Best Friends Animal Society	95844		/users/profile/111508	Chris234	Client Served	5	08/17/2011	Best Friends is one of the best places on earth!!!  They are extremely caring and helpful.  I adopted my youngest dog from them.   Since the dog had to be flown to me when he was old enough, they constantly checked in to make sure things were ok....and are still in touch today.  I recommend Best Friends to everyone.  I love the place.  Hopefully someday, whether soon or in retirement, I would like to work or volunteer there.  Love them!!!  You can't find better!!   It is such an amazing place to have where no animal is turned away!! 
Best Friends Animal Society	95843		/users/profile/111507	Barbara234	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	Best Friends is a in vast wonderland of beautiful scenery and awesome red rocks.  My granddaughter, Jillian, and I had the very special privilege of visiting the Sanctuary for a week and volunteering for many kinds of animals with a concentration on cats.  Entering one of the cat buildings is almost surreal.  There are cats everywhere, many of which are special needs kitties.  For example, we saw two black cats, one of whom was three-legged and the other was born with no back paws.  Both came right to Jillian and me when we arrived to volunteer.  The cat rooms were just full of fun toys and  hideaways for the cats.  Each had a huge outside area which looked like a playground with nooks, crannies, rafters, and trees!  Once an animal comes to Best Friends, any who are not adopted are safe in this loving, no-kill environment.  Jillian and I were able to take a lovely kitty, Rosita, for two sleepovers at our motel.  What fun that was!  I can't emphasize enough the caring and love at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary.
Best Friends Animal Society	95842		/users/profile/111506	Kara A.	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I visited BFAS in the summer of 2003 to volunteer for ten days...a "Volun-cation".  I flew into Las Vegas, rented a car, and drove the scenic 3.5 hours to the small town of Kanab. I stayed at the Shiloh Inn (a pet-friendly and very affordable motel).   As a volunteer at BFAS I worked in Dog Town, Horse Haven and the Bunny House.  I took a dog back to my hotel each evening for an overnight "slumber party" in which you are able help the animal's chances of getting adopted by reporting back to shelter staff the next day about the animal's behavior in a "home setting."   My experience at the Sanctuary was amazing, the staff was friendly and welcoming, the vegan cafeteria has the most amazing view (and good food!), and working with the animals, while being hard physical work, was absolutely delightful. I've never had a more pleasant Volun-cation and would recommend the every animal-lover at least tour the Sanctuary and canyon if they're unable to have an extended stay!   P.S. While in the area, I highly recommend you make some side trips to Bryce Canyon (do guided horseback ride!), Zion National Park (driving through and taking pictures is sufficient), and the Coral Pink Sand Dunes (rent a dune buggy!). Beautiful!
Best Friends Animal Society	95840		/users/profile/111504	joydyan	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	My husband and I spent one day volunteering at Best Friends in September 2010. The experience was better than I could have ever imagined. We were able to spend time in a puppy socialization class, walk a pair of dogs, bring two dogs to a wall flower class and then spend the afternoon helping out in Old Friends.  We both really enjoyed our day and can't wait to go back to help out again, this time for a longer period. Everyone from the employees to other volunteers were extremely friendly and helpful.
Best Friends Animal Society	95839		/users/profile/111503	bobbi1951	General Member of the Public	5	08/17/2011	My first time donating was to the MSPCA here in MA for they annual dogwalk, I had just lost my dog at age 16yrs.  I then was ask to take a dog that was being misstreated by its owner and I did he was so underfeed and skinny so I took him and got him back to health and every since that time which was over 8yrs ago, I've be donating money to the BestFriends in Utah and Northeast Animal Shelter in Salem, MA every month for the wondeful work that they do in saving so many animals of all shapes and sizes. I will continue to donate financially even when my dog passes under the Rainbow Bridge....
Best Friends Animal Society	95838		/users/profile/111502	Lori234	Donor	5	08/17/2011	I have been supporting Best Friends for approximately 4-5 years. The work they do with homeless animals of all kinds, is incredible. They have helped during Hurricane's, the Vik disaster, and multiple others. Personally what they have done for me, is make me realize, that all Puppy Mills, should be shut down, and I will never purchase another animal. My current pets are both rescue animals.
Best Friends Animal Society	95837		/users/profile/111501	Debbie234	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I have visited Best Friends twice in the last 11 years. Both visits were magical. The feeling of love that surrounds the red canyons where Best Friends reside is an unbelievable feeling. The animals are happy, healthy  well cared for and LOVED. I hope to go back at least one more time in my lifetime.
Best Friends Animal Society	95836		/users/profile/111499	Allie H.	Volunteer	5	08/17/2011	I love volunteering at Best Friends. The work they do with the "unadoptables" is absolutely incredible. You can really see the love and care they invest in each of the animals in their care. I volunteered at Dog Town for 2 days. The caregivers treat all volunteers as adults, with great respect and are truely happy for any and all activities/time that is given. The Sanctuary is a very peaceful place, and each staff member is friendly, helpful, and genuinely happy to be there.  I am going back with a group of girlfriends in Sept 2011, and I am very excited!!! 
Best Friends Animal Society	95570		/users/profile/110988	Sean Perry	Donor	5	08/11/2011	I am a long time donor of Best Friends and will be doing volunteer work in the near future.  The organization is the most impressive and driven organization I have found in regards to pet rescue, do not kill, and no more homeless pets initiatives.  The fact they will not say no to rescue any pet regardless of temper or medical needs and try and rehabilitate it and find it a home if possible is remarkable.  Taking what were considered the hardest cases of the Vick Pit Terrier dogs and rehabilitating them the way they have is just one of many cases where they have stepped in to help give a pet a happier world to live in.  I will continue to support this organization as much as I can.
Best Friends Animal Society	95374		/users/profile/90394	pamelaw	Volunteer	5	08/09/2011	I have volunteered for Best Friends on many occassions in dogs, cats, pigs, horses, wildlife, and birds.  The caregivers that work at Best Friends are some of the most compassionate people I have ever experienced, caring for so many animals who come from unfortunately situations.  It is amazing to watch the animals respond to the people who take care of them day in and day out.  Their fears subside and you can actually see them come back to life!The programs that Best Friends has outside of the sanctuary in LA, Vegas, Salt Lake City, NYC and many other places continue to education the public and help those in need.  Two programs that are really cool : Pup My Ride and Puppy Mill Transport.  Check it out on their webpage-www.bestfriends.org!
Best Friends Animal Society	95290		/users/profile/110492	Angie W.	Volunteer	5	08/08/2011	I volunteered at Best Friends a few years ago and fell in love with not only the beautiful location but with the dedication I saw from everyone involved. Since that time I have thought often of returning and unfortunately I have not been able to make that happen but dream of it often. It is such a special place!!
Best Friends Animal Society	95205		/users/profile/92636	Cheetahz	Volunteer	5	08/07/2011	I've worked with this charity for many years as a volunteer.  I've visited the Sanctuary many times and the care the animals receive is far beyond anything available anywhere else.  I volunteer on the Animal Help Line, and received very good training and resources, and have always been treated with friendship and kindness.  I

This was the charity she chose for memorial donations.She researched it well, and was so impressed with the care and compassion of the people involved at all levels
Best Friends Animal Society	95160		/users/profile/110319	Mary Barrett	General Member of the Public	5	08/06/2011	When my daughter in law started working for Best Friends over 2 years ago, we  talked about my visiting while she was working on site.   We got to do that in May of 2011.  We took a guided tour that was a highlight of my trip.  Everyone we met was friendly and caring and intent on taking such personal care of each and every animal.  We watched a volunteer brushing a pig, a group of workers helping an obese horse get on its feet and a dog that could not walk being given a ride on a golf cart (because he loves it).  The whole place was very clean and beautifuly taken care of.  Many improvement projects were in the works.  I live in Maryland but hope to get back again sometime.  I tell everyone that Best Friends is a great place to visit and volunteer.
Best Friends Animal Society	95123		/users/profile/110257	Rachel B.	Volunteer	5	08/05/2011	I visited Best Friends for the first time May of 2011.  I was overwhelmed with everything about the sanctuary. The staff was awesome and  made sure you were well knowledgeable about what to do in all cases while you were volunteering.  They are truly dedicated to all of the animals that reside there. The grounds and facilities were amazing, beautiful, well maintained and appropriate for all of the animals that are  cared for there.  The work that is done  is so necessary for the animals that come to call it home.  I had a wonderful time working with cats, it was so satisfying to know I had a  small part in helping.  This is truly a great organization and I am glad I had the chance to witness and help out first hand.
Best Friends Animal Society	95093		/users/profile/110206	Jen H.	Donor	5	08/04/2011	I have been a donor and volunteer of this organization since I learned of them in 2009.  I came to Kanab and volunteered in the Fall of 2009.  I love the staff that I met and worked with while here.  They inspired me to become a part of my local shelter at home and offer their dogs and cats the same care and love that we gave while out in Utah.  Many shelters and rescues do the very best that they can on their limited income.  Best Friends has been able to develop an amazing institution for animal care until they can find their forever homes.  Not only do I love the staff, the facility, and the animals, but I am so proud of the organization.  I am proud of them for seeing the bigger picture and taking on homeless pets across the world and trying to change how everyone views animals.  I hope that they continue their mission, and inspire others to help in their local campaigns.  I actually moved to Kanab in 2010 in order to futher assist the organization, but I am not an employee.  Keep up the great work.
Best Friends Animal Society	95088		/users/profile/110196	Cheryl H.	Volunteer	5	08/04/2011	In June 2011 I visited Best Friends for the 4th time.  I attended the art retreat and volunteered with my daughter, mother, & sister.  The art retreat revived my artistic spirit and was so much fun.  While volunteering you get to interact with so many different animals and hear their stories.  The staff is very welcoming and thankful for your time and energy.  The ground  are beautiful. The cafe is a great place to eat (and no animals were harmed).  It is nice to be in a large place with lots of people who are all working for the same thing you are - no more homeless animals.  The sanctuary is very clean and a great temporary home.  The first time I visited I was shocked at how clean the whole place was.   I expected to be covered in cat hair and that was not the case.  
Best Friends Animal Society	95074		/users/profile/110167	aweese1	Volunteer	5	08/04/2011	We had visited Best Friends last fall, but returned in July, 2011 to tour the entire facility and also to volunteer.  The experience was heartwarming - the staff of over 400 caring for dogs,cats, sick dogs and sick cats, pigs, birds, horses, wild animals such as mink and turkeys------ had to have been picked by the animals they lovingly cared for. This no kill sanctuary rehabilitates troubled or sick animals with the hope that they will be adopted to their "forever home", but if that is not possible, the ones that must stay receive loving care until the end of their days.  This is truly God's work, carried out by loving caregivers.
Best Friends Animal Society	95069		/users/profile/110165	Steven P.	Volunteer	5	08/04/2011	After years of following the Best Friends organization and supporting the cause, I was finally able to spend a month in Kanab volunteering on site. Best Friends does a great job of engaging their supporters through their online community, magazine, and Guardian Angel program; but to actually be on site and see the animals and how well the staff interacts with and cares for the animals was truly inspiring. Most employees have taken significant pay cuts to follow their passions and the company has attracted experts despite the less-than-competitive pay and remote location. Throughout any given day, a caregiver, trainer, or rehabilitator will give a free demonstration detailing some of the basics of animal care. Spending a month on site, I was able to visit every animal area. I can only say that I wish they had the resources to house more homeless animals until the day that they can achieve their goal of no more homeless pets.
Best Friends Animal Society	95060		/users/profile/110145	Chris P.	General Member of the Public	5	08/04/2011	Best Friends is one of the best run organizations in the non-profit industry, not just animal welfare. The sanctuary amazing and how they treat their animals second to none (they have a freakin' water therapy treadmill!), but being leaders in animal welfare initiatives is where they also shine. Pitt Bull Terrier education, cat initiatives, national conferences, and the work they do to send money to and help smaller shelters. Across all departments and channels this organization is top notch. 
Best Friends Animal Society	95057		/users/profile/110141	Shawn Claybaugh	Volunteer	5	08/04/2011	2011 will be my third year volunteering at the Best Friends Sanctuary in Kanab, UT. It is a trip that I look forward to each year! Interacting with the animals and working at the Sanctuary is truly a life changing experience that really can't be explained in words. You must visit the sanctuary and experience the magic yourself!  The Staff at Best Friends are all so friendly and welcoming to the volunteers as well. They really make a positive impact for the animals in the world and I'm grateful to be a part of it.
Best Friends Animal Society	95043	2	/users/profile/110119	Jennifer Sanders	General Member of the Public	4	08/04/2011	I finally had the chance to visit the Sanctuary, and I'm glad I did.  I can honestly say that they must hire their staff based on how nice they are, because everyone seemed *earnestly* happy that you were there.   (warning if you go:  it gets HOT in july.) Coming from the northeast I'm used to seeing dogs running around in grass, so it was a bit shocking to see them running around on that red earth.  My first thoughts were "aren't they hot?"  But I volunteered at Dogtown and none of the dogs seemed uncomfortable.   It's a little depressing to see how many dogs are there, especially the older ones that are going to have such a hard time being adopted.   But I suppose that's better than being in a shelter. And if you do go stay at the sanctuary.... VOLUNTEER AT THE PIG AREA!   It's wonderful!!
Best Friends Animal Society	94032		/users/profile/108011	chemyn	Volunteer	5	07/19/2011	I have been a supporter for many years, and finally was able to spend a week volunteering this summer.  The experience far exceeded my expectations.  Every staff member we met, without exception, was incredibly dedicated to making sure that the animals in their care received the best care possible, including daily walks, outings, socialization, training, diet, medical care, etc.  Even caretakers who worked in other areas would know the names and history of dogs that I was walking, as I passed them by.  I witnessed the elation of caretakers when one of their dogs left to go to their forever home, and the deep sadness when one dog lost her battle with cancer while I was there.    They put the needs of these dogs, cats, horses, pigs, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds and others ahead of their own, and have created a true sanctuary, in every sense of the word.  The staff members were also incredibly welcoming and patient with the volunteers, including those of us who hadn't been there before and had tons of questions.
Best Friends Animal Society	93934		/users/profile/27200	Ricki	Volunteer	5	07/15/2011	I have visited two separate times and stayed for a week each time - staying in the cabins near the Horse Headquarters. Went with family members and had the best experiences ever! Walking dogs, grooming and feeding horses, taking dogs for overnights, cleaning enclosures, sitting with nervous dogs trying to help acclimate them to human beings, playing with cats and cleaning kitty enclosures - the list of opportunities to help just goes on and on - each one better than the last! The staff are absolutely incredible! they know each animal by name, all of their quirks, what their individual needs are. I am an animal rescuer myself ( exotic cats from the entertainment industry ) and know how hard these people work. Everyone should give them 5 stars!
Best Friends Animal Society	93667		/users/profile/107886	Hank Miller	Volunteer	5	07/09/2011	Disregard any quacks who indicate this is other than a sterling operation that has withstood audits, investigations, slander and libel only to remain at the top of the game. Over 100,000 volunteers contribute labor annually. Their founder Michael Mountain takes a meager salary of $40,000+ annually. Try living on that in Kanab! The Humane Society and other organizations work hand in hand with BF as do global animal rights organizations and activists. Those who say otherwise have another agenda possibly due to envy or rejection as a poor employee or scam artist.
Best Friends Animal Society	92953	2	/users/profile/106712	bobby	Volunteer	1	06/29/2011	Best Friends is an evil scam and a big money maker. Some of the volunteers think it is great, but they are the kind of people that gladly drank the Jim Jones Kool Aid. The money goes to the old "Process Church of the Final Judgement". This is who founded  Best Friends. If you think they are good people, Then do the research and look them up.  Stopped being fool by the cute fuzzy animal slick ads.
Best Friends Animal Society	88408	2	/users/profile/99479	Michael Greenhut	Volunteer	2	05/05/2011	I am curious about the specifics relating to $30,026,237 of Annual Expenses, since Best Friends uses volunteers. What are the itemized annual expense items and amounts? What are the itemized details relating of the Net Assets of $27,385,285? Is the property leased arms-length to Best Friends by a third party or is a principal getting lease rent payments? If so, how much is the lease rent payment? If the property is owned by Best Friends, was sold it to Best Friends in an arms-length transaction or did a principal make a profit? If so, how much was the profit? What disclosures have been made by Best Friends to their contributors regarding the expenses, the assets and the property ownership
Best Friends Animal Society	58399	1	/users/profile/62136	Kipper	Donor	4	12/02/2010	As both a volunteer and a donor I have worked in the field for rescue operations as well as visitng/interviewing at the Kabab site.  Best Friends is an AMAZING place.  The canyon is the most peaceful setting I have ever been in.  The volunteers and mid-level staff are exceptionally dedicated and talented.  And of course, the animals, magnificent and take your heart away.  I have volunteer on the Pup My Ride projects. Also amazing and made me feel as though I was truly helping the dogs.  The staff was tireless in their efforts as was the transport organization.I have worked as an executive in the nonprofit sector for over 20 years and I know the challenges faced by management. However, I will say that there is certainly a deification of the Founders, and they suck up every bit of it as egos and personalities expand expotentiallly.They need to diversity their leadership as to dispel both the myth and reality of a cult like atmosphere among the 19 Founders.  The CEO that they brought in from the outside several years ago fought a gallant battle to bring new energy and effort to the cause. However, he is gone because, among other things, he questioned the founding fathers and mothers.   BFAS does amazing work and lets many people find a place for their passion and compassion to be realized.  However, it is time for the Founders to pass the torch. Otherwise, the effort begins to seem more like self-angrandizement than selfless work.
Best Friends Animal Society	26095	9	/users/profile/27129	Lora726	Volunteer	5	01/23/2010	I first volunteered with Best Friends after Hurricane Katrina and have since volunteered in Pahrump, NV, as part of the Great Kitty Rescue of 800 abandonded cats, and also at the Sanctuary in Kanab several times. I live in NJ, so this is a significant commitment on my part. I have seen first hand the dedication of the staff, several of whom have become friends, and opened their hearts and homes to me.
Best Friends Animal Society	22867	11	/users/profile/23879	jennturner	Volunteer	5	11/19/2009	I've visited Best Friends Animals Sanctuary twice for a week each. I've never been to a more magical place. I walked different dogs every day, even taking one on a day trip to the North Rim. I played with cats (offered to clean but the guy working there said he would clean if I wouldn't mind just socializing them :) And I got to pet one cat that had previously not let anyone touch her. A year later she was adopted!!!)  The dogs are fed separately so that notations can be made if any dog isn't finishing their food. Cat have multiple feeding stations so the scared ones can eat up in the rafters if they want. They all have beds and toys. One year I wanted to adopt a dog from there and the lady in charge of adoptions was SO wonderful and patient with me. I asked a million questions and when I decided to adopt from a local shelter (since a Best Friends animal is so cared for and won't be put to sleep) she was very happy with my decision instead of being upset with all the time she spent with me. I got to help trainers with an unruly dog. He learned some cool stuff with me! A local dog was being mistreated and Best Friends worked with local law enforcement to take care of him. I even took dogs on overnighters and would fill out paperwork in the morning (where dog slept, did he bark, was he afraid of anything) so potential adopters would know this info up front. I can't wait to go back!!!
Best Friends Animal Society	3261	6	/users/profile/5004	K2crew	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/06/2009	Best Friends is no longer a honest organization. They like HSUS and PETA decieve people into believing they love animals. Nothing is futher from the truth. They love money and fame.
Best Friends Animal Society	3255	4	/users/profile/4986	Demogorgon	Donor	1	04/06/2009	Best Friends, or Worst Friends as I prefer to call them, is a fraud.  They sit on thousands of acres of land and millions of dollars in the bank, but do ABSOLUTLY NOTHING for the local community.  We are in dire need of a local animal shelter in Kanab, but will Worst Friends help?  You have got to be kidding!  They would rather spend money on saving animals in Lebanon, Peru, the Michael Vick pit bulls, etc.  Why?  Because it is great publicity and rakes in the dollars.  Kanab and Kane County need an animal shelter and if Worst Friends would actually live up to their Best Friends title they would provide it.  One of the Founders was once overheard to say that in addition to the to the land at the sanctuary itself, they also had title to a large amount of acreage very remote.  This land cannot be used for sanctuary purposes becuase of its location and it's understood that you need a 4WD to get access to it.  Why do they have this additional land?  Remember, the people were originally known as the Process Church so is this property used to hide religious ceremonies from public view?  With Worst Friends almost anything is possible!
Best Friends Animal Society	3254	9	/users/profile/4985	susans	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/06/2009	Fueled by donations of over $35 million their activities have spread across the country and beyond. A great deal of good is done both in helping animals in need and also educating the public and lawmakers. However, like a few other large and successful charities, they have changed in many ways over the years. Some of them not visible or so pleasant.Near Kanab, Utah, they have the largest domestic animal sanctuary in this country. Each year, thousands of people visit their Sanctuary and hundreds more post their feelings on the forums and news blogs from Best Friends Animal Society. Many stories have been heard for the past few years, about things there not being quite as advertised. In their Dogtown series athttp://www.bestfriends.org/dogtown/index.cfm?csid=2759&csii=2763&csit=Setthey describe the "real" Dogtown and say,"Breakfast in the morning, treats in the afternoon, nice walks, and lots of afternoon snoozes.Its like a giant summer camp for dogs! Everyones really nice to you, and there are lots of new faces everywhere. Dog faces, people faces. But theyre all happy. And theres none of the fear that was all around you before."But, in the past years those other stories have grown and many of their donors are bringing up questions on the Best Friends forums. Questions about what Best Friends is saying. Questions about omitted details and honesty. For several months now, on their dog forums, Best Friends has been deleting many of these posts. Now, they've started doing the same deletions on their News Blogs. More and more, it seems to appear that publicity and donations are their primary aim and that the welfare of the animals now comes second.While still better than some small shelters, little of what they said above about the "real" Dogtown seems to be really true at Dogtown. After looking at walk lists at their Sanctuary and talking to people, I have to say that I've never really been at a summer camp where I was ignored for weeks at a time, while at the same time other people wrote about me by name, with all the walks and attention I was getting. The very friendly dogs and those with publicity get a lot of attention, but only them. I also spoke with some of their former staff, or tried to do so. Most are afraid to say anything and some even explained why.After recently firing their previous CEO, perhaps things will change for the better once they find a new one. I certainly hope so, as so many people feel they are among the best. Maybe some day that will be true again. In the meantime, I see struggling local shelter who get no help from them and that's where I'm headed.http://bestfriendz.wordpress.com/http://animalliberationfront.com/AR_Orgs/Best Friends-beginnings.htmhttp:/kanab.net/BFWFhttp://circlesphere.blogspot.com/
Friends of Animals Utah	145284		/users/profile/77472	gdeneuve	General Member of the Public	5	11/30/2012	I am always amazed at the wonderful work FOAU does saving so many animals every year. Our puppy came from Furburbia almost two years ago and we are so glad we could in some way be a part of this organization. I especially appreciate the foster network they have built, not only helping these animals but fostering community as well. 
Friends of Animals Utah	70866		/users/profile/77472	gdeneuve	Client Served	5	02/18/2011	What an incredible organization! We recently adopted our puppy from Friends of Animals and have had the best experience. The environment is very comfortable and clean for the animals and they are clearly well cared for. For humans, the adoption is low pressure and easy. The staff is helpful, knowledgable and truly wants each pet to go to a forever home. They do such a great job of finding fosters and socializing animals allowing them to transition into their new homes as best as possible. Also, the community loves Friends of Animals and that speaks volumes for me. I love that we were able to have our puppy on trial for a few days to be sure that we were the right match for him.  It turns out we are and we are thrilled. Friends of Animals takes care of all puppy shots, provides a voucher for a spay/neuter, microchips your pet and sets you up with great tools to welcome your new pet into your home.  Most importantly, Friends of Animals saves these wonderful creatures that may otherwise be euthanised in local shelters and provides not only a second chance for them, but an opportunity for us all to play a part in their mission.
Friends of Animals Utah	125711		/users/profile/139160	Lisa64	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	FOAU understands that being a rescue organization & an NPO starts with collaboration.  To truly be  effective animal welfare stewards & community leaders, we have to be as generous with others as our donors & supporters are to us.  This means we assist other shelters as they strive to become no-kill. We reach out to other organizations creating programs like Purple Paw that serve victims of domestic violence & their pets.  It is our responsibility to serve the animals in our care & my honor to be associated with an organization that values its mission so highly.    
Friends of Animals Utah	103913	1	/users/profile/139160	Lisa64	Board Member	5	01/19/2012	I have been with FOAU for more than a year working as a fundraiser and expanding the organization's voice through social media.  I am thrilled to start this year as board president!  FOAU has currently found permanent, loving homes for more than 11 thousand dogs and cats.  We ensure the safety of any pet that enters our embrace until a forever family match is made.  It is exciting to be a part of our community by strengthening the human-animal bond through pet adoptions, but additionally with our many programs that facilitate humane education.  We are considerably fortunate to have the many wonderful foster families and volunteers who give so generously of their time to the pets in our care.  I am honored to be a part of this impactful organization and look forward to to a successful year.

With over 1,000 cats and dogs rescued, and then placed in their loving new forever homes, all you have to do is spend a few minutes at the adoption center to see the daily miracles. This organization is supported by the community in an extraordinary way - from donations to the gift of time, Friends of Animals Utah is making a difference for not just the animals, but also for the people who choose to serve. We are lucky to have an organization like this to serve both our community, and the lives of those who need our guardianship.

I recently adopted a rescue Bengal cat from Furburbia in Park City Utah, after visiting many times and donating many cat items, over the last 5 years. Each time I visit, I am astounded by the care that all staffers and volunteers provide to all of the "residents" - both cats and dogs. The facility is clean, well managed, and the resident cats/dogs are constantly receiving a high quality of attention and care. All staffers are kind, welcoming, and encouraging to all visitors. In addition, they have taken great care in providing full medical care for boarders/residents, and make the adoptions completely turn-key for clients. I have also observed innovation. They launched an innovative program with Petco, placing a permanent installation at Petco for 3 cats at a time. Adoptions have been quite good at our local Petco, and when I spoke with Petco management, they said the pilot program did so well at the Park City UT location that they were now rolling this out to other Petcos in the area. Fantastic!  I have also seen great work in the community, in trying to place these cats and dogs. Everything from regular TV spots on PCTV, to running features in all of the Park Record Newspaper editions. They have also successfully created a Ranch Sanctuary nearby, made possible with the many fund-raisers they have driven, as well as the large donations that they have solicited to make this possible. FOA is simply the best run organization I have ever seen (and I have been exposed to several other large organizations in CA). I do not know what our community would do, without such an exceptional program. To this day, I have yet to run across a member of the community who has not adopted from FOA. This community wholeheartedly supports FOA.

Volunteer	5	02/12/2012	In our town of Park City we have an extraordinary number of people that have adopted dogs from Friends of the Animals Utah.  Not only have I  adopted a dog, I have also fostered them.  The Friends of the Animals Utah have established a great system of fostering animals of all ages and they have a great adoption success rate as a result.  Adoption has become a given in our town thanks to FOA Utah's proactive approach to reaching out to the community to educate them in the benefits of adopting, volunteering and contributing to the organization.  
Friends of Animals Utah	67151		/users/profile/73381	Suze W.	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	I have been a resident of Park City for 28 years.  When I first came to town there were stray cats and dogs all over town...With an itinerant winter population that came to work at the resorts and restaurants, came many "cute puppies and kittens" that were purchased or acquired during their stay for the winter, but once the spring came and the jobs ended, those folks returned to their countries but couldn't or didn't take their pets with them.Since Friends of the Animals has been in town, many many formerly homeless pets have found homes...it is a rare occasion to see a stray cat or dog wandering through town.I have had first hand experience with them since up until 6 years ago, I regularly fostered dogs at my home.  I had 9 foster dogs and 1 litter of 3 puppies before I actually became the owner of a fostered dog that couldn't me adopted.  Due to the nature of that dog, I couldn't foster any more.  What I find amazing is HOW MANY people in this town have dogs they have acquired from FOAU.  Almost everyone you speak to walking a dog has a story to tell about how they found their pet through FOAU.What's more...they take in and rehabilitate where necessary, and find homes for all sorts of other pets from turtles to horses.  The FOAU provides a huge service to our community in Summit County.

The amount of caring, hard work and the number of hours dedicated by its board, staff and volunteers to finding forever homes to their locally-rescued pets is incredible! Next time you are think about getting a pet, please consider adopting one. Consider Furburbia! Next time you have a gift to give, whether for someone's birthday, Christmas, wedding, in memory of a friend, a loved one or someone's pet, please consider  a donation to FOA Utah.

He loves animals and a friend suggested that he volunteer there.  This was almost 2 years ago and he looks forward to his time there as much today as when he started.  In addition he met and adopted his adult cat Molly and she has changed his life!   Everyone associated with Friends of the Animals is kind, caring, capable and efficient.

I took a chance and loaded him in my car, where he went right to sleep. The next day I called FOA and they committed to helping him find a home, so Chief traveled to Park City with us - we already had dogs and couldn't keep him. After the obligatory stay at the shelter they took him in. He kept having medical issues and it took months to get him adopted - but finally Chief found a home. FOA was wonderful to take in a dog from so far out of its service area.

This is a pet-friendly place and all of us, people and pets, are well-served by this wonderful organization. We had a pet that did not fit into our current living situation. Shortly after our phone call, they arrived and help us find a solution. In this case, we put our little dog up for adoption and he found a loving home within 24 hours.  Their new initiative to help the residents of Peace House who are temporarily without a home for their pets is an outstanding example of their willingness to jump in with both feet and four paws to solve a community need.

He had just been brought back from another adoptive  family who adopted him in April. They desided that he was not a good match.  I think it is wonderful that the FOAU allows the dogs to be brought back  if the match doesn't work and reconditioned  the animal and up back up for adoption. Wrigley is not our first, In early years of FOAU wer adopted a black adult cat named Lucky he has sinced past but brought great friendship to my children.  Please give FOAU the $5000.00, I know they will use it to bring friendships together.

I instantly fell in love with him and we adopted him.  He was 3.5 years old and we renamed him Jet Back because his original name didn't fit.  He was my devoted companion until throat cancer took his life in Sept. 2008.  Tears come to my eyes as I remember him.  He seemed to sense that they/we saved his life.  As soon as the new FOAU building donation center was started we purchased a name brick for him.  I never knew his true story but I was lead to believe he was neglected rather than abused.  He had papers and we tried to find the breeder but were unable to do it.  FOAU gave me the best dog of my life.  The people at FOAU work tirelessly to save animals.  I was also indirectly involved with the rescue of a puppy mill in a local city where 6-8 Papillon puppies were taken from squalid conditions.  I have volunteered on several occasions and felt very satisfied in doing so.  I plan to do so again because I  personally know Claudia  and the force, leadership and  strength she  can bring to an organization is unlimited.

Friends of Animals Utah	72806		/users/profile/79582	Melissa B.	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	Friends of Animals is an organization that helps you see the humanity that still exists in our chaotic world.  I have been a volunteer in years past, as well as a client more recently.  I have seen the passion that the people of the FOA have for animals as they sacrifice many hours of hard work to care and rehabilitate the Dogs, Cats, Horses, etc.  that are fortunate enough to become a part of the FOA family.   I have also seen the tears and frustration that come with such an awesome struggle to save lives.  Cathy Clark of the Utah chapter of FOA is a personal hero of mine.  I volunteered many hours with Cathy at their adoption center Furburbia.  I learned  about dedication and perseverance from Cathy.  On many occasions, when Cathy was helping a particularly sick or emaciated animal, tears would flow from her eyes, letting you know just how much she cares about what she is doing.  You can see this dedication throughout the FOA organization.  And this is why I am writing this review to say Thank You to the Friends of Animals!  Thank you for your love and your daily struggle to help the animals!  The FOA is an ultimate example of courage and strength!!  -

FOAU does an impressive job helping animals find loving homes. They also do a fantastic public service for our community and State. We adopted our two cats form FOAU who are not so happy when we bring a puppy home for the night but they are getting used to the idea. While we have the puppy or dog we enjoy teaching him things, finding out what he knows and taking him for walks. It is so fun to have a dog. This is a great program for us as we have jobs that don't allow us to have a dog full time. We also fall in love a little bit every time we have a foster.

When the time came to bring a new cat to our home, we visited both theWasatch County shelter and Summit County FOA....we adopted a kitten from each! Both are delightful cats and we love them as we did our Georgie. Summit FOA had lots of animals from which to choose and the volunteer helped us make our choice, showing us every cat and letting us hold them. We were looking for a male kitten and brought home a sweet son of a feral mother. When we took "Toby" to be fixed, we learned that he was really Zoey! Can't always tell when they're that young.

The volunteer staff works with me to accomodate a crazy work/travel schedule so that I have this opportunity to give back, the site manager there calmly and professiionally takes excellent care of the animals while at the same time encouraging and guiding the volunteers.  For an animal lover, its always hard to see energetic pets in cages.  But these animals clearly get a great deal more attention and love as a result of the well-organized nature of Friends of Utah.   Volunteers are lined up several days of every week, which I know means these deserving animals get some respite from their cages and encouragement to remain the loving, healthy animals that will make great adoptees when the time is right.

I started volunteering with them about a year ago, and in that short time they have worked continually to forge an agreement with the city of Heber that resulted in changing their animal shelter to a 'no-kill' shelter. We have adopted and saved hundreds of dogs and cats and increased public awareness of pet responsibility through neuter and spay programs and the trap and release program of feral cats. We are attracting more and more volunteers who are inspired to work for a common goal: that no animal should have to put down simply for existing.

I work at the Heber Animal Shelter once or twice a week and it is the most rewarding work I have ever done.  It is very heart warming to see an animal go from being afraid of people to being a sweet, loving animal ready for adoption. I clean their cages and socialize with both cats and dogs. The animals get to know you and respond when they see you, which is probably why I have adopted 2 cats from there.  The best thing FOAU has done is making the shelter a place that keeps animals alive rather than put them to sleep.

Charlene Brewster deserves a BIG hand for finding a wonderful Springer Spaniel for my friends who lost both of their dogs in a car accident three years ago. The concern and caring shown by the entire staff is amazing as it extends not only to the animals but to all of us humans as well.

I have been a donor and will continue to donate to FOA. The entire organization is staffed by the most incredible people that I have had the pleasure to meet.

Friends of Animals Utah	67428		/users/profile/73700	DianeParkCity	Volunteer	5	02/12/2011	I'm a former volunteer for Friends of Animals Utah and found that no matter what, they put the animals first.  Even in the days when the organization didn't have a facility, staff and volunteers would drive to Salt Lake City on the weekends to adopt dogs & cats out of Petco stores in Salt Lake City.  With a shoestring budget and a cadre of committed foster homes, the organization managed to find homes for hundreds of dogs and cats each year. Friends of Animals has matured significantly in the past ten years, as the organization now has two physical homes: a beautiful adoption center located in a popular outlet mall and a significant housing facility located on a large parcel in eastern Summit County.  The new housing means the organization no longer pays boarding fees and can provide a safe and consistent environment for some animals awaiting adoption. Your charitable donation will go far with this organization.  Their staff and volunteers are professional and caring.

I love my volunteer job and find that it fits perfectly with my lifestyle and with my desire to make a difference. I interact (via email) with a team of other volunteers to define and accomplish our goals. I've learned many new skills and absolutely love having something "important" (like saving animals) in my life. My challenge is two-fold: increase the number of volunteers we have and improve the volunteer experience-once we have them. I can't do it alone: so my challenge is to find additional volunteers who are team-spirited, experienced, dedicated and able to help.

Friends of Animals Utah	67179		/users/profile/73421	lizyok	Volunteer	5	02/11/2011	I got involved in Friends of Animals after writing a story on the organization for Park City Magazine.  I was so impressed with the R&R Ranch that was the focus of the story and the Dogs of Bark City fundraiser that I readily volunteered.  My son and I became regular dog walkers and snuggled with the cats and kittens.  It soon morphed into a foster dog spending the night here and there and it was a great way for my kids to have an animal in the house without formally adopting one (they are both allergic.) As I've gotten to know the organization from the inside/out, I continue to be impressed wtih the board and all the FOA staff.  They are loving, kind people with a heart for the animals and are doing great things to end ethunasia in Summit County. My husband and I now regulary attend their fundraisers and are advocates of the organization throughout our community.

After 6 weeks of looking I found just the perfect dog for me. He is my forever furry friend. I have been so inspired by them that I have become a donor and a volunteer when time permits. The staff are kind and sensitive to humans and animals. What a great service for our community to have this available to everyone who is looking for a pet. 
Friends of Animals Utah	67147		/users/profile/73385	alice	Donor	5	02/11/2011	I wish I could volunteer at FOA.....but it is impossible.  Even w my husband driving me there and picking me up.......I feel I have to take at least one of them home.   So many beautiful animals in need of love and shelter.   How can such a cruel world be????   So we have become donors.....and when we lose one of our dogs/cats, we adopt from FOA.     They are a wonderful organization staffed by saints and volunteer saints.  alice puleo
Friends of Animals Utah	67132		/users/profile/73370	Julie	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	In July, I saw "Barley's" big, brown, deep eyes looking at me on the Furburbia Facebook page.  His story said that he was a puppy mill rescue from Missouri.   The next day, I picked him up.   Oh, sure, I pretended I was going to "foster."  But, when I stepped into his kennel, Cathy scooped him up and put him in my arms.  His fur matched my hair.   But, his spine went rigid. I was prepared with a pocketful of treats, but having spent 3-4 years in a puppy mill in Missouri, then traveling across the country to Utah, and, being one of eight chosen to go to Furburbia, he was shell-shocked.  Did I mention he'd just been neutered and had an upset stomach, too? So, Barley loaded up in a crate and sat in the back of my Element.  We came home. For a week, he cowered in his crate, but carefully watched his big Bernese sister, Faith.  Everyone's gotta' have Faith. Then, he started walking around on his own. . . One day, I called him "Gus," after Captain Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove.  He's strawberry blonde ears perked up.  But, winter is when he found joy . . . I don't know if it's because he realizes he has a home where he is loved, but . . .whatever it is, Gus runs, romps, and rrrrffffs when we go outside.  Gus practically flies.  I love watching him run in the snow . . .there's pure joy when he stretches luxuriously in his very own downward facing dog next to my bed in the morning. They told me, "he may never be a real dog."  Nobody told me that he'd be a puppy. Thank you Friends of Animals.

We adopted a dog that we eventually were unable to keep since he could not adapt to be alone in our home.  We found a loving home for this dog (with someone who was home all the time).  We went back to Furburbia a year later longing for another dog.  Well we found the perfect match.  A bit unsure of adopting again Furburbia gave us several weeks to be sure Roscoe would fit into our home.  Roscoe came from an abusive situation and really needed some love and attention.  During those first few weeks we kept in touch with the staff and eventually signed the adoption papers.  Our little Rosco has become the love of our lives.  We truly appreciate the wonderful staff at Fuburbia.  The care and love they give to the animals waiting for homes is evident every time you walk into the place. Furburbia has also been a wonderful place for students in the Park City School District to volunteer for community service.  They are very deserving of this monetary award.
Friends of Animals Utah	67109		/users/profile/73343	lovey	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	We adopted the best dog in the world from Furburbia in Park City Utah.  I saw her online late one night and called first thing in the morning.  They held her for me until I could get there (I live over an hour away) even though   other people had called wanting her.  They were very helpful and thorough, making sure she was going to a good home.  I had a great experience and outcome!
Friends of Animals Utah	67089		/users/profile/73322	JPetty	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	We adopted both of our dogs from the Summit County Friends of Animals.  In both cases we were very impressed with the facility and with the care that the animals received while they were awaiting adoption.  Everyone we dealt with was so kind and helpful, especially Cathy King.  All employees did all that they could to make the adoption process as easy as possible.  The trial adoption period was so nice because we took dogs home three different times and one of them was not compatible with our family.  We love our two dogs that we did make a part of our family and we are so grateful for the FOA and the loving care that they give to so many animals.  So many furry lives have been saved!
Friends of Animals Utah	66937		/users/profile/73158	dsnelson	Board Member	4	02/11/2011	I have watched, volunteered and become a board member of Friends of Animals Utah over the last 6 six years. I have seen them grow from being a small group of animal lovers to a business that serves the community and saved over 1,000 animals last year alone. The commitment, the drive, the involvement of the community, volunteers, people from across the country that come in contact with FOAU makes me proud to be a part of this great organization. As we grow we hope to do more in the community and nationally and with kind donations, grants, and fundrasing we hope to continue to expand and help animals and people in all walks of life. 
Friends of Animals Utah	66913		/users/profile/73133	Buckwheatn	Donor	5	02/11/2011	This is the most dedicated crew of people ever.  The animals they see and take care are some of the most abused and damaged in the system.

My dog was rescued from a terrible situation where he was living with a broken front leg after a truck ran him over. The owners woudl not care for him. FOA rescue dhim, paid for the amputation of his leg, fond him a foster home to rehab and then finally he came to our house. This organization has the most dedicated staff and volunteers and brings joy to our community every day by helping animals. 
Friends of Animals Utah	66895		/users/profile/73113	KLofft	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	My husband and I adopted a dog (an Aussie Shepherd) from Friends of Animals in April 2005.  We love this organization!  They are well-run, the staff is well-trained and to a person, everyone involved with the organization is dedicated to the well-being of the animals they help save.  The dog we adopted had a long and rather difficult history, and due to some physical issues, was a difficult dog for them to place.  They kept the dog in the organization - using foster care - for a lengthy period, up to 6 months, before we found him.  In another setting (including many shelters), this dog likely would have been killed.  We truly believe FOA Utah helped save our beloved Cooper's life.  The joy Cooper has brought us in the years we have lived with him is indescribable, and would not have been possible without FOA Utah.
Friends of Animals Utah	66887		/users/profile/73105	KimberlyRoss	Donor	5	02/11/2011	Although I live in Wasatch County, I work in Summit and participate in many activities and events here.  Summit County FOA is undoubtably the most active and effective non-profit animal welfare group I have encountered.  I am a marketing professional, and am amazed at their ability to communicate through multiple channels, marshaling volunteers and donations for a variety of projects.  It seems everyone in Summit County knows that they can find just the right pet at Furburbia; that they can help out at The Ranch; what time of year they can look forward to the Barking Ball; and that they can donate their spare change at the counter of any number of local retail shops.  These efforts have created a more conscientious public, and a better environment for Summit County's homeless pets.  I hope my volunteer work with FOA Wasatch County can produce the same results. 
Friends of Animals Utah	66865		/users/profile/73078	zoerosareynolds	General Member of the Public	5	02/11/2011	Summit County Friends is an amazing organization. I am a huge animal fan and have two rescue dogs myself. I enjoy going to Furburbia and seeing how well they take care of the animals. I have friends who foster animals and I know kids that volunteer to walk the dogs. Their new rescue ranch is a great accomplishment! This organization is definitely dedicated to animals of all types.  Those who run the organization are high energy,  "get things done for the animals kinds of people." I am a fan!
Friends of Animals Utah	66863		/users/profile/73075	peggylhanson	Donor	5	02/11/2011	Friends of Animals-Utah/Furburbia is the epitome of the goal to have no more homeless pets in Utah.  They will keep any adoptable animal until it finds its forever home.  My cat Freya was at Furburbia for a long time before I found her and brought her home to live with me.  She was taken to Furburbia when she was pregnant, and her previous owners left her there.  She had her kittens which were adopted.  Now she is living in the lap of luxury which she deserves.  Furburbia is a beautiful facility with luxurious kitty condos.  The dogs are at Furburbia for six hours a day, and then they are taken to the Friends of Animals Ranch, a wonderful new building that can house both cats and dogs.  There is a 24-hour a day caregiver there as well as a spay and neuter facility.  Eventually they will be able to take horses and other large animals that are abandoned or abused.  I am so proud of the work that FOA/Furburbia is doing in our community, and I am happy to support their work.

Although we did not end up adopting that particular dog we came away with a very special addition to our family.  Kathy, the manager, was so incredibly patient with our many questions, gave us an amazing amount of information and assurances that if it did not work out our little dog would find a great home.  Because of her and her team, we not only left with a very special little guy we made an extra contribution to the organization so that their work could be multiplied and sustained.Furburbia is a very special place in our community!

I found the place that I can now call my "volunteer home." Friends of Animals rescue ranch is that place.  What a wonderful group of loving people that work there! The ranch is nestled right in an unbelievably beautiful spot right past Park City. The facility is amazing. The volunteers are wonderful. The animals are so well taken care of and happy. When you walk in the healthy cat playroom, the purring just about makes the walls shake! The dogs have toys to play with and an abundance of treats! What a healthy, happy and wonderful place to volunteer at...not to mention being an animal there has to be just as fantastic!
Friends of Animals Utah	66798		/users/profile/73007	Tom S.	Donor	5	02/11/2011	My wife and I have volunteered for both the DC Humane Society and Friends of Animals of Summit County, Utah. We have also been donors to both. Both are good organizations run by good people who are committed to saving animals.  Their is a difference. Whereas the DC Humane Society is largely government funded, the FOA of Summit County is funded  almost entirely by donations.  And with those donations, they have built a wonderful, large animal rescue facility. It also serves as a teaching facility for school kids with its summertime "Camp Kindness", and a place where veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome can come and help the animals many of whom have also suffered trauma in their lives. The FOAU is great on these many fronts and deserves our support.
Friends of Animals Utah	66793		/users/profile/73001	lesterli	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	I have always been impressed with Friends of Animals Utah when I visited their facility in past. When I went looking for a Border Collie mix, I started there and found a great dog.  Friends of Animals Utah  supplied whatever I needed to get started with my new puppy as well as shots and neutering.  They even gave me a follow up call to make sure my puppy wasn't sick when they identified an illness in another dog at the facility. I was also impressed how carefully they matched me up with my dog.  They were concerned that he might be too much for me, being a Border Collie and dominant in his litter.  When I told them about my experience with training Border Collies in herding, obedience and agility they were thrilled I had the right dog.
Friends of Animals Utah	66785		/users/profile/72993	foa66	Donor	5	02/11/2011	For some reason, I have always been connected to animals.... as long as I can remember, they always spoke to me. Through their gentle eyes, their play, their total trust in us.  I have always had companions and they have been part of my family. Knowing that their is an organization of volunteers that provides for the animals in the county where I live is a huge relief to me. And if I can help by donating to their cause, I will do so as long as I can.I love to go into Furbubia and say hello to the animals..... it's the only place I've been that houses animals and it does not make you feel sad for them. They are the lucky ones. Once Furbubia has them, their luck has turned.... they have foster care from people who truly love them and they have activities during the day. It's like they're going to work just like everybody else. FOA is an organization made up of volunteers and they get things done for the animals. Their adoption system is thorough and protects the animals and well as giving an adopter an opportunity to give the adoption their best shot.When my sister was looking for a dog, that's where she went to find her companion. Rascal has been with her for 3 years now. He loves her like no one else. He's a lucky dawg!I'm a proud supported of FOA!!!

Friends of Animals Utah	66759		/users/profile/72965	Kim Holmes	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	I've adopted two dogs from Friends of Animals over the past 6 years, and both were great experiences. Of course the dogs are great, but I've learned that Friends of Animals makes an effort to insure that each pet is going to a prepared and committed pet-owner. They check out and educate the people that want to adopt and make sure that the adoption will be successful. This makes for happy dogs - going to a good and permanent home. I've seen Friends of Animals care for and foster dogs for many months, in order to find that dog a forever home. The most recent dog I adopted, an adorable little terrier named Billy, had a bad case of kennel cough, which I realized after taking him home. When I told Friends of Animals about his condition, they made sure I had the medication to get him better. My sincere thanks to Friends of Animals for all they do for our animal friends!
Friends of Animals Utah	66728		/users/profile/72933	Buddy	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	We adopted our "Buddy" (aka Cupid) from Furburbia in Park City this past November.  We are new to Utah, and asked around about adoption facilities when we began our search for a new dog.  Furburbia came highly recommended to us by locals who had been clients and loved the adoption experience they had there (as well as their pet).  The staff was supportive, knowledgable and caring.  They knew Buddy and shared both his strengths and weaknesses so there would no surprises when we took him out on trial.  The trial period, which I believe is one of the strengths of Furburbia, allowed us to get to know Buddy without making an initial commitment.  This was very important to us as we have two other dogs and small grandchildren.  We were looking for a dog that would fit into our established pack and be gentle with our little ones.  Buddy was just the one for us!  Now, when we run him at the Park City Dog Park, most of the people we meet there also adopted from Furburbia.  Like us, they love their dog and had a wonderful adoption experience.

I volunteered with a program called Canines With A Cause. I helped train shelter dogs to be used as psychological therapy dogs. We worked with a trainer on basic obedience and canine good citizen certification. All of the dogs in the program were adopted.

Friends of Animals Utah	66663		/users/profile/72863	karenm	Client Served	5	02/11/2011	I have adopted two wonderful dogs from Summit County Friends of Animals.  In both cases, every person I interacted with was very helpful.  Their primary concern was always in making sure that the dog found a good forever home.  We were given advice, allowed a trial adoption period, and lent equipment, such as kennels, to help ensure that our home was a good match for the dog. When we adopted our second dog, we had to consider that we already had a dog at home who had strong fears of other dogs.  The FOA staff let our fearful dog meet some other dogs and finally suggested a particular dog who turned out to be a perfect match.   This is a well-organized group of people who are dedicated to serving the homeless pet population.  I have followed the group since my first adoption from them 14 years ago, and during that time FOA has continually expanded in order to serve more and more animals.   Their latest addition is a new rescue and rehabilitation center.

Following on the above three broad principles, has increased the legitimacy and credibility of SSI's financial procedures, its effectiveness of its programs and has earned tremendous respect in the communities of Botswana and within the local and international donor agencies.Good governance and self-regulatory initiatives and commitment to their principles are the most important drivers for this NGO, in bringing behavior change not only within the direct beneficiaries of SSI but overall in the local communities. Accountability to it beneficiaries involves all its stakeholders in processes. SSI works in consultation with local communities by drawing on local skills and knowledge.This NGO is known for investing its resources in its local staff empowering and ensuring professionalism in project designing and its execution for bringing the best to meet its local needs; increases local capacity and skills base, and increases the commitment of the community to support the project. SSI creates a conducive and supportive working environment for existing staff and international volunteers who bring their expertise to this NGO. SSI is committed to its principles to help to improve the effectiveness of achieving its mission. Anis Ajani - From Dallas

Stepping Stones International	284920	1	/users/profile/12632	sandy	Volunteer	5	04/06/2016	Stepping Stones International has made a significant difference in the lives of participants especially in the reading programs. The students are now reading, comprehending, learning and passing tests which allows them to continue in further education and/or in the job market.  As well, the youth are experiencing new adventures which we take for granted daily, such as realizing their self value, finding hidden talents, making new friends, and realizing care and love!!!SSI, you are the very BEST!!!  Keep up the wonderful successes!
Stepping Stones International	226090	1	/users/profile/12632	sandy	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	Stepping Stones International is a one of a kind NGO in Botswana giving hope and life to youth ages 12-18 and beyond. These children are being fed, taught social skills, given a chance to know their worth and value. They have been robbed of a childhood and  are given the chance to pick themselves up and realize that they are loved and are very valuable souls.  They are receiving tutoring and are passing their tests and moving on to the next level of education. Many have progressed to employment in a field of their liking and choice. If not for this opportunity all would be out in the streets idly wandering and wondering and most likely engaging in activities of an evil nature.   Yes! Stepping Stones International is WONDERFUL AND VALUABLE!!!!!!!!!!! It is a happy place for many!!!

Stepping Stones International	93355		/users/profile/12632	sandy	Volunteer	5	07/03/2011	Stepping Stones Intl. is a one of a kind program and most amazing. The staff is diverse and international from all parts of the world. The participants are given a chance to smile, laugh, and catch up with a bit of the childhood that was stolen from them. Progress has been made in academics, communication skills, income generating, financial management, entrepreneur skills, computer training, goal setting. A critical issue os sexual abuse and gender equality is being address with the youth and in the community. SSI reaches the 100 participants AND families AND community....building a healthier environment.  SSI is nothing short of THE VERY BEST!!!!!!! Thanks SSI!!!!!
Stepping Stones International	10737	6	/users/profile/12632	sandy	Board Member	5	09/23/2009	It has been my privilege to spend time with the youth at Stepping Stones Intl.  I am in awe at how these young people have opened up and are progressing in a world that seemed so far out of their reach. They now have the chance to make choices,set goals,and become contributing adults. They know what it is like to be their ages and have fun. With more donations and monies, this nonprofit can accomplish amazing feats. Please Help!!!!!

Stepping Stones International	259238		/users/profile/290245	Heidi51	General Member of the Public	5	09/24/2015	SSI empowers children to become successful, competent, and courageous young adults. The SSI staff provides the children opportunities for personal growth, conversations and reflections on daily and life issues, and outside resources to help increase self-esteem. I wish SSI could be implemented in so many other countries for children in need.  
Stepping Stones International	226518		/users/profile/290245	Heidi51	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	SSi provides teenage children a safe and nurturing place where they feel a sense of belonging. The children are provided with experiences they may not get elsewhere. Positive guidance and direction is modeled for the children by the excellent educators at SSI. Botswana is lucky to have this organization and hopefully SSI continues to expand in other countries. 
Stepping Stones International	259224		/users/profile/291113	Brigitta P.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/23/2015	Stepping Stones International (SSI) opens the doors to a world that many did not know even existed.  It allows children, who are of lower socio-economic class and vulnerable, to succeed in school, pass exams, progress to a higher education, earn jobs, better their personal lives and self, receive counseling for various hardships they have and/or are currently enduring, form healthy relationships with others, help their families, and give back to their community.  SSI believes in these kiddos' potential and worth, while also encouraging them to do their best and be their best self.  This organization may only be located in one country, but it has made its impact and stamp all over the world, to include, Salt Lake City, Utah in the United States!!! 
Stepping Stones International	227385	1	/users/profile/291113	Brigitta P.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/27/2014	SSI is committed to the population that rarely gets targeted in Botswana and many other countries in Africa! This NGO feeds the kids, teaches them life skills that they would not otherwise know, educates/tutors them in areas they are struggling in academically, prepares them to achieve a passing score on their tests, allows them a safe environment to talk about daily life struggles, as well as things that have happened to them (things that we cannot even imagine), and exposes them to experiences in the community that they would not otherwise have access to. The volunteers and staff at SSI are extremely committed to the kids and are completely invested in helping them to succeed. I just hope that SSI's ideals and goals are able to spread to other contries and continents!!! 
Stepping Stones International	258767		/users/profile/347294	SHromero	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/21/2015	Stepping Stones International is a non-profit organization that is doing great work and making large strides to give teachers and students the skills they need to succeed and create for themselves a better future.
Stepping Stones International	257642	1	/users/profile/346095	Lebogang D.	General Member of the Public	4	09/16/2015	SSI's leadership programme has made great strides in getting out of school youth either back into the education system or finding them work. Their leadership programme has done a lot for young Batswana, especially in the Mochudi area where they are based. They also assist tertiary institutions by providing positions for professional attachments which is a great opportunity for skills exchange, but also demonstrates their commitment to assisting and empowering young people from all walks of life.
Stepping Stones International	256905	1	/users/profile/345304	Mnthali	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/13/2015	I have worked with Stepping Stones International when they were a sub-contractor to Education Development Center (EDC). I have been very impressed with their dedication to the welfare of vulnerable adolescents. I have seen how they have given hope to many young people by equipping with much-needed skills to navigate the world. There are many stories of young people who have turned out to be excellent leaders in the community because of Stepping Stones International. An excellent organization which lives up to it's vision and mission.
Stepping Stones International	256520		/users/profile/344913	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	Stepping Stones International provides much needed services to at-risk young people.   This organization should be a model for other communities who want to provide a crucial bridge of skills, support and knowledge for teens as they move towards adulthood.  Partnering with organizations like the University of Utah Reading Clinic in Salt Lake City to provide research based reading instruction is just one way that SSI is providing their students with valuable skills that will affect them the rest of their lives.  Hats off to SSI!  
Stepping Stones International	256372		/users/profile/344776	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/11/2015	Stepping Stones is an incredible nonprofit that is seeking to change the lives of vulnerable youth in Botswana. The people are passionate and committed and the difference SSI makes in children's lives is invaluable. 
Stepping Stones International	256020		/users/profile/344409	AmandaSkinn	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Stepping Stones International is an excellent organization genuinely dedicated in supporting orphaned and vulnerable youth with their educational, emotional, social and physical health and well-being. While volunteering with the education program in 2011, I learned a lot from the youth, staff and volunteers and in turn they were open to new ideas and strategies. This organization collaborates well with community members of varying scales to seek out and provide the best programing and opportunities for its youth. It is a great organization with which to volunteer and I still hope to return some day!
Stepping Stones International	256003		/users/profile/344389	MMW1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2015	Stepping Stones is a wonderful organization that plays a key role in supporting youth in Botswana in a manner that engages, empowers, and educates vulnerable youth. The integration with and respect for the greater community in which it works contributes to its success. It has a clear focus as an organization, a dedicated leadership, and an understanding of how to combine the best of Botswana, the US, and the region to create meaningful programs in youth development that focus on the overall well-being and future success of vulnerable youth.
Stepping Stones International	255945		/users/profile/344330	Hao G.	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Fantastic organization, incredible cause and a phenomenal team!  One of the best non-profits I've worked with and wish them continued success in the future.

Their approach to youth development is comprehensive, addressing academics, emotions, family life, and physical health.  I was so inspired by the staff and their dedication to Botswana's adolescents.  
Stepping Stones International	255794		/users/profile/344181	emmarose	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Stepping Stones is an agency that successfully balances offering supportive services for youth and advocating for change and community development on a large scale - not an easy task! As a volunteer I was blown away by how Stepping Stones was dedicated to community-driven projects and the effectiveness in achieving those projects. Thank you SSI for being an amazing 'stepping stone' for participants, volunteers and community members alike to grow and develop the skills to do amazing work and make change!
Stepping Stones International	255448	1	/users/profile/343831	readmore	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2015	Stepping Stones International is doing the kind of work we all wish we could do!  I am proud to be associated with this fabulous organization, and I welcome all interested literacy volunteers to contact the University of Utah Reading Clinic (www.uurc.org - 801-265-3951) to find out how to get their "boots on the ground" in Botswana!!!
Stepping Stones International	255440	1	/users/profile/343826	MeganBryant	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2015	Stepping Stones International has developed a holistic program to address the many complex needs of the youth in Botswana.  SSI has networked with the University of Utah Reading Clinic (UURC) to improve the literacy rates not only at the Center, but throughout the country.  Tutors at  SSI have been trained to provide targeted  individual and small group reading intervention.  SSI has partnered with the UURC, Ministry of Education and Skills Development, along with BIHL, to train hundreds of teachers in the UURC's whole class text and word study literacy models.  Teachers have been given additional tools to make texts and therefore content accessible to their students.  SSI's impact on this nation is enduring and remarkable.
Stepping Stones International	255414	1	/users/profile/343806	CMcBeth	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/09/2015	I have worked with numerous international nonprofit organizations in various countries and I have been very impressed with SSI. SSI has a focused mission on an area of great need and thoughtful leadership to execute the projects. I have sent students to work with SSI and every one of them has returned having a positive experience and a strong conviction in the work SSI does. They are a great nonprofit!
Stepping Stones International	229344		/users/profile/292996	Tshepo_Paledi	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2014	SSI is an absolutely fantastic organisation. They really want to unlock the potential of youth and really deliver. I wish it would garner a lot of financial support from donors because they really deliver. I am absolutely honoured to be part of this life changing team. As an Education and ICT Coordinator, I see change each and every day in the lives of SSI participants.

Stepping Stones International	229301		/users/profile/292952	garrettflint	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	It is inspiring to see the impact Stepping Stones International is having on the youth of Botswana.  Their hard work and dedication is manifested in the lives of the youth to whom they are dedicated.  During the time I spent volunteering at Stepping Stones, I was trained to conduct literacy sessions with one of the participants.  As we progressed through the literacy clinic, it was not only his literacy skills that improved, his self confidence, behavior and schoolwork all improved as a whole.  Stepping Stones knows how to focus on their participants to create lasting changes in their lives.  
Stepping Stones International	229280		/users/profile/292930	Sophia S.	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	Stepping Stones International is a real on the ground, hands on solution to the problem of poor literacy, life skills and coping mechanisms of youth in Mochudi. The participants are given one on one literacy training as well as a comprehensive program centered around giving them the skills necessary to be strong individuals and community members. The programs offered include, Psycho-social support, Financial literacy, social responsibility, leadership training, life skills and literacy. The youth are also given games to play, during leisure time and attend sports on Saturdays. The staff is accommodating and constantly evolving through sensitivity training and facilitation training. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. 
Stepping Stones International	227065		/users/profile/290796	Melissa232	Board Member	5	10/27/2014	The staff and volunteers at Stepping Stones inspire me. I'm so proud to be part of Stepping Stones and the good work that they do with adolescents. They make dreams come true and give young people in Mochudi a safe place to land in what is often a difficult world.  My wish would be to give the staff and management a big thanks and continued energy and resources in a dwindling resource environment. Keep up the great work ditsala - you are building stronger adults and a stronger nation. Thank you for your good work.

Stepping Stones International	167225	1	/users/profile/222086	arti321	Client Served	5	09/05/2013	As a client of mine, Stepping Stones International is an organization I aimed to help better operationally. What I didn't expect was to walk into its office and centre and be touched, inspired and left feeling speechless by the work that they do and the people who run the organization. As founder, Lisa Jamu, has dedicated her life to not only the kids that go through the program but also to her staff and volunteers. As such, Stepping Stones is not just a non for profit, but a family, a family that is commited to having an impact all across Africa, which is absolutely beautiful to witness.

Stepping Stones International	157323		/users/profile/208616	ceceh	Donor	5	05/07/2013	I know of the commitment of the staff and volunteers at Stepping Stones International; recently had the opportunity to visit with Tinny Seitei and learn from her about the impact Stepping Stones has on the children and the community.  It was heartwarming to hear her stories. Impressive that contractors who come to Botswana want to do what they can to help the community.
Stepping Stones International	157188		/users/profile/208448	Kate49	Volunteer	5	05/06/2013	Stepping Stones International is an amazing program that has made such a difference in the lives of so many young people.  They provide support and services to a very underserved populations, teens and young adults orphaned by AIDES.  Our Women's Club has donated to SSI for the last few years and we feel good that our donation is carefully used to directly benefit the participants.  We have seen the growth of the program over time and look forward to continued involvement.  
Stepping Stones International	157157		/users/profile/208404	Timothy14	Donor	5	05/06/2013	This program has been well planed and implemented with intelligence and experience gained in the area it suports. I know some of the people behind this organization and can honestly say that I have never ment a more dedicated group in my life. The love and passion the staff and administration have, both fo the children in the program and for those that have graduated from the program, is evident when talking to or when receiving emails from them. The work they put in to making it the exceptional program it is give me the confidence that my donation is reaching children in need and helping these children build a better life for themselves. 
Stepping Stones International	157086		/users/profile/208320	Tish Mobley	Volunteer	5	05/04/2013	I served as a US Peace Corps Volunteer at SSI for two years, 2011-2013.  It was incredible to watch the adolescent participants grow in self confidence and leadership ability, gain skills to help them succeed academically and in life, and to build meaningful relationships with their peers and staff.  SSI makes all the difference in the lives of these orphans and vulnerable teens, many of whom are HIV positive.  It is a well run organization that strives to continually improve its programs.  It is THE best run NGO in Botswana!
Stepping Stones International	157012		/users/profile/208236	Nontombi	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/03/2013	My name is Nontombi  Gungqisa. I joined Stepping Stones in August 2013 as a "Finding the Leader Within" Leadership Coordinator. This organisation unlocks a world of opportunities for youth. Everyone associated with it is presented with the opportunity  to excel from the welcome, buildings, colorful rooms, positive energy and creativity,  and divers cultures. Psychosocial support is the core in this organisation for both our direct clients and their primary caregivers including grandmothers. We pride ourselves with community ownership and grooming the asserts of the next generation - the youth. 
Stepping Stones International	156973	1	/users/profile/208182	GAMcD	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/02/2013	Lisa Jamu, the founder and ED of Stepping Stones, is a longtime friend and colleague.  She poured her heart and soul into the creation of this incredible organization, and keeps it running  impacting the lives of 1000s in Botswana and internationally  with great passion and professionalism.  Her culturally appropriate model  imbued with community input, local staff, and techniques such as peer-to-peer mentoring  nurtures the growth and well-being of orphaned and vulnerable adolescents.   In a relatively short period of time, Lisa - together with her staff, board and many dedicated volunteers - has designed and implemented an impressive, holistic program for the development of self-sufficient, self-assured  young adults.   I greatly admire her success.  
Stepping Stones International	156948		/users/profile/208151	alexagrooms	Volunteer	5	05/02/2013	My name is Alexa Grooms and I had the pleasure of serving Stepping Stones International as an intern for two months. I helped S.S.I with their social media and developing their leadership curriculum.   During my time, I worked closely with the faculty and participates especially Lisa Jamu. The passion and drive in every faculty member and the experience of every participant was positive. S.S.I does not just help its 100 participants will homework it takes a holistic approach to bettering their lives-- with goal setting, financial literacy, leadership building, and life skills. These subjects are not taught in schools and these participants without question are more secure and ready for life. S.S.I has also helped many participants go to college with their tutoring and land jobs and internships with their connections in the community.  S.S.I is a highly respected and thriving non-profit. Their ambition and drive to make their participants better in my opinion makes them an elite non-profit that deserves all positive recognition. 
Stepping Stones International	93623		/users/profile/107808	Celine B.	Volunteer	5	07/08/2011	I have had the opportunity to be a volunteer in the SSI program. I have learned so much about the community, as well as my own personnality. My first initial goal when I first started was to improve the academic skills of the teenagers that attended the program. Everyone that worked there made a difference; helping them in their daily obstacles, supporting them in their actions even providing them with a meal, gave them courage to strive in their lives. 
Stepping Stones International	93393		/users/profile/107399	Kent Rowe	Volunteer	5	07/05/2011	My name is Kent Rowe and I volunteered with Stepping Stones initially to help establish a philosophy of sport and health.  The idea was to use sports, physical activity and general health as a way of life, and the lessons learned from sport in other aspects of your life.  When I arrived I soon realized what I was to do on top of my initial mandate was to roll up my sleeves and help in anyway possible.  This ranged from helping with the meals, to listening to the kids stories and telling stories of where I come from.   this was one of the best experiences of my life as it helped me to better understand our global community.  I speak of my experiences on a regular basis to anyone who will listen, and it seems everyone I speak to is interested to know more.
Stepping Stones International	93345		/users/profile/107304	Thobo M.	Volunteer	5	07/03/2011	I have worked with Stepping Stones for almost a year now. Their staff and programs are great!

They are dedicated to making the most of the opportunities given to them.
Stepping Stones International	93042		/users/profile/106817	Intern452	Volunteer	5	06/30/2011	Upon arriving at Stepping Stones, I was extremely impressed with their facilities and commitment to bettering vulnerable children's lives. Everyday there are mentors and employees there to help the children with their studies. The income generation project also provides a unique opportunity for the children to raise income. They can raise this income by making recycled bead jewelry or by working in the garden. 
Stepping Stones International	92772		/users/profile/106480	hooray4me	Volunteer	5	06/29/2011	Stepping Stones International is an inspiring NGO whose approach and success story diverge from much of the discourse surrounding similar institutions. Although SSI is in its infancy, it is a recognized leader on the Botswana non-profit scene. I am elated to be associated with Stepping Stones and have remained motivated and supported throughout my stay here. Strengths at SSI include program and management flexibility, psycho-social support, keeping the participants healthy and cared for, and educational tools. Points of improvement would be further encouraging the participants to use their imaginations in a variety of scenarios.
Stepping Stones International	92210		/users/profile/105687	Mr Fisher	Volunteer	5	06/27/2011	I have volunteered here for almost a year now and I wish that this year that I am spending here would never end. There is a spirit within the staff that makes you happy to work overhours for the children, they are like a big family. Even if I am leaving soon the path of Stepping Stones International and mine are definitely going to cross at some point in my life again. The love that is shown to these children on an averyday basis, their holistic approach in improving their life situations gives me a warm feeling in my heart after an exhausting day.

Stepping Stones International	11539	6	/users/profile/13480	mpetie	Volunteer	5	09/30/2009	I have spent the last two summers working with the staff and participants of Stepping Stones International to develop their curriculum.  The staff has been eager to learn how to lesson plan and develop their skills in designing worthwhile activities that best benefit the learning of the participants.  The goal is to educate the adolescents to improve their quality of life and develop a strong self-esteem so goals and dreams can be obtained.  There was a major change in many of the participants from one year to the next.  They portrayed a stronger sense of self and displayed higher levels of confidence.  Lisa Jamu, the founder of Stepping Stones International, works tirelessly to find funding, build a quality, well trained staff, and network with the Mochudi and surrounding area communities.  The biggest obstacle is funding and having the resources to further evolve and grow.
Stepping Stones International	11321	5	/users/profile/13264	tshiddy	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2009	my experience with stepping stone was spectacular, the first time i heard about it i was surely taken aback and then came their official open which as a perfect way of make us partners to experience what they are doing for the kids of Mochudi which is so splendid. The approach they use is holistic and give the children a chance to choose and make choices. It is really important keep stepping stones as it reaches to so many students. I remember asking Lisa why she doesn't scale up he services ad she said to me give me money i will do it. So give her the funds she will do it.
Stepping Stones International	11112	6	/users/profile/13051	MF	Former Volunteer	5	09/28/2009	I volunteered with SSI for 4 months last summer and couldn't have asked for a better experience. Working with the youth was such a rewarding and humbling experience that I will never forget.Lisa was the perfect supervisor and has a good handle of the orginazation. I found her to be extremily flexible and supportive of the staff. She provided additional training for the staff on a number of occassions and was continually working hard to ensure everyone was both happy and productive. She also worked with the youth at SSI often and you could tell they all loved and respected her very much.The youth at the centre are in extremily difficult situations and require the love, attention, support, guidance and resources that SSI works to provide them. Including MANY different programs in the SSI curriculum allows all youth to grow into mature and responsible adults in many different ways. Through horseback riding, they learn strategies on focusing as well as responsibility by taking care of the horse. Through gardening and composting, they learn effective strategies of taking care of their environment, as well as taking responsibility of maintaining the vegitables. The list goes on and on.The holistic approach that Lisa and the staff at SSI have taken to develop the organization's curriculum is commendable. They are taping into the various learning styles and strengths of each of the students, opening up a dialogue with the them and collaborating with them so that everyone gets the best experience they can.

Stepping Stones International	11008	6	/users/profile/12935	Amy	Donor	5	09/25/2009	We are about to provide funds to SSI to bring their school-based peer education intervention to our project.  We selected SSI because of the excellent work they do and for their cost efficiency.  SSI is one of the leading local NGOs of Botswana and contributes greatly to the betterment of the country's young people.  My only hope is that it can expand its work nationwide.
Stepping Stones International	10777	5	/users/profile/12682	Sebastian	General Member of the Public	4	09/23/2009	SSI helps youth become more confident in themselves and their future. They are able to see for themselves that they can continue to go to school and reach for the stars despite their personal situations.
Stepping Stones International	10754	5	/users/profile/12660	MM	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	I am a volunteer at Stepping Stones. Lisa Jamu is an excellent manager and creative fundraiser. The children flourish there and are learning things such as income generation, drama, and study skills that they could not learn anywhere else. Their self esteem and communication skills are improving by the day. These kids are overlooked otherwise- Stepping Stones is vital for their personal success.
Stepping Stones International	10753	7	/users/profile/12659	Celia	Professional with expertise in this field	0	09/23/2009	I have been working with Stepping Stones Intl for a year now, developing and running our Income Generation Programme, and am continually impressed by the kids.  They are all in such incredibly vulnerable situations, ones we can hardly imagine, and yet at SSI they flourish; growing as individuals, supporting each other, building their confidence and becoming responsible young adults.  The staff at SSI are incredibly dedicated, doing so much more than simply providing services at the centre - for example, supporting the schools and families to better support the youth, opening doors to careers for the older youth and providing support even after they have left, and helping the academically strong children to apply for scholarships.
Stepping Stones International	10745	3	/users/profile/12653	jandre	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/23/2009	Stepping Stones International (SSI) is unique, being supported not only by the Community, but the Chief. It is a place of learning, safety and development for children that has made a lasting difference to the most vulnerable.SSI is working at the forefront of children's issues in Botswana that will extend the reach of its work to a national level.
Stepping Stones International	10742	3	/users/profile/12650	steppingstones22	Volunteer	5	09/23/2009	Stepping Stones is one of the best organizations I know of! I have visited Stepping Stones once, and fell in love. The work they do with teenagers is inspiring. Teens often get left out in the cold, but its nice to see that someone is finally giving them a chance to succeed in life.
Stepping Stones International	10735	5	/users/profile/12644	bpetersen8	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/23/2009	Stepping Stones International targets the youth who are most of the times forgotten.  SSI helps the kids with their  home and domestic life, personal challenges, emotional grievances, school academics, life goals and expectations and to better themselves as a whole.  With the help of donors, SSI could go beyond their potential and soar to amazing heights.  SSI needs funding to be able to hire credible and qualified staff, pay the current staff adequately, create and develop curriculum that is appropriate, and provide the best for the youth that it serves daily.  This organization is an inspiration to me and I hope to see it blossom further!  Given the resources SSI has now, the organization and its staff is doing the best to  make a difference in the youth community.
Stepping Stones International	10722	5	/users/profile/12628	Ann	Volunteer	5	09/22/2009	Stepping Stones International has quality lasting impact on youth who are vulnerable and need guidance in their lives. They need to increase their staff size to help more kids.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	311470		/users/profile/402824	astrodanzz	Donor	5	10/17/2016	I ran the Berlin Marathon this year through Run for Burma, which is part of Burma Humanitarian Mission.  I have to say that I had a terrific experience running for this charity.   I was originally only looking for a non-profit that didn't have a super high fundraising requirement, but I became a complete believer and advocate over the 4 months of working with them.  The cause is absolutely fantastic and if you don't know much about it (I didn't), it's worth looking into. Mike is your contact point throughout the experience and is quick to respond and help out with anything you need, supporting your training by sending out frequent running articles.  Basically everything they promised went exactly as such, which was a total relief-- there can be so much to stress about when it comes to doing an international marathon, but I was fortunate to have this side of things run essentially worry-free.  If you're interested in running a marathon and supporting a good cause, I really can't think of a better charity to recommend!
Burma Humanitarian Mission	309813	1	/users/profile/401167	Writer	Donor	5	10/11/2016	This is the most wonderful organization  that I have ever experienced.  The job this  organization does has touched my heart and my soul forever. Tears drop on my face after reading their amazing stories through their work.   I first knew Burma Humanitarian  through the Marine Corps Marathon , running for charity. That was the most memorable  event in my life. I ran to save people lives.  Only 5 dollars, I can save 2 lives , a mom and a newborn soon to be from death from a common treatable disease malaria. I keep on thinking about this and it embedded in my mind as long as I live.I believed in pay it forward  and giving , and I try all my best to share my blessing to these unfortunate people in a promote area in Burma. They don't need anything but saving their love ones from common illnesses.Please support the organization.Betty Ann Berger, RN

The mission and the people who volunteer to help the people of Burma are truly dedicated to what they do and it is inspiring to see. Each gift, no matter the size, can truly make an incredibly big difference in the life of many. It's an organization I personally support and look forward to seeing grow.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	309572	1	/users/profile/400925	blakely	Volunteer	5	10/10/2016	Burma Humanitarian Mission has continued to do spectacular work!  It's singularly focused on helping the people of Burma with a most fundamental need:  medical and health care.  The members are selfless, kind and compassionate.  They ensure the maximum of their donations get to the people who need them.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	304887	1	/users/profile/396083	SJBalland	Volunteer	5	09/15/2016	I have worked with BHM directly through their annual fun run in Salt Lake City's Liberty Park a few years back, and they have also linked me to one of their partners abroad, Girl Determined in Mandalay, Burma (Myanmar). The organization is consistent, transparent and involved in the greater community and in their community of focus. I admire their drive and ability to include all in their ongoing mission, and remain a steady source of support for this cause, community empowerment and education.

It is clear that BHM supports great projects that are founded in the philosophy of being truly empowering to their grass-roots partnerships.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	302887		/users/profile/394041	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/08/2016	I had the opportunity to do an onsite internship with Burma Humanitarian Mission on the Thai/Burma border. We visited many of the organizations BHM partners with and collected stories to create advocacy pieces. It was very clear that BHM's commitment to helping the education and health in the migrant and refugee community had huge, tangible impacts on the lives of people there. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	302859		/users/profile/86645	Jeff	Donor	5	09/07/2016	Without Burma Mission, I would never know about the plight of the people of Burma.  It's incredible to think what these people endure.  The good news is that Burma Mission does wonderful work to train medics and provide tons of medicine to help.  It's inspired to think what is done as a result.  Truly, young children to older adults are saved.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163427		/users/profile/86645	Jeff	Donor	5	07/24/2013	What an awesome organization!  It focuses on providing medicine to one of the most under-served parts fo the world.  I was floored to read that 1 in 7 children never make it to their 5th birthday.  All because there's no medicine to cure the most basic illnesses and disease.  Burma Mission's phenomanl drive helps bring those meds to more than 50,000 people every year.  I feel a direct and very real connection t the people they help.  They provide a lens for the rest of us to see an area where the media and governments ignore.  As tragic as the conditions are in Burma, this organization makes a positive difference. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	79323		/users/profile/86645	Jeff	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	For years now, Burma Humanitarian Mission has done great work to help the peoples of Burma oppressed by the junta and its Army.  The isolation imposed on eastern Burma extracts a painful and brutal mortality on the Karen and other minorities who only wish to be free.  The children suffer the most.  BHM's support to backpack medics makes a world of difference -- helping reduce infant and child mortality rates
Burma Humanitarian Mission	302857		/users/profile/216975	MikeI	Board Member	5	09/07/2016	Burma Humanitarian Mission is committed to the ethnic minorities in Burma. While other iNGOs have shifted their focus inside Burma's urban centers and leaving the conflict zones, BHM remains committed to these areas and people. They continue their support to sustain 14 teams in 2016 -- providing care to more than 32,000 people 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	225374		/users/profile/216975	MikeI	Board Member	5	10/23/2014	Burma Humanitarian Mission continues to provide exceptional support to the people and children of Burma.  They and their medics provide the only medical and health care to isolated villages in eastern and northern Burma.  The Burma army continues its assault on the Karen, Kachin, Mon, Shan and others -- attacks, seizing land, rape, and killing civilians.  In face of these atrocities, the Backpack medics provide the only care.  60% of children's deaths can be prevented with basic medicine.  Neo-natal mortality has been reduced by 80% in key areas.   Burma Humanitarian Mission does this support for extraordinarily few dollars. $1 provides 40 doses of basic meds. Incredible!
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163425		/users/profile/216975	MikeI	Board Member	5	07/24/2013	Burma Humanitarian Mission has incredibly few resources -- but has tremendous impact.  Thousands of children and their families in eastern Burma recieve medicine and have access to rudimentary health care as a result of the support BHM generates and provides.  BHM enables compassionate, kind-hearted individuals in communities world-wide to make a positive change for those who have endured decades of violence and oppression at the hands of the Burma government.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	302852		/users/profile/394002	Eric1080	Donor	5	09/07/2016	BHM is a world class charity that continues to make a big difference in the lives of Burmese people.  They get the most bang for their buck.  Their transparency and Executive leadership is second to none.  All above, they can count on me continuing to make annual donations. BhM Board Member Mike Isherwood is a non profit Subject matter expert is always willing to help other non profits.  Recently, he participated in conference call   where he provided a series of recommendations for Cross World Africa non-profit. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	302815		/users/profile/148746	Mike I	Volunteer	5	09/07/2016	what a wonderful organization!  They ensure the maximum amount of every dollar gets to the people in need.  They understand the background, culture and challenges facing the people of Burma and help them help their people.  
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163441		/users/profile/148746	Mike I	Volunteer	5	07/24/2013	Conditions in eastern Burma remain horrid and appauling.  The backpack medics role is expanding for as additional people are returning to their villages.  The Burma government still does not provide any medical care into eastern Burma; rather they are using funds to reinforce their soldiers and military forces instead.  The Burma army continues to assault the villagers, steal land, force individuals to work without pay and rape without impunity or accountability.  The people remain living in fear.   Nonetheless, disease and illness stalks the people.   Without any care, mortality rates remain horrendous. Burma Humanitarian Mission is an outstanding organization who provides medicines that the backpack medics.  They provide a viable conduit for me and others to make  a difference -- a real difference.  The dollars donated go directly to help people.  It's neat.  Warm-hearted organization.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	109209		/users/profile/148746	Mike I	Volunteer	5	04/06/2012	Burma Humanitarian Mission is one of those quiet but highly effective and efficient organizations that zeros in on human suffering and makes a profound impact.  There are few others than can have as much impact for the effort as BHM does.  The suffering they have focused on is very real.  The medicines and medics they train make a profound difference.  This is one organization where, if you are part of it, your time, commitment and cash will go directly to tangible differences you can see.  They save lives...and why not be part of something so compelling in the face of abhorant cruelty?

Burma Humanitarian Mission	230315	1	/users/profile/293957	jcoulter	Board Member	5	10/30/2014	It is a tremendous privilege to serve on the Burma Humanitarian Mission Board of Directors. I have known of BHM since 2010. Impressed with their focus on supporting the people of Burma since 1999 and maintaining an ethical, transparent and dedicated organization, I asked if our fundraising efforts for Minmahaw School on the Thai-Burma border could work under the BHM umbrella. They welcomed us and support our vision for the school while helping us expand how and what we do. I was deeply honored to be asked to join the board and feel fortunate to work with a group of people who make every dollar count. They respond with compassion and real action to various health, education and human rights needs of the people of Burma, while taking the time to educate others who are interested in their (our) mission. A truly vigorous organization! 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	229542	2	/users/profile/293191	RachaelL	Volunteer	5	10/29/2014	I first had contact with Burma Humanitarian while planning for World Refugee Day in 2013.  Burma Humanitarian has done an excellent job in bringing awareness of conditions and supplying relief to those that need the help.  You could not find a better group of people who show compassion and determination in their work.  BHM has organized runs for a few years and being able to help participate as a member of an allied agency was very gratifying.  
Burma Humanitarian Mission	227331		/users/profile/291061	M.M.R.A.	Donor	5	10/27/2014	Burma Humanitarian Mission did outstanding work using the Run for Burma team as a fundraising vehicle. Not only did BHM raise awareness of the need for supporting Burma's transition, but BHM made fundraising easy and provided amazing, personalized support throughout. A great organization worthy of your consideration. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	226981		/users/profile/290705	lisaking88us	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2014	I ran with the 2014 "Run for Burma" team for the Marine Corps Marathon and I had a great experience with this organization. They were very involved and were in contact with the runners on a weekly basis. I was extremely impressed by this organization and honored to run on their behalf.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	226847		/users/profile/164135	MaryE	Volunteer	5	10/26/2014	I have known and volunteered for BHM since its beginning and been proud to help with the back packer medicine program, enjoying hearing the reports of their worthwhile contribution from those who travel into Burma.  For the past three years, BHM  has sponsored the Salt Lake City Run for Refugees event which has given me the opportunity to see and hear first hand the  impact this organization has had on Burmeese refugees.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120662		/users/profile/164135	MaryE	Volunteer	5	08/14/2012	Ive witnessed the work of Burma Humanitarian Mission since its early beginnings with events that were held in supporters' back yards with silent auction items made by the volunteers and food prepared by members of the Burma community.  I've been honored to be associated with the dedicated caring people who are BHM.  Through their hard work and persistence the fund raising efforts have become more sophisticated, which has resulted in more assistance for the people of Burma.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	226667		/users/profile/290399	RachelP.	Volunteer	5	10/25/2014	I am also an active member of Whitman College's GlobeMed chapter and have had the pleasure of working directly with BHM's Executive Director and Chair of the Board last year. They were so supportive in identifying and creating meaningful and high impact projects for us to fund at the Minmahaw Post-10 School. These individuals really care about their work and listening to the needs of the people from Burma they are assisting. A wonderful non-profit through and through.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	226378		/users/profile/290108	GlobeMed at Whitman College Student	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I am an active member of Whitman College's GlobeMed chapter, which is partnered with BHM (http://www.globemed.org/impact/whitman/) to involve Whitman students with the grassroots/non-profit work that is happening through BHM both in Burma and right across the border in Thailand. We are entering into our second year of partnership and it has been a pleasure to work with BHM to learn more about social justice and public health in Thailand, Burma and on a global-scale, and it has been wonderful to take action and help make a difference on the ground as well! BHM is an amazing organization with an inspiring story of origin and fabulous leadership (and volunteers) who strive to spread equality in a place that needs their help so very much. BHM's fundraising campaigns are only part of what they do as the awareness and education factor is so vastly important for this issue as well, since it is not something that is talked about enough in America. Keep up the good work BHM - keep spreading the word and bringing hope to the lives of countless voiceless people!
Burma Humanitarian Mission	226328		/users/profile/218792	Yvette O.	Donor	5	10/24/2014	I have been friends with the starting members of this organization for a very long time. I was impressed with their selfless dedication then, and continue to be impressed by it. The fund raising activities as well as the risk they put themselves going under the radar with backpack medics into the country is the stuff that movies are typically made of,  but they do it because it's the right thing to do. I myself am not in a position to go to Burma yet,  but I help by donating,  knowing that my money directly helps the targeted audience and isn't lining someone's pocket. I appreciate their efforts and I know the countless people they've helped in Burma appreciate them also. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	164618		/users/profile/218792	Yvette O.

Burma Humanitarian Mission	226216		/users/profile/164073	Jersmom	Donor	5	10/24/2014	For the disenfranchised and often persecuted people living in villages in Burma, the BHM is one of the only lifelines, providing health care, clothing and educational materials to the people there, training "back pack" medics and literally saving lives.  The organization spends donated dollars to do this and I am proud to support with my dollars whenever I can.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163836		/users/profile/164073	Jersmom	Volunteer	5	07/29/2013	This organization has used funding to travel into Burma and bring medication, train medics, provide educational material and clothing to the Karen people who have been disenfranchised by the military junta.  They have done this work tirelessly and have now created an education fund in my son, Jeremy's name to provide educational opportunities for Burmese people who can get this wonderful scholarship.  I have worked with other charity organizations and this particular organization operates with integrity and with a minimum of our donated dollars going to operations and a maximum going to the people in Burma.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120623		/users/profile/164073	Jersmom	Donor	5	08/14/2012	I cannot say enough about the selfless work done by this organization!  I have volunteered in the past with fund raisers and actions against the oil pipelines using slave labor in Burma.  Every year, this group goes into Burma, facing constant danger from both the military and the jungles, to bring necessary medicines, educational materials and clothing to the Karen people living in jungle villages.  Every year money is raised to directly help a population who has suffered constant abuse and genocide.  I am proud to be able to support this excellent non-profit organization that channels every donation to the people of Burma who desperately need it.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	226037		/users/profile/148750	Jennifer Zurick	Board Member	5	10/24/2014	Every year I am proud to update this review by staying that we have done more to help the people of Burma than in previous years.  Thank you for continuing to support our work.  We are honored to carry it out on your behalf.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163432		/users/profile/148750	Jennifer Zurick	Board Member	5	07/24/2013	We've done some great work this year!  Thanks to the Transparent Fish Fund and Alternative Gifts International, we've been able to continually expand the reach of the medicines we supply and we continue to provide the resources for training new medics.   We also have expanded our education efforts by providing more scholarships to refugee youth along the Thai-Burma border as well as for refugees from Burma who have resettled in the US.    And I'm so excited by what our partner organizations have accomplished with having the Minmahaw School recognized as a legal foundation in Thailand and the amazing efforts of Girl Determined to empower at risk girls. There is a curse that says "May you live in interesting times"and times are indeed interesting in Burma.   As much as we'd all love to believe that democracy is moving things in a positive direction, the truth for the populations we serve is that they are more imperiled than ever before.  Despite ceasefire agreements, the actuality of military violence remains and this is coupled with the threats of land seizures for development and people returning to villages after years of living as refugees without adequate security or infrastructure to support them. Our work remains as critical as it ever was - perhaps more so, and I just want to express a heart felt thanks to the volunteers and donors who make this possible.    And thank you so very much to our wonderful board who works so hard with so few resources and nothing in the way of personal reward, except for the positive feelings they get for being of service to others.    We're excited to have welcomed three new members to our team this year, as well as a new partnership with Globe Med, and I just can't wait to see what we'll do next!

BHM is genuinely invested in helping the communities they serve. One of the particularly impressive aspects of BHM is that they take into account the long-term impact of their actions as much as the short-term effects. This is why I believe BHM will make a lasting difference on the people of Burma.

Burma Humanitarian Mission	163494		/users/profile/217064	MeredithW	Volunteer	4	07/25/2013	I have been working with community-based organizations on the Thailand-Burma border since 2005 and can appreciate the work the BHM is doing because it's quality over quantity. Small amounts of money and handfuls of dedicated people can make a big difference in this setting. This year is the second time I've signed up to run the Marine Corps Marathon with Run for Burma, and I am happy to support BHM's work through this cause.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163488		/users/profile/217056	Valerito	Donor	3	07/24/2013	I think that the work that BHM is exceptional. They strech small resources to help and save lifes to very  vulnerable population groups: children and women living in isolated places where help and healthcare is non existent

Burma Humanitarian Mission	163428		/users/profile/99378	Tony P.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/24/2013	Our organization, Alternative Gifts International, features BHM in our catalog and online fundraising. We chose to partner with BHM because their mission is vital to the health of the refugees, and they operate an organized and efficient program. I recently inquired about a visit to their sites in Burma and learned how challenging their work is, both physically and politically. If you wish to raise awareness and funds for this great project you can launch a personalized virtual campaign to share with family friends by visiting our website www.alternativegifts.org. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163413		/users/profile/216948	Joshua12	Donor	5	07/24/2013	I have been following Burma Humanitarian Mission for a number of years now. All of the people involved are 100% dedicated to the mission and truly believe in what they are doing.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	163395		/users/profile/216924	DCBill	Donor	5	07/23/2013	I've been involved because of my wife and I think they support a very important cause with very few resources.   I know that when I donate the money is actually helping the people intended and it's exciting to see them expand into doing more in the area of education after being focused on medicine for so long.  I highly recommend them.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	121261		/users/profile/164986	Eric G	Donor	5	08/22/2012	I've known the folks who work at Burma Humanitarian Mission for a number of years.  It's incredible how they do so much with so little!  More importantly, they have this wonderful way of connecting donors and compassionate individuals here in the United States with people in the junlges of Burma -- and making you feel like you are making a great impact on their lives and the world!
Burma Humanitarian Mission	121183		/users/profile/164890	scotthitchins	Volunteer	5	08/21/2012	Burma Humanitarian Mission is one of the more efficient, "lean and mean" organizations I have encountered. A very high percentage of their donations actually make it into the hands of the people they help in he form of medicine and supplies to combat a whole host of primarily health care issues, the main one being Malaria. The growth they have sustained in even the most difficult economic times is impressive, and the volunteers, board members, advisors and donors are the highest quality people in terms of selfless giving and compassionate service to others. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	121025		/users/profile/164676	jlm108	Client Served	5	08/19/2012	As a charity client of the Burma Humanitarian Mission, I can say that we have received help "beyond the call of duty" from Jen and the BHM group.   Our school offers a free university prep program to children of Burmese refugees and migrant workers, ambitious kids who would never get to college without help from a program like ours. Operating for 5 years in legal limbo on the Thai-Burma border, we recently decided to apply for NGO status, so that we could legally raise funds, hire staff, and hold public events without fear of arrest or closure. Our biggest challenge was how to raise money for the necessary lawyer fees and government approvals. By luck, we were introduced to the people at BHM.  After checking out our operation, they not only set up a non-profit account for us, but, given our dire financial condition, decided to forego even their small administrative fee for the service.  Once we began raising money in the US, BHM became one of our first donors by providing scholarships for 2 of our most deserving students.  With the credibility and support that BHM gave us, we have now reached our funding requirement, and expect to be legal in Thailand by the end of this year.  BHM not only gave us a mechanism for fund raising, but also the confidence to push ahead and reach our goal.  Many, many thanks!
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120979	1	/users/profile/164611	kevinaje	Donor	5	08/18/2012	This is the little organization that could!  I have never seen people so caring and engaged.  BHM raises awareness and funds to help internally displaced ethnic minorities in Burma.  BHMers pay their own way to the Thai-Burma border so their overhead is virtually nothing; funds raised go straight into buying needed meds and supporting backpack health workers.  This dedication is rare and priceless...and the exact opposite of so many bloated humanitarian organizations.  Also unlike many humanitarian organizations that subtly use racist stereotypes to get your donations, BHM  uses a respectful solidarity model.  They see people first, not a situation that needs them to swoop in and be heroic.  By going to the border directly, BHM maintains accountability, making sure the meds get to the backpack health works ok, and not making extra demands on the little clinic that could.   They have long standing ties and come through with what they promise.      
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120968		/users/profile/164594	Rebecca BHM	Volunteer	5	08/18/2012	BHM is an excellent organization!  I've been involved in various ways over the past 6 years.  BHM does an amazing job of training back pack medics to work in conflict zones.  Their commitment to the ethnic peoples of Burma is incredible.  In addition to working with community based health care in Burma they also help provide education scholarships to young girls and the children of the backpack medics.   The healthcare and education BHM makes possible truly changes lives.  BHM is well respected by community based organizations in Burma.   
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120959	1	/users/profile/164580	Bhanyar	Volunteer	5	08/18/2012	I am Bhanyar Janumonya, the president of Myanmar Indigenous Community of Utah (MICU). MICU is a non-profit organization that combining seven Myanmar ethnic groups include Arakan, Chin, Kachin, Karen, Karenni, Mon and Shan. The MICUs mission statement is to creating a forum by pooling resources from members and the community at large with the view to helping build and develops the organizational capacity of each of the seven ethnic-based communities through networking, educating and training, advocacy, mentoring, collaborating and partnerships. Since 2009 when the organization was founded, all board members are working so hard in order to help organization growth. However, without experience, knowledge and supports in this country, the organization is not growing as expected. Board members are struggling in finding resources especially with financial assistance.  A couple months ago, Jennifer Zurick, director of Burmese Humanitarian Mission, introduced herself to me and offered helps. With her capability, she quickly set up a 5K-Run-for Refugee Event to raise money for MICU during refugee month. She invited many special people from other agencies to get involve with this event, especially with this person that I cant forget to mention him Mike, Chair of Board, Burmese Humanitarian Mission. Together we raised more $5000.00 that all goes into MICU account to spend on culture events and youth scholarship.  So, I am not surprise at all why people are saying that the Burmese Humanitarian Mission is a great non-profit organization because they have amazing people like Mike and Jen. They are amazing leaders!!! 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120787		/users/profile/164324	Mehmet M.	Board Member	5	08/16/2012	I have been involved with this group since its founding and have participated in the field as a volunteer, on the Board of Directors, and as a funder. I have seen it grew and helped in modest ways to ensure that the people BHM serves continues to receive support from groups like BHM. It has been an incredibly enlightening experience, one tht has brought me great joy and, at the same time, sadness and concern for the people there, I recommend this group based on many factors, including the absolute impact it has on a very modest budget.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120692		/users/profile/164184	BruceG	Donor	5	08/14/2012	I have been honored to watch the growth of BHM over several years and to have contributed some money and a little expertise to aid its development.  I know of no other charitable organization which does so much with small resources.  The board members are caring and effective.  Overheads are minimal and expenditures closely monitored to insure that virtually all monies raised are used for the medical and humanitarian purposes of the charity.  
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120661		/users/profile/164133	Donnal W.	Donor	5	08/14/2012	Though only peripherally involved, I have the highest regard for this organization. I appreciate their great work and am honored to contribute from time to time.
Burma Humanitarian Mission	120640		/users/profile/164104	Diana25	General Member of the Public	5	08/14/2012	Burma Humanitarian mission is a great non-profit organization. The people involved, that I know, are honest, caring and truly dedicated in the cause for helping and improving the lives of the oppressed people in Burma, as well as the displaced refugees. Thank you for all your hard work, and special thanks to Jennifer Zurick Witte, who is instrumental in making all this possible.  
Burma Humanitarian Mission	110033		/users/profile/149864	solokreuzer	Donor	5	04/17/2012	Although I have not been able to physically participate in any of the BMH volunteer opportunities, I believe this to be a worthy and righteous cause.  Through education of dedicated members of BMH, I have come to understand the necessity and strength of this organization.  Job well done, money well spent.  It's time to erase and eliminate all human suffering and brutality, so to this organization; only praise and continued support! 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	109211		/users/profile/148749	PucksMom	Board Member	5	04/06/2012	After having traveled to Burma in 1999, I was forever touched by the people struggling with their oppressive government, and since then I've been looking for a way to help. Burma Humanitarian Mission is grassroots, tiny, and therefore incredibly effective in helping Burma's beleaguered ethnic minorities with basic health needs. 
Burma Humanitarian Mission	48837	2	/users/profile/50046	mary46	Volunteer	5	07/28/2010	I have traveled to Southeast Asia and seen the abhorent conditions inflicted on the Karen and other ethnic Burmese minorities.  There is tremendous need in many areas:  education, health and medical.Burma Humanitarian Mission is an exceptional organization. It has long-standing ties with Karen and others who can focus the assitance provided gets directly to those who need it, in the jungles fleeing for their lives.  BHM operates with very low costs and ensures 100% of individual donations buy medicines or trains medics.  They have a heart of gold!
The Living Planet Aquarium	155489		/users/profile/206411	stefanie4	General Member of the Public	4	04/20/2013	A great afternoon to spend with your kids.  This aquarium focuses very nicely on varieties of animals kids in Utah might not otherwise have an opportunity to see. We've visited this aquarium so many times, I really can't count. We've seen it grow from it's original location in downtown Salt Lake, to it's current location in Sandy, Utah. We look forward to it's continued growth.  Our travels have allowed us to visit very large aquariums in other cities. By comparison, Utah's aquarium is still in its very early stages. However, The Living Planet Aquarium has made a great effort to provide themed settings and appropriate ambiance. There is always the sense that you have stepped into a different world. Local water habitats of the west have not been overlooked, which is greatly appreciated. Marsh settings of the arid west and mountain lake habitats are represented among the many offerings.  Overall, the aim appears to be an educational experience with emphasis on children and youth. My kids always canvas the entire aquarium. They want to visit everything on every visit. By far, they enjoy the penguins exhibit and the opportunity to pet the rays in the open pools. The newer South American exhibits are really fascinating to my kids, especially since they are fond of watching "River Monsters" on TV. The large fish of South America are represented in the aquarium's collection. We have enjoyed the privilege of invitations to childrens' birthday parties held at the aquarium as well as the opportunity to attend summer camps. It's a nice way for the kids to explore the aquarium with a guide who provides an age-appropriate educational experience. There is an appealing gift shop with a range of items and a cafe that's nice to have on hand. A longer visit will inevitably lead to hunger and thirst! The outing is complete when we enjoy lunch together in the cafe. There is a somewhat limited choice, but the kids lunch in a basket is enjoyable and healthy. Sometimes we choose to enjoy a soft drink or a bottled water as the refreshment for our visit. Also, the drinking fountain and restrooms appear clean and well maintained. I would recommend the aquarium to anyone with kids 12 and under. Older children will enjoy it as well, but the younger kids are very likely to request return visits. It's cool inside in the heat of the summer and a pleasant retreat from cold and gray winter days. The Living Planet Aquarium has held a regular place in our play date repertoire.
The Living Planet Aquarium	155396		/users/profile/206301	melissadc	General Member of the Public	5	04/19/2013	Love this aquarium! We never get sick of going and plan to renew our membership agian. The set up is great and I feel like it is an enjoyable learning experience each time my family goes. 
The Living Planet Aquarium	155290		/users/profile/206180	Amanda Mitchell G.	General Member of the Public	5	04/18/2013	I love this aquarium! I have 2 young children that are very active and they stayed completely entertained the whole time we were there-nearly 2 hours. The prices are very family friendly and the staff was so amazing! My girls still talk about the "amazing aquarium with the sharks, and penguins and cool stuff!" Such a great family day! We bought a year pass and we'll happily make the hour drive to enjoy it again!

The Living Planet Aquarium	154966		/users/profile/205827	mjdanderson	General Member of the Public	5	04/16/2013	I am very impressed with The Living Planet Aquarium!  My kids love it every time we go.  Ever since the first time we visited with my then 2-year old son, he has been very interested in fish and other aquatic creatures.  I love that his interests go beyond Spiderman and Batman, and I believe The Living Planet Aquarium has a lot to do with that.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154940		/users/profile/205805	Tina J.	General Member of the Public	5	04/15/2013	We love to visit the living planet aquarium. The River otters, and the penguins are our favorite to watch. When ever you have a question there is always someone knowledgeable to help. This is a great place for indoor family fun!! 
The Living Planet Aquarium	154848		/users/profile/205713	baluga	General Member of the Public	5	04/15/2013	This acquarium is wonderful.  The people who work there are knowledgeable and courteous.  There is such a wide variety of sealife and opportunities to learn new things.  I have a membership and go often.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154839		/users/profile/205703	JoAnn Ferrini	General Member of the Public	5	04/15/2013	I have been to the aquarium with my grandchildren several times. And it doesn't matter how many times we go, they still enjoy going. The exhibits never get old. they love watching what they animals do and could stay all day. They love to play in the play area. I can hardly wait to see what the new aquarium will be like. I know my grandshildren will enjoy that one even more.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154829		/users/profile/205692	Stephanie88	General Member of the Public	5	04/15/2013	I love to visit the Aquarium. I took my 13 year old Nephew with me the first time we went and he begs me to take him there every time he comes to stay with me. Now he is 15 and we still love to go to the Aquarium to see all of the amazing things there are to see. I think that is pretty awesome for a teenager. Great job, TLPA. I would love to volunteer, but my declining health makes that impolsible, but that would be so much fun.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154815		/users/profile/205677	rohwer	General Member of the Public	5	04/15/2013	My two boys and I are big fans.  Since we live in land-locked Salt Lake City, marine life is not part of our normal day-to-day experiences, and an afternoon at the aquarium is a real treat for us.  My boys both like the hands-on ray tank where they can touch the rays (like a petting zoo, but for fish).  I like the sharks, especially the ones in the big tank.  The fresh water stuff is pretty interesting as well (I get to point to a rainbow trout and say something like "those live in the river by the cabin."). 
The Living Planet Aquarium	154777	1	/users/profile/205637	johnwboom	Volunteer	5	04/15/2013	There are few things in life so amazing as to be worth not only doing them for pay, but doing them for free, even paying to do them.  This is how I felt about my time at the aquarium.  There are some jobs that when you leave, you never want to see them again.  This is not so with TLPA.  I chose to go back and volunteer for the aquarium AFTER working for them.  I enjoyed every moment of while I was there and would recommend it to anyone.  The aquarium is like a box of swimming jewels comprable with aquariums I have seen around the world.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154767		/users/profile/205620	Anitra R.	General Member of the Public	3	04/15/2013	Hello,     i find my experiences at the aquarium allot of fun. I have my membership so I can bring my three year old to look at the animals and hopefully learn a little bit about them. For the purposes of my young child this meets my expectations. However, being a visually impaired individual I think that a way you could make this more accessable to people with a vision issue is to find a way to put what is said about the animal in brale without disrupting the print that is there of finding a way to make a booklet of the discriptions of the animals in braile and in large print so that people with a form of visual impairment can also learn about all the animals because it is difficult for a blind parent or blind child to learn about the animals there when we can not read about them at least.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154764		/users/profile/205618	Steve73	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2013	I would like to thank the LPA for letting us hold our Salt water Club meetings there!!! They rock!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154757		/users/profile/205612	utahgrandma	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2013	What a fun place to visit with my grandsons.  I first visited The Living Planet Aquarium on a whim due to cold weather and wanting to take my grandsons someplace.  It was so happily surprised.  Although currently in a small building (they will be moving this summer to a very large location) there is a great use of space and many wonderful exhibits.  There are always some aquatic animals who are active.  The shark tank has a wide variety of critters to watch.  The penguins are always active and entertaining.  The octopus (if one is lucky enough to be there at feeding time) is amazing to watch.  After our first visit we decided to become members and although we live about 35 miles away we visit 3 times a year, often taking additional people with us. We are excited for the  new location and new animals.  I have recommended to many friends that this is a fun place to visit.   
The Living Planet Aquarium	154750		/users/profile/205600	Chantel G.	Client Served	5	04/14/2013	I love going to visit the Living Planet Aquarium.   I have two children who are 10 years apart in age and they both love going.  Our favorite areas are the shark tank and ray exhibit where you can actually get a chance to touch the rays.  We also like the penguins and other exhibits.  Overall, it's an excellent place to visit!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154729		/users/profile/205573	granmadianne	General Member of the Public	3	04/14/2013	Staff is always friendly. Some days parking is practically non-existent. Otters are almost always asleep when we come, so we never get to see them. The 'petting zoo' is exciting for all ages.  A bit much forcing everyone to walk through the gift shop on exiting.  This is an emotional hardship on the children of parents or other adults who cannot afford to buy them anything on each visit, and is definitely something I dread when it's time to leave. ( Please locate it elsewhere in the new location. )
The Living Planet Aquarium	154726		/users/profile/205571	Kit_	Client Served	5	04/14/2013	We LOVE to visit the Living Planet Aquarium!  I have 3 children, two of which have special needs.  We first went to the aquarium in 2011.  We weren't sure what to expect but thought we would give it a try.  I'll never forget watching my kids eyes light up at the sight of the jelly fish, and the sharks.  Every exhibit is well maintained, and every animal there is,  you can see moving about actively.  The animals all seem very happy and content.   As the years have gone by, and more and more animals are put on display, my kids seem to enjoy it just as much as the first time we went.  The paths are very wide, and it is easy for someone with a stroller, wheelchair, or walker, in our case, to get through easily to see every exhibit.  There are steps up for smaller children to stand on so they can independently view each tank, and a children's area where the tanks are down on the floor.  It's such a great place with lots to see, and plenty of hands on activities.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154723		/users/profile/205569	msmith2	General Member of the Public	4	04/14/2013	As a biology teacher, and a parent, I feel the Living Planet Aquarium is an amazing resource for people of all ages.  The displays are engaging, hands-on, and well-presented.  I take my daughter there every time we visit Utah.   I grew up in Salt Lake City and only wish something like this was available in the Salt Lake area when I was a child.  I teach in Nevada and am always amazed at how little children who dont live near the ocean know about aquatic life.  Facilities like the Living Planet Aquarium allow people of all ages to experience and learn about aquatic life in a variety of ways---I recommend it highly! 
The Living Planet Aquarium	154711		/users/profile/205559	mick002	General Member of the Public	4	04/14/2013	The Aquarium is a great excursion for young children.  I especially like to visit when the weather is poor and I want to get out of the house.  There is a surprising amount of aquatic life at the current/temporary location and numerous interactive exhibits.  The price of a season pass is inexpensive and my two years old daughter's entry is free.  Can't wait to see the new location!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154710		/users/profile/205558	rachelsummers	Client Served	5	04/14/2013	As a child I grew up by the ocean.  It is amazing watching fish and other sea creatures live.  The Living Aquarium is an wonderful place to enjoy the sea and all of the creatures in it.  I love to take my 3 year old grandson and share my knowledge with him.  I have also had the pleasure of having experts from the aquarium teach my 4th grade students about the water cycle.  I love having The Living Planet Aquarium in Salt Lake City and I hope they continue to grow both in size and in our community.  Thank You, Rachel Summers
The Living Planet Aquarium	154709		/users/profile/205557	Atanner	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2013	I love the aquarium! We bought passes this year and take my kids regularly. It has grown so much in the last few years since I was in college. There are Loy's of great animals and exhibits to se. Definitely great for all ages. My favorite are the river otters and penguins. 
The Living Planet Aquarium	154706		/users/profile/205554	Corsetkat	General Member of the Public	4	04/14/2013	My (almost) 2 year old daughter and I love going to the aquarium!  The annual pass is extremely affordable and the exhibits are really fun for both of us to see.  I really like the "talks" they do for each of the different animals because they offer great info and allow visitors to ask questions.   My daughter loves climbing up on the various platforms to get a good look at the animals and I appreciate the easy flow from one exhibit to the next.  
The Living Planet Aquarium	154701		/users/profile/205549	LynneGma	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2013	My husband and I love to scuba dive and see the wonderful sea creatures in their habitats.  The Living Planet Aquarium has been a wonderful getaway for us and our kids/grand kids to go see some of these marvelous creatures even though we live in Salt Lake and are at >4,000ft. altitude.  They do a wonderful job of the habitats for the fresh and salt water life.  They have remarkably good variety for our location and it's a great chance for the kids to be exposed to sea life, which they don't come in contact with on a day to day basis.  I wish I'd been able to experience something like this when I was a kid.  I had NO idea what the ocean was like until I was 16 and how extraordinarily beautiful that world is.  I'm so grateful that we have this wonderful aquarium and I've been able to see it grow and become more impressive over the last 5 years!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154682		/users/profile/205531	cerrahg	General Member of the Public	5	04/14/2013	My two kids and I LOVE going to the aquarium.

The Living Planet Aquarium	154674		/users/profile/205524	Brittanie P.	Client Served	5	04/14/2013	Last year in May we booked my son's 2nd birthday party at the aquarium. Not only was the party reasonably priced, the staff was amazing and helping us set up everything, clean-up, and they were super friendly. The only thing I would love more is to have more time in party rooms without having an extra fee. But anyways, after the party our entire family was able to go through the aquarium which was amazing because here in Utah we don't have very many indoor family activities to do, especially learning activities such as learning about our wildlife and their habitats. I am excited for the new facility to open up and I just hope there will be more facilities like this one that will open in Utah over time.

I take my nephew and niece there a lot and cannot wait to be able to take my son here. It's been a place my husband and I have gone to just to 'escape'. There is something calming about watching the beautiful creatures move. Watching the aquarium evolve over the years has been great.

Because of this, the aquarium is one of our favorite rainy-day or crazy-hot-day destinations.It's educational, fascinating, and down-right pleasant.They've also packed in the attractions, so we can even take grandparents and not worry about having to make them walk too far to enjoy themselves.

The aquarium is just down the street for us, which makes it very convenient to stop by and visit. The membership cost is a wonderful deal, so we frequent often.  We love the aquarium and can't wait for the new location to open and have more spaces to explore.  The form wasn't quite working properly, so I would likely volunteer and I believe this organization is life-changing for the state of utah. 
The Living Planet Aquarium	154257		/users/profile/205089	adh4269	Donor	5	04/11/2013	The residents of Utah are so lucky to have such a unique place to go for entertainment and learning. Many of the things at The Living Planet Aquarium are only found by traveling miles away, such as penguins from the Antarctic, sharks, rays, sea horses and an adorable sea turtle to name a few. It's unique in that it showcases ecosystems which provides visitors with a number of diverse exhibits for visitors to experience.  I can't wait for the new Aquarium and how much more it will have to offer the residents of Utah and those coming to visit the area!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154246	1	/users/profile/205076	Ronnie4	Donor	5	04/11/2013	The Living Planet Aquarium is a wonderful place for a family adventure.  My kids love seeing all the animals and learning about where they come from.  Where else in Utah can you pet a shark?  I love the Aquarium!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154228	1	/users/profile/205056	Karli H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/11/2013	I have worked at the Living Planet Aquarium for almost a year now and I love it! I get to talk to people every day who are interested in the animals at the aquarium. I always get to see smiling faces and happy children who love sharks, otters, penguins, and colorful fish (just to name a few!) People who come to visit often tell me how much they love the aquarium and how well they think we have done with it. I am happy to be a part of such an amazing organization and would encouage anyone to come visit at least once.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154225	2	/users/profile/205052	ariaudd	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/11/2013	The Living Planet Aquarium is a wonderful place where people who can't normally interact with aquatic and marine animals (being that we are landlocked here in Utah) can explore and learn all about the wonderful oceanic life in this world. You feel as if you are actually there in that  environment with beautiful murals and so many different species of animals. It helps to inspire people to learn more about the natural world and how we can do our part to help and change its current situation.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154223	1	/users/profile/205050	bbeards	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/11/2013	The Living Planet Aquarium is a great place for families to visit. There are all sorts of amazing animals to see and even some that you can touch. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and there is always something going on during the day. The afternoon feeds are worth watching as well.
The Living Planet Aquarium	154219	1	/users/profile/205046	Kimberlee T.	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2013	This aquarium is community in all sense of the word. Since its creation the area in which I grew up became more active and involved than I have ever seen it. I got an annual pass just so I could drop by at any time and I know a number of people who do otherwise. Going to the aquarium is as entertaining and enthralling, and as easy, as going to the park but with the perk of animals. Children love it. Parents love it. Our community loves it. Thank you!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154169	1	/users/profile/204997	DeeAnn L.	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2013	We love going there. It is great for all ages. The penguins are our favorite. I don't have money to donate unless paying for our admission to get in is donating.

The Living Planet Aquarium	154110	1	/users/profile/204933	emiden	Volunteer	5	04/10/2013	While this certainly isn't the largest and most diverse aquarium out there, it gives off the feeling of community every time you walk in. As a volunteer, I look forward to the time I spend in the aquarium as a joyful and relaxing break from my busy life. The staff is wonderful to work with, as well as all those who volunteer with me. It's very exciting to watch this wonderful place grow into a larger facility that is even more capable of meeting the needs of the community!
The Living Planet Aquarium	154108	1	/users/profile/204931	yodame2012	General Member of the Public	5	04/10/2013	We only visited Living Planet Aquarium for the first time a few weeks ago but we will be going back.  It is a very unique place for the kids of Utah to have hands on experiences with animals they don't often get to see.  We are very much looking forward to the new expanded location.  This aquarium is a huge asset to Utah. 
The Living Planet Aquarium	154082	1	/users/profile/204913	Deana Y.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/10/2013	The Living Planet Aquarium is a great place to learn about the variety of ecosytems in our world.  The staff is well trained to share their knowledge about the collection at the Aquarium.  They also strive to create a more hands-on experience for visitors of all ages.  There is always something to do or see that will add value to your visit, whether its feeding the stingrays or meeting the penguins, all are available as an enhancement to your visit.  I have visited numerous zoos and aquariums and feel that the Living Planet Aquarium is a great value both educationally and entertainment wise.
The Living Planet Aquarium	141064	1	/users/profile/187290	Welfymom	Donor	5	11/18/2012	Living Planet has been a part of Salt Lake County for many years now, first at their tiny space in the Gateway, and now at the larger Sandy location.  Each time I visit I see the care and concern they put into their animals and the facility.  Their staff is friendly and helpful as well as knowledgable about the aquarium.  I've interacted with their educational staff in my capacity as a classroom teacher and a science methods instructor.  My daughter liked the Living Planet so much that she now regularly volunteers for them.  My husband and I just bought a year long membership for ourselves.  We're looking forward to seeing their new facility.  We've been able to donate small amounts of money to them over the years and we're hoping to make a larger conribution to help with the new building.  They are a much needed educational and recreational landmark in our area.  Way to go, Living Planet!
The Living Planet Aquarium	139231	1	/users/profile/185335	Matthew22	General Member of the Public	5	11/14/2012	I have enjoyed my experiences at the Aquarium. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They have a great knowledge of the animals they are talking about. I enjoy bringing my 2 year old son to the aquarium because he loves fish. He will run all over the aquarium. The facility is great I enjoy the new exhibits they will bring in. The change in the touch pond was awesome I love being able to interact with new animals. I am so excited for the new aquarium to open it is going to be an awesome place to visit. I tell everyone to go and see the aquarium. My family bought the 2 year pass last year and we have gone so many times to the aquarium. One of my favorite places to visit.
The Living Planet Aquarium	56781	1	/users/profile/59476	Janet K.	General Member of the Public	5	11/11/2010	I have been taking our children to the Aquarium for several years now. We recently renewed our membership, and I was so pleased and excited to see how much it has grown this year!  The wide variety of animals has grown, as has the facility, but the "personal touch" of the staff has grown even more personal with the scheduled shows led by the staff. To be able to ask questions of someone instead of just reading the descriptive plaques enhanced our experience. The Bio Station seems to be continually staffed, too. I appreciate the generosity of the Benefactors of the Aquarium as well-- the Living Planet Aquarium is a very top-notch facility, and we as a family look forward to many years of membership. (Hooray for those adorable penguins, too!)
Bikes For Kids Utah	81171		/users/profile/88747	rznhthykdz	General Member of the Public	5	03/04/2011	I have been involved with Bikes for Kids Utah fundraisers with our school and the community for the past 4 years.  This organization has been a great experience in providing my children an opportunity to give to those in need, while gaining physical benefits for themselves at the same time.  Bike for Kids board members have been great to attend and support fundraisers big and small.  Thank you!
Bikes For Kids Utah	81119		/users/profile/88678	sherryj	Board Member	5	03/03/2011	I have been involved with Bikes for Kids Utah since 2006.  I have watched this organization change the life of children.  Through the Bike give away, children in need have had the opportunity to have their own bike, begin a exercise program that can and will continue throughout their life. I am always impressed with the dedication of those involved in the organization to change the life of a child.  I have watched the eyes of children as they pick up their bike, many would never have the ability to own a new bike...they treasure the bike...every child that I have interacted with  said "Thank You", how often do we remember to say "Thank You"! This organization may be small, but the Hearts of those involved are large.   
Bikes For Kids Utah	79227		/users/profile/86540	skigolfraftride	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	Bikes for Kids is awesome. The fact that so many kids get the benefit of a bike is amazing. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	79199		/users/profile/86510	James Kimball	Board Member	5	02/27/2011	I've had the great pleasure of being a member of the Planning Board for Bikes for Kids for the past several years. It's been  a privilege to work with a number of dedicated individuals in this capacity, all for a wonderful cause.The opportunity to be a part of an organization that annually gives 1000 economically disadvantaged Utah children a new bike and helmet is fantastic. Additionally, as Bikes for Kids continues to be a going concern we work to develop all the elements of our charter to benefit this community.Most importantly, it's the smiles and joy of the children who receive the bicycles that matters.
Bikes For Kids Utah	79183		/users/profile/86493	ChelseaMalouf	Client Served	5	02/27/2011	Last year, the second grade students from my school received bikes.  They were so excited to participate in the Bike Safety Rodeo, wear their new helmets, and ride away on their shiny new bikes.  Their smiles were contagious!
Bikes For Kids Utah	79175		/users/profile/86485	ChelsM	Volunteer	5	02/27/2011	Working the Bike Safety Rodeo each year is such a pleasure.  The kids are so excited to receive their new bike.  My favorite experiences have been those with the kids who are riding a bike for the first time in their lives.  This is an amazing organization!
Bikes For Kids Utah	79166		/users/profile/86473	ChelseaM	Board Member	5	02/27/2011	Bikes for Kids Utah is an amazing organization staffed completely by volunteers.  100% of the money raised goes towards providing bikes and helmets to kids in Utah.
Bikes For Kids Utah	74760		/users/profile/81680	JospehT	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2011	The organized bike rides have been excellent! Well supported, fun, good routes, etc. The kids who receive bikes have such a great time. I really think it has a more positive impact that we all realize.
Bikes For Kids Utah	74621		/users/profile/81531	bike2live	Volunteer	5	02/24/2011	Bikes for Kids is an incredible organization which provides 1000 bikes each year to 1000 kids.  With the rise in  childhood obesity, bikes for kids not only provides bikes for underpriveldged and at risk children, but  takes kids away from TV.  They are now  out exercising.  There is nothing like seeing the kids learn about bike safety, but seeing their bike being built and then riding away on it.  Think about the adventures that you had as a child on your bike. The charity also brings together the community in annual rides and auction events.  
Bikes For Kids Utah	72321		/users/profile/79070	Ragin Miss	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	Bikes for Kids is an amazing organization that brings kids together to put a smile on their face. Every kid wants to own a bike and be able to ride around with their friends and family. Unfortunately, many families are not in the position to provide a bike for their child. This organization gives these children the opportunity to receive a bike like many of their friends and enjoy the benefit of it. The organization also provides safety tips and gear to make sure the children are safe and prepared before riding their bike. Overall it is an amazing non profit organization who really cares about the needs and desires of children. Together we can make a difference! Every kid deserves it. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	71794		/users/profile/78501	DeniseO	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2011	I've watched needy children receive a tool to exploration, fitness and joy because of Bikes for Kids Utah.

Bikes For Kids Utah	70206		/users/profile/76729	astrickland	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	Bikes for Kids Utah is a great organization that helps introduce kids to "the noblest invention" - the bike.Every year kids who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford a bicycle get a chance to enjoy riding and start a long-term relationship with a great activity.My company provides free public relations and marketing support for the organization and their annual events.

Bikes For Kids Utah	70093		/users/profile/76608	aimeelour	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/17/2011	Bikes for Kids Utah is an awesome organization that allows all children in Utah to experience the fun of having a bike.  It's hard to imagine that some children do not have many things in life that bring them enjoyment.  Imagine how many children could have a fun summer with a bike if this organization was to win $5,000.00!
Bikes For Kids Utah	70089		/users/profile/76604	Clint	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	Bikes for Kids is awesome!  I love to watch the kids and their big smiles as they get a brand new bike.  I also love that the kids get to do service and they learn bike safety!
Bikes For Kids Utah	68777		/users/profile/75158	Sharyle Karren	Volunteer	5	02/15/2011	Bikes for Kids is a non profit 100% volunteer organization that gives out 1,000 bikes to second graders each year.  The students can but do not have to be affiliated with an organization such as a school or Boys & Girls Club.  All Children in the organization receive a bike in May along with a helmet, bike lock, water bottle, t-shirt, health and safety instructions.  The organization hosts an event where children come, about 100 every 1/2 hour, check in receive a wristband, instructions on helmet and bike safety, a bike lock and a bag of goodies.  They then participate in a bike safety rodeo.  Children can take their bikes home in a box and assemble them or a bike shop and eagle scouts will assemble them on the spot.  It is an exciting event with entertainment and music!  
Bikes For Kids Utah	68736		/users/profile/75106	Todd Reid	Board Member	5	02/15/2011	I've been involved with BikesForKids for the past 6 years as a volunteer, board member, cyclist,  mechanic, and spouse of the founder and president.   In bike terms it has been a "fun ride".  At the end of the day, all the hard work is forgotten when you see children enjoy their first bike and ride away.  What a thrilling feeling that can be related to by people of all ages and backgrounds.   BikesForKids goes about their business the right way with expenses and providing value for those involved.
Bikes For Kids Utah	68476		/users/profile/74812	Cottonwood C.	General Member of the Public	5	02/15/2011	To see the joy in the children when they receive a bike all their own really is wonderful!. A bike to these kids is like giving them freedom if only for a few minutes. I am proud to be associated with this organization! They really inspire our community.
Bikes For Kids Utah	65772		/users/profile/71893	OdysseyHouse	Client Served	5	02/09/2011	Wow! I can't say enough about Bikes For Kids! The organization is very thoughtful, compassionate, and giving. Our program serves parents with drug addictions and their children. Some of the children who live at our program were the grateful recipient of gorgeous brand new bicycles last year thanks to the organization. Many of the children in our program had never owned a bike until Bikes For Kids gave them the bikes. What an important part of their childhood they might not have had if it wasn't for this organization. I'll never forget the joy I still see on some of their faces when we talk about the bikes! Thank you for all you do Bikes For Kids!
Bikes For Kids Utah	64440		/users/profile/70456	CJ01	Board Member	5	02/07/2011	I have been involved with Bikes for Kids since the inception and have been amazed at how it has changed children's lives. To be able to see a child receive a bike that ordinarily would not be able to afford one is amazing.   I love the bike rodeo and the fact that they teach the children proper bike saftey. Bike safety is just as important as giving the child the experience of having their very own bike.  
Bikes For Kids Utah	63964		/users/profile/69923	Bill Pollakov	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/06/2011	Bikes for Kids Utah is a trendous organization, with the sole purpose of helping needy and disadvantaged children.

Bikes For Kids Utah	63877		/users/profile/69828	Anni	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	I've been involved in the bike ride, the race, a sponsor and volunteer teaching safety classes to the 2nd graders picking up their new bikes at the Bike for Kids Rodeo. Some are new to this country but all wear a smile that transcends all languages. There are many organization that help with food and shelter but this specifically targets the children. The organization provides bikes, helmets, locks, safety course and a skills clinic. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	63867		/users/profile/69818	CAL3	Donor	4	02/05/2011	I have participated in the ride event for several years.  The money raised provides bikes for kids whose families would not be able to provide a bike for them.  At the ride event the bikes are assembled and given to these kids along with a helmet, t-shirt and bike safety training.  What a great way to get these kids started riding the right way.  This is a great organization that does not pay any of its board memebrs so more of the money can go to the bikes and gear.
Bikes For Kids Utah	63715		/users/profile/69658	blgillies	General Member of the Public	5	02/05/2011	I have participated in the Bikes for Kids Utah charity bike ride for several years.  I have also participated in many other fund raising bike rides.  The Bikes for Kids ride is unique because you can see the results of their great work immediately as bikes are given to needy kids at the end of the event.  It's always special. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	63643		/users/profile/69581	Mark	Volunteer	4	02/05/2011	While working in the Park City area I was part of a cycling club that for three years worked with the local Elementary school to put on a spring bike safety fair. As part of that, Bike for Kids assisted us in giving bike to dozens of school age children who would not have the joyful experience of riding a bike. We were also able to give them helmets to go along with those bikes. In looking back I am so greatful that there is an organzation working to better childern lives through the simple joy of riding a bike. To this day riding a bike bring joy to my heart and soul. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	63509		/users/profile/69436	Spence	Donor	4	02/04/2011	I have worked with Bike For Kids for the past 3 years as a sponsor/donor.  They have been great in their quest to provide bikes to underpriveldge youth.  I love their emphasis on fitness and encouraging/teaching children the importance of exercise.  To provide a nice new bike to someone who may not have the means is a cause I've enjoyed being a small part of.   
Bikes For Kids Utah	63484		/users/profile/69410	bikemann	General Member of the Public	5	02/04/2011	Bikes For Kids is a great organization that puts together great events and gives back to the community.

Bikes For Kids Utah	63480		/users/profile/69400	Maura L.	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I have had the pleasure of working with Bikes for Kids Utah for the last four years. At each bike giveaway event I am reminded of why we do the work that we do. The joy on each child's face as their ride their very own bike through the bike safety rodeo is magical. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	63478		/users/profile/69405	cbass	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I was the race promoter/director for a fund raising race done in conjunction with Bikes for Kids. They are an exceptional organization with a great purpose in bringing a smile and simple pleasure to less fortunate kids. The kids that I have seen who have received bikes from Bikes for Kids have literally had new doors opened to them as they interact with other children and get around their neighborhoods. In addition, the safety education that Bikes for Kids provides for kids riding bikes is much needed to be sure that our kids are safe while they're out having fun on their bikes. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	63418		/users/profile/69337	J. R.	Volunteer	4	02/04/2011	 I have had a great time volunteering with this event.  It has been fun watching the kids receive and practice with their bike.

Bikes For Kids Utah	63288		/users/profile/69194	Leslie	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	Bikes for Kids Utah is multi-faceted charity that not only takes into consideration the needs of kids that are in need of bikes, but also kids with other needs as well.   For example, Bikes For Kids allows professional bike mechanics to teach a large number of at-risk kids from inner cities how to put the bikes together.  These kids learn a skill, and then put over 1000 bikes together.  They spend the day working together, and help distribute the bikes.  This gives them a sense of accomplishment and teaches them a skill.    It is rare to find an organzation that focuses every aspect of the charity on kids, and Bikes For Kids is one of those rare gems. 
Bikes For Kids Utah	63235		/users/profile/69134	Larry	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	My family and I have both had the chance to work with this group and it was a wonderful experience for all of us.

Bikes For Kids Utah	63158		/users/profile/69050	Anton B.	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I have been able to volunteer to work with the organization for two years.  They do a great job organizing in advance of the event, it is very well run.  It is very rewarding to see the reaction from the kids when they receive their bikes and their safety gear and training.  Support from Costco and IHC really assists in making the event a success.

Bikes For Kids Utah	63006		/users/profile/68888	Janice	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I have in the past been a volunteer of Bikes for Kids Utah.  I enjoy being involved. It is so fun to see the children's faces as they receive their bikes, helmet, bike locks, etc.  They then get to go over and learn how to ride safely at a bike rodeo. They are a little shaky to begin with but confident when they leave.  The 1,000 bikes recipients are in 2nd grade and would not likely have a bike of their own if not for this program as they are lower income kids and often their parents can't afford to give them have a bike of their very own.   The thanks we receive from the kids and parents is very overwhelming at times.
Bikes For Kids Utah	62977		/users/profile/68856	Teresa	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	Great organization!  Does a great job of promoting bicycle safety and education to children and the general community.  It's priceless to see the looks on the children's faces when they receive their bicycles and helmets.  They do a great job!
Bikes For Kids Utah	58867		/users/profile/63035	Chip	Board Member	4	12/16/2010	I'm a volunteer board member of Bikes for Kids Utah too, and really enjoy being involved. We give 1,000 bikes, helmets and locks to 2nd grade children attending Title 1 schools in Utah. Kids at those schools tend to be lower income kids and often their parents can't afford to give them bikes. We host two to three fundraising rides in conjunction with our annual May Bike giveaway.  It's very cool to see 300+ riders of all types riding to help provide bikes for the kids. It's even way more fun to see all the kids arrive at the bike giveaway and the huge smiles on their faces when they get their bikes.
Bikes For Kids Utah	55171		/users/profile/57177	jkelements	Board Member	5	10/22/2010	I have been on the Board for "Bikes for Kids"   for several years and I have seen the amazing impact it has had on the lives of the kids and families that have recieved bikes every year.  If you haven't attended the May Event I would encourge you to do so, it is like Christmas day for alot of the kids when get their new bikes, its awesome to watch thier faces light up and to see them running around excited and happy.  I am a bike rider and I enjoy being out on my bike riding, racing and training.  So passing on this opportunity to kids that may not other wise have this opportunity is amazing.  I have worked closely with the board and they all give tirelessly thier own time, money and dedication to this cause.  No one on the board is paid, all of the money donated goes directly to funding the bikes, helmet, locks and T-shirts.
The Younique Foundation	306790	7	/users/profile/398090	Celest C.	Client Served	5	09/27/2016	I was in the first group of women to attend the Haven Retreat. You would think that as a nonprofit first starting out there would be so many kinks to work out. I am sure they have tweaked things as they have done more retreats, however from my experience it flowed like a well oiled machine already. I never felt so worthy, and honored for being myself and my journey--It has helped me begin to reframe my life and see what I am worthy of. Everything. Anything. Because just as I am, I am worthy. Worth something. Worth the space I take up on the planet and what is more--I matter in my corner of the world. Healing from sexual assault as an early teenager has been a journey--one I have had to do alone. I now have a network of women who understand and are on this journey with me. I don't know what healed looks or feels like, but I do know now that its not all pain. That it can also be a beautiful journey of healing and hope. And beautiful things.

I never realized how much of my life was consumed in negativity until I was there. Because of all the trauma in my life I felt like I always had to have a hard exterior and never let my emotions show. With the help of the therapists and my warrior sisters, they taught me it's ok to let go and let the tears flow when needed. I was taught different tools and coping mechanisms to get through the tough times. For this I will be forever grateful! I am learning to find myself and put my feelings first for once instead of holding back in order to protect everyone else's feelings. By doing this I have become a better friend and support for others because if I'm not happy I can't help others. I've made it part of my life mission to share my story instead of hiding with shame so that I can help other women that have been sexually abused.

It was such an eye opener. The classes you attend, the information you receive and the nutrition you are given is above and beyond anything I've ever heard of. The love, the respect and the bonds made there are forever. The landscape absolutely breathtaking. I left with so much more than I gave. Self worth, goals, peace and a healthy mind. I am forever greatful.

That is what The Younique Foundation did for me by creating The Haven Retreat.My abuse started at a very young age. I learned to cope and survive.  Constantly defense mode. Prior to this retreat, I was oblivious to my actions, thoughts and feelings as well as the thoughts feelings and actions of others. I had been conditioned to be strong and tough all the time. I would say and do hurtful things to the good people in my life, because good was not normal for more. If someone was being nice to me it was because they had an ulterior motive. My fight/flight train of thought would kick in. I allowed other people from my boss to my family to hurt me and I in turn would take it out on people who really did love me. That was my defense mechanism. I was coping and surviving but not living!  I learned at this retreat that it is okay to not be strong and tough all of the time. I am not made of stone.  I learned that my trauma was running my life. I learned to be more aware and mindful of others around me. When I came to this realization, I was jolted awake. For the first time, I was seeing life so much clearer! If it were not for The Younique Foundation, I would still be coping and surviving, but not living!!Everything from the grounds to the food is therapeutic. You cannot find this therapy anywhere else in the world. And it is free??!!  The Younique Foundation should be a requirement for every woman that is learning to sail a similar ship as I am. Thank you to all the staff for a new beginning!

I have never felt so valued, empowered, and validated in my life. I am definitely lifelong connections and friends while also finding a deeper healing than I've ever known. At the Haven retreat I learned about how my trauma has affected my brain and consequently my life.

The experience helped me and 15 other women realize that even though our experiences may differ some we still understood each other and we know we aren't alone. Our children need all of us and when you've suffered that type of trauma it literally alters your brain. You're reactions sometimes are over exaggerated and sometimes closed off. Its not because we choose to be that way but its because his our brain is literally altered. They taught us how to handle our triggers and how to begin to get a grasp on our emotions when memories strike us from out of the blue. I highly recommend the haven retreat to ALL women who were sexually abused as children or teens. There is much healing in those mountains. By people who genuinely care.

I was given many tools to use in the future when I am struggling.  I feel honored and lucky to have been able to go to the Retreat.  I realized I don't want to change my past anymore, I don't want to erase it but embrace it and continue to use it to make me the person I am suppose to be and then one day be able to help others realize the same for themselves.

But not with clear glue, with gold added to it. The idea is not to hide the repairs but to embrace them and find beauty in them. (Just as we were doing with ourselves). Where the cracks are glued the bowl is stronger. This is called Kintsugi. On the last day as we sat in our final group activity with our bowls in front of us. We were told to pick a bag of beads. The other girls were picking and choosing what they liked best but I just randomly grabbed a bag not paying any attention to them. When I actually looked at them they were red and round and different sizes. Instantly I knew why these were meant for me. I just sat there trembling, willing myself the courage to share these little beads. These pieces of my heart. After most of the girls had went I began by explaining the color. I associate red with love. With my heart. And now I was going to be giving them each a piece of my heart. But first, I had to give myself the first bead. Because I need to love myself first. Because I am lovable. This was by far the hardest of the activities I did that week. Because I gave a piece of me. And now I am stronger. I have my sisters. I have found my tribe.

I didn't want to live anymore. All the tools I used to get me through life suddenly worked no longer and before I knew it I was at the bottom of the deepest, darkest pit and I couldn't find my way out. From the time they pick you up to when you walk through the front doors, you are showered with love, you are honored and for once, it's all about YOU. They renewed my spirit and taught me things about myself that I didn't even know, they have me new tools that taught me to be aware of my responses to situations and have control over them. My marriage was saved, my family was repaired and my heart was healed. Above and beyond from the food to the accommodations, the best thing that has ever happened to me.

I have had so many wonderful experiences. One time a Indian man came there with a woman I later found out was his wife. He thanks my sister and I for serving there. He asked if we would mind if he told us his story. He said that he use to be addicted to alcohol and that he use to be homeless. He'd lose everything- work, home, wife and family. He felt hopeless. He came to the Coalition to get meals and found other help their. He was able to get a job, quit drinking and he was now active in a church and married to this woman. He was going to college and was there to remember and to write his story before graduating from college. Tears were in all of our eyes. We have seen many miracles there and this is just one of them!

It all began with an introduction to the Coalition's Executive Director, Brent Crane, at a local business function. I quickly learned of Brent's heavy involvement in the community and the good accomplished by the Coalition. I wanted to be part of this dynamic movement. In the ensuing years, we have enjoyed our association with all the Coalition team members and the clients served by this organization of caring souls. There is no such thing as second-best for the recipients of the Coalition's services. From the meals, to the dental services, to the life skills training--and beyond--every client at the Food & Care Coalition is served with respect, dignity, and diligence.

We gathered boxes and boxes of shampoo & conditioner, toothbrushes & toothpaste, lotion, soap, and toilet paper for the Food and Care Coalition.  The response from the children was so much more than we anticipated.  We filled a 12 passenger van, empty of benches, from floor to ceiling and then filled another mini van after that.  Some of the children in the school's Service Club did announcements describing the people they were helping.  The children were enthusiastic about the project.  The children gained insight about the needs of people around them while also learning to be grateful for their own situations.

I arranged for my school A Capella and Chamber choirs to sing during the meal times. I found the people working there so amiable and wonderfully eager to make the experience of serving there a great one. Because of the INCREDIBLE experience everyone had, this has become a choir tradition. I heard so many stories of how students' lives were changed from the people they met there, as well as the general feeling they received just from serving. Ever since we started serving there, the choir has become so much closer and more in tune with the messages carried in our music. I'm SO SO SO grateful that I had the opportunity to organize these "service singing" trips, and watch as the choir members' hearts were touched. Thanks so much to everyone at the Coalition for all that you do! :D

The return comments from those referred individuals encouraged me to sign up as a volunteer.  My experiences over the past 18 months have both awed and excited me.  The staff and volunteer persons with whom I have served have been absolutely fantastic, energetic, and fun.  And the people whom we have served have been almost always very sincere and complimentary in expressing their appreciation and feelings of blessings received during their time of need because of the availability and services provided by this charitable organization.  The overall services provided by this organization for the benefit of our local needy persons are both extensive, exciting, and often times unexpected in the range and quality of services and care.  Every time I work in the kitchen, it amazes me about the food service, types and quality of the proffered meals, and the genuine interest and concern demonstrated by the chefs, kitchen staff, and the organization leadership.  As volunteers we often comment on the menus which many times are more diverse and complete for each daily meal than many of us are used to enjoying in our own homes.  It also amazes me pertaining to the generosity of the food donors (individuals and organizations) within our area and the quality of the food products provided.  This whole experience just makes my volunteer service exciting, fun, and definitely fulfilling.  I look forward each week for my volunteer day to arrive and am having such a wonderful experience that I do everything I can to ensure that I do not miss a single opportunity to go and service.  My experience as well as those voiced by  my volunteer associates has been so worthwhile that it just makes us HAPPY.  Whenever anyone says to me, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, I just have to respond with, THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVICE.   The Provo Food and Care Coalition is a marvelous organization, well led and managed, and an absolute benefit to both our community and to those persons in need.    
Friends of the Coalition	119205		/users/profile/162069	Brady M	Board Member	5	07/24/2012	I have worked with the Coalition for the past 8 years.  Over the years I have introduced my  family, friends, and scout group to the coalition.  It has provided a wonderful oportunity for me to help in a small way those who live among us that are in need. My family and I love serving at the coalition and will continue to do so in the many years to come.

Friends of the Coalition	118896		/users/profile/161671	Nanfran	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/19/2012	Having working for this private,non-profit agency since 1997, I have been in a position to see many hundreds of people that have been helped with their barriers that keep them in a homeless vicious circle.  Compassion and dignity are traits that underpin the advocacy for individuals that are struggling with things such as mental health issues, substance dependence, mental or physical disabilities,  economic issues, lack of education or opportunities, and/or lack of life skills.  Agency administrative costs are very low and the staff works very hard.  There is a large base of community volunteerism that helps make it possible.
Friends of the Coalition	118881		/users/profile/161651	ckw0225	Volunteer	4	07/19/2012	The Provo Food and Care Coalition provide a great service to the community. I always look forward to the days that I get to volunteer there. Not only because it helps put my own life in perspective, but also because of the great staff have I have the opportunity to interact with. 
Friends of the Coalition	58912		/users/profile/63117	kellr93	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/17/2010	The Food and Care Coalition does so much for the clients it serves. I am amazed at the leadership of this organization and their vision to make a difference in people's lives. They truly care about people. I have had the privilege of talking with some of the clients through a research project and have had some of my students volunteer in the organization. In addition, a representative from their organization always guest lectures in one of my courses providing students with valuable knowledge about this community organization. I greatly appreciate my association with them and look forward to our continued association in the future! 
Friends of the Coalition	57461		/users/profile/60716	rainchick	General Member of the Public	5	11/19/2010	I helped drop off a delivery at the food & care last year around Christmas time.  There were people there sorting through boxes of clothing and other items that had been donated for their use.  I remember being struck by a beautiful little Asian Family.  Usually when we think of homelessness we think of a single man or woman on the streets but we often don't think of children and families.  Well, here was a family that was being served by this organization.  It was striking to see the gratitude they had to find a helping hand and their happiness in receiving warm clothing to dress their children for properly for the cold winter months.  This moment will stay with me forever.  We need to do all we can to reach out to members of our community that are in unexpected circumstances, dire circumstances.  And this organization is doing just that.  One precious life at a time.
Friends of the Coalition	57458		/users/profile/60712	PRogers	Volunteer	5	11/19/2010	What a great organization.  I have recently began to donate my time at the Food and Care Coalition.  This is a well run and caring place.  The attention to detail and time spent with each person is unmatched.  Many lives are touched and changed; not only the lives of those in need, but the lives of those who give of their time and talents.  It is a place where true charity is expressed.   
Friends of the Coalition	57448		/users/profile/60695	volunteer29	Volunteer	4	11/19/2010	The Food and Care Coalition is a wonderful facility supported by kind, non judgemental individuals. I have especially been impressed with the Share A Smile group in the dental clinic. I know they put in long hours and enjoy the service they give.
Friends of the Coalition	57440		/users/profile/60688	10001144	Volunteer	5	11/19/2010	I can not say enough about the wonderful programs this agency provides for the community.  They assist their clients by providing nourishment for both the body and spirit.  They show compassion, love, respect  and allow them to feel like complete human beings. My students and I have been taught so much by the clients we treat in their dental clinic. The UVU Dental Hygiene Students come back so very glad to have been able to educate and improve their clients oral health.  Thank you, for gving us the opportunity to be  a small part of such a terrific organization. 
Friends of the Coalition	56957		/users/profile/59732	drmj	Volunteer	5	11/15/2010	I am a dentist, and volunteer at the food and care coalition dental clinic.  There are many organizations that would like me to donate my time, but I only donate to one - the food and care coalition, and I'll tell you why.  I love that they ask the patrons to provide hours of community service before they receive services such as dental work.  I've seen people that receive something for nothing, and it means close to nothing to them.  It doesn't help them to better themselves and their situation, it doesn't improve their self esteem, and it does very little to change a life.  When I provide dentistry for a food and care coalition patron, I know they have helped someone in return.  I see a different sort of confidence in their eyes, and I see true gratitude.  They know what it takes to give, so they truly appreciate my gift.  This an an organization that will use any gift you give, and pay it forward many times over.  Thank you for giving to my favorite organization.
Friends of the Coalition	56767		/users/profile/59348	nanner	Volunteer	5	11/11/2010	I volunteer in the dental clinic at the Food and Care Coalition every Friday.  I have seen many lives changed by the various services that are provide to the clients there.  Their confidence and self-esteem are returned,  they are then able to find employment and return to the mainstream of their communities.
Friends of the Coalition	56694		/users/profile/59350	melmik	Volunteer	5	11/10/2010	I've really been impressed with all the things the food and care does for those people that really are in need.  They really do care about the well being of these people and try and do everything they can to help these people get on there feet. 
Friends of the Coalition	56689		/users/profile/59344	Melory	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2010	I feel that the Food & Care coalition does an effective job of providing for those who need help while maintaining the highest level of dignity for their clients. The ability to receive aid in exchange for community service gives their clients such a lift in self worth that I feel their formula is magic.
Friends of the Coalition	56667		/users/profile/59303	EVogel	Volunteer	5	11/10/2010	The food and care is an amazing organization.  The director, Brent Crane, is visionary.  He sees a vison of helping people who are in desperate situations to rise up and realize a better life.  I love the way that they treat the poor with love and respect.  I love the way that they find the specific needs of an individual and help them to address them.  I love the way that those recieving help are encouraged to pay back the system with community service.  This is a well run organization, they are frugal with their funds and amazing with their results. 
Friends of the Coalition	56661		/users/profile/59304	J White	Volunteer	5	11/10/2010	What a terrific program!  I can not say enough about how well organized and motivated everyone is that works/volunteers at the Food and Care Coalition.  Everyone works towards the same goal of providing the best care possible to those that come through the doors.  I thoroughly enjoy giving of my time to help out such a great cause and I appreciate all that goes on behind the scenes to make even my work more efficient.

Friends of the Coalition	56612		/users/profile/59221	E Bidstrup	Volunteer	5	11/10/2010	Our foundation, Share a Smile, has a strong partnership with the Food and Care.  We have been volunteering to provide dentistry for their clients for 8 years. In that time we have see many lives changed.  Brent Crane and the entire staff at the Food and Care have amazing vision and work hard to lift those in need.  Their new facility is amazing and has a unique feeling of hope.  Its truly a place where lives are changed and miracles can happen.  Its been a blessing in my life to be involved in the Food and Care Coalition. 
Canines With a Cause	187417	1	/users/profile/244429	theshadowdancer	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	Initially I was looking to adopt or foster a dog but the more I learned about Canines with a cause the more I knew that I needed to offer what I could to this organization. It was a fantastic experience volunteering with Canines with a Cause! Saving homeless dogs and helping veterans is such important work, I looked forward to volunteering for the dog training sessions every week. I know that even though there is not monetary compensation the rewards that I received by spending time with these great people has added such great value to my life.

Canines With a Cause	187343		/users/profile/244342	Aerous E.	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2013	As a veteran I know what it means to have non-profit organizations like this one looking out for me. As a disabled, I absolutely can attest to the saving power of animals in my therapy. It keeps me from being depressed. it helps me know that there are creatures in the world that offer their love unselfishly.  Canines With a Cause is not only a good cause, IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for many veterans who are suicidal, or lost with no hope. Men and women who are finding it hard to re-adjust to civilian life with special needs. CWAC is the best.

Canines With a Cause	186937		/users/profile/243941	Becky56	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	Canines With a Cause helped us adopt our dog, Darwin, earlier this year, and we greatly appreciated their service and time. They were patient and welcoming as we discussed the possibility of meeting Darwin. And they graciously met us at a convenient location near our home so we could meet him. The representative we met with had so much info about the dog, and obviously cared a great deal about the home he was going to. We had support to make sure it was the right fit, and they even let us do a week long trial foster period. Canines With a Cause very clearly wanted to better our home life and give us the companion we wanted. They included his collar, crate, vaccines, and a microchip for Darwin, which we were very grateful for! I have since recommended people to CWAC and will continue to do so!
Canines With a Cause	186890		/users/profile/243898	Megan60	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	Awesome organization that does everything they can for the dogs that need help and also the veterans. I have not had the opportunity to adopt from them or help by fostering but I have watched them help lots of dogs and I hope to work with them once my circumstances allow it
Canines With a Cause	186889		/users/profile/243897	FireDocUSMC	Client Served	5	10/31/2013	I am a USMC Nam Era Veteran disabled Federal Fire Fighter of over 24 years, and former Correctional Sergeant/Fire Safety Officer.  With the passing of our 2 canines Poke 2009  & Acacia Embers 2011, that we had adopted in CA, our family was not complete without the occasion bark, wag and paws on our laps, or going places as a family, camping and walking with our canine children, drawing others attention and praise. PetFinders led us to Hank aka the Hank'ster, which brought us in touch with Canines With A Cause, adoption went smoothly and there was more laughter in our home once again...Hank a 3-4 month old Border Collie who had his own medical challenges in his young life.  CWAC helped us with his treatment and CWAC since became part of our Family as well.  I will not throw out any names as Buddy another BC rescued by CWAC came into our home to be Fostered until AD Journey, returned from Dog Trials in So.CA., where our family are from...and upon AD's return, Buddy had bonded so well with Hank, it was decided Buddy belonged here...and over 18 months later they remain close as Brothers. https://www.facebook.com/hank.n.buddy and http://hankpokewilliamsjr.blogspot.com/ Now our family including 2 Felines and a Cockatiel are very happy, well our Felines (George & Janome) have another opinion, as in keeping a low profile, being quiet and watching from above....that is from the top of our TV cabinet.  Hank n Buddy are very quiet, well behaving, lovable, love to play, ignore the Felines and love being with family...we could not ask for more, other than if we can only do more for CWAC and their Mission, as a family.  And we offer to foster other CWAC rescues if needed.
Canines With a Cause	186878		/users/profile/243886	CamillaK	Donor	5	10/31/2013	Canines with a Cause is an amazing non-profit that goes beyond expectations. Not only do they save canine lives but they save human ones by working with veterans. The work they do is incredible and I've met many of their volunteers, all passionate and knowledgable. When I donate to them I know they are not going to waste a penny and it all goes to continuing their mission.

The goal of this organiation is such a win-win for all involved.  The more you understand the far reaches of this program....the more it's importance to the communities it touches becomes apparent.  Take a moment....learn more and I'm sure you'll want to be supportive and involved in some way with Canines with a Cause.
Canines With a Cause	186827		/users/profile/243834	Christina64	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	I have had the privilege of knowing the Canines with a Cause team since the concepting phase for this amazing not-for-profit organization. I am continually at awe by the dedication and service this team provides to Military Veterans as well as well deserving shelter animals. The concept of  this pairing is so logical and natural. The execution takes a loving and diligent team willing to make continual sacrifices on behalf of this program. To date 165+ animals have been placed in loving homes. This not only means that 165+ shelter animals have been saved from a life of total uncertainty, it also means that 165+ loving families have been given the gift of unconditional love and companionship. The time and financial resources necessary to make these connections happen are a necessary part of the equation - but the return makes every minute and dollar spent well worth it. BRAVO Canines With A Cause for your diligent work serving both the shelter animal community as well as the Military Veterans community. You are an incredible group! 
Canines With a Cause	186804		/users/profile/188806	shancicc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/31/2013	I have volunteered with CWAC, then hired a year ago.  I have been working with shelter dogs and veterans closely.  It is awesome to see how dogs can change a veterans life.  I constantly point our to our participants any change I see in their own personality.  I see a lot of smiles when thing go well.  This is a great organization that I am happy to work for.
Canines With a Cause	142341		/users/profile/188806	shancicc	Volunteer	5	11/24/2012	I used to train Seeing Eye dogs for the blind in NJ.  I did this for 15 years.  I loved the whole process of matching the right dog to the right person.  Then, watching them blossom into a team was amazing to watch.  The hard work I put into training a dog for a blind person and then watching what I did for someone was VERY rewarding.  Because of my husband's job, I moved here to Utah and got involved with CWAC because of a good friend of mine.  This program helps to match veterans with PTSD with the perfect dog that they themselves, through the expertise of a head trainer, will take classes to learn how to train there own service dog.  Being involved with this whole process brings me back to my days working for The Seeing Eye.  I feel the same reward for taking a shelter dog and matching them to a veteran who can change their life forever.
Canines With a Cause	186800		/users/profile/243806	morninghoodpc	Advisor	5	10/31/2013	My involvement with Canines with a Cause has been virtually since the beginning. The work and effort produced by this organization is so underrated they definitely deserve any accolades coming their way. The lives they save and impact from both a human and canine point of view are truly remarkable. Cathy King is amazing, as well as all the volunteers, board members and everyone who make the organization what it is.

This organization not only gives shelter dogs another chance to have loving homes, the dogs enhances the lives if the veterans they are partnered with. The dogs will soon be trained in a local prison, the offenfers in the prison will benefit from skills learned training and grooming the dogs.

The training process is wonderful therapy and gives the veterans a sense of accomplishment.
Canines With a Cause	166023		/users/profile/73370	Julie	Board Member	5	08/23/2013	For years, I appreciated the work Cathy King and Canines with a Cause did . . . every rescue saved two lives.  But, in addition to saving animals from shelters and giving veterans companions, Cathy was generous with her time.  On numerous occasions she came to my classroom to help my eighth and ninth grade students understand that animals matter.  Cathy taught my children how to write letters to legislators and about sustainable rescue. Then, on July 9th, Cathy called me.  A few months earlier, I lost a sweet senior poodle.  She told me about Timmy.  Timmy spent most of his life helping a veteran with PTSD.  When his veteran could no longer care for him, Cathy asked if he could stay with me. Almost 15-years-old, without teeth, hard-of-hearing, unable to see very well and little wobbly, Timmy moved into my home.  His big heart, gentle spirit, lopsided ears and sweet appreciation for everything re-taught me how to love. A month later, I accepted a position on the Board for Canines with a Cause.  CWAC makes a difference.

I often considered returning him, and giving up being his forever home. His name is Romeo. He saved my life. Keeping him was like deciding to live. Suicide was no longer an option. I needed him. He needed me. We toughed it out. Now we are better friends then I could have ever imagined. I thank CWAC for saving Romeo from a shelter, and indirectly saving me from suicide.  
Canines With a Cause	165736		/users/profile/220238	Kati4	Donor	5	08/21/2013	I have a hard time writing or talking about this wonderful organization with out a tear in my eye.  It comes straight from my heart I LOVE this organization and putting it very straight forward this organization saves lives.  I have always felt we do not do enough to edecate people about dogs, so they don't end up in shelters or pounds.  And I feel we owe more to our veterans, who give so much for us as a nation. CWAC SAVES LIVES. The first life it saves is that of shelter dog, who does not understand where they are or why they are there.  The second life it saves is that of the brave solider coming back from war who has fought for our country, our freedom, our rights.  Cathy, Shawn and all the volunteers, fosters, donors, work selfless to match dogs with veterans, so they can both sleep peaceful at night.  CWAC has spread the word that we can all work together to make a win/win situation.  Cathy has spoke to church groups, businesses, government agencies, attends conferences, lobbies on capital hill for animal rights and veterans rights.  This orgainzation deserves to be spot lighted and known to everyone - it shows we can help... one dog and one solider at a time turns into many.
Canines With a Cause	165725		/users/profile/189219	cesmith1	Board Member	5	08/21/2013	Canines With a Cause is such a great organization!  They save 2 lives - the Veteran and the Dog!  Their Executive Director works so hard to make sure that the needs of the Veterans and their Companion Dogs are met.  The difference between the Dogs and Veterans once they start to work together on training is a wonderful site to behold !!!
Canines With a Cause	142773		/users/profile/189219	cesmith1	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	What a wonderful thing to Save 2 Lives!  I love helping Canines With a Cause save dogs on death row in shelters and place them with Veterans who have PTSD and need help putting their lives back.  The dog training program really helps to make sure the Veteran and the Dog get the help to be able to stay together as a family.  The Veterans love their dogs so much and in turn, the dogs love them.  It is a match made in Heaven!  
Canines With a Cause	165707		/users/profile/220208	rufusmagoofus	Donor	5	08/21/2013	I fell in love with Canines With a Cause when I attended their fundraiser in Park City, and learned of their compassionate giving of time energy, and yes., love, to our brave veterans. These men and women serve our country and return often so emotionally damaged. To see a sweet dog, rescued from the pound, trained by CWC volunteerrs who are professional trainers, and given to a Veteran, to ease their anxiety levels, and know they have a companion who loves them is just beautiful! God's own work done by CWC. I plan to attend and give each year.

I'm very impressed with the Canines With A Cause organization. Their idea to bring our veterans much needed help by matching them with a dog that needs a home is brilliant. Thank you CWAC for providing a much needed service to those that have served our country and our animal friends that provide so much unconditional love to us.
Canines With a Cause	144003		/users/profile/190499	Walt M.	General Member of the Public	5	11/28/2012	This is to add more information to what my friend, Myron Peterson, had to say. I'm a Certified Peer Support Specialist, CPSS. I have talked to Canines With a Cause, and what they have to offer is much more. I have refered Vets there from the SLC, Utah VA Hospital. What doesn't get mentioned as their stories are being told, is that their services are free. They will find the right dog to match your needs, free, help you with the needed training for them to be a Service Dog, free, and depending on your circumstances, help you with other needs. Canines With a Cause needs to be made a Cause that everyone is aware of, be they Vet or cilvilian. If it hadn't been for Myron, I would still not know where to send Vets that really could use help with their MH issues. So one and all. tell everyone about them so that they are aware of the services available, be it friends, Doctor's, Therapist, or whoever. It's a much needed Service, and I greatly appreciate everything they are accomplishing.  (Editors note; if any of this information is not as stated, please let me know so that I relay the correct information.)  :)

My brother is a Captain in the Army, so the helping of veterans is a personal passion of mine as well.  Our veterans are returning home with many personal issues and changes in their lives.  To connect them with a companion that will provide them with unconditional love is the perfect idea for both.  
Canines With a Cause	143669	1	/users/profile/190141	Myron P.	Client Served	5	11/28/2012	When I was referred  to Cath King's organization, Canines with a Cause (CWAC), I was looking for a dog which would help me cope with my PTSD.  I have suffered from severe PTSD symptoms and knew that animals provide many helpful things to vets like me.  Also, I did already have a dog named Timmy who is 14 years old and showing signs of deteriorating health and was losing his zest for life.  Aware that he was likely to pass away in the near future, I feared that losing his companionship while living alone would be a devastating change.  I felt that if I had another companion that I have bonded with, That event would be less painful.  Also, there was a chance that bringing a new young dog into Timmy's life could bring to him new vitality. I was referred to Cathy by my Equine Therapist Dr. Laurie Sullivan-Sakaeda when I asked her if she knew how I could obtain a PTSD certified service dog.  Cathy And I spoke about my needs abd the needs of Timmy--my loyalty to Timmy gave him veto power over the choice of a dog.  She already gad a dog in mind. Unfortunately,  the fiest choice was not successful because the puppy's size and energy bewildered Timmy.  It was decided that a small breed and slightly older and calmer dog was necessary.   Then came Puck, as he is now named.  They were introduced to each other in a large quiet room and allowed to interract.  It seemed the match might be a success. Puck was very docile, though he growled at first meeting.  Puck is a little Chihuahua like dog. He was very shut-down when I got him.  It didn't take long for him to open up in my home with just me and Timmy.  I was very careful to only show him love and patience so as to not set him back.  When his personality revealed itself as he felt safe, I gave him the name Puck from Shakespeare's misunderstood and mischievous character from one of his plays. I actually find those personalty traits in him endearing.  It gives me plenty of opportunities ti observe, write about, and photograph his odd behaviors.  It seems he is revealing something new almost daily. The relationship with Timmy is definitely beneficial.   Timmy seems to always be happy and more engaged now.  He has resumed some of the puppy-like behaviors he used to have (some not mentionable in polite company).  Timmy is almost completely deaf abd could not greet ne at the door  anymore because he couldn't hear me come in. Now Puck sits on the window sill and waits for me and his bark is loud enough to alert Timmy. Now I have two dogs that greet me with enthusiasm when I come home. As for a help for help coping with my PTSD,  animals like my dogs and even the horses I work with are always about being in the moment.   PTSD is an illness that rudely takes one out of the moment into a painful past.  Anything that help keep one in the present or helps bring one ba.ck to the present when in a dark place is of great help.   CWAC has provided food for my dog when I was in need, access to good discounted veterinary care, and volunteers to care for my dogs when I was incapacitated.  I believe Cathys organization has brought a new light into my life and given me a sense that my service was neither in vain nor forgotten.  I have a greater trust for the inherent decency of most people as witnessed in the work of CWAC. Thank you Cathy.

It was a fantastic experience volunteering with Canines with a Cause! Saving homeless dogs and helping veterans is such important work, I looked forward to volunteering for the dog training sessions every week. I know that even though there is not monetary compensation the rewards that I received by spending time with these great people has added such great value to my life.

As a disabled, I absolutely can attest to the saving power of animals in my therapy. It keeps me from being depressed. it helps me know that there are creatures in the world that offer their love unselfishly.  Canines With a Cause is not only a good cause, IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for many veterans who are suicidal, or lost with no hope. Men and women who are finding it hard to re-adjust to civilian life with special needs. CWAC is the best.

They were patient and welcoming as we discussed the possibility of meeting Darwin. And they graciously met us at a convenient location near our home so we could meet him. The representative we met with had so much info about the dog, and obviously cared a great deal about the home he was going to. We had support to make sure it was the right fit, and they even let us do a week long trial foster period. Canines With a Cause very clearly wanted to better our home life and give us the companion we wanted. They included his collar, crate, vaccines, and a microchip for Darwin, which we were very grateful for! I have since recommended people to CWAC and will continue to do so!

With the passing of our 2 canines Poke 2009  & Acacia Embers 2011, that we had adopted in CA, our family was not complete without the occasion bark, wag and paws on our laps, or going places as a family, camping and walking with our canine children, drawing others attention and praise. PetFinders led us to Hank aka the Hank'ster, which brought us in touch with Canines With A Cause, adoption went smoothly and there was more laughter in our home once again...Hank a 3-4 month old Border Collie who had his own medical challenges in his young life.  CWAC helped us with his treatment and CWAC since became part of our Family as well.  I will not throw out any names as Buddy another BC rescued by CWAC came into our home to be Fostered until AD Journey, returned from Dog Trials in So.CA., where our family are from...and upon AD's return, Buddy had bonded so well with Hank, it was decided Buddy belonged here...and over 18 months later they remain close as Brothers. https://www.facebook.com/hank.n.buddy and http://hankpokewilliamsjr.blogspot.com/ Now our family including 2 Felines and a Cockatiel are very happy, well our Felines (George & Janome) have another opinion, as in keeping a low profile, being quiet and watching from above....that is from the top of our TV cabinet.  Hank n Buddy are very quiet, well behaving, lovable, love to play, ignore the Felines and love being with family...we could not ask for more, other than if we can only do more for CWAC and their Mission, as a family.  And we offer to foster other CWAC rescues if needed.

Canines With a Cause	186827		/users/profile/243834	Christina64	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2013	I have had the privilege of knowing the Canines with a Cause team since the concepting phase for this amazing not-for-profit organization. I am continually at awe by the dedication and service this team provides to Military Veterans as well as well deserving shelter animals. The concept of  this pairing is so logical and natural. The execution takes a loving and diligent team willing to make continual sacrifices on behalf of this program. To date 165+ animals have been placed in loving homes. This not only means that 165+ shelter animals have been saved from a life of total uncertainty, it also means that 165+ loving families have been given the gift of unconditional love and companionship. The time and financial resources necessary to make these connections happen are a necessary part of the equation - but the return makes every minute and dollar spent well worth it. BRAVO Canines With A Cause for your diligent work serving both the shelter animal community as well as the Military Veterans community. You are an incredible group!

I have been working with shelter dogs and veterans closely.  It is awesome to see how dogs can change a veterans life.  I constantly point our to our participants any change I see in their own personality.  I see a lot of smiles when thing go well.  This is a great organization that I am happy to work for.
Canines With a Cause	142341		/users/profile/188806	shancicc	Volunteer	5	11/24/2012	I used to train Seeing Eye dogs for the blind in NJ.  I did this for 15 years.  I loved the whole process of matching the right dog to the right person.  Then, watching them blossom into a team was amazing to watch.  The hard work I put into training a dog for a blind person and then watching what I did for someone was VERY rewarding.  Because of my husband's job, I moved here to Utah and got involved with CWAC because of a good friend of mine.  This program helps to match veterans with PTSD with the perfect dog that they themselves, through the expertise of a head trainer, will take classes to learn how to train there own service dog.  Being involved with this whole process brings me back to my days working for The Seeing Eye.  I feel the same reward for taking a shelter dog and matching them to a veteran who can change their life forever.

Canines With a Cause	166023		/users/profile/73370	Julie	Board Member	5	08/23/2013	For years, I appreciated the work Cathy King and Canines with a Cause did . . . every rescue saved two lives.  But, in addition to saving animals from shelters and giving veterans companions, Cathy was generous with her time.  On numerous occasions she came to my classroom to help my eighth and ninth grade students understand that animals matter.  Cathy taught my children how to write letters to legislators and about sustainable rescue. Then, on July 9th, Cathy called me.  A few months earlier, I lost a sweet senior poodle.  She told me about Timmy.  Timmy spent most of his life helping a veteran with PTSD.  When his veteran could no longer care for him, Cathy asked if he could stay with me. Almost 15-years-old, without teeth, hard-of-hearing, unable to see very well and little wobbly, Timmy moved into my home.  His big heart, gentle spirit, lopsided ears and sweet appreciation for everything re-taught me how to love. A month later, I accepted a position on the Board for Canines with a Cause.  CWAC makes a difference.

I often considered returning him, and giving up being his forever home. His name is Romeo. He saved my life. Keeping him was like deciding to live. Suicide was no longer an option. I needed him. He needed me. We toughed it out. Now we are better friends then I could have ever imagined. I thank CWAC for saving Romeo from a shelter, and indirectly saving me from suicide.  
Canines With a Cause	165736		/users/profile/220238	Kati4	Donor	5	08/21/2013	I have a hard time writing or talking about this wonderful organization with out a tear in my eye.  It comes straight from my heart I LOVE this organization and putting it very straight forward this organization saves lives.  I have always felt we do not do enough to edecate people about dogs, so they don't end up in shelters or pounds.  And I feel we owe more to our veterans, who give so much for us as a nation. CWAC SAVES LIVES. The first life it saves is that of shelter dog, who does not understand where they are or why they are there.  The second life it saves is that of the brave solider coming back from war who has fought for our country, our freedom, our rights.  Cathy, Shawn and all the volunteers, fosters, donors, work selfless to match dogs with veterans, so they can both sleep peaceful at night.  CWAC has spread the word that we can all work together to make a win/win situation.  Cathy has spoke to church groups, businesses, government agencies, attends conferences, lobbies on capital hill for animal rights and veterans rights.  This orgainzation deserves to be spot lighted and known to everyone - it shows we can help... one dog and one solider at a time turns into many.

The difference between the Dogs and Veterans once they start to work together on training is a wonderful site to behold !!!

I love helping Canines With a Cause save dogs on death row in shelters and place them with Veterans who have PTSD and need help putting their lives back.  The dog training program really helps to make sure the Veteran and the Dog get the help to be able to stay together as a family.  The Veterans love their dogs so much and in turn, the dogs love them.  It is a match made in Heaven!

These men and women serve our country and return often so emotionally damaged. To see a sweet dog, rescued from the pound, trained by CWC volunteerrs who are professional trainers, and given to a Veteran, to ease their anxiety levels, and know they have a companion who loves them is just beautiful!

Canines With a Cause	144003		/users/profile/190499	Walt M.	General Member of the Public	5	11/28/2012	This is to add more information to what my friend, Myron Peterson, had to say. I'm a Certified Peer Support Specialist, CPSS. I have talked to Canines With a Cause, and what they have to offer is much more. I have refered Vets there from the SLC, Utah VA Hospital. What doesn't get mentioned as their stories are being told, is that their services are free. They will find the right dog to match your needs, free, help you with the needed training for them to be a Service Dog, free, and depending on your circumstances, help you with other needs. Canines With a Cause needs to be made a Cause that everyone is aware of, be they Vet or cilvilian. If it hadn't been for Myron, I would still not know where to send Vets that really could use help with their MH issues. So one and all. tell everyone about them so that they are aware of the services available, be it friends, Doctor's, Therapist, or whoever. It's a much needed Service, and I greatly appreciate everything they are accomplishing.

My brother is a Captain in the Army, so the helping of veterans is a personal passion of mine as well.  Our veterans are returning home with many personal issues and changes in their lives.

Canines With a Cause	143669	1	/users/profile/190141	Myron P.	Client Served	5	11/28/2012	When I was referred  to Cath King's organization, Canines with a Cause (CWAC), I was looking for a dog which would help me cope with my PTSD.  I have suffered from severe PTSD symptoms and knew that animals provide many helpful things to vets like me.  Also, I did already have a dog named Timmy who is 14 years old and showing signs of deteriorating health and was losing his zest for life.  Aware that he was likely to pass away in the near future, I feared that losing his companionship while living alone would be a devastating change.  I felt that if I had another companion that I have bonded with, That event would be less painful.  Also, there was a chance that bringing a new young dog into Timmy's life could bring to him new vitality. I was referred to Cathy by my Equine Therapist Dr. Laurie Sullivan-Sakaeda when I asked her if she knew how I could obtain a PTSD certified service dog.  Cathy And I spoke about my needs abd the needs of Timmy--my loyalty to Timmy gave him veto power over the choice of a dog.  She already gad a dog in mind. Unfortunately,  the fiest choice was not successful because the puppy's size and energy bewildered Timmy.  It was decided that a small breed and slightly older and calmer dog was necessary.   Then came Puck, as he is now named.  They were introduced to each other in a large quiet room and allowed to interract.  It seemed the match might be a success.

When his personality revealed itself as he felt safe, I gave him the name Puck from Shakespeare's misunderstood and mischievous character from one of his plays. I actually find those personalty traits in him endearing.  It gives me plenty of opportunities ti observe, write about, and photograph his odd behaviors.  It seems he is revealing something new almost daily. The relationship with Timmy is definitely beneficial.   Timmy seems to always be happy and more engaged now.  He has resumed some of the puppy-like behaviors he used to have (some not mentionable in polite company).

Unemployed from my elementary school after a combined 9 years in mid February, 2013 I have been registered with state and church employment centers. Upon invitation and attending an overview meeting at People-Helping-People, I knew this resource was the best fit for me. They have many workshops that have helped me to understand the dynamics of my barriers and how I can create action plans to overcome those barriers. The coaching and mentoring programs help individual clients to know how much is needed in wages to break even, identifying hard and soft skills through a personal history and resume building. The volunteer mentors and coaches genuinely care for all clients to facilitate growth and hope. The programs offered along with Junior League give incentive for unemployed and employed women to receive a complete outfit or additional outfits for their working wardrobe to help make a great impression for the first interview or career advancement. I have learned how some of my behaviors regarding employment have slowed my success. With acknowledgement of those ineffective behaviors with support of the organization and caring volunteers, and administration I feel more empowered to create a better life for my family. My skills and educational degrees in elementary education and special education are being professionally showcased through resume building. My confidence has increased tremendously so that I will succeed in obtaining the dream job that I have worked so hard for the last ten years. My passion to teach visually impaired children has been realized by being accepted to the U of U Special Education department for visual impairment endorsement program. The hopeful reality of my dreams coming true are met with wonderful coaches and mentors. This organization empowers many women and they make a difference in our lives and our families. Thank goodness for a resource that custom fits to it's clients. I'm grateful to be part of an organization that is determined to make a difference.

I feel that the program workshops and training has helped prepare me to better utilize my talents and skills and sell myself to employers. I found out what skills I have that I had discounted or didn't even thought I had.  I would recommend this training to other people. I even referred my son to help him when he lost his job and encouraged him to find out what programs he could use to go back to school.

I has taught me many different things. They help me with my job search. They have been a shoulder to cry on. Very caring people. I' glad they are here. They are very giving.
People Helping People Inc	211206	1	/users/profile/274100	jh0920	Volunteer	5	08/19/2014	I have been a volunteer coach and mentor with PHP for almost two years.  Every time I meet a client or volunteer I am amazed at how well-tuned this organization is.  As someone who does research for a living, I stand by my decision that this is one of the best tools for people working toward bettering themselves.  PHP truly cares about the long-term success of its clients! 
People Helping People Inc	210970	2	/users/profile/273792	laurie.woodland	Client Served	5	08/17/2014	I was laid off in January of 2014 and learned about People Helping People at a job fair.  Their Program Structure has four phases: 1 - Employment Preparation, 2 - Mentoring, 3-Participation in an Employment Strategies Network, and Phase 4 - Membership to the Women's Professional Network.    This program is to help with not only finding a job, but  also providing skills to keep a job and grow your career.  I recommend it for any job seeker  needing support during their job search  or  anyone who has a job but wants to get a better job.   The tools, training, workshops, networking opportunities, coaching, and mentoring are just some of the benefits of the program.  I also enjoyed making new friends along the way.   PHP's contact number is 801-583-5300, www.phputah.org. 
People Helping People Inc	210737	1	/users/profile/273527	Tekoa	Donor	5	08/14/2014	As a former volunteer for People Helping People, I was able to witness first-hand the tremendous impact they have on their clients as well as the community.  I hope to volunteer again in the future when time permits since I really believe in their mission.  Not only do the participants become better educated, more self-sufficient, and confident, the community as a whole benefits when these individuals no longer rely on public assistance and consume these scarce resources.   It is so rewarding to see people become empowered and stronger and People Helping People truly helps accomplish this for so many!
People Helping People Inc	210734		/users/profile/273523	cmills42	Volunteer	5	08/14/2014	I have been volunteering with People Helping People for the last three years and I am as enthusiastic now about what they do for single moms and others who wish to better their lives through better employment as I was when I started.  What they learn through People Helping People is how to look for, prepare for, and get and keep great jobs that turn into careers which help move them out of poverty and into self-reliance. The clients experience a tremendous increase in confidence and self-esteem and many say that they finally feel a great sense of worthiness that was missing prior to starting the program. The organization is well established having started over 20 years ago so they really know their stuff. The program consistently produces outstanding results for the clients as long as they are willing to do the work. The leaders, mentors and other volunteers are truly caring and dedicated individuals who really want to see every client succeed and are willing to do whatever they need to to make sure that the clients are successful.

I also see they help people not only to get a job, but teach how to get promotions to help the company along. They are very positive to be around. 
People Helping People Inc	210662	1	/users/profile/273445	cheryl1964	Client Served	5	08/14/2014	I came into this program a few weeks ago. I was let go from my job when management discovered I had applied outside the company for another position. I came to PHP with very few resources for job hunting, as I had never done that online before.  I now have many resources available to me and if PHP doesn't have the resources to help me with certain problems, they direct me to who can. I have a new resume and so much more knowledge about my current position of unemployed than I would have had without their help. I am so much more empowered and effective in my job search than I would be otherwise. Job hunting can be tough on the ego, constant rejection takes it toll, even if you try not to take it personally. The encouragement to keep going is paramount to me, I don't feel like I am so alone out there. I love the Wednesday groups and workshops, as it keeps my spirits up and gives me useful information. I am nervous about interviewing, it has been many years since I have done that. However, I know that PHP will be there when the time comes, ready to help me with that process as well. They have offered resources in the area of attire proper for interviewing and mock interview to help me gloss over my termination. (Another area of concern for me during interviewing.) I cannot say what this program has done for me already, in the form of support and not feeling so lost in this world of technological job searching.  I cannot believe the support of the volunteers and the contributions to help provide our workshop materials. Again, it is invaluable to me that I have this support and caring staff to help direct me through this. Starting over can be difficult at any age, but at age 50, this support is priceless to me. I would be so lost in this new technology without this help! I think I would also be very discouraged without my cheerleaders at PHP, they make me feel like I can do anything. I am very encouraged and proactive about job searching and I know I will find just the right job for me soon. If nothing else, I DO know that PHP will be there for me, helping me with whatever barriers are in my way. I love that this program exists to help those like myself with our dreams and goals. We all count and we all deserve to feel successful. Thanks to PHP, although I am unemployed, I am hopeful for my future.  Of all the resources PHP has guided me to, hope has to be the most important one.  I love People Helping People and hope to be able to volunteer and give back to this wonderful organization which is priceless to me right now.   (Although I filled this out for the SLC, UT organization, I participate up in Ogden, at Cottages of Hope.)  I

Unemployed from my elementary school after a combined 9 years in mid February, 2013 I have been registered with state and church employment centers. Upon invitation and attending an overview meeting at People-Helping-People, I knew this resource was the best fit for me. They have many workshops that have helped me to understand the dynamics of my barriers and how I can create action plans to overcome those barriers. The coaching and mentoring programs help individual clients to know how much is needed in wages to break even, identifying hard and soft skills through a personal history and resume building. The volunteer mentors and coaches genuinely care for all clients to facilitate growth and hope. The programs offered along with Junior League give incentive for unemployed and employed women to receive a complete outfit or additional outfits for their working wardrobe to help make a great impression for the first interview or career advancement. I have learned how some of my behaviors regarding employment have slowed my success. With acknowledgement of those ineffective behaviors with support of the organization and caring volunteers, and administration I feel more empowered to create a better life for my family. My skills and educational degrees in elementary education and special education are being professionally showcased through resume building. My confidence has increased tremendously so that I will succeed in obtaining the dream job that I have worked so hard for the last ten years. My passion to teach visually impaired children has been realized by being accepted to the U of U Special Education department for visual impairment endorsement program. The hopeful reality of my dreams coming true are met with wonderful coaches and mentors. This organization empowers many women and they make a difference in our lives and our families. Thank goodness for a resource that custom fits to it's clients. I'm grateful to be part of an organization that is determined to make a difference.

Here at Discover Financial Services we fit that profile.  Because we offer full-time employment with full benefits available and 4 weeks paid time off per year, we are a great option for those re-entering the workforce.

I love the difference they make in so many people's lives. They are very good at breaking the cycles of poverty by teaching women how to earn a living wage. The thing that I love most is that they help them by teaching them how to change their own situation rather than just giving them handouts that eventually go away. They teach their clients how to change from the inside out which is where it really counts.

As a college professor, I have had the opportunity to work with a number of organizations in the area, and PHP is one of the very best organizations with which I have had the opportunity to associate.  I believe in its mission of helping single mothers as they seek gainful employment so that they can be self-sufficient members of the community.  The organization helps clients  identify the skills sets they have to offer employers, and provides comprehensive training through volunteers who are successful professionals.  No one could do a better job for this organization than Marva Sadler who coordinates the program in Ogden. Marva is amazing in her interactions with the clients and the volunteers.  I love volunteering my time because I know that it is a worthwhile cause, I love working with the clients, and I love my association with Marva.   I've been volunteering for 6 months now, and I don't plan to stop.  It's just a marvelous experience seeing the clients become more confident in their skills as they pursue their chosen careers. PHP is the best!

I now valued myself  I have a new appreciation regarding my self worth.  I know I have many skills  and they continue to bring out the best in me.  I had many barriers to employment.  They have helped me to help myself to break through many of them.  Including, making me realize I should continue on my quest to get my college degree.   I will complete my last class toward getting a college degree by December 2013.   I had lost site of my goals and visions.  I had lost site of ever being able to get a job that valued all of my skills and employement experience.  People helping people have helped me get back on track so that I will successfully be employed. There are so many people looking for work today, but people helping people is a strong organization with strength that helps motivate it clients to realize that we will be in the number of employable people.  Kayleen, Marva and all of the amazing staff of women who work in this organization work hard at helping Single Mothers to achieve their dreams, to reach higher, to be stronger, to not give up. People helping People staff are always available to help just pick up the phone and call them if they are not available when you call I can tell you they will call back as soon as possible to make sure that whatever it is that you need they have an answer for you.   Be strong they say,  just have a plan and stick with it they say,  you can do it they say,  just take one level at a time.

People Helping People Inc	183430	1	/users/profile/240342	Laurie51	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I volunteer at people-helping-people.  The organizaton helps single woman and their families get back on their feet and out of poverty.   Women gain confidence to re-enter the workforce after losing a job or being left by their husband.  They should make all women volunteer (including the young) so they realize the negative consequences of quitting their job or studies to raise a family.  The organization teaches clients how to change their way of thinking, how much they need to earn, how to write a resume, how to interview, and how to land a job.  I think it is a worthwhile organization and needed in our community.  We even had a male client and it helped him too!

Helping women succeed in the workplace is an important goal for Utah! This not only help women financially, but it also increases their self-esteem and helps them realize their potential. I have grown immensely by participating in the program as a Volunteer in Service to America (VISTA).

People Helping People Inc	183388		/users/profile/240299	JLVolunteer	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I began volunteering with PHP in 2003.  In October 2013, I began taking a short leave of absence. I had been looking for an opportunity where, as a working professional woman, I could mentor others as I have been mentored.  An important component of mentoring is to help another individual identify their abilities and let that be the first stepping stone for them to build on; followed by an increase in their self-esteem and new courage and abilities to promote themselves to others. It has been interesting sitting down with a young mother in a hard skills coaching session hearing how the client has always been told they do not have the ability or skills to offer a 'real' business; yet by the end of the session, discovering you are sitting with the apartment manager for the ex-husband's and his parents' family owned business.  Or going through the routine office equipment and computer application section for a low paid, part-time office staffer and discover the client has Microsoft Access skills, design and analysis abilities that exceed those of many professional business analysts and IT professionals. PHP brings us together (mentor, client) in a one-of-a-kind, structured setting that allows this type of discover, the first step on the first stone.

People Helping People Inc	183306		/users/profile/240218	Kelly105	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I am currently volunteering at People Helping People through the Americorps program. I chose to apply at PHP from the list of great organizations offered because of the mission statement: to reduce the number of children living in poverty by helping single mothers learn to earn a living wage. I loved the idea and after 9 months of volunteering here, I can see just how important a program like this is for the community.  Many of the women PHP helps are single mothers. Many are also women who used to stay at home with their kids, but now their kids have grown up, or the woman has gotten a divorce and now needs to be the breadwinner. For these women, entering a workforce they haven't participated in for several years if ever can be incredibly intimidating. Right from the start, PHP helps women realize just how many skills they have used throughout their life, either in the workforce or at home, and how they can present those skills to an employer. Since the entire program is taught from the employer's perspective, it teaches women about the rules and behind the scene processes of landing a job, remaining employed, and then moving up at work and earning raises. And PHP has parts of the program that are there for women at each step of that transition from low-income to finally earning enough to completely support her family. I have witnessed first hand the renewed confidence of many of the women who go through the program. People Helping People greatly benefits the women who come through the door, their children and families, and the entire community.  So come check it out! If nothing else, you'll meet some amazing volunteers! (Seriously, our volunteers are awesome. Come meet them.)

On our last Awards Night at the end of June, as a client received her progress award, she spilt tears because she was so happy to feel part of a wonderful network of women. She shared that PHP has provided her with a sense of self that therapy was no longer doing, primarily because she decided to apply the employment tools that we teach and has become successfully employed in a job she loves. I've been doing this for six months, and THAT'S when it hit me: "I am one lucky woman to work with such a dedicated, helpful group of businesswomen --truly people helping people!"

I started out as a volunteer and soon received just as much benefit from the program as the clients I was mentoring.  In my first year as a volunteer, I received three promotions at work due to the knowledge I had gained through the workshops. Now, as a board member, I have the opportunity to share my experiences with larger groups by facilitating workshops, mentoring, and coaching. It just feels good to know that I can make a difference in a child's life by helping their mother learn to earn a living wage.

SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	116749		/users/profile/158910	skiss777	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	On September 29, 2009 I unexpectedly lost my husband and my daughter lost her father exactly 1 month after her 3rd birthday. We soon learned that Wayne had an undiagnosed genetic heart condition called Long QT Syndrome.  Since losing him, our family has learned that other family members have Long QT as well, including our daughter, Lily.  And, sadly, we learned that Wayne's death was preventable.  We are so fortunate to be connected with the SADS Foundation, as they have been a compassionate source of support and expertise in the field of genetic heart arrhythmia syndromes.  Not only do I feel comfortable with the information they give us, but I feel like I have understanding friends to whom I can simply talk to when in sorrow or fear.  As a way to give back and further advance their efforts, I've chosen to volunteer on behalf of the  Foundation. Each year we host a celebration of life in Wayne's memory in an effort to raise critical funding and awareness for Long QT Syndrome and other SADS conditions.  These events have been a tremendous source of personal healing, as well as raising significant funding & awareness.  My life & the way I've dealt with the loss of my husband is dramatically different in a positive way as a result of the SADS Foundation and their incredible staff.

They are dedicated to educating people about the dangers of SADS related conditions.  More importantly, they provide encouragement and comfort to parents that have had to endure the loss of a child due to a SADS related syndrome.  My father passed away at age 33 from a SADS related problem and I lost a sister in 1897 to the same malady.  Nothing is worse than a premature death and a life cut short, especially when it may have been detected and potentially prevented.

Client Served	5	06/29/2012	I am writing to you as an advocate for  and perhaps the #1 greatest fan of  the SADS Foundation.  This organization has truly impacted my life, and I cannot imagine how I would have coped with the trauma that I have over the last six months without them.  In June 2011, my then 13-month old son, Lee, was diagnosed with Long QT 8 / Timothy Syndrome.  This diagnosis is one of the more rare conditions that the SADS Foundation provides support and education for  and was obviously extraordinarily devastating news for us to receive.  The prognosis for Lees condition is not good, but already with the constant love and support from the SADS Foundation, we are doing everything possible to ensure a happy and healthy life for this amazing little boy.  The day I found out about my sons diagnosis was a day I will never forget.  Feeling as if I just had the air knocked out of me, I knew our lives had just changed in more ways than I could comprehend.  I felt incredibly alone, and had no earthly idea how my husband or I would be able to handle this news.  It was only after talking to the SADS Foundation that I finally felt like we werent alone, and that there really are people out there who understand what we were going through.  Alice Lara and Laura Wall were like guiding angels  calming my fears and walking me through what Lees diagnosis may likely mean for our family.  I could not have imagined going through those first days  and the last many months  without them.  They have gone above and beyond to provide me  and Lee  with resources, contacts for some of the worlds most well respected professionals in the field, and networks of other families and parents. I have volunteered with, and donated to countless non-profit organizations and foundations in my life, and I truly must to say the SADS Foundation is one of the most professional groups Ive ever come across.  Not only are they professional, but they also take the time to get to know each and every family and do their very best to get them the support and attention they need.  In the short time that weve been dealing with our sons diagnosis, my family (including extended family and friends) has helped raise over $5,000 for the SADS Foundation.  I feel 100% confident that this money will continue to help the SADS Foundation support other families like mine and also help bring awareness to the frightening Sudden Arrthymia Death Syndrome.  I know for certain that I am one of thousands of people who will make the same statements of appreciation for this incredible organization.  All the families I know who have been affected by a SADS condition have made a commitment to support the SADS Foundation in any way possible, and I can confidently say that I will be a supporter  and a fan  for life.

Because long qt is such a rare disorder there was little support for those afflicted.  While searching the internet we came across the SADS website.  We have found that SADS has a wealth of information and reaches out to those who suffer a loss such as ours.  We have also attended some of their conferences and have learned so much from their knowledgeable experts.  We feel SADS is such a valuable organization and have held an annual fundraiser with proceeds going to them since 2006 to help raise awareness.  Our fundraiser is called Christie's Heartoberfest.  We have rasied over $100,000 for SADS and will continue to do so in the future.

Volunteer	5	06/28/2012	I became involved, as a volunteer, with the SADS Foundation in 2005, following my sister's death.  I know first-hand how devastating sudden cardiac death is for a family, and the frustrations of being unaware of warning signs.  SADS goal to spread awareness for diseases like Long QT, that killed my sister and with which several members of my family and myself are affected, is also a lifelong mission of mine.  Alice, Laura, and the whole team at SADS have made volunteers feel like part of the family, and given us a chance to help make a difference in a fight that is so close to our hearts.

They had been there before we knew it by supporting research into our condition.  They had educational resources that let us understand our condition better.  They had forms to use for school and other care givers. They helped us work through the insurance issues of genetic testing that our insurer would not agree to fund at first.  Later, when my daughter had to have an ICD implanted for this condition, the contacts helped us develop kept us calm and supported us through the surgery.  I am very grateful for SADS.

It wasn't until he was about 24 he was finally diagnosed.  Then we found out about the SADS foundation and was overwhelmed with a wealth of information.  Since that time, I have done all I can as a volunteer to help and get information out to as many people as I can.  
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	116856	1	/users/profile/159032	rvines	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	When my son passed away from fainting spells that went undiagnosed by specialist after specialist, it was only after his death that we learned of www.SADS.org. They were kind enough to respond to our need for answers as to WHY he passed away. They referred us to doctors who reviewed my sons medical records gratis and confirmed that he was afflicted with SADS, and that if he had been diagnosed correctly he would still be alive today. Because their wonderful responsive team was able to help us so much to find closure, our family has joined the cause as volunteers to help spread the word throughout the medical and acedemic community, to educate, inform, and help to save others lives. We take great joy in knowing that we are helping to support them in saving others from this horrible life taking affliction.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	116832	1	/users/profile/159005	Tracy22	Client Served	5	06/27/2012	I first became aware of the SADS organization almost 3 years ago now. My daughter, Morgan, then 12 years old, had a syncope episode that landed her a trip to the emergency room where it was discovered she may have Long QT. Thankfully, there was someone that quickly referred me to the SADS organization. To say they changed my life, and that of my daughter, would be an understatement. At a time in my life when I felt so incredibly lost and scared, SADS was right there with me to offer support, a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, resources, referrals and so much more. SADS has connected us with other families, living with SADS conditions that I've gleaned support and encouragement from.  Day or night, the middle of the night, the early morning, it didn't matter. The SADS organization was there for me. They always answered their phones, promptly returned phone calls, answered e-mails and even gave me their own personal cell phone numbers in case I needed anything. I never once felt like I was an inconvenience or wasn't cared for. SADS has stuck by me, daily sometimes, for the last 3 years. As we are still seeking help for Morgan, SADS continues to stand by me. They have been there through my tears, trips to the hospital, and the happy times as well. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of the SADS staff when they took time out to meet with Morgan and I while visiting our area. Just recently, the SADS organization put me in contact with an AED machine company. The church my daughter and I attend wanted to purchase an AED but didn't have the funds to do so. Ms. Laura Wall from SADS connected me with a wonderful company that donated an AED machine to our church. It's comforting to know that we have that resource not only just for Morgan, but others. As we still seek answers to Morgan's condition, I know without a doubt that SADS will be right there with us. My children and I are so passionate about this organization that we spread the word every where we go. We've both done school projects on SADS, made speeches, passed out material and raised awareness to the best of our ability. We are currently working on a fundraising project in our town, with all the donations going to SADS. There are so many wonderful things that I could say about the SADS organization and use every opportunity possible to do so. I will always, with passion, work to spread their cause, raise awareness and do all I can to help them in their endeavor to save lives. I have already had the opportunity to refer others, going through scary situations with themselves for their children, to SADS. This organization, will without a doubt, always have my heart. As they have stood by me, so I too will always stand by them as well as the lives they touch.  
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	116780		/users/profile/158945	Kelly39	Client Served	5	06/27/2012	I have been diagnosed with a Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome called LQTS. I had to have a defibrillator implanted in January 2010 when I fainted for the third time in 10 years. Twenty-three months later, the defibrillator saved my life when my heart would not beat correctly. I was actually shocked 40 times that night until medicines kicked in and the defibrillator was able to pace my heart. I also had a younger sister who died in her sleep at the age of 18 in January 1990. She apparently had a SADS condition that was undiagnosed since she didn't have any symptoms, such as the fainting I had. The SADS Foundation has been a wonderful source of information. If I have any questions, someone always e-mails me back right away. I know they can put me in contact with people who have stories such as mine. They are trying to get word out about SADS conditions, signs and symptoms of SADS,  ways to save children's lives, having AEDs in public places, learning CPR, and finding the causes for SADS conditions and genetic testing. They keep up with the latest news on all of these subjects and keep in touch with the national and international experts in this field. They have also set up an emergency system to use when they are  told about a child or young adult who may have died due to a SADS. They try reach the medical examiner involved, offer support and advice to the family, they help the family get genetic testing, get information and support out to the friends and community, also. I keep thinking it may have helped my family back when my sister died if we had those services available to us.  This is a absolutely wonderful Child and Family Non-profit that I support 110%.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	116729		/users/profile/158887	Dan Alatorre	Volunteer	5	06/27/2012	I run a website with over 550 members; most of them are parents whose children have a rare and potentially fatal heart condition called Long QT Syndrome. The people at SADS have been a key element in helping parents find resources, given guidence, assisted in working with insurance companies, helped people find doctors - the list goes on an on. They have even helped our members get questions answered by some of the top doctors in the field, on video, which we can play on the site. They have gone above and beyond my wildest expectations. I can truly say without reservation many, many families have greatly benefitted from their help.

SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	71341		/users/profile/78010	Mark C.	Client Served	5	02/19/2011	In 1975 my ten year old brother began to faint at odd times.  He would faint while we were all playing monopoly, he would faint when playing with the dog, he would faint when he got excited.  In short, he fainted and we knew nothing about why he was doing it.  He always woke up. Then, he started fainting and not waking up.  Aid cars were called.  We discovered that his heart was going into something valled ventricular fibrillation.  He was defibrillated on a trip to Children's Hospital in Seattle. At the hospital he was fainting when he was in the hospital bed.  Wires were hooked up to him and they were checking his hear.  They could see that his heart was doing weird stuff -- ventricular fibrillation -- but they could not tell us why. The cardiologist hooked up an external pacemaker and my brother stabilized.  But, the doctors did not know why he was having these problems.  Finally, a resident came in with an article describing a newly discovered genetic problem called Romano-Ward syndrome that was associated with Long QT. The cardiologist measured my brother's QT interval -- he actually used calipers -- and found a long QT. The doctor inserted a pacemaker -- it went into my brother's abdomen because it was quite large -- and sent us all home. But, our journey with Long QT was just starting.  We were asked to all have ECGs and it was discovered that My dad, my sister and my new little brother -- less than a year old-- and myself all had Long QT. Not much was know about the disease -- it was 1975 -- and we were told to watch for fainting.  None of us had fainted except my brother and my dad had spent 21 years in the navy and served in Vietnam for a few years and even had a Purple Heart! The doctors and our family reasoned that the rest of us would be OK.  We were the first Long QT family the hospital had ever seen. They were wrong but we would not know this for another 18 years. In that time frame I climbed Mt Rainier, became a volunteer fire fighter- even taught advanced first aid and CPR -- and even responded to a call for help at Husky Stadium where I did CPR on an elderly man and rode in the aid car doing CPR because the crew was short handed.  What an adrenaline rush! I had lots more adrenaline rushes as I went into burning buildings, responded to aid calls, learned how to autocross -- a form of sanctioned car racing where you go through cones -- and did a lot of great things as a young adult. In 1979 I went to college.  My sister followed about a year later (I had graduated from High School in 1975 and went to college in 1979) and my sister had a great start to her college career until she started fainting. She ended up getting a defibrillator inserted in 1981 or 1982 and the doctors started to think there was more to this Long QT thing. We were asked to be part of a genetic study so that researchers could try and locate the gene causing our problem.  Other people were being identified at Children's and Long QT was getting some attention.  Teenagers had been dying unexpectedly and autopsies were not showing doctors why these otherwise normal children were dying.   The common thread was unexpected fainting. I was married in 1982 and we had a daughter in 1984.  Genetic studies were ongoing and researchers had learned about a mutation that resulted in a "potassium ion channel polarization" problem and they labeled us Long QT2.  Tests showed my first daughter did not have the defective gene. We had a second daughter in 1989 and tests showed she had the gene.  Research was progressing and more info was being learned about this disease.  Let's go back to my brother who started all of this -- he was doing great..... and living life even though he had also developed diabetes.  My younger brother, also diabetic was also doing great and was being seen regularly at Children's.  Both brothers had been put on a drug for Long QT -- a form of beta blocker. So, we fast forward to 1993, my brothers, sister, dad, and youngest daughter are doing great.  My daughter is five years old and taking nadolol -- a beta blocker -- and she is doing fine.  Research showed that Long QT affects young people between the ages of 13 and 20 the most and sudden death occurs unexpectedly. My youngest brother was 18, getting ready to graduste from High school, driving into a park with his girl friend when he saw a car/motorcycle accident.  He started to get out of the car to go help out at the scene and collapsed.  He had fainted. Nobody did CPR, Aid car came and took him to Children's, the aid crew defibrillated him and got him back on the way to the hospital.  At the hospital my brother's heart remained stable but he had gone into a coma. We learned that the lack of CPR and the ventricular fibrillation had caused his brain to go without oxygen for a period of time.  He was placed on a ventilator and tests were done.  We learned that his brain had died.  My little brother was declared dead. We were all devastated.  How could this have happened?  Was this Long QT thing this real and this dangerous?  The only good thing to happen was that my brother was able to be an organ donor and I believe he helped about a dozen people. Eighteen months later the Washington State Patrol found my next youngest brother dead in his truck on the side of the road.  We believe he felt something starting and was able to pull over.  Our family had lost two young people to Long QT.  Sudden death by Long QT was real! My sister -- the only one of us to have a defibrillator -- had several attacks and been automatically defibrillated and continued living. I did not have a defibrillator, my dad and daughter also were unprotected.  My daughter continued to take beta blockers and be checked every six months on a treadmill to see if the beta blocker was working. in 2001 my dad got a defibrillator.  In 2002 my daughter got a defibrillator and I got mine a year later.  We have all had them replaced but my daughter has had four surgeries to replace defective leads, a recalled defibrillator and survived long QT with no problems until December of 2010 when she woke from a bad dream and had a cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation. Her defibrillator saved her life.  At the ER, she had texted me and said she was Ok but in the hospital, my electro physiologist checked her out, got her permission to call me and flatly said "this would be a different story if she did not have a defibrillator." My daughter came to brunch at my place and has almost recovered from the trauma of her cardiac arrest.  She has had some anxiety attacks -- who wouldn't? -- and is doing great. This is a long story but has a summary.  Research into Long QT has saved lives.  The SADS organization has learned that proper care with beta blockers, defibrillators and education saves lives.  While our family has lost two young people to this disease we were also a family that started a long history of research. The SADS organization does great work and should be supported. 
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	70759		/users/profile/77346	Bill L.	Volunteer	5	02/18/2011	Why we do it?In 1994, while visiting Disneyland, my wife Sally collapsed and for the next 28 minutes she was without her own working heart and lungs. I called 9-11 and managed to give her CPR for the next 17 minutes until the paramedics arrived and transported her to the ER. All the while, our two young daughters had to watch the whole event unfold in front of them. At the ER, the doctors were able to get her heart restarted in the 28th minute. Sally remained in a coma for the next 3 days.  They said she wouldn't make it through the night and gave her a 10% chance of surviving. We almost lost her 3 more times that first night, but she kept hanging on. She was transferred to UC Irvine and had a cardiac defibrillator implanted. Five weeks later she finally went home. Sally has spent years undergoing therapy for her brain injury (due to lack of oxygen during her collapse).Sally has "Long QT Syndrome". Ever since this tragic event unfolded, we have become involved with the SADS Foundation: doing any and everything we can to help.Thank You, Bill Layton

Of course the first thing we wanted was answers. That is when I stubble across the SADS Foundations web site. They had so much information and also mailed me information as well. They have been great supporters over the years; as we have found out my brother, his children, myself, and my children also have this scary syndrome.  We are lucky to have found out, as many are not as blessed as us. SADS Foundation provides great support for all families affect by SADS conditions. As of last year, we celebrate Caches birthday by helping raise awareness and fundraising so they may help save others from tragedies and support others.

Loma Linda Dr. Marc Platt Chief of cardology at the time studied 3 families who's children had also died suddenly during that time.  Pesticides being used in the community were suspected in my daughters case.  I am very sad that SADD does not address this FACT even though it is very well documented.  Do any of their donations come from CHEMICAL companies.  How many ATHELETS die each year on contaminated Fields.  My daughters case has been documented since 1998. Look up ORGANOPHOSPATES and make your own conclusion.  As for the cause of death of the other children, out of respect for the families I will only comment about my daughters, However I do know my facts are correct.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	70224		/users/profile/76751	mlchallen	Volunteer	5	02/17/2011	In the early '90s, Long QT Syndrome took the lives of two of my uncles. Today my grandpa, aunt, dad and myself live full and normal lives. Though hardly anyone has heard the name, let alone fully understands the potential severity of the condition, Long QT and other SADS conditions are responsible for far too many deaths. On October 10, 2010, I went into cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. Within 15 seconds, my implanted defibrillator detected the rhythm and sent a corrective shock to my heart. It is safe to say that without an ICD and how far research has come, I probably wouldn't be here today. Although I have always understood the condition, it has never been so real to me, nor have I ever been quite as thankful for organizations such as the SADS Foundation, as I am now. The SADS Foundation is full of wonderful people who are striving to continue to spread awareness of SADS conditions. It reminds me that, even through hard times, we need to reach out to others and think outside ourselves.

Hardly anyone knows about arrhythmia conditions, even doctors are astoundingly ignorant.  And people with the condition have only piecemeal information. so when someone is struck down, everyone says, oh, if I had only known, why didn't anyone tell us about this? This small grass-roots organization is the only one I know of that is trying to get the word out, to save lives.  I attended a workshop after I survived a mild attack of arrhthmia and was diagnosed with one of the rarer forms--most people don't live thru it.  I feel like I was spared so I could help my extended family who are now able to take steps to prevent dying from this--but I did not know what to do until SADS laid it all out, how to approach them and what needed to be done.  This is such a hidden danger, and SADS is about the only thing exposing it so we can deal with it.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	44481	10	/users/profile/45375	jennifer48	Volunteer	5	06/18/2010	On April 7, 2009 my life was changed forever. That is the day my 3 yr. old daughter, "George" (Cecilia Kay Balma), just stopped. It was the middle of the afternoon, on a regular day, my 5 yr. old son said George was pretending to be asleep on the kitchen floor. My two other daughters and I went to 'wake George up'. We use to be a very playful family. It only took a second for my oldest daughter and I to realize something was wrong. My 10 yr. old called 911. I held my child and talked to the emergency operator. When we reached the hospital, there was already a priest in her room waiting for us. I didn't look at him. Within seconds my husband was in the room. We watched, helplessly, while the doctors tried to save her life. They were unsuccessful. No one could tell me what happened to my baby. Not 911, not the paramedics, not the doctor or hospital. It took the coroner to diagnose my daughter. Death by Sudden Cardiac Arrest due to an undiagnosed heart condition. I couldn't understand how something like this could happen to my family, to my child. I wanted to know something, anything. The coroner diagnosed my daughter. She had right ventricular displasia, a form of SADS. I couldn't understand why I didn't know and began a downward spiral into a horrible depression. During the days I spent locked in my house I began to research this condition. The more I learned the angrier I became. I started very slow, asking for a small amount of literature at first. The reaction I got from the community has lit a spark. No one knows.I went to the Health Dept., W.I.C, and Medicaid Office. I hung posters in the library, courthouse, and grocery stores. I just kept telling anyone who would listen.I am proud to say that I have a date with the School Board on 6/21 to ask that they change the county wide physical forms. I will never stop telling. My family will never stop telling. SADS helped me find a way to be a mother to my child in Heaven. While I could not save George, together we can save someone else's Angel.

At the time, there was little research and support with regards to my condition and others like it.  I found the SADS Foundation online, and they truly gave me the education and motivation to get through the most difficult time in my life.  Working with them the past 10 years has been extraordinary, especially with witnessing the invaluable gifts they are able to give to heart survivors like myself.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	43899	9	/users/profile/44803	blackartrocks	Client Served	5	06/14/2010	I first learned about the SADS Foundation after my sons death.  Before his unexpected passing last August I had never heard of sudden heart arrhythmia.   One day while at work, feeling helpless, sad and angry, I goggled CVPT, one of the affiliated illnesses.  Of course, there was a good amount of online information to go through.   However, the SADS website was one of the few sites that stayed with me during my many weeks of research.  Their site was not only easy to maneuver and had a very professional appearance; it also had a massive amount of great information, including links taking me to other reputable and related sites.    I absolutely loved the innovation of their Patience & Family Support page, especially the Healing Wall.   It was obvious that everything was very well thought out.  The website was just a small reflection of the great services I received from the organization since my first contact.   A few months ago I made one phone call and the outreach from this organization has been phenomenal.  The encouragement, compassion, and support Ive received verbally and through the actions of the foundations staff has been top notch.   I feel as if they truly understand the difficulty me and my family are experiencing and they are there for us.  I receive a thinking of you phone call or an email at least once a week.   Each contact ends with words of encouragement and inspiration.  Ive also received a call from a member of their board as well as two or three other supportive parents the foundation put in contact with me.   In the short period of time since Ive been in touch with the foundation, they have created a memorial page for my son, send me results of donations directed to his page through weekly reports, and have volunteered to attend a celebration of life event I am having for my son later this summer.  As a result of their support, I have also found a new and important mission while refocusing most of my grief:  working on a way to honor my son by getting out the word regarding SADS as well as this great organization.  I know I would have eventually found a way to work through my grief.  However, I could not have re-focused this level of organized and positive energy to such a wonderful cause if it were not for the support of this organization and its staff.

Shortly thereafter, our other two children were also diagnosed with Long QT.  At that time Dr Vincent, was working tirelessly to make sense of the unexplained deaths that were occurring in young people. Blood samples were sent to Dr Vincent to be added to his research.  It was Dr Vincent who talked with us and gave us comfort that we would find the underlying reason for this condition.  Here we are 19 years later.  Answers and good treatment modalities are here.I have supported the SADS Foundation from the beginning; I have seen it grow from a vision to a reality. SADS works everyday to give support to families and to educate medical providers at all levels.  SADS is a presence at most, if not all, major Cardiology meeting.  SADS continues to work with other specialties, e.g medical examiners, to get the word out about the possibility of this underlying cardiac condition as the cause of unexplained deaths in children and young people and young adults. The work SADS does has saved the lives of many sibling and other family members.

They  work dilligently to educate doctors, schools, and the general public on how to detect warning signs which claims the lives of many adults and youth; particularly young athletes. It's amazing that in this day and age many doctors miss the signs of SADS conditions, because they simply do not know what to look for.

SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	43293	8	/users/profile/44118	hootsb	Volunteer	5	06/08/2010	I have worked with the SADS organization for almost 4 years now.  This will be the 4th event I have done with them.  In the time I have worked with this group, I have seen the organization grow from something smaller to something larger.  This growth has only increased their abilities to do what they say they are going to do.  Raise awareness in the medical communities, educational facilities and around the communities who are impacted by this syndrome.  Getting AED's out to critical places like schools and pools was the initial push, but educating doctors who give sports physicals and cardiologists has also been important.  Harder, but critical to creating the awareness we need to not ignore critical signs.  I have seen the group actively try to lower operating costs and manage the dollars they get as effectively as possible.  I like to see this in Non profits because so many times I see abuse.  Laura and the SADS group are careful on how they spend the dollars they get and if possible get matches and double or triple the dollars they get from the public through matches and grants.  I hope to be involved with this group for some time and are grateful that the time I spend with them increases their ability to raise funds to meet their goals.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	43288	8	/users/profile/44110	anthony10	Client Served	5	06/08/2010	Three year ago we learned our daughter had a serious heart arrhythmia condition called LQTS1.  The SADS Foundation was tremendous and instrumental in providing us with education and knowledge on this condition.  We receive their monthly newsletter keeping us up to date on information.  They are always available to answer any questions we have with a live voice during business hours.  We do not know where we would be without their continuous support and education.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	43247	6	/users/profile/44055	bryan2	Donor	5	06/08/2010	My wife died of Prolonged QT (SADS) in 1998. For the last 3 years I have helped organize a fun run event and donate all proceeds to the SADS Foundation. All of the staff at the SADS Foundation have been very helfpful and provided great support so that we could have a successfull event.
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	43077	6	/users/profile/43847	craig6	Volunteer	5	06/05/2010	We were introduced to SADS after losing our daughter Christie at age 25 in 2005 to sudden arrhythmia death.  We have found them to be helpful, caring, efficient and very supprotive to afmailies who have lost someone and to those that were fortunate enough to survive an arrhythmia episode but now live with the disease;
SADS (Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes) Foundation	43021	6	/users/profile/43788	dianne1	General Member of the Public	5	06/04/2010	I lost my youngest granddaughter on November 22, 2009.  She had been treated for seizures for years.  It was not until one horrible day we found out that her problem was Long QT.  A gene problem that had been passed on from me to my daughter to Abbey.  Our pain is so great we can hardly function.  But because Abbey was such a giving and loving little girl we had to do something.  Laura and all the people a SADS has been great.  We have gotten so much love and support for everyone.  We are always thinking of ways to raise money to better serve the organization and keep Abbey's memory alive.  We are just a few, but that is all it takes.  One small step after another.  Laura sent me a packet of information to deliver to all the surrounding schools.  Awareness if vital.  Everyone must understand how important the work that SADS is doing and support in the smallest of ways.  Small donations are so welcomed.  One person giving $1.00 and spread the word, then another person can give $1.00.  Pretty soon we could raise thousands.  It is that simple.  I am and will always be a strong supporter of SADS Foundation.

Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	316730	2	/users/profile/407947	danefortney	Client Served	5	10/30/2016	This organization has been a great source of support throughout my journey. I am especially comforted by how accessible the people of the foundation are to discuss issues (such as fundraising ideas and resources available). All the people involved seem to be totally invested due to personal experience with the terrible and rare cancer. My son in law and I have bonded through running and fundraising to honor my daughter whom we lost on 11-17-2013. 
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	313516	2	/users/profile/404881	nancydd	Client Served	5	10/23/2016	This site has been my sole source of information about Cholangiocarcinoma. It is run by an extraordinary core group of Moderaters, they are resourceful, compassionate and positively encouraging to everyone. With such a rare cancer, the personal stories and ability to actually interact with others who are fighting this disease, is invaluable!
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	313366	3	/users/profile/404739	coastalcure	General Member of the Public	5	10/22/2016	A cancer diagnosis is heartbreaking but especially so with a rare and aggressive cancer such as Cholangiocarcinoma.  It is frightening to navigate the medical system when so few practitioners have direct experience with this cancer at the same time treatment decisions must be taken quickly.  The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation plays a critical and at times life-saving role.  The medical  experts I have dealt with know of the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation and have referred me to its wonderful on-line resources.  I have contacted the Foundation outreach staff for advice and responses have been timely and sympathetic.  The Foundation supports urgently needed research and through its moderated discussion boards allows patients and caregivers to educate each other about their experiences with diagnosis and treatments and to see there are many positive stories and reasons for hope.  I cannot think of higher praise for this organization.
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	313297	3	/users/profile/404668	Samantha90	Donor	5	10/22/2016	This foundation was basically my sole source of information when my mother was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in June 2015. There's really nothing else out there. That's why I decided to raise money for them for the Bank of America Chicago Marathon this year. I know that my donations count with CCF. Without this nonprofit, I would have had virtually no information to go off of when I was researching this disease.
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	313284	3	/users/profile/404653	Deborah167	Volunteer	5	10/22/2016	Very important nonprofit doing extraordinary work on an often overlooked cancer. 
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	313059	3	/users/profile/404430	GavinS	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	Like many I had never heard of Cholangiocarcinoma until my dad was diagnosed with it in 2008. So much to learn in such a quick time period I turned to the help and support of the people of the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation and have been a volunteer with them ever since. All I can say if you or a loved one is touched by this horrible disease then please go there as you will find a wealth of information  and get the help and support of some of the best and friendliest people out there.I am extremely proud to be a small part of this organisation and I know that I will be a part of it for life. Please, do not go through this alone. Go over the to the CCF and you will be around people how know how you feel, what you are going through and will be there for you.  It does not matter if you are a patient, family member, carer or a friend of someone with CC, do not go through this alone. Stronger together.Thank you.
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	312458	4	/users/profile/403829	barbara6193	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I had never heard of cholangiocarcinoma until the day my husband was diagnosed in May 2006.  My desperate search for information led me to the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation website. This was in the very early stages of the CCF. I immediately made some incredible connections and felt some comfort having conversations with others who understood what I was going through. My husband lost his battle in 2007, but I have become an active volunteer for this incredible foundation. I do as much as I can to raise awareness and I know that my time and effort is put to great use. For 5 years I have held an annual fundraiser, knowing that the monies raised are used to fund the much needed research that WILL one day find a CURE for this horrific cancer. This is an amazing foundation with so many incredible people. I am very proud to be a part of it.
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	311891	4	/users/profile/403245	Ben_51	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	When my mom was diagnosed with cholangioncarcinoma, the foundation was the only website that specialized with information specifically for her condition. They provided excellent and invaluable information for our family, especially the 100 questions booklet.
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	311864	3	/users/profile/403218	kglenn8	Volunteer	5	10/18/2016	The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation provided information and resources for my family during one of the worst times in our lives. My father, my best buddy, was diagnosed with stage 4 Cholangiocarcinoma in January of 2016 and passed away within months, in May of 2016. With this devastating news came a very poor prognosis but we knew we would fight. The research began and we came across The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation, which led us to find the top specialty doctors for opinions, information on treatments, personal stories, and support. Cholangiocarcinoma is a devastating, complicated, and tragic disease. This Foundation is a support to families in a time of need when we feel so alone and so helpless. The annual conference hosted by the Foundation brings patients, caregivers, and doctors together to find a cure. The specialist we went to at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Gores recommended we go to the conference. The knowledge we gained about the disease prepared us for the devastating complications associated with this disease that were to come. The relationships formed with others affected by this disease will last a lifetime and we know these wonderful people because this Foundation brought us together to support one another. This disease needs awareness, research, and a cure. The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation advocates for a cure and I will continue to support it in honor of my Dad. I miss you and love you everyday Daddy. 
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	311657	2	/users/profile/403020	mike.scott	Volunteer	4	10/18/2016	My wife was diagnosis with stage IV cancer. After many tests the first doctor we saw could not find the primary source and wanted to treat as unknown primary.  When we got a second option it was discovered she had Cholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer. We had never heard of Cholangiocarcinoma. After she began treatments we began to learn more about Cholangiocarcinoma; I found the Cholangiocarcinoma and began to read others stories, much like ours. I ordered a copy of 100 Questions and Answers about Biliary Cancer and found other resources that could only be found on The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation website. It is by far the best place to find information about Biliary Cancer; to find doctors and support.   
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	311519	3	/users/profile/402877	scheitrumc	Client Served	5	10/18/2016	A special group of dedicated people who provide tremendous empathy and support. I learned about the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation when my wife was diagnosed. This was the first organization I found when trying to understand about this terrible cancer. In addition to providing a great deal of information regarding the disease, resources, clinical trials, etc. I went to this site every day to their discussion boards. What an amazing group of moderators who made each person feel special while trying to help them through every challenge faced as a patient and caregiver. I am grateful to the people in this organization and to the many volunteers willing to help others.

The outpouring of support on the discussion board is overwhelming. This Foundation is growing and is THE source for those suffering from this rare form of cancer. 
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	311412	3	/users/profile/378602	lisacraine	Volunteer	5	10/17/2016	The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation was the first place I found when I was diagnosed Stage IV ICC in 2010. The organization is staffed with caring and compassionate individuals who have a passion for making a difference in the lives of cancer patients. They are extremely informative in helping you navigate care, clinical trials and other new treatment options.  I have met some of my best friends through this group and find wonderful support through their patient board. Other foundations could use the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation as a model to replicate. Lisa Craine 
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	288400	3	/users/profile/378602	lisacraine	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation was the first place I found when diagnosed with Stage IV Cholangiocarcinoma. The staff is extraordinary with their passion for advocacy, connecting cancer patients and providing HOPE. I have learned so much about this disease and made lifetime friends through their blog. I am truly blessed to have found such a fabulous organization.  Attending the Annual Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation meeting was incredible, it was full of education, networking and hope. 
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	311407	3	/users/profile/402755	mattreidy	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2016	I discovered the foundation shortly after my diagnosis with Cholangiocarcinoma. The information they provide as well as the forum for patients, caregivers, and others to share information and experiences with this terrible, rare, cancer has been priceless to me and my family.

Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	302080	3	/users/profile/393200	BeatrizZ	Client Served	5	08/31/2016	Truly a GAME CHANGER...I can attest that without the advocates, discussion board, and the referrals to physicians who truly CARE, I will be at loss in trying to help my father manage his diagnoses and treatments. I am also impressed they have now Spanish services now. If you can please, please, please donate money as much  research is needed for this unheard condition so much that not all hospitals/surgeons know how to diagnose it. This is how I found out this foundation when the first medical team we approach were lost.
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	258576	3	/users/profile/347081	meghood14	Volunteer	5	09/20/2015	In 2012, I reached out to the foundation when are mom was given a short time to fight this cancer. The foundation inspires me to help others. I remember setting up our first fundraiser. We needed 100 CC bracelets. I called and reached Stacie Lindsey, the President of the foundation. She kindly overnighted tbe bracelets. Since then, I've been a volunteer. Love this foundation and the people behind the scenes who give their time & efforts to create change.

I continue to be amazed and proud of this wonderful organization.  They strive everyday to do their best for those diagnosed with this disease along with the people who love and care for them. From support to education to research for the cure, The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation deserves every kudo and accolade that comes its way, just ask anyone who has been touched by their compassion and generosity. Best non-profit? The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation has my vote!
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	258119	3	/users/profile/346602	Writer	Client Served	5	09/17/2015	I want to recognize the CC Foundation for what they do 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every week of the year.  As a CC patient, I've received both emotional and treatment support from other foundation discussion board members through the diagnosis through treatment and post treatment of my cholangiocarcinoma.   I think the best way to see just how great a job an organization like this is doing, is to see how many past patients and caregivers continue to come to the boards and help others in the same boat.   They believe that strongly in this organization.    I must say that though I am not one of the moderators, I frequently make comments on the boards either with personal experience or with emotional help for a patient or caregiver.   It isn't easy being a patient with CC and posting sympathy to a caregiver who has lost a loved one to this disease, but I've received so much from the CC discussion boards, I feel that I should pay it forward and this organization is the perfect place to do that.  
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	258028	4	/users/profile/346510	Writer	Board Member	5	09/17/2015	I have two loved family members who have passed from this disease. The Foundation has provide tremendous support and a vast array of resources for my family. Its a  Foundation that gives those impacted by cholangiocarcinoma ("CC") hope for a cure and aids to improve the quality of life for those affected by cholangiocarcinoma. The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation has achieved progress year over year in its mission. I have witnessed many great strides including not only encouraging collaboration among the CC medical community, which is absolutely necessary for a rare disease, but also making that collaboration happen. This has aided in the education of others, both within and outside the medical community, to gain familiarity with the disease and further our understanding through research.

This organization provides not only answers to questions pertaining to a cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis, but also an amazing support system for those diagnosed and their loved ones. Information from others' experiences helped in understanding treatment and gave me a way to share my father's experience. Although my father passed away in 2012, I am still a huge advocate for bringing awareness and hope to continue volunteering to bring more understanding of this cancer.
Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation	253986	3	/users/profile/342281	George45	Donor	5	08/25/2015	The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation is an organization that one can support with absolute confidence.  When a family member was stricken with this disease, the Foundation was instrumental in providing information and assistance.  The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation operates on a tight budget and no monies are every wasted.

I am pleased to give the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation my highest recommendation.

Healing Hands For Haiti Foundation Inc	55997		/users/profile/58270	edmauss	Donor	4	10/30/2010	I visited the HHH campus in April 2009 (several months before the earthquake) and was blown away by the facilities and staff. It was clear to me that HHH is truly making a difference in Haiti where there is a huge need for rehab of amputees as well as others with disabilities. I also visited the central hospital in Port-au-Prince, where I witnessed firsthand the fruits of a vital partnership HHH has with a group of doctors from the University of Miami. The doctors were the only ones in the country at the time how were performing surgeries on children with encephalitis and literally saving their lives. HHH is also extremely well run and its operations are efficient. They employ high-caliber local professionals and attract volunteers far and wide, hosting them comfortably in a guest house that boasts a world-class kitchen staff.

Healing Hands For Haiti Foundation Inc	55278		/users/profile/57337	loyalc	Volunteer	5	10/24/2010	I spent 9 days in Port-au-Prince with Healing Hands (HHH) in 2007.  Everything about my experience was positive - from travel to my service to building relationships with resident and volunteers who enthusiastically serve both disabled clients needing prosthetic applicances and students and staff striving to learn and improve their lives.  The goal is for to provide independence and local self-sustaining growth.  HHH also works with orphanages to improve the care and well-being of countless disabled children.  HHH has enabled change and provided hope for many years.  The hard work that led to a well-respected and staffed clinic must not stop.  The entire campus was destroyed during the earthquake, donations are needed to rebuild the clinic and the hospital that was ready for ground-breaking at the time of the earthquake.  Donations are used wisely and frugally,  leveraged with great dedication and sacrifice on the part of both native and global volunteers and staff.  The organization's size and culture enables real change and healing.
Healing Hands For Haiti Foundation Inc	55213		/users/profile/57238	jwirish	Donor	5	10/23/2010	Volunteers and staff for Healing Hands for Haiti have been there for years.  The work they have done to give medical care to the people of Haiti was little known until the devastating earthquake last January.  Although their hospital compound was destroyed, they continue their work in Port-au-Prince while the compound is being rebuilt.  They are committed to serving and to rebuilding.  I appreciate the fact that all money I donate goes toward that goal and will continue to support their mission.

They are dedicated to improving the level of care in haiti for disabled persons, especially in trying to bring back the services lost in the earthquake (that they had so carefully built over the years).  They support the local economy, and volunteer above and beyond what I have ever personally witnessed in the nonprofit world.  They are particularly adept at corraling resources, and know how to make lemonade from lemons.

I have been to haiti before and after the Quake. The organization is well organized and makes the trips run as smooth as possible in such a unorganized country as Haiti is. It is very rewarding to be able to go and help treat the people who need Prosthetic devices and care, being able to focus on the outcomes and your specific speciality, while HHH takes care of the housing, travel, and other arrangements.  HHH is a great foundation providing a needed service to the disabled people of Haiti taking care of those professionals who chose to come and donate of there time and talents to help with the programs.

Given the post-quake situation, there were additional stressors for first-time volunteers/visitors to Haiti like me. From my first introduction to HHH via Frank Shirley (orthotist), I felt as though I was in capable hands with a team of experts who knew the landscape, understood the culture of the people, and were similarly committed to providing quality patient care. HHH not only helped me to feel safe as I traveled around the island but also feel welcomed. They care about the paid staff who they employ and appear to have the respect of locals. Their reach in Haiti is broad as is their heart.

Even before the earthquake, I knew that Haiti needed our help, since it is such a poverty stricken country... the worst in our area of the world. I know the Director of this organization, Eric Doubt, who is a man of integrity.  They are a well structured and hard working group. I have seen films of their facilities and the faces of the people they are helping.  I feel good about doing my part.Those of us who are in a position to help others, have an obligation to do so.   If I was born into such a situation, I'd be grateful to Healing Hands for Haiti. They are making a difference.

Donor	5	10/21/2010	When the earthquake happened in Haiti, I was like many others looking for a way to make a donation to a responsible charity where my gift would have an immediate impact.  Some friends told me about Healing Hands for Haiti and when I checked them out, I found them to be one of the few organizations who were already "in country" and working there.  In addition, they have an excellent record of low management expense.  I felt my donation would make a difference through their organization.  I continued to monitor their work in Haiti and have been moved to donate even more money to help them achieve their continuing goals.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	320372	2	/users/profile/412798	volunteerinriverton	Volunteer	5	12/21/2016	I have donated time and money to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for decades.     I noticed some comments on the site from individuals offering disapproval and making claims that sound as if the nonprofit money was used to build a mall.  I just wanted to clarify that there are business arms to the church that are separate from nonprofit. If there was moneys used by the Church to build a mall, then it was not pulled from the nonprofit arm of the church.  Nonprofit money goes to the aid of the individuals or groups who are in need and many unpaid hours go in to that so that moneys donated are actually put 100% toward whichever cause it goes to.  I understand that there are frustrations experienced by those who have been disillusioned by the church for various reasons and so they use there review as an opportunity to vent.  I believe that the church bears no malice toward these individuals but rather it is my experience that all people are viewed as of equal value in the eyes of God.  I will continue to donate my time and money because the LDS church not only donates the money, time, resources, but also does so with tremendous love and heart.  This is truly an organization that wants to bless the world.

Just go to the Humanitarian Center. The Church has been there in many other places....they don't just help members they help other people. They have provided medical services where none has been...they helped out Germany with wheat after WWII or I....many pounds of wheat was sent on train carts.

And when Lakota people were dying in the Dakotas for lack of propane this past winter, the church was spending money to build condominiums in Philadelphia. The Maya children of Guatemala suffer malnourishment as high as 80%. What did the LDS church do? It built a multibillion dollar mall in Salt Lake City for the wealthy to shop in. Think about how much of a difference that money would have made in helping the Maya peoples instead of a shopping center in Utah. Other nonprofits do far more to help make the world better. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	188161	31	/users/profile/245412	Privately	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/08/2013	I worked for over15 years in South Asia and East Asia with various government agencies and NGOs and I have always been impressed by the LDS Church's charitable relief efforts. When disaster strikes, they are among first ones in  - and they come with appropriate aid.  For example, we watched as container after container of LDS aid arrived in Indonesia after the big 2004 tsunami, and again after a big earthquake in a different part of the country the next year. We were in China following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan and again the LDS were busily bringing in supplies.  I can't remember a typhoon in the Philippines in the last 10 years where I haven't run into LDS relief efforts.  I was discussing the LDS with some of my classmates who work in the US and they tell me they regularly see hundreds of LDS volunteers (sometimes called Mormons) in yellow vests working in the aftermath of disasters in the US like  hurricanes Sandy and Katrina.  One of the things that impresses me most about the LDS church's relief efforts is their attitude. They don't try to limit their aid to their own adherents, they are willing to help where help is needed, regardless of religion. It doesn't even  matter to them whether they get "credit" for their efforts - only that the aid gets to those in need. For example,  in Pakistan after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake there were problems with local officials who were very opposed to their people finding out that relief supplies were coming from Christians (to the point that the officials were blocking shipments to starving people), so the LDS simply had their supplies repacked to remove any mention of the church so they could get through. One LDS leader told me "It's only important that the hungry are fed and the homeless are sheltered, not that we get our names in the papers". I heard a similar story from a colleague that the LDS have been quietly shipping food to North Koreans on the same "no name" basis - politics don't matter, only hungry children matter.  I saw criticism  of the LDS church several years ago for a  "lack of transparency" (echoed in some  other reviews on this site) and I did some research of my own. Apparently the LDS church doesn't file the same financial disclosure documents with the US IRS that big US charities do (like Red Cross), but I learned that most US churches aren't required to file them and therefore don't file either. I also learned that the LDS church has a modern internal audit department and that one of the major public accounting firms (currently Deloitte) audits the church and its internal processes and auditors.  I looked into the governing board overseeing LDS charities and it is quite impressive (and a  bit eclectic, which I like), including a Stanford business school professor, several university presidents, a state supreme court judge, and even the former chief pilot of Lufthansa, All serve as unpaid volunteers.  LDS charities distribute 100% of funds donated for relief.  An LDS church leader told me that their charitable relief funds are separated from the church's other funds (like their tithing program) by a one-way gate. The church can use other funds to support relief efforts (like paying for all the overhead of the relief program), but no relief funds can be used for anything other than relief aid.  Given what I have seen and experienced personally and what I have learned about them, I would be very  comfortable recommending The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as a worthy charity.

When we arrived I was surprised to find dozens of families like ourselves filling their shopping carts with food and necessities.  I have since learned that the LDS church offers this all across the world and they do so through their members donations and investments in cattle ranches and such.  We receive meats, dairy, and canned goods during the time my husband was un-employed.  Everytime we visited the store house it was full of people receiving help.  I'm thankful for the help we received in a time of stress and need.  Thank you to all who make this charity possible.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	149285	9	/users/profile/198922	radicalgeekery	Volunteer	1	02/12/2013	Spent more than 25 years as a voluntary member of this organization. After I left (voluntarily), I was shunned by members of this organization. I was told that I was not good enough for them and many of them cut off contact with me due to the teachings of this organization. This organization also took thousands of dollars from me with the promise of my life getting better, but like many organizations who claim this, it didn't happen. It is also a very homophobic and misogynist organization which routinely gets involved with politics (gay marriage) and I believe that it's tax-exempt status should be revoked because of that. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	145662	15	/users/profile/192198	mckaymoline	Volunteer	1	12/03/2012	I have donated thousands of dollars to and spent two years as a volunteer missionary for the Mormon church. Unfortunately, those two years in a third world country were spent almost exclusively recruiting new members for the organization and doing very little substantive service for the poor people around me. I loved the experiences I had there, but I very much wish the Church would train its missionaries to be less like salesmen. The Church is guarded about its financial practices. It is estimated that it has a net worth of at least $40 billion, with annual revenue of $8 billion (http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-07-10/how-the-mormons-make-money#p1). Members of the church are told that payment of tithing (10% of income) is a requirement for admission to heaven, and they will be denied access to Mormon temples if they fail to pay. Growing up I was led to believe that the Church spends millions of dollars each year on humanitarian aid projects around the globe, but these figures are never made public, a fact I now find disturbing. This is especially troubling because the Church recently funded the building of an enormous shopping mall in Salt Lake City (at least $2 billion). The Church owns 928,000 acres of land in North America,  is the largest ranch land owner in Wyoming, is the 2nd largest land owner in Nebraska, has the largest  cattle ranch in 48 states (adjacent to Disneyworld in Florida), is the largest foreign landowner in UK.  The LDS Church owns several businesses, numerous radio and television stations, its own insurance company, and is rumored to be the largest single producer of commercial beef in the USA .  They own enormous properties in Hawaii including a Marriott hotel franchise  and the Polynesian Cultural Center, which is the most visited tourist attraction in Hawaii (http://mormonthink.com/tithing.htm). As an organization claiming it is God's "one true church," these business enterprises and lack of financial transparency are disconcerting to say the least. This is all important information people should consider before donating their, time, money, or any other resources to this organization.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	136096	12	/users/profile/179768	loveCFRI	Volunteer	5	11/09/2012	I think it's so wonderful that the LDS Church is usually the first organization to arrive at the scene of a disaster, sometimes even before the Red Cross gets there.  We learn to "serve one another" from the scriptures and so volunteering is serving.  Members can either volunteer and help at disasters or can help by donating to the Humanitarian aid on an Offerings slip at church.   I haven't been able to volunteer at a disaster, but have helped by donating.  The church helps people throughout the world, not just the U.S.  
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	131864	16	/users/profile/177459	wjgold	Donor	5	10/31/2012	The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or "LDS" or "Mormon" for short, is run completely by non-paid clergy, including those at the highest point of leadership (They are compensated for travel and other church related expenses if they are unable to pay with their own funds).  ALL the non-paid clergy to the highest level continue paying tithing voluntarily as well.  The biggest expenses of the Church are building chapels and temples world-wide including upkeep and maintenance, and maintaining missions throughout the world.  Members when paying tithing, which money is used for these and related eccesiastical matters, also have options to donate additional moneys for disasters, humanitarian aid, education scholarships for less developed countries, etc., and contrary to the norm,  all the money goes to help since church volunteers are paid nothing to do so.  It is due to lack of understanding that some write negatively about the money controlled by the church, since they do not know the facts - that help given to disasters, etc. is directly donated by members voluntarily for that express purpose, and is distributed by the church free of overhead.  I prefer donating this way since I know that every penny I give will go to help those in need.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	122328	12	/users/profile/166586	Tanzania	Donor	5	09/14/2012	It is reassuring that the church gives out 100% of its humanitarian aid contributions, which is very uncommon in so many charities today.  The church often stays for extended periods helping in areas that have had natural disasters, long after other relief agencies have left the scene.  The Church specializes in small items that are often overlooked by larger agencies such as hygiene kits. The LDS Church also has an extensive welfare system which is separate from its humanitarian aid program. This program is primarily for the relief of its members and is administered on a local level.  Members of the church fast each month and donate the money they would have used on meals to assist the poor.  This program should not be confused with humanitarian aid.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	114547	11	/users/profile/156080	ytrent2012	Volunteer	5	06/11/2012	I've been a donor, volunteer, adviser, and dispenser of both human resources and finances for the LDS Church. I think it deserves high marks, particularly since almost everyone is an untrained volunteer. Collections are done in person, online, or through the mail, and receipts are kept by the donor, local group, and headquarters. Every year the donor confirms their receipts with the organizations to make sure nobody tried to skim anything, and in all my years I've never encountered a problem. The primary donations are tithing, which is taught as a biblical principle and duty, and those funds cover all the operations of the Church, it's facilities, staff, equipment, etc. Other funds, such as the humanitarian relief fund, are 100% load-free-- all the donated money goes directly toward the recipients, because administrative burden is paid for already by tithing. Because of it's size and spread, the LDS Church has people on the ground all over the place, and the local administration of relief funds increases their effectiveness IMO. I have been on both the giving and receiving end, and the human face makes the help more meaningful. The LDS Church also excels at gathering volunteers, has a well-developed transport and distribution network, and even owns farms and food-processing facilities, so each dollar tends to have far more than a typical dollar's impact at another aid organization. Internal audits are conducted by Deloitte, a top accounting firm, and double checked by an independent in-house team. Totals aren't released, which keeps the focus on the goal rather than the money, and local administrators have access to their precincts' funds and records, and it's all very orderly. Overall, it's tough to beat a no-admin-load charity with well-developed networks and reputable history. The religion's adherents' tithing donations provide facilities and staff and keeps the ball rolling, so anyone else's donation goes straight to the particular cause. My favorite funds are the education-loan fund and the disaster relief fund. They are LDS specialties.  I expect that LDS philanthropies will continue to improve in coming years, and it's been a joy to be a part of.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints	107377	10	/users/profile/145398	tedf	Donor	1	03/01/2012	The Church receives 10% of its members' gross income as tithes as well as other donations. It has various tax-exempt benefits and has large land holdings and property investments in various locations around the globe, it is involved in the running of numerous media and commercial enterprises.  It uses donor contributions as it wishes to expand its operations without providing any form of financial accountability statement. Its contributions to humanitarian assistance are absolutely miniscule in relation to its income, mostly in the form of getting its membership to donate their time. So where does all the money go?

I don't know where the money came from. I wish I knew that names of all the people who were responsible; but I don't. What I do know is that one day I received an email from Tracy, inviting all teachers to write and submit grant proposals for classroom needs. The form was simple enough. Talking with my 3rd grade colleagues about enhancing our writing program was exciting. We put our heads together, did a little research and came up with a plan. A few weeks after we submitted our grant proposal, we were issued the $5000 we needed! It was like magic! So to all who are responsible for finding the funds, helping with the grant process and giving of your time to improve our schools; I thank you!

I cannot thank them enough for all the books , computer programs , computers and ipads they have so generously given to the schools.The Mo Willems books are some of the best loved books we use in first grade. Two years ago I had a student with special needs and it was so hard to find books that he loved. Then the Foundation brought the Mo Willems books into my room and WOW! This child started to read, he would not put down the books. In fact, I had to keep checking his backpack before he went home, because he would try to sneak them into his pack and take them home.I have found that if you can have a child learn to love reading in first grade, then they will become life-long learners and readers.Without this wonderful Reading Foundation I would not have been able to instill in this special needs child the love of reading.So Thank you again for all the good work you do for our schools. Sometimes we do not appreciate all that we have been given.

I had noticed that when I introduced samples and specimens to my class that many students were unable to see the specimen because it was small.  When these specimens were passed around the class they were often damaged.  I wanted to purchase a camera that would allow me to magnify and display specimens through our projector and that would also mount to a microscope.  Our budget did not allow for the purchase of such an expensive piece of equipment.   Through a grant proposal the Kane Schools Foundation recognized the potential benefit that this piece of equipment would provide to our science classes and provided the funds to purchase the camera.

Kane Schools Foundation for Students	157996		/users/profile/209542	esplin	Client Served	5	05/15/2013	Thank you Kane Schools Foundation For Students. Third grade is a transition year in reading.  Students go from learning to read to reading to learn new things.  They go from reading small picture books to reading books with chapters.  It is a challenge for students to make that jump.  If they can develop a love of reading and find the book that connects with them, they can become life long readers.  That is the goal of the reading program at Valley Elementary third grade.    We are having wonderful success with our reading program.  We have an extensive third grade library that has book of all levels.  It is very important to match a student with books that are in the correct reading level range AND are interesting to them.  The books must not be too easy because then they will not grow.  They also cannot be too difficult because then the student will be frustrated.  Because all students differ in their interests, it is vital to have a wide range of topics and reading levels.  We have such a library here in our classroom thanks, in part to the Kane School Foundation for Students.  They have donated books to use in our classroom.

Now we are seeing fewer students scoring in those ranges and more students meeting the benchmark for that testing period. This year (2013) we only have one student scoring in the intensive and two students scoring in the strategic ranges. Hooray! This accomplishment was not achieved by just the sixth grade teachers, but by all of our teachers here at Kanab Elementary School.	The Kane Schools Foundation has provided a way for us to acquire materials and resources that have helped improve reading throughout all grades in our school. The foundation has been especially devoted to increasing student literacy and concentrating on providing materials which are readily available to all teachers. Through monies provided by the foundation we have been able to build our school libraries; which includes: guided reading library, six-traits library, take-home library, and classroom libraries. In addition, this organization awarded our elementary a grant to purchase an i-pad for each teacher to complete DIBELS testing. We have found that electronic testing has the following benefits: less student stress, accuracy, saves time, no bulky materials, and instant results. Testing with the i-pad has been a huge success. 	So, thank you again Kane Schools Foundation for your tireless efforts and support in our ultimate goal to increase our students self-esteem and success. You are the best!

It would be easy to say a foundation will not work due to the small district size.  This foundation group has found a way in spite of small size to generate funds to assist programs.  Many students have been positively impacted by the foundations efforts.

Students who started on levels two and three are progressing to level four.  I appreciate this organizations support.

The compassion and dedication that Faith displayed gave me great confidence that there was no better place to leave our beloved pets. Faith gave us a tour of the whole farm and knew every creature there by name. She expressed such an enormous amount of love and concern for each one of them. She has made sure the living conditions were very comfortable for each of them as well. I'm so happy that my little Indigo and Ricochet are able to live out the rest of their lives there.

Some ways were expected,  most were not. Ching Farm is called a Rescue and Sanctuary, but I never thought it would be so for myself.  I haven't been more at peace than since spending time with the varied beautiful animals out on the farm. We don't realize that they all have personalities just like our pets because we honestly don't have many opportunities to get to know them like we do our pets. Ching Farm changed that for me, and can change it for anyone. Dare to open yourself up to a new and different perspective of life. Support animals that have been through far too much in their lives. Come love and laugh with us! These lil guys are a hoot!

Faith Ching, along with all of the other volunteers who keep this sanctuary alive, are some of the kindest, most compassionate people Ive met.  Having the opportunity to see and interact with these incredible animals has been an eye-opening and humbling experience.  The manner in which Ching Farm provides for these animals allows them to flourish and enjoy their lives to the fullest.  Witnessing the different personalities of these animals is a testament to the notion that we are dealing with someone, not something.  I commend Faith and her team on their education based outreach and look forward to many more opportunities to participate with such an amazing group of people!

The experience is unforgettable; having an opportunity to learn and work with a wide range of personalities amongst the animals brings me back to have more experiences. I love my time at Ching Farm.

I have always been an animal lover but prior to volunteering here I had no idea how much personality all of these farm animals have, from the smallest chicken to the largest horses.  It is such a joy to get to know all of these creatures and to help in some small way to give them the love and care they so deserve.  It is also nice to know that 100% of all donations go directly toward caring for the animals as there is no paid staff at the farm.  The entire organization is run on donations and volunteers.

Faith's heart is bigger than most where animals are concerned and it shows in her devotion to their care. No animal is unknown or lost to Faith. She knows everyone's name and story, what they like best to eat, and where they liked to be scratched!  As a volunteer at Ching Farm, it's an absolute pleasure to work among the animals. Upon arrival, I'm greeted by emus, pigs, mini horses, goats, geese, chickens, and sheep. Further in, I see many of her rescued horses, my favorite tooth-grinning llamas, long-horned cows, and Miss Betty, the largest and sweetest pig ever! It's so rewarding to see all these animals thriving and living in harmony together. No matter what their heartbreaking story was prior, they have all found a loving home at Ching Farm.

She is an amazing person and she has saved the lives of thousands of animals. Words cannot describe how wonderful she is and how amazing Ching Farm is. I started volunteering there back in March and I've found my favorite place. This place is a safe haven for animals and people as well. It's also a learning experience. You'll learn that Sven the cow is part lab and loves to be pet and gives kisses lol. You'll meet pigs who have been trained to sit and do tricks. You'll find that goats are one of the friendliest creatures on the planet and will follow you around to get attention. A day at the farm is more educational than any zoo I've ever been to, plus it's free! Gather up the kids and spend a day at the farm taking care of these wonderful animals. XOXO Jessica!

I was only expecting to get one, the young horse, but Pam needed a home too. I took them both. At first, I did okay financially, but then Pam had some health conditions that I couldn't afford, and on top of that, I was trying to help her gain weight, which got expensive very quickly. I put an ad up on ksl, and I was very suspicious of anyone who contacted me. I wasn't satisfied with anyone who wanted my old mare; I wanted her to go to a place where she'd be loved and appreciated and cared for in the best way. Faith contacted me. It was like a blessing from heaven. I visited her farm to check things out and I instantly fell in love. Every single animal is loved and known as an individual. And I mean every single one. Each one is adored by Faith and her volunteers. I decided to send my Pammy there, and I'm so happy that I did. While I've only been able to visit a few times, I know she's being cared for and loved. Last time I visited, Pam looked like she'd gained all the weight she needed to, and she had her own little herd of another horse and her buddy's sheep friends (the older horses are kept separate from the main herd so they stay safe). I cannot sing Ching Farm's praises loud enough! It's a save haven for all sorts of creatures, and the best part is that each one is cared for, loved, happy, and healthy.

Ching Farm Rescue	271657	1	/users/profile/360524	Writer	Volunteer	5	11/09/2015	Ive volunteered, donated, and sponsored animals at the Ching Farm Sanctuary for more than 10 years. Faith Ching runs the sanctuary and is an inspiring woman. The animals are rescued from all kinds of situations. Some were laboratory test animals, some came from neglectful or abusive homes, and a surprising amount were abandoned. Whether permanent or not, each and every animal on the farm is Faiths baby. She knows the name, story, personality, and quirks of each and every one. She introduces them all as the "best boy/girl of the farm.  In addition to animal rescue, education and adoption is another important task of the farm. Faith hates to part with any of the animals, but if she didnt she wouldnt have room to save more.  The farm has very strict adoption criteria with adopters having to provide at least the amount of space and care the animals are already getting at Ching Farm  a high standard to meet. The staff makes site-visits to adopters homes to make sure they have the right environment for the animal. They also pay post-adoption visits to make sure the care is kept to an acceptable level.

Each weekend is unique in that the women who comprise the group is always different and inspiring in its own way.  We offer retreats for Young Survivors, Metastatic Patients, Latino women and all breast cancer survivors.  We indulge and pamper them to the extent that they all deserve.

There is fellowship, laughter, some tears and so much hope and caring for others.  Lifelong friendships are made at these retreats.

When I was diagnosed, there was little or no support available.  Image Reborn's healing retreats for survivors provides women with an opportunity to realize that they are not alone on their journey back to health.  When the women arrive on Friday night, they are somewhat apprehensive as to what will happen.  When they leave on Sunday, they have made new friends, have enjoyed wonderful activities and are armed with a number of resources.  The laughter, smiles and hugs as they leave confirm that their time at an Image Reborn Retreat was a life changing event.

I was surprised and elated to receive an email a few months later informing me of an upcoming retreat and inviting me to apply.  I was thrilled to attend a winter Young Survivors Retreat and had a wonderful time.  Every detail of my trip was taken care of and exceeded my expectations.  I flew into Utah earlier than the other group members and the foundation arranged transportation to take me to a location of my choosing for the afternoon and then the director picked me up personally and took me to the retreat house.  The retreat house was phenomenal and I was overwhelmed at the luxurious comfort to which we were treated by generous donors.  I really enjoyed the delicious meals by our private chef.  The art journaling was a fun and moving activity.  My favorite was, of course, the facials and massages. The comraderie of spending time with other young survivors was exactly what I needed to move into the next phase of my cancer experience - being a survivor.

This opportunity allowed me to, in a way, escape my real life.  Even though I was with other breast cancer survivors, I could realize I was not alone in my journey and life isn't as awful as it seems when you hear the words 'breast cancer'.  It was a nice reprieve from day-to-day life.  I was able to bond with my sister survivors and be pampered and taken care of.  I love the home we were able to stay in and I am grateful to those generous enough to donate the use of their home for these retreats.  My favorite parts of the weekend were the yummy cheeseburger I was able to have at the club house cafe and the fun art journal we were able to start creating.  There were a few times when I felt a little out of place, but I overcame those feelings by the camaraderie of the other guests and the compassion of the hostesses.  I do wish my own events hadn't caused me to be so late, that I could've had a better room, but I did enjoy the experience and if I were ever invited back to attend, I would go in a heartbeat.  I also want to do what I can to help the organization out.  I would like to see a possible weekend event that involved spouses, significant others, or caretakers as well.  They need a break just as much as a survivor does.  I will admit I thought we were going to talk a little more about how to make ourselves more healthy, like with eating and follow-up treatments, etc.   Overall, though, I am so happy I went, and I am happy I had the opportunity to go in the first place.

The women who are in charge of the retreats are truly inspiring. They give up their time and provide resources hoping to help others through cancer. The resources they provided were great. It was helpful to hear other stories and to get feedback. I left with a new understanding of the direction I wanted to go with treatments and with new friends for support. 
Image Reborn Inc	92582		/users/profile/106242	lpbehrendt	Client Served	5	06/28/2011	Once hearing about Image Reborn and being accepted into the program retreat, I was ecstatic to find out I could hang with others, who were exactly where I was. Financially, having tons of medical bills was a concern that was wiped away, because the retreat was 100% covered. What a blessing! The food, leadership support, friendships made was a priceless experience. Stage IV Metastatic Cancer, once you've been tagged, you're tagged for life. Is it denial, when the oncologist states you are in remission, you think of yourself as cancer-free? Or perhaps it is a coping mechanism of the brain? Well, I have cancer. I am in remission. I will continue to seek out life adventures that make me smile, soothe my spirit and bring me joy, spend time with my precious family and true friends. All the while, asking God to use me to help others smile, soothe spirits and bring joy.

Labs For Liberty	322225		/users/profile/415923	jtw06	Client Served	5	01/27/2017	Labs For Liberty is top tier! They genuinely care about supporting veterans, with their services they are empowering their clients, well making them part of their family and giving them a life long companion. I have had the privilege of being on a few sides of the organization. I first went on an amazing retreat pheasent hunting with fellow vets, that alone got me out of the slump I was in at that time. Then my wife and I wanted to not only give back to the company but to the community so we fostered a puppy. It was an amazing experience helping raise and train a dog that will be doing so much good. Now my personal pup has been born and Labs For Liberty has been in contact every step of the way, there to support me in anything. I cannot recommend them highly enough not just for their services provided but the family themselves are great caring people, who are on a mission and doing an amazing job at it!-JWUSMC

I'm an Army veteran who suffers from extreme social anxiety and post traumatic stress as well as a brain injury. Carbon has allowed me to go out in public places, he keeps a bubble around me in place, alerts me to people coming up behind me and allows me to have personal contact with people without the stress of always watching my back! Labs for Liberty has changed my life and given me a second chance at having a social life!

They have helped my husband and our family in ways we could not have imagined. My husband returned from Iraq with PTSD and possible TBI. It was almost 10 years after his departure from the Marine Corps that the talk of a service dog was  brought up. After having our sweet Gunner for about a year, we could have never imagined the difference that sweet 4-legged friend could really have made! We are truly blessed to be apart of this wonderful family-because that's what you become with L4L, family.

From before I even got my Service dog and was just filling out the application process they helped walk me through everything step by step. The day I found out I was getting my Service dog Sarge was one of the best days. They kept me updated on his progress the whole way through. They also made sure that he was tailored to my needs. As a Veteran you are sometimes limited on the resources you can get. With Labs For Liberty being 100% nonprofit this exceeded my expectations in all ways possiple. It blew my mind how willing and loving they are towards Veterans to help save our lives. When I went to Labs for Liberty to meet Sarge for the first time I felt very comfortable and they did an excellent job in preparing me to go home with Sarge. Thanks to Labs For Liberty I now not only have a best friend, but also a new reason for living. I cannot say how grateful I am to this selfless organization.

They are not about being recognized, they are about actually helping Veteran's like myself who didn't know needed help until they gifted my husband and I with a service dog that we call "Woobie", our security blanket. We are both combat war veteran's and this organization has tremendously helped us in our every day lives. They are 100% non-profit, 100% for the Veteran and have made an impact on our lives and feel like we can never fully repay them for the future they gave us with Woobie. We were welcomed into their family and pack from the beginning and are truly blessed with more ways than just the service dog.   Looking for someone to donate to, this is the organization!!!

I picked him up in August, and life seemed to go on just as it had, until one day it didn't go as planned and Flynn went right to work. Upon reflecting on my bad day, all I could think about was what would have happened if Flynn wasn't there. I kept circling back to how I would have never been traveling alone if I didn't have Flynn, how I would have never had the courage to be away from home or be brave enough to be navigating a city I didn't know well. Yes, Flynn did what he was trained to do, but most importantly he gave me the freedom to be "Jenna" again and he gives me the willpower to keep moving on. It took me another six weeks to be able to get back out there, all the while Flynn was my reason to get up each morning and keep  moving, and the afternoon I decided that it was time to keep moving forward again, Flynn was right there and ready to keep tackling every day with me.

This program helps veterans with PTSD live the life they should live after sacrificing  for our freedom. We have seen first  hand how these "battle buddies" have helped their veterans reengage in everyday life, from taking a walk to going out for a cup of coffee. These may seem like small ventures but for a veteran with PTSD these are major steps to getting back to their old selves and feeling like a productive citizen again.Labs For Liberty has also assisted us as fosters in task training for each veterans needs. They are always available to handle any concerns or questions that we may have.This program has saved so many veterans by pairing them with a "battle buddy". We are honored to be a part of something so wonderful and making such a difference in veterans lives. Roxi and Steve Leach

They also flew my wife, daughter and I to Utah, round trip, and had us all stay at Liberty Outpost (A cabin on their property for individual training with your pup!). I have a specific disability and Post traumatic stress. They donated their time to train him to understand and recognize my seizures and to help me through a tough time. Odin is a great companion and friend. If you're in need of a service dog and a Veteran, I highly suggest L4L. Fantastic organization and a beautiful family.

She was the only person that had ever returned emails. I was truly in need for some assistance with my MST and my mobility and my depression.  Joan Nold sent  me an  application. I went thru the process and I  was accepted. I was thrilled finally someone that heard me . My knee buddy was picked out just for me and my needs. I was sent a plane ticket to Morgan Utah. I had the pleasure of staying at the outpost for a week being trained with my service dog and I bonded with the entire family.  Every night we had dinner I felt so much love. I felt as though someone truly cared and understood me and my feelings. After the week of being rejuvenated I felt as though I could face the world again with my knee buddy.

I originally contacted them in 2015 and within a couple days I had an interview with Joan, who is amazing! We talked over the phone and went over some of the disabilities I had to see if I would be a good fit with the organization's goals.  Within a couple weeks I was at Liberty Outpost having dinner with the Nolds and talking about how Labs 4 Liberty was set up to help veterans with physical disabilities and PTSD.  I was able to meet with other vets that had already received their dog, as well as a veteran that was being paired with his that week.  Labs 4 Liberty hand picked a dog that would benefit me for my physical disabilities and especially for my size.  Over the next few months I was able to visit L4L at the outpost and spend time with the Nold family and meet more and more veterans that were connected with Labs 4 Liberty.  When Juno ( my pup) was ready to for me to pair with her, L4L invited me to the outpost for a week to get familiar with the commands and Juno in general.  They had my wife and I, completely took care of us the entire week.  They completely accepted us into their family and have always been more than willing to help with any questions and any help that we need.  Since Juno and I have paired we've been honored to represent L4L at a Marine Corps Birthday Ball and at the University of Utah gymnastics meet.  They have also added to the organization family two new faces since we paired, that have been so great to get to know.  Everyone in this organization is incredibly helpful and sincerely there for you.

Hawkwatch International, Inc.	44166	7	/users/profile/45087	ninihindert	Board Member	5	06/16/2010	Hawkwatch International employees and volunteers maintain observation sites for raptors during peak migration months.   One site is in the Goshute Nevada mountains and provides a breathtaking view of the organization's work.  By gathering years of data about migrating raptors who depend on the integrety of environments over thousands of miles of migration, Hawkwatch International has developed a data base that is a remarkable window into the health of our world. Important decisions such as development of wind power may be guided by this information for better outcomes for our raptors and their habitat.

I was a member for part of that time.  When I had the opportunity to serve HWI again as a board member, I was excited to reconnect with the organization.The best part of HWI is the passion for birds of prey and for environmental protection that is shared by staff, volunteers, and supporters alike.  In the last three years HWI has honed its mission and has begun to take what it knows about birds of prey and apply not only to their conservation and but also to the conservation of the ecosystems in which they reside.Based on current leadership, staff composition, and a board that is more engaged than it has historically been, I see a very bright future for the organization.

I spent 2 months on the mountain at the Goshutes banding site in the 1994 season.After that I received more training in bird handling and identification and then led several field trips for bird watching.HawkWatch provides a careful and thorough collection of data on raptor migration and population health, and shares it with professionals.Raptors provide a uniquely enticing opportunity to introduce people to the wonder of nature and the need to care for it.

Hawkwatch International, Inc.	35814	4	/users/profile/36608	susan24	Former Volunteer	5	04/14/2010	Years ago, the local power company worked with Hawkwatch International to identify which power poles were being most used by raptors, so they could put perch guards where they would prevent the most electrocutions of hawks and owls.  I was a volunteer gathering the evidence along certain lines.  I learned just how frequently hawks use power poles and just how deadly the lines can be.  I liked the partnership idea with the power company.  Years later, I know much more about HawkWatch as I am now on the Board.  They are clear about their vision, and they manage their resources well.

I realized they did hawkwatches at the Texas coast.  I was so impressed with their mission and goals, that every year since then our Alamo Area Chapter of the TMN approves an activity to go learn and assist the counters.  It is so popular with our volunteers that many stay for 2 - 3 days, learning and assisting the official counters.  When they return to San Antonio with stories of seeing over 20,000 raptors at one time, that only inspires more members to understand the importance of protecting this species and their habitats.

Hawkwatch International, Inc.	35555	4	/users/profile/36375	anneliseslater	Client Served	5	04/12/2010	HawkWatch has provided unique educational opportunities for my fifth grade students.  I teach fifth grade in a Utah public school.  Our classes are crowded (I have 32 students this year) and we have limited resources.  Fifth grade is also a transitional grade for kids.  Their interests and priorities shift dramatically.  They began to have emotional, personal and academic problems.  Many of my students dont like school.  Its hard to teach these kids.  HawkWatchs education Director, Jenn Hajj offers educational programs about raptors and our environment.  She traveled to our school to teach our challenging students.  She brought a live red-tailed hawk.  She also brought her guitar.  She sang creative songs teaching about raptors and their ecosystems.  She taught the kids about what scientists and volunteers at HawkWatch do (collecting data from different places about various species of birds).  She explained why this data needs to be collected and what HawkWatch does with it.  She even brought in calipers and rulers with cardstock photographs of raptors as models.  This was for the kids to get some hands-on experiences using measurement and collecting data.   My class was engaged.  They actually experienced the importance of making accurate metric measurements.  They loved having HawkWatch teach them.  They were finally able to see a real connection with science, math, and reading.  They made statements like, Oh, this is why we need to make graphs.  This lesson made an impression on my students.  They are still singing Jenns Raptor Bird song.  Our introduction to HawkWatch was also a bridge to other learning opportunities.  We were introduced to two live nest web cameras.  One is for bald eagles, the other is for barn owls.  My students have loved learning about these birds and watching them from our classroom.  We observed them hatching, eating, growing, moving, and last year we watched one fledge.  HawkWatch is a wonderful non-profit organization for schools.

At that time I had personally experienced the opportunities that come when kind-hearted, hard-working, and generous people provide a chance for other hard-working people to self sustain--and beyond.  With gratitude in my heart for my benefactors, I began supporting Mentors.  Over the years I have come to appreciate the way Mentors efficiently matches kind-hearted donors with the hard-working poor to develop the dignity that results from self reliance.  Only the most compelling purposes on earth have held my attention for this long.  If you desire the feelings that well up inside when one helps the poor and needy help themselves, you might seriously consider Mentors International.

My wife and I visited many individuals in Guatemala who have been assisted by Mentors. These humble people of Guatemala are hard working mothers and fathers who want to make a difference in the lives of their children and fellow countrymen. Mentors allows them to get a boost in the form of a microloan. Yes, these people pay interest on the loan and are held responsible to pay the loan back. The fact is that the wonderful people of Guatemala have a 100% repayment record. Mentors has programs in many 3rd world countries and has had success in all. I don't know where the money for the salaries of the full-time staff come from, but I am certain they deserve what they are paid and I don't think it matters considering the impact being made in the lives of tens of thousands of people in the world. That influence for good will simply grow as the children of those assisted grow up in a better circumstance due to the programs provided by Mentors. I know the people of Guatemala very well having lived among them for more than a year and a half. These people know how to work and are proud of their country and especially proud of their families. They are willing to work their hands to the bone to help their children get a better start in life than they had. We should all be proud of Mentors and other organizations like it who go out in the world and do good. After all that should be the goal of all mankind, to go out into the world and do good to our fellow men, women and especially children. God bless Mentors and those who work and serve with them!
Mentors International	147857		/users/profile/195634	nonprofitadvisorsgroup	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/08/2013	A cursory review of this organizations published fiinancials statements show that they are diverting operational expenses to program related expenses to show that more money is spent on programs expenese versus operational expenses.  They have at least 5 full time employees for 7 foudations and their operational expenses as per their financial statements were less than US 70,000.  How is that possible? They included in their audits "Notes Receiveable" from partner organizations yet these notes are not asset back nor are they worth even a fraction of the value booked in the audit.  This is anohter attempt to hide the true nature of this company which is really to act as a fund raising organisation for the benefit of over-paid staff members.

Park City Performing Arts Foundation, DBA Park City Institute	271406		/users/profile/360238	probinson	Donor	5	11/06/2015	I have been a volunteer and patron of  the Park City Performing Arts Foundation/Park City Institute since it's founding in 1998. My husband and I are sponsors of the Park City Insitute because of the  quality and diversity of the programming, the organization's commitment to arts education in the schools and the inclusivness of its programming and community outreach. I joined its Board of Directors and now serve as its Chair because of the organization's sustained and demonstrated commitment to the arts and the Park City community.

It is one of those organizations that has something for everyone. I have gone to both summer concerts and Main Stage shows at the Eccles Center for years, but then recently found out that they offer free tutoring as well as a number of other programs dedicated to youth and enriching our community through the arts. What is most unbelievable to me is that they do it all on a shoe string budget and a tiny handful of employees. I proudly became a board member this past year and am dedicated to continuing and improving the mission.

My life has been tremendously enriched by all of the experiences I have had because of Park City Performing Arts Foundation, and I can only imagine the positive impact on the thousands of my fellow citizens as well... who have been sitting alongside me in wonder and thoughtfulness and awe at the amazing TEDxParkCity and Curiosities (to which I am hopelessly smitten and addicted) and all the inspiring performances at the Eccles Center and Deer Valley.  I have been introduced to things that have expanded my mind and heart and consciousness.  I believe in the power of live performance and live interaction to change the world, and to lead people in positive and productive directions.  It's more than just entertainment.  It's the illumination that is magical.  I urge you to participate, to donate and to connect with all of the ideas in all their forms that spring from this one organization. It's really remarkable.
Park City Performing Arts Foundation, DBA Park City Institute	30386	1	/users/profile/31369	robinwhitney	Donor	5	02/24/2010	I have been involved with the PCPAF in many capacities for many years.  As a patron of the arts, I have attended and enjoyed so many excellent arts events they have put on I can't even count them all.  Our town would not be the place it is without the opportunities that this organization provides to see, feel and experience such exceptionally high quality performing arts programs.As a active community member, I have attended numerous fundraising events sponsored by PCPAF which have been thoroughly uplifting to me as a person.  The Curiosities events are wondrous, and I heartily look forward to seeing where PCPAF's vision and gumption take them in building these curated events and "The Big Idea."Most recently as an in-kind donor, I have had the pleasure to work closely with the PCPAF team on branding and launching the Mega-Genius Supply Store & IQ HQ.  This team not only works wonders at conjuring up so much from nothing, but they are smart-cookie strategic thinkers too.All in all, this is a rave review. As for constructive criticism, I wish they were able to have more frequent performances, events and gatherings so that I could soak up more inspiration.

I bought tickets to five different concerts last summer; sometimes just one for myself, sometimes two or three to share with friends.  The music was fantastic, the atmosphere was amazing, but what really surprised and thrilled me was learning about how PCPAF works with the local schools to expose the kids to all kinds of the performing arts. It made my decision to attend these concerts even better knowing that some of the money goes toward showing young people what their future can hold. Looking forward to the winter schedule!

The Eccles Center is truly Park City's "front porch" and both risidents and guests benefit throughout the year.

Students, the hispanic community, local organizations, our senior citizens and religious organizations are among the groups that benefit from activities supported by PCPAF.The amount of outreach in the arts our students receive is first rate.  From music to dance, from speakers to Sundance films, our children have the opportunity to see and participate in the performing arts on a very personal level.Many of our underrepresented residents have the opportunity for complementary and reduced price tickets for events.  PCPAF staff make sure to include various other nonprofit organizations on a regular basis.Many children have the opportunity to have their first music or dance recital on stage because of this wonderful facility.  The Catholic church is able to provide Christmas Eve mass to over 2,000 locals and guests.  Funeral services, films, lectures, and community service meetings are held here on a regular basis.  This requires the efforts of PCPAF staff to organize, prepare, and attend these events at great effort on PCPAF's part.  The PCPAF board, staff and volunteers are famous for their efforts.  I am proud to be a part of such a fine organization.

Living in Park City offers such a unique lifestyle and one of its greatest assets is our access to cutting edge performances offered by the Park City Performing Arts Foundation.  The sheer joy of seeing unique acts in our state of the art theater in the winter is rivaled only by the opportunity to see live music under the stars at beautiful Deer Valley resort in the summer.
Park City Performing Arts Foundation, DBA Park City Institute	30470	7	/users/profile/31444	kelly4	Board Member	5	02/24/2010	As someone who grew up in the community, I can tell you that the addition of the Park City Performing Arts Foundation, nearly 15 years ago, has greatly improved our small town. They have always had a strong focus on bringing the arts to the community, not just through the performances on the stage, but through an amazing commitment to student and community outreach. Now, they are expanding their outreach to address the need for after school literacy tutoring for at-risk students. The ability of this organization to identify and work to solve the challenges facing our community, and provide more than just a stage for artists to perform on is truly unique. I am excited to see what else they bring to Park City.

Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	295984	1	/users/profile/386752	Writer	Donor	5	07/12/2016	Choice Humanitarian is incredible. They use every dollar wisely and are truly trying to make a difference for communities living in extreme poverty. Instead of just sending in supplies or money, they have teams on the ground that bring real change to make the communities self-sufficient and stronger on their own, thus allowing them to be independently prosperous. What a great model! 
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	295821		/users/profile/386602	choice	Volunteer	5	07/12/2016	The CHOICE Humanitarian model of development is extremely effective in capacity development, leadership training, connecting village leaders to community resources, producing sustainable industry/income through education, training and and the use of natural resources as well as laying a strong foundation of trust, commitment and vision for the villages where the CHOICE model is at work.I have the advantage of witnessing the power of the CHOICE model from the viewpoint of volunteer as well as an expedition leader and understand the amazing results that are produced.  CHOICE values individual dignity, creativity, leadership and the necessity of self-reliance to overcome the heavy weight and stigma of poverty.  There is an undeniable power associated with the strength and unity that comes from community-driven growth and development.  This is what CHOICE does!
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	295674		/users/profile/171176	Devin T.	Volunteer	5	07/12/2016	CHOICE Humanitarian is one of the few NGOs working around the world in a constructive, grass-roots way to completely eradicate extreme poverty. Their inclusive model is designed to lift entire communities out of poverty, giving them access to the global economy. They leverage donor funds multiple times through matching grants, government and local participation. Their model has been developed over 30 years of field work and relies neither on simplistic self-reliance or "leave them to weep" training nor on dependency-building donations. This is the one to support.
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	295620		/users/profile/386405	SharonSpauld	Donor	5	07/12/2016	I've been passionate about gender issues and root causes of chronic persistent hunger and extreme poverty since the late 1970s.  CHOICE is one of the very best organizations around that is effective and strategic.  CHOICE's model is about empowering its village partners in figuring out their vision for their future and then supporting them through leadership training and other tools, to realize those visions.  This model works.  The other thing I love about CHOICE is this:  too often people in developed countries think we have so much to offer "poor" people, as if we had a superior way of life.  Of course we have access to numerous opportunities and technologies and those scales are unbalanced, but the CHOICE model really allows those of us in developed countries to appreciate the tremendous assets, skills, and rich traditions of our human family who lives in poverty.  The most resourceful, creative, and hard-working people I've met are those who scrape together what they need daily to keep their families alive.  Often, in developed countries, we seem to lack a deep sense of connectedness to the world, so while our hunger is more of a spiritual nature, we have a great deal to learn from those in other parts of the world.  Go on an expedition with CHOICE!  Heal yourself.  Change the world!  CHOICE is doing just that.
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	124132		/users/profile/90596	Terry Madsen	Volunteer	5	10/01/2012	Not only is the Choice model of empowerment and village development a great one, but involving donors in expeditions where they have a chance to meet the people who will be benefiting from their donation is actually brilliant! When a person goes on a Choice expedition 2/3rds of the expedition cost actually goes towards the costs of the projects being worked on in that country. After my first trip to Nepal I realized that when a volunteer goes on a Choice Expedition, they are in the target country LESS to 'work on a project' and MORE to 'Make a connection with the people'. When volunteers feel 'connected' to the people of a certain country, as I do to Nepal, they will continue to donate to causes connected with Choice Humanitarian in that country and hopefully continue to go on expeditions as well. The Choice Humanitarian in country staff in Nepal is well educated, professional, enthusiastic, and a model for all other NGO's operating in Nepal. In fact the Nepal in country director Bishnu was invited to meet the President of Nepal who is quite interested in the Choice model and the success that Bishnu and Choice Humanitarian has had in helping to improve the standard of living in rural villages in Nepal. I am blessed to be involved with this organization.
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	124088	1	/users/profile/168891	drbsundown	Donor	5	10/01/2012	The one negative reviewer  of Choice doesn't understand that the labor contributed by US expeditioners is not intended to be a primary factor in getting projects built -- it is to give expeditioners an on-the-ground feel for the quality, importance and philosophy of the work being done, with the hope that will lead them down the path to becoming future financial supporters, not to provide an exotic vacation.  I am also amazed at the comment on excess staffing.  I have been intimately familiar with Choice's staffing levels for over 10 years, find that their lack of adequate staffing limits the amount good that can be done under their unique development philosophy and am very impressed with the amount of volunteer effort that makes up much of the Choice work.   The overwhelming focus of  Choice's funding is on showing indigenous peoples how to build self-sustaining health, educational  and small business projects and develop local leadership in the process so that those local leaders can lead their villages and regions toward further independence and well-being without continuing support from donors.
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	109780		/users/profile/149547	ColeB	Volunteer	5	04/12/2012	Everyone at CHOICE has the highest priority of outreach and helping others become self reliant.  It is an organization run by love, compassion, hard work and dedication to help others.  They are highly experienced and organized.  I could not recommend any Humanitarian Organization more highly.  
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	108385		/users/profile/147524	Michael Gnost	Volunteer	2	03/27/2012	Choice is a decent organization with a great philosophy for sustainable development (teaching villagers how to tackle big projects so that they can progress on their own). However, I disagree with how Choice utilizes (or rather, underutilizes) expeditioners. Choice Humanitarian teaches that it's about the villagers and the journey, and that we need to immerse ourselves in "village time" as part of our experience. The conclusion that they make is that we shouldn't impose developed world processes, urgency, efficiency, and increased production to projects. For example, we're told not to form bucket lines passing materials one to another and saving the energy of trekking back and forth, because the villager way of doing things is to plod along the entire way. Others tell stories of jumping into projects and generating a flurry of activity and progress, only to be asked by Choice staff to step aside and allow villagers to work at their own pace, and using their own methods. While I agree that it needs to be about the villagers, and that experiencing and gaining an appreciation for "village time" is valuable, I don't agree with their conclusion of not helping the villagers to apply developed world processes, urgency, efficiency, and increased production. Using that philosophy, expeditioners become tourists  dead weight. We're there to experience, and to fund, but not to improve. The villagers do 80% of the work, and the soft foreigners gamely do our best but can't hope to match the villager hardiness and endurance. The end result is that Choice involves expeditioners for the purpose of making them tourists and to get them to fund projects. We're no more than dead weight pocketbooks. We're just there on a REALLY expensive vacation. Additionally, this pigeon-holes villagers into the role of "gentle savages" who can only learn so much, and achieve so much. Choice tells us not to expect too much from them. LDS senior missionaries, on the other hand, are sent on service missions specifically to help developing nations improve their processes, efficiency, and productive capacity. Industrialized techniques and technologies are taught to those in developed areas. This opens up entirely new possibilities to them. There are many projects and achievements which villagers believe to be impossible, because with their current processes such achievements WOULD be impossible. If we can teach them new ways of doing things, then we can open up to them new possibilities and accomplishments. Instead of capping their progress, we can make it equal to our own. The cynic in me says that Choice may intentionally limit progress in order to minimize the actual amount of work that they have to do. Building relationships with villages is difficult, time intensive work, and if villages progress too quickly, then Choice has to spend more time developing those relationships rather than focusing on fund raising, which is what Choice would rather be doing. The idealist in me, however, just hopes that its a case of Choice drawing the wrong conclusions from their philosophies on village interactions. The other aspect of Choice Humanitarian that I find troubling is how many paid staff they have. I know a lot of people who have worked extensively with Choice over the years, and almost all of them left because of what they viewed as waste, and excessive overhead. There are more cost efficient organizations out there. The Choice philosophy about this seems to be "We're doing great things so we deserve to reward ourselves and our staff" rather than "We're doing great things and we're willing to make personal sacrifices in order to achieve them."
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	82299		/users/profile/90614	heather lovell	Volunteer	4	03/15/2011	A good organization for family volunteerism. CHOICE partners with motivated village leadership  to choose self-sustaining projects in  poverty striken areas. Expeditioners are then brought in to work side by side with entire communities building schools, clinics, and water sources.       
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	82294		/users/profile/90607	jordan menzel	Volunteer	5	03/15/2011	CHOICE is an organization that creates opportunities for everyone to get involved! They wisely use their resources and efficiently engage community members to donate their time and talents to the organization. By doing this, they save money on administration and in turn focus funds on the projects. After seeing this model of administration, I was quickly impressed to get involved. 
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	82293	1	/users/profile/90606	Kelsey Stark	Volunteer	5	03/15/2011	I volunteered with CHOICE on an expedition to Bolivia in 2008.  I had volunteered internationally before and although I had a good experience, I was wary of international NGOs because I saw desperate need for change, even though I plan to work in the field.  CHOICE was a very positive experience and exceeded my expectations.  Their approach to international development is at a grassroots level and involves the local people every step of the way to ensure a sustainable future.  As a volunteer, you will feel like you contributed very little, and that's great, because you will not be the one to sustain this project into the future.  That belongs to the people of the village and they need to hold responsibility and ownership of the projects.  CHOICE makes sure that the villagers are prepared before and after the brief visit from international volunteers to undertake these projects.  As a volunteer, you will exchange cultures and a become a part of something bigger than yourself.  You will inevitably take away so much from this experience and have the assurance that CHOICE will ensure success in the village after your departure.  CHOICE gives me hope for international NGOs everywhere, and theirs is a model worth following!
Center for Humanitarian Outreach and Intercultural Exchange	82277		/users/profile/90576	S. Sessions	Volunteer	5	03/15/2011	I first stumbled upon CHOICE through one of it's sister organizations.  I did my research of how the organization worked and instantly fell in love with it.  CHOICE encourages people everywhere to make a difference in their own lives and of the lives of those around them.  It is an upward spiral of teaching, learning, and doing.   For example they have expeditions that send out anyone willing to participate for a few weeks in one of the 5 different countries they work in.  One of my friends went on an "expedition" last year and loved it so much is going again this year.  You work side by side with the villagers, learning from them and their humility.  Reminding us of how fortunate we are. It truly changes lives.

Rocky Mountain Care Foundation	125653	1	/users/profile/170884	andrus.ray	Volunteer	4	10/16/2012	A couple of months ago, I saw an article in a local paper regarding the work RMCF was doing helping elderly and handicapped people with home repairs that these people were no longer capable of doing for themselves.  I have worked in construction for over 55 years. Having recently retired, I want to stay active and feel that using my skills to help what I consider an underserved portion of our community would be good for me and good for our community. I sent an email to Dede Fluette of RMCF offering my services. Dede responded back to me that same day.  I met with Dede and Joel Warren, RMCF volunteer coordinator, a few days later. I learned that Joel is an Americor Volunteer, a knowledge that further made me feel good about helping. Both Joel and Dede were obviously dedicated to their work and are fine people. I readily joined with them as a volunteer.  Since that time I have performed home repairs for six different elderly widows and one elderly lady whose husband suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm. These women have ranged in age from late 70's to 92 years old.  They are ALL very grateful for the help.  Each has been the kind of person who has been independent all their life and they continue to take care of their homes as best they can.  To fix their plumbing, repair their roof, trim tree branches that may damage roofing, replace an unsafe porch and stair, clean rain gutters, fix broken sprinklers and make home safety inspections has been very rewarding to me and helpful to these fine people who simply can't do these things for themselves.  All have been  tremendously grateful and appreciative.  It simply makes a guy feel good. (Not to mention the occasional bag of vegetables from a small garden that some insist I take home with me.)  RMCF is a fine organization that I am very happy to serve with.  Ray Andrus 801-435-4040.  andrus.ray@gmail.com

I lost the hearing in my left ear in 2011 due to a devistating bout of bacterial meningitis. The hospital that I was in referred me to their audiology department where they were conducting clinical trials of a brand new hearing system for Single Sided Deafness (SSD). The only catch to doing it was there was a cost associated with it. I had not been able to work in 8 months due to illness, and money was in such short supply that I figured I would never be able to get this hearing system. My physical therapist was at a Rocky Mountain Care facility and told me about the foundation. The foundation was able to help me get this hearing system which has given me the confidence I once had prior to my hearing loss. I COMPLETELY RECCOMMEND THIS FOUNDATION!!

Friends In Need	104611	2	/users/profile/140281	Karen56	Volunteer	5	01/26/2012	At Friends in Need Animal Sanctuary I have seen animals that are emaciated and injured taken in at FIN, and transformed literally into beautiful, healthy, happy creatures!  Karen and Kim have found their purpose on Earth, and have taken the love and gift that they have for nurturing unwanted and mistreated animals and made a Sanctuary so that these critters can have a safe place to live out their lives.  They do all of this through much needed donations.  The City Library put on a fundraiser for FIN, and I was blown away but the outpouring of support from the people who gave!  But Karen and Kim not only love animals, they love people, and have opened their hearts to many who want to come and volunteer:  Scouts, community service, troubled teens, families who want to learn the value of giving back.  I love just going out and helping feed the animals.  Each one has a unique story, and Karen never tires of telling you about them.  They are her babies!  Potbelly pigs, emus, sheep, goats, horses, ducks, geese, turkeys...I have never seen them turn a creature away.  When they run out of room, they find more room!

Friends In Need	104421	1	/users/profile/140017	sdelg	Client Served	5	01/25/2012	One wonderful rescue dog has come into our life and made us better people.  We were looking for a medium to large dog to rescue and there she was...almost in our backyard.  We live in Eagle Mountain, UT and just down the road was Friends In Need.  We saw Gracie on their website and called to make arrangements to meet Gracie.  We were excited about the prospect of a new dog to be part of our family.  We got into the car with our then 11 year old dog and headed to Friends in Need.  What amazing individuals we met.  I sat for a short while with Gracie.  I walked a short while with Gracie.  We introduced her to our 11 year old and within those 30 or so minutes, I knew she was mine.  Through the years, we have read the stories from this amazing organization.  They have saved every variety of animal and they are more than willing to go above and beyond to save an animal.  They put their needs and wants last so the animals are taken care of.  The owners are amazing and I recommend individuals to contact Friends in Need for their next adoption.  
Friends In Need	104377		/users/profile/139954	Cortney C.	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	For the past year or so I have been volenteering my time helping tend to the needs on abused and neglected animals at Friends in Need. Along with getting the opportunity to share my love with abused and neglected animals, I have also learned much about many different species and how to meet their individual needs. There is one animal in praticular that has captured my heart. Her name is DK (dumpster kitty) she is a cute, fluffy, white, female, persian cat. She gained her name through her tragic story, she was discovered abused and abandoned most likely left to die in a dumpster. She had a huge gash is the top of her head and required much medical attention and care. Thats where Friends in Need stepped in. I have watched an animal that has been through so much and trust humans so little because of it, but as she began to spend time at Friends in Need Ive watched her slowly open up to me and a few individuals. I love Friends in Need! it is such a valuable and beneficial orginzation in our community. Over the past year I have seen the difference and the major impact that Friends in Need has made on both humans and animals. My wish is that I may continue to see such changes continue to take place :) The owners Kim and Karen have set a wonderful example for me and as a college student I have decided to major in business with the intention of one day starting a business just like Friends in Need that makes the world a better place.
Friends In Need	104343	1	/users/profile/139910	Jackie B.	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	Kim and Karen O'Donnell have really been an inspiration to me and to my family and many, many others.  They are the most unselfish people I have ever met in my life.  I will never ever forget when I first met them after hearing about their rescue of a dog who was left on the side of the road after being hit by a car.  The poor innocent soul was left to die.  When the O'Donnell's came across this special dog they immediately went into action.  They were not and still are not wealthy people, yet that took that innocent precious animal to the vet and October was theirs!  They since sold the home they once had and have built an animal rescue in Eagle Mountain.  At first they went up against a lot of opposition with other people in the neighbourhood who did not want them there, but they continued to be  kind and respectful neighbours themselves and have become an important part of Eagle Mountain, Utah County and the whole country in my eyes.  They sacrifice day in day out without complaint.  Kim has to be on oxygen because of medical reasons but will not ever give up on the animals in their care who they refer to as their "kids" and when they say "our kids" they mean it whole heartedly, they ARE their kids.  They work around the clock with very little sleep caring for so many different animals who would otherwise be in dire straits.  I was over there one day for a few hours with my daughter and we did very little in comparison to the O'Donnell's.  Karen is of small frame yet she hauls hay, climbs fences, builds fences, tackles naughty goats!!  She is a kind soul as is Kim her husband.  What an inspiration.  My own daughter told me that she hopes she will find someone exactly like Kim some day to be her husband.  A lot can be said for someone who is a strong man who could be out with his buddies at night, but instead is side by side with his wife caring for all kinds of animals.  They have very little for themselves.  Their entire house is dedicated to the animals.  They time I was there they had a dog who was wearing a diaper who they had to carry in and out.  There was another who had been abandoned on the streets who was so week she couldn't stand on her back legs.  They nursed her back to health.  The animals clearly love them.  Sometimes they even have to (as they say) send some on their way to Heaven, humanely of course with a kind vet who volunteers there and they are with them as they leave this world and they feel the devastation and loss that some people don't even feel when a human dies.  They are totally committed to what they do, it's their life.  Each morning Kim drives quite a distance to a store that donates food they would otherwise be throwing out which he then brings home and they cut it up and feed it to the animals.  They don't get to stay inside in the warm when it is raining or snowing or boiling hot outside.  They carry on and make sure each an every animal has a loving place to be, to be safe and cared for.  They have inspired me so much.  They need volunteers there as much as possible, but they have to do so much by themselves, almost everything, like I said without complaint.  Just recently after a huge snow storm their farm area got flooded, it was Karen's birthday, but she wouldn't have that on her mind........Karen was out digging trenches.  They are life savers and there has to be a special place in Heaven for those two.  I plan to go and help them more this year and I hope that others will too because once you have been there and have met them and their "kids" you will leave feeling that with people like that in this world there is still hope, hope that people can be kinder and more gentle and show unconditional love and these animals do to us.  Even abused animals are so forgiving of those that have harmed them.  The O'Donnell's are a blessing the this world.  Thank you for reading this.   Jackie Ballif
Friends In Need	104311		/users/profile/139860	JennyBeans	General Member of the Public	5	01/24/2012	I first came into contact with FIN when I was looking for a rescue to take an animal in need.  Since then I have been a donor, a volunteer, a customer, a participant and now feel as though I am part of the FIN family.  For the community, this organization is integral.  Not only do they rehabilitate, rescue, provide sanctuary and find forever families for animals of all kinds they also provide additional community service.  The owners are advocates for animals and they visit schools to provide information about animal selection, care and education on animals.  Classes and organizations are also welcome to visit the FIN grounds to learn about the domestic and exotic residents.  FIN also aides the community by allowing individuals to fulfill community service hours working on the grounds.  I have also been impressed with the fact that they will also permit group homes/rehabilitation homes to visit FIN and work off service hours.  Probably the biggest good impression I have had of FIN in the amount and detailed care that each animal receives.  Each resident is considered "family".  They all have names, receive one-on-one attention, individualized diet care (as needed), young birds receive food via dropper, malnourished animals receive full rehabilitation and each member is individually loved and cared for.  I have never met another couple who have given so much of themselves for the benefit/welfare of our animal friends.
Friends In Need	104299		/users/profile/139842	JayWNielsen	General Member of the Public	5	01/24/2012	Non-stop help and search for animals in need.  No special animals.  ALL four legged animals.  Outstanding loving, caring, and understanding people in charge.
Friends In Need	104298		/users/profile/139838	Mari M.	Volunteer	5	01/24/2012	Friends In Need is an amazing sanctuary for all furry and feathered friends.  All critters that make their way to this little piece of heaven on earth are shown the utmost care, love and kindness.  Kim and Karen O'Donnell are two of the most incredible people you will ever meet.  I came to know of them  when I had rescued Diesel, a black Schnauzer, from the Draper Animal Shelter that was scheduled to be put down that day.  After several unsuccessful attempts on my part of finding him a permanent home, I called Karen and she said "bring him on out!".  When I arrived, I realized that this was the greatest thing that could have happened for Mr. Diesel and I knew he would be well taken care of.  A few years have past since Diesel and I made our way to Eagle Mountain and he has recently been adopted into a loving permanent home.  I could never show Kim and Karen how grateful I am for everything they did for Diesel and ALL the other friends out there.  In an attempt, my husband and I have organized our family and friends to go out and do fall cleanups/repairs and have collected much needed supplies for them on a yearly basis.  In fact, I am in the middle of organizing another round up for this spring as I type this.  I am so proud to have been involved with such a beautiful place and am so grateful to have Kim and Karen a part of my life - my forever friends!
Friends In Need	104144		/users/profile/139323	umaibo	Volunteer	5	01/22/2012	The founders, Kim and Karen, are definitely committed and love what they do at Friends in Need. They turned their home into a shelter and take care of them every day. I helped them prepare food and feed the animals. It was a fun and interesting experience feeding large animals. While preparing food, I was talking to Kim and Karen and they were very warm and easy to talk to. If you want to know or experience what animal shelters go through, this is the perfect place to volunteer. 
Friends In Need	103574		/users/profile/137184	lchan	Volunteer	5	01/17/2012	I volunteered for Friends in Need per a friends suggestion and found the experience to greatly exceed my expectations. Kim and Karen are the founders of the animal rescue. They were extremely warm, friendly, and hardworking. Although I arrived early in the morning, they had already been at work for a while.   I first spent some time cutting up vegetables and fruit for the animals; it was a simple task but you quickly realize how much time it takes for only two people to do this amount of food preparation everyday. Kim and Karen have literally built the rescue around their livesit is in their backyard and they relentlessly spend every single day making it is a safe haven for animals. Amazing! I have a lot of respect for Kim and Karen. The sheer magnitude of their passion and humility is a rarity.  
Friends In Need	103049		/users/profile/136715	hoht	Volunteer	4	01/08/2012	I came down to volunteer with a friend in June. They had us help them remove the old hay and place a couple of new bales of hay down. My initial thought was that this was way too easy. However two hours later, I found myself nearly out of breath when we finish. I find that I had only spent a fraction of the day working and I was already exhausted. Karen and Kim do this day in and day out. I really have a lot of respect for the level of compassion and commitment these guys put in to what they love to do. I believe this is a great place to really get your hands dirty and really know that your making a difference doing it.
Friends In Need	103046	1	/users/profile/136703	mblack47	Volunteer	5	01/08/2012	I came across Friends-In-Need in Aug. 2010 after reading about an opportunity to volunteer at their first 5K fundraiser. I contacted them that same day and even though it was only over the phone, I was welcomed with open arms, so to speak. Wanting to know more about their organization in general, I visited the Rescue a few days later and immediately understood why I was drawn to Friends-In-Need and their cause. What I found was an organization that genuinely and sincerely cares about the happiness and welfare of their animals. I was very much impressed with owners Kim and Karen O'Donnell, and their dedication to taking animals in, mainly out of horrific situations, who undoubtedly would not have survived otherwise. They know the story behind every animal rescued. It is their compassion that inspires me to continue with my volunteerism, both with Friends-In-Need and other nonprofit organization in Utah. I have experiences volunteering at the 2010 and 2011 Friends-In-Need Stampede 5k's, a local city Halloween contest,  and visits to help feed the animals and maintenance around the property. In an effort to generate more awareness of the Rescue, I nominated Friends-In-Need to my employer last spring to be our next nonprofit service project . About 20 of my coworkers and I visited the Rescue to help repair fences and clean out the area for the pigs and rabbits. My coworkers enjoyed it so much that a second visit was made to Friends-In-Need to plant trees. I have worked with many nonprofits over the past few years and I feel Friends-In-Need Animal Rescue has been the most sincere in their cause and appreciative of the volunteers that they come into contact with. I highly recommend Friends-In-Need to anyone who loves animals and can appreciate a great nonprofit.
New Play Project	30227	4	/users/profile/31226	tatum	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/23/2010	I had the wonderful opportunity to act in a play produced by New Play Project. It was great to work with people who have a desire to bring value to the community. I love that New Play Project gives an opportunity to those who love theater and need a venue in which to grow. My only suggestion would be in marketing. The marketing could definitely be better. I think with better marketing the New Play Project will be able to grow and continue to offer opportunities to writers, actors, etc.
New Play Project	29541	5	/users/profile/30556	wayka	Former Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	New Play Project is a perfect opportunity for new playwrights to see their works produced on a stage and modify their writing accordingly.  Many wonderful playwrights contribute to the shows, and I love seeing the original works presented in such a friendly, professional atmosphere.  I have performed for New Play Project multiple times and I have consistently been welcomed by the enthusiasm and kindness of the program directors.  It is impressive to me how New Play Project continues to earn enough money to produce plays multiple times throughout the year.  New Play Project is clearly invaluable to the rising film, acting, play writing and theater scene in Provo.  This is obvious when you see the number of talented young individuals who work consistently with New Play Project.
New Play Project	29398	10	/users/profile/30424	anothername	Client Served	4	02/19/2010	I attended a night of one act plays written by locals and despite the sparse resources of the theater, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, especially for the low ticket price. Great activity.
New Play Project	29084	6	/users/profile/30126	john5	Donor	5	02/18/2010	New Play Projects isn't only a unique and vital venue for young and upcoming playwrights, actors, and directors, it also consistently provides the best theater experiences I've had in Utah. It's a positively invaluable asset to the local arts scene.
New Play Project	28935	3	/users/profile/29980	carretero	Client Served	5	02/18/2010	These plays are AMAZING!!! We have not gone to one without having a very uplifting cathartic experience. It's so cool to see quality plays that are original and well-produced. It's also good to be able to support up-and-coming playwrites, directors, actors, etc.
New Play Project	28802	3	/users/profile/29864	cpace	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	I have attended many of the shows put on by New Play Project and they are phenomenal! Their work is clean and tasteful and through it they are able to open the eyes of community members. You can tell that it's a great opportunity for playwrights and actors to grow and explore new issues, but for the average non-artistic viewer like myself it is an incredible experience to go and share in the energy and meaning of the shows. I would recommend it to anyone.
New Play Project	28755	4	/users/profile/29809	ben1	Client Served	5	02/17/2010	I took a date to one of their shows and it was great. We watched several short plays related by a common theme. The plays were generally well done. Some of them needed some work, but I actually enjoyed being able to see plays at different stages of development. Most of all I enjoyed how members of the community came together to make original plays for other members of the community. This is an implementation of art that we don't get to see much.
New Play Project	28673	4	/users/profile/29716	sam3	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	This organization allows people to explore their talents in a comfortable and safe environment. I don't really classify myself as an actor, but I was able to do something I love without having to dedicate my whole life to it. Through the 3 short plays I participated in, I gained a deeper appreciation of both acting and play writing. The plays explored interesting relationships and inner struggles that occur everyday. This organization blesses the life of any who participates in it.
New Play Project	28659	3	/users/profile/29700	dennis2	General Member of the Public	5	02/17/2010	I found New Play Project online, and it was like discovering a gold mine of like-minded individuals seeking to develop new works from rough drafts to actual productions on stage.I've only attended a few productions and a few of their new play workshops, but have found the people there open to new people coming in and bringing their ideas.One of my favorite discoveries with the group is that the new play workshops are attending by actors and theater students, so the lines sound so much better than a flat reading that a group of playwrights alone might give it.
New Play Project	28633	8	/users/profile/29669	teeps	Volunteer	4	02/17/2010	I first got involved with New Play Project because a friend told me to come watch him act in a show.  A month later he told me they were looking for actors for their next show.  I auditioned and was cast.  As part of that show I found that they needed help doing the technical things, like building the set and organizing props and scene changes, so I helped with that.  Then the Artistic Director asked if I wanted to be officially the Technical Director, a post which I have held for the last two years.  What I love about New Play Project is that anyone and everyone can get involved and be involved as much or as little as they want to be.  We've had people who simply come watch every show, we've had people who have acted in one show and then we've never seen them again, and we've had people who come see a show, then act in a show and then we can't get rid of them; they're always around helping out in one way or another!  The best thing about New Play Project, though, in my opinion is that it gives practical theatre experience to people who would not normally have those kinds of opportunities.  The only theatre experience I had when I started was acting in a few shows in High School, but thanks to New Play Project I learned first hand what it's like to manage and organize scene changes and sets and props. I even got to learn how to hang lights and design lights for a show.  It was great experience that I will always be grateful for.And with their focus on 'values driven theatre', I knew that all of the plays that were performed would have good, moral messages, or at least be something I wouldn't be ashamed to invite friends to see. At times they pushed the envelope, just a bit, by showing things not typically shown in such a conservatively religious community, but those shows were always tastefully done and done to bring some issues to light that are not often talked about.  All in all I have loved every moment I have spent with New Play Project, and I hope to be able to recreate something similar when I graduate from college and move to wherever I end up being.
New Play Project	28630	6	/users/profile/29667	davey	Volunteer	5	02/17/2010	New Play Project has helped me grow tremendously as a writer, producer, and director. I've seen some of the best plays of my life here, and I've had the opportunity to touch audiences and make them laugh and move them and make them think about life differently. I've been touched and laughed and moved and thought about life differently as an audience member. I've had chances to have my work produced as a writer, to act, to direct, to produce; I've learned, I've gotten better (I hope) at what I love to do. What's better than that?
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	111162	3	/users/profile/151303	Bob_7	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	I've been teaching Square Foot Gardening for the last four years to children at the Rahway, New Jersey YMCA. The gardening techniques are easy to understand and simple to implement and completely natural and organic. Our Square Foot Gardening program for the Y continues to strengthen and is poised to become a prototype for other Y's to duplicate. Sincerely, Bob Markey-Certified Square Foot Gardening Instructor.
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	111154	3	/users/profile/151294	SusanH	General Member of the Public	5	04/30/2012	I support this foundation because it saves the environment, promotes healthy lifestyles, reduces our carbon footprint (no more local than in your own yard!) and helps the poor cut their food bills. I think if everyone in developing countries had the SFG knowledge, they would be empowered to help themselves and their community forever. Takes much less water than a regular row garden - that's a big plus. I think SFG is a way of life and would recommend this foundation and the SFG gardening methods to anyone.
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	111133	3	/users/profile/151272	jamieop	Volunteer	5	04/30/2012	Working with the Square Foot Garden Foundation has been phenomenal! They have guided us every step of the way, shared best practices, and helped us harvest. They strongly recommend using your resources- from starting a compost pile to water conservation, and using only the seeds and soil that you need. The method is easy and perfect for all ages!
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	111083	3	/users/profile/151176	Da5id	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2012	Square Foot Gardening saves the environment because it uses no fertilizer or pesticides. That means no fertilizer runoff into the rivers & oceans. Fertilizer runoff causes red tides, fish kills and dead zones. Pesticides kill helpful insects & pollinators (bees, ladybugs & butterflies) as well as pests.
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	111077	2	/users/profile/151169	Karrin P.	General Member of the Public	5	04/29/2012	As a result of reading and studying the SFG method, I have turned my front yard and back yard into a space that produces 40% of my family's vegetables and fruit between May and October. The reason: I am an avid supporter of eating locale and organic, and I can't get any more local and organic that what I grown myself. I also teach college at Bellevue College, located in (oddly enough) Bellevue, Washington. I have the privelege of being the student garden counselor there. I use SFG methods to help students make easy to care for and productive gardens, thereby spreading the message of how to help reduce the world's food crisis--one young person at a time. Like Heifer International, the SFG system enables people to feed themselves and teaches self-respect and integrity through being self-sufficient. It also teaches peace. After an afternoon in the sun tending plants, I'm not in the mood to go grab an AK-47 and engage in the wrong kind of political activism. Perhaps it's a nurturing female-thing, but I think that if we humans were more connected to the earth that feeds us and the animals that sustain us, and we learned to have some self-restraint in our wants and desires, this world could become something more closely resembling the beautiful allegory called the Garden of Eden. Mel Bartholomew and the SFG foundation are leading the charge towards this vision of a better future.
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	111004	2	/users/profile/151078	Kim R.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/28/2012	Through the SFG Foundation I have become a certified SFG instructor.  Mel encourages ALL of us to add a a humanitarian component if we decide to start a SFG-related business.  He was wise to do this because when we help others, we ourselves become fulfilled.  Because of Mel's guidance there is now a demonstration bed at The Samaritan Women in Baltimore.  Soon there will be a SFG at Park Elementary School (Brooklyn Park, MD) and in just a few days we are installing the first SFG bed at homeless residences in the Glen Burnie area.  I never would have had the skills or confidence to tackle these projects without the help and encouragement of the SFG Foundation.  
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	110965	2	/users/profile/151037	Judy29	General Member of the Public	5	04/27/2012	I am an avid gardener and live in eastern NC.  I also have rheumatoid arthritis.  This method of gardening enables me to continue to do what I love and continue to be productive by gardening.  The traditional method of "row planting" was just too labor intensive and causes the RA to flare up which is painful.  Square Foot Gardening is not as labor intensive as traditional methods, uses less resources and water!  A raised bed is used so there are no weeding chores.  A LOT of vegetables are produced in a small space using this method.  We have had drought here for the past two summers, but using the Square Food Gardening method of planting, I was still able to have a bountiful harvest.  I would highly recommend this method to anyone needing to grow in small spaces and most especially for those like myself with physical limitations or those with limited means.
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	110951	2	/users/profile/151021	Amy Lea	Volunteer	5	04/27/2012	I just moved from a home with a  large yard & garden into a small town home.

Square Foot Gardening Foundation	110860	2	/users/profile/150901	Garden Inspire	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/26/2012	As a garden coach I have used the Square Foot Gardening at four houses in two states in the last 20+ and teach as many people as I can about this gardening method.  Square Foot Gardening is the easiest way to garden that I know of - save water, less work (almost no weeding), save seeds (no planting extra to thin out later), save space.  Even for those who have plenty of area to garden you can grow more variety or just more.  Whether you live in a house, apartment, townhouse, or condo you should be able to grow some of your own food.  Never gardened before? No problem!  You can be growing your own food within weeks.  Copies of the book All-New Square Foot Gardening are available almost anywhere.  The Square Foot Gardening Foundation's website has information and lists of teachers plus a Forum for asking questions and posting photos of your garden.  No matter where you live in the world you CAN grow some food!
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	110848	2	/users/profile/150886	Amie H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/26/2012	The Square Foot Gardening Foundation provides educational support and opportunity beyond comparison to the world!  I have found support from key members at the foundation, and especially from creator and founder Mel Bartholomew in answering general logistical questions, as well as ideas and ways of offering practical support for several community based projects locally that I have spearheaded, such as school gardens, Boy Scout initiatives and non-profit ventures.  I so love this fun and easy method of growing vegetables, fruit, flowers and herbs that I was inspired to earn my Square Foot Gardening Instructor Certification!  This combines perfectly with my work and passion as a certified health coach, where I truly feel I can inspire individuals, children and families to connect to their food, their community and the land - improving their health, one square foot at a time.   It is a pleasure and a privilege to be an ambassador associated with this organization whose mission is to end world hunger.  The tools, materials, support and certification program provide empowerment, build confidence and strengthen that "can do attitude" that the world needs more of.  I have seen first hand how implementing, introducing and inspiring others to use the SFG method where you simply build a box, fill it with perfect soil, place a grid on top and get green by growing changes and improves peoples lives, their health, their happiness and who they are in the world!  I proudly recommend the Square Foot Gardening Foundation.
Square Foot Gardening Foundation	110828	2	/users/profile/150848	Myrtle	General Member of the Public	5	04/26/2012	I love Square Foot Gardening Foundation because I feel they are doing wonderful work around the world. Their goal is to end world hunger by teaching people how to garden. It is a very great thing, not the old-fashioned way of gardening in a row. This type of gardening is in square foot or square meter boxes, with grids on top. The advantages over the old row method are many, such as it saves way more space than the old way. You can grow just as much as a great big row garden in a tiny space. It saves water too, which is important since there is a water crisis, especially in developing countries. It saves time, NO WEEDS since you use all compost in a special blend. It is great for poor people with limited land and resources! But also good for anyone because the food is the most nutritious. I support SFGF because I believe it can help save lives and the environment with organic and easy-to-do methods.

I had a first hand experience on what this organization would and could give and I would always see everyone go the extra mile to encourage, help, support, in anything the public needed. If you ever need a little boost in the soul I highly suggest volunteering, donating, and even becoming a Family Connection Center client.
The Family Connection Center Inc	230029		/users/profile/293687	jayedwards88	General Member of the Public	5	10/30/2014	I've donated to a lot of food banks over the years through scouting and other community and neighborhood activities.  I like to volunteer to help take the food to the food banks because I like to see how they do things there.  I like the Family Connection Center food bank because of how I've seen the guys in the warehouse and volunteers work with the people.  Everybody is respectful.  Plus I've never seen a food bank with so much fresh fruit and vegetables and meat that the clients get to have.  Usually it's just cans of food, but it looks like these guys get really great stuff to help families.
The Family Connection Center Inc	226137		/users/profile/289877	Garry B.	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I have volunteered for about a year at FCC documenting their giving operation to the community in photos. I'm amazed with the many volunteers; for instance about 50 helpers from Hill AFB came one Saturday to help unload several semi-trailers of food. So quick the trucks were unloaded using a chain of people handing off to each other. Also it is quite different the FCC approached in that they aren't a free handout, but teach the user skills to help lift them up. They also have a daycare for parents to use while looking for jobs. What a service!  From my experience a community cannot have just one pantry, there needs to be more for the better. FCC fills a gap in the community. Best,Garry Bryant

Their dedicated employees are experienced in helping with a variety of issues and if they arent able to meet the needs of our clients they know where to direct us in the community to get the help we need for our clients/families.  I dont know what we or Davis County would do without this great organization.  There just isnt any other service organization doing what they do here and they do it with professionalism and heart.  --Merri Ann Perkins, Director of Davis Community Learning Center
The Family Connection Center Inc	211895		/users/profile/274841	scottharb	General Member of the Public	5	08/22/2014	As a former Board member of the Family Connection Center, I saw first hand the value and benefit that that the FCC provided Davis County. They do not just give a hand out to those in need, but rather a hand up in assisting with physical needs as well as educating and promoting self reliance.  A few years ago we decided at my place of business to do a fund raiser at our annual golf outing to help a local non profit. We chose the FCC because of the wonderful benefits they provide the community. Each year we have a double or nothing hole on a tough par 3. They put up a few dollars, and if their ball lands within the circle on the green they can double their wager. The awesome thing about the golfers at our event is that even if they do hit within the circle they donate all the winnings back to the FCC. Our company then takes the total and doubles it. I truly am grateful for the work this non profit does within the county. Thanks Family Connection Center!! 
The Family Connection Center Inc	211704		/users/profile/274630	Tamara20	Board Member	4	08/21/2014	I'm a consumer representative on the Board of directors for the FCC for 9 years.  I've seen many great things happening with the FCC over the years.  Many success stories of families who have been helped in getting self-sufficient. Great nursery for those who need help with child care when parents are in a pinch. A food bank that serves many throughout our communities. And a safe haven for those who need some added support. Great board members volunteering their time to make these programs successful. The staff members are friendly and work very hard to maintain and run such a special program to help with those in need. These programs are so important in helping many get back on tract to have successful lives. Thank you for all your services and keep up the great work now and in the future.  - Tamara Pont
The Family Connection Center Inc	210614		/users/profile/273387	Amanda146	Volunteer	5	08/13/2014	I am a counselor intern with FCC; and have been here for over a year. I am grateful for the opportunity that I have been given to meet and get to know not just the clients but the staff at Family Connection. From the time I began I have been welcomed by the staff. I also would like to say that I have had an amazing supervisor who has helped me grow and become a better counselor. I am sad to be leaving but happy to be leaving with the knowledge that the staff, clients, and my supervisor have given me.
The Family Connection Center Inc	209033		/users/profile/271793	juliejulesjulie	Client Served	5	08/07/2014	When my family was in need of help, the Family Connection Center was our answer.  With life crashing down all around us, the caring counselors and staff at the FCC were more than willing to extend a helping hand and assist us in putting our lives back in order.  Without the compassionate care, education, empathy, and dedication my family received during what was, to us, a pivotal moment in time, we certainly would not be doing as well as we are (thankfully) today.  My children were comfortable talking through tough issues with caring and gentle counselors and were given tools to help them find peace and comfort during our difficult time.  As their mother, that meant everything to me.  I, too,  received the same quality of care and found all those with whom I interacted to be genuinely concerned & supportive with a wealth of knowledge, insight, and advice.  I wasn't just another client to this organization... when I met with my counselor or worked with a staff member... I felt like I was his/her ONLY client.  Although I found the FCC by chance during a moment of family crisis, I will continue to find the FCC by choice anytime myself or my family has need of any of their services.  This is an amazing organization and I owe them many thanks!
The Family Connection Center Inc	199342		/users/profile/260251	rjhhh	Volunteer	5	04/30/2014	I personally like that the Family Connection Center makes a direct impact on our community. I feel like my time and donations are helping make our community a better place for everyone to live. I love that their programs really help people avoid poverty and abuse through education while giving short-term support. For 3 years now, our youth group has held a food drive for the Family Connection Center. It is great to see the youth gain an understanding of how they can help others that may not be as fortunate as them. 
Shriners Hospitals for Children  Salt Lake City	303560	1	/users/profile/394734	Wade3	Client Served	5	09/12/2016	Most of us think of hospitals as these awful places you never want to go to. But Shriners comes from a dream world.  When you walk through the big rotating doors you feel like you're entering this magical, sacred temple for children. The burdens of the real world no longer exist and you and your child are now being truly cared for. The fact that it is completely free is of course an enormously important component to Shriners' success. Gone is the stress and worry of how to pay for what are complicated and increasingly expensive procedures.  My daughter's condition is Spina Bifida. It is degenerative. Our goals are always aimed at fighting what is ultimately an escalating and losing battle. Knowing that the costs will not increase for us as a family cannot be overemphasized. When you work with the staff at Shriners, you can tell that they not only care about your child, but you sense that they are extremely good at what they do. They are clearly a cut above what you would experience on average at a typical hospital. The professionals there have opinions and they are not afraid to share them with you and educate you on your options. But they are also open to other routes, taking into consideration the feelings and priorities of the family. I've been particularly impressed with our daughter's physical therapist. Motivating a child to do things that are hard and may cause pain is a real gift from heaven. He's been incredible at helping her get excited about her work and teaching us parents how to do the same. Because of my experience with this hospital I feel strongly that this is one of the best organizations in the world to donate one's time and money, and I've committed myself to do just that for the rest of my life.

Women's World Health Initiative	84851		/users/profile/94281	s.wolf	Volunteer	5	04/05/2011	I just recently started volunteering with WWHI and I can already see the intense commitment each and every person puts into this organization. I feel as though the attention and support WWHI gives to the women in communities in which they would otherwise ignored is truly remarkable. 
Women's World Health Initiative	84825		/users/profile/94232	Heather Berg	Volunteer	5	04/05/2011	WWHI really has a great idea that to build a community, building up the women in the community is crucial. This has been proven and WWHI does a wonderful job of bringing money and resources together to educate and enable these women in underdeveloped countries. 
Women's World Health Initiative	84751		/users/profile/94097	kristinqueathem	Volunteer	5	04/04/2011	I have been volunteering with WWHI for a few months now and I am so greatful to be involved with an organization that specifically focuses on helping Women. Although I am not currently living in Utah or attending any regular events, I love hearing stories of our success. Recently, Dana shared some of her experience from a recent trip to Sengal. It is amazing that she and her team have been able to travel over there
Women's World Health Initiative	84023		/users/profile/93136	mkgilmore	Volunteer	5	03/30/2011	I have spent the past 9 months working with this amazing organization. My interest and support began based on its sole purpose of helping women in need of greater healthcare access, especially mothers. Mothers are vital to any community as nurturers, caretakers, economic providers, and in the education and development of the next generation. WWHI differs from other organizations in that it is organizationally solid, with a talented and dedicated team of core volunteers who make WWHI's mission a priority in their lives. I recently accompanied the Executive Director and a few other staff members to Senegal, where we are currently working, and experienced first hand a global community of women working together to improve and sustain lives. 
Women's World Health Initiative	83949		/users/profile/93056	Ana A.	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	Everybody at WWHI is so committed with the organization and with the cause. It's a great place to volunteer because we have space to say what we think and to give new ideas. As a volunteer, I feel like my work is appreciated and I am allowed to use my talents to make a difference in the world. I haven't been with WWHI for long, but it's been a great pleasure to work along side these wonderful people. 
Women's World Health Initiative	83879		/users/profile/92973	christyboyer	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	I have been a volunteer with WWHI for over two years. I clearly remember our first meeting. In a crowd of roughly a dozen people I felt as if we had the power of hundreds. The group was diverse but I left with a feeling of awe for the passion, compassion, and careful attention to principles that was displayed by the group. Last week I returned from our trip to Senegal with that same feeling of awe at the skill and understanding of the volunteers, the strength of our organization and immense gratitude for the people in Senegal with whom we are collaborating.  We have partners who are methodical and careful.We have recipients who are grateful and not just expecting a handout.We have programs that are sustainable and targeted to the specific need of the community.We have volunteers who are knowledgable in their fields and who are culturally sensitive and careful to support and empower the recipients not take over.
Women's World Health Initiative	83876		/users/profile/92970	Michael	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	WWHi is doing important work with Women in Senegal.

Women's World Health Initiative	83730		/users/profile/92800	Kathryn	Volunteer	5	03/29/2011	I recently spoke with WWHI Executive Director Dana Allison. She and her staff celebrated Women's Day in Senegal, West Africa, where they met with private sector partners to further WWHI's initiatives. I'm continually amazed at the passion, vision and fortitude of its leaders. Their tireless efforts and strategic, economical programs help preserve the dignity of women in Senegal. I'm honored to associate with this truly great nonprofit that empowers women to live healthier, happier lives.
Women's World Health Initiative	83577		/users/profile/92614	Rachal	Volunteer	5	03/28/2011	WWHI focuses on saving women and infants in vulnerable populations.  In Senegal, Africa women die unnecessarily from preventable complications during pregnancy and childbirth.  When the mothers die, their children are 14 times more likely to die.  For the children who do survive, their outlook is bleak as they are given to relatives or sold into sex slavery.  Mothers focus on the family well being and strengthening their communities.  If we can save mother's, we can change the world.  WWHI's approach is building self-sustaining maternal healthecare.
Women's World Health Initiative	83523		/users/profile/92551	Danielle	Volunteer	5	03/28/2011	This organization has good ideas for implementing sustainable healthcare systems for women in developing countries. I am excited to see the progress that comes from WWHI.
Empower Playgrounds Inc	176521	1	/users/profile/232942	Jbrito	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	EPI is such a great organization doing much good to the people of Ghana. Last summer I had the privilege and opportunity to be their summer intern. By visiting the schools, talking with the students and teachers, and interacting with the EPI staff, I truly know they are making a difference not only in the students' lives, but also in the villages and communities where they live. I am very excited to see how EPI grows and expands to bring more play, light, and learning to children in need.
Empower Playgrounds Inc	176501		/users/profile/232923	gillianv	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	Nothing can change a child's life like education. Empower Playgrounds is a fantastic company that lets children get exactly what they need: light. The company really works with the community to provide a needed service in a fun way! Such an innovative idea and motivated and caring employees. Great company, i hope to see other places in the world Playing, Lighting, and Learning soon!
Empower Playgrounds Inc	176251		/users/profile/232648	bdn711	Volunteer	5	10/09/2013	I had the privilege of spending several weeks volunteering with Empower Playgrounds in Ghana in 2012. I loved showing up unannounced at a school for routine maintenance and seeing the children playing enthusiastically around EPI merry-go-rounds.  I was impressed as I saw how they worked together with leaders of the local community and school administrators to instill a sense of responsibility and ownership in caring for the equipment that was provided. I think this kind of a relationship has been key to their success in providing light and opportunity to children in need.
Empower Playgrounds Inc	175512		/users/profile/231860	meganlfyoung	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	I've seen Empower Playgrounds in action over the last several years and love what they do. I've been several times to schools with installations in Ghana and love to see the joy and light (literally) they bring to students. This is an organization that cares deeply about their mission, and works hard to ensure that they work effectively to serve their program recipients, donors, and community. I look forward to continuing my relationship with Empower Playgrounds for many years to come.
Empower Playgrounds Inc	173738		/users/profile/229888	Abbie2	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	Empower playgrounds is an innovative and excellent company that has really made a difference in Ghana. I got to see first hand how the equipment worked and how it positively affected the lives of school kids and their families. Empower Playgrounds cares about its product but more importantly the people. They have very good relationships and are very involved with the people they work with. 
Empower Playgrounds Inc	173700		/users/profile/229848	mbg22	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I went to Ghana and saw the playgrounds in action; they were so fun for the kids, and for me!  Even adults might like them. ;-) The kids love to play and when they use empower playgrounds, playing helps them learn.

Empower Playgrounds Inc	173278		/users/profile/229416	cshhall	Donor	5	10/04/2013	I've worked with Empower Playgrounds both as a volunteer and as a donor and have had such an excellent experience. I got the chance to visit playground installations on the Volta River islands while I was in Ghana, help repaint one of their swingsets, and meet some of the recipients of this wonderful nonprofit's work.  I have also donated towards a new merry-go-round installation and art supplies for the students.  I have seen the actual numbers of the increasing test scores of children who benefit from both play and learning through EPI, which far outstrip performance of other schools and regions in the country.  I've also been able to meet the founder and learn about the technology first-hand, as well as learn more about the programs and their results through the Executive Director.  EPI is committed to helping Ghanaian children learn and play, and they consistently seek out new technologies that will support this mission.  I have been very impressed with their work, responsiveness, commitment, and innovation. 
Empower Playgrounds Inc	167398		/users/profile/222263	David162	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	Empower Playgrounds is an excellent idea launched by a retired Exxon-Mobil executive who spent his career evaluating good ideas to find the ones that would actually work. He's approached the problem intelligently, building trust and validation with public officials in Ghana, and he values the input of the end users enough to change directions when needed. EPI has brought light and productivity to thousands of children in Ghana, and they've clearly thought out how they will maintain installations to ensure ongoing service. Many other nonprofits I've observed take no thought beyond the initial installation, which can do more harm than good.
Empower Playgrounds Inc	54152		/users/profile/55357	chris44	Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	In May 2009 I traveled to Ghana with Empower Playgrounds Inc.(EPI). EPI installs innovative playground equipment that generates electricity for rural schools off the electrical grid. It was amazing to me that electricity could be produced by something as fun as a merry go round! These toys are often the only toy these kids will ever see besides old bike tires and an occasional soccer ball. And the light these toys produce will be the only safe and renewable light source they have as well, often replacing dangerous kerosene lanterns which cause severe eye and lung problems besides the obvious fire risk.  EPI as a foundation is also amazing. They operate with minimal overhead by keeping a small employee base in the US as well as in Ghana. There are no huge salaries to be paid out of donations they receive so a large majority of the money they raise is transferred to the children in Ghana providing them with improved education and opportunities.  EPI's founder, Ben Markham, is also very devoted to improving the standard of living and education in Ghana. After retiring from a long and prosperous career with a major company he has devoted his life to this work in Ghana.

As a result of the training received at the NAC I volunteer with other similar organizations.  The staff at the NAC is a group of dedicated individuals helping those with disabilities achieve the highest. There is no higher calling then that.
National Ability Center	134253		/users/profile/180042	Kieran	Volunteer	5	11/06/2012	As an 18 year old taking a gap year before college, I volunteered as a peer partner in the Ski Program last winter, and  the Archery Program this past summer. I was able to help people with all kinds of disabilities learn to ski or to shoot an arrow. It was fun and rewarding and I couldn't believe the difference the National Ability Center makes in the lives of those who come to participate in their adaptive recreation programs. Thank you, National Ability Center, for allwoing me this tremendour opportunity!
National Ability Center	134125		/users/profile/179897	ltcase	Board Member	5	11/06/2012	The National Ability Center in Park City, Utah, is an inspiring and transformational place.  It empowers individuals of ALL abilities through sport, recreation, and educational opportunities.  Volunteering in the Ski Program, I have seen individuals build confidence and self-esteem.  In the past few years the Center has been involved in the Wounded Warrior Project.  It has been instrumental in helping these military individuals to regain their confidence and capabilities, as well as work through the challenges presented in their post-military life.  The campus itself is a beautifully serene and peaceful place and a perfect place for healing and nurturing!
Park City Conservation Association	126067		/users/profile/72900	Sally E.	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	Recycle Utah has been a positive force in Summit County since its founding prior to 1990.  At that time, there was no recycling option in Summit County.  Through the the consistent and pervasive community educational efforts of Recycle Utah, we now have County-wide recycling, public school educational programs, community messaging and Summit County and Park City Municipal Sustainability Departments.  Because of the political will generated by Recycle Utah, Summit County is on its way to becoming a national leader in sustainable community efforts.  The leadership of Executive Director, Insa Reipen has been acknowledged by Leadership Park City and the Utah Non-Profits Association.  Kudos.
Park City Conservation Association	58957		/users/profile/63245	jerlund13	Board Member	5	12/20/2010	Insa's (the E.D.'s) oversight of both the mission and operations of the organization are an example for non-profits everywhere.   She is constantly working to expand services offered while staying within our mission.  Examples include the addition of EPS and shoe recycling at the center and organizing the Water Festival a clean-water outreach program for grade-schoolers every year.  She also demands a strict budget and accountability against that budget.  Within the last two years we have even been able to set aside some money for an endowment to prevent against going dark if we have a bad fundraising year. In sum, this is a great organization that stewards its resources extremely well.  
Park City Conservation Association	52093		/users/profile/52920	julie29	Volunteer	5	09/09/2010	Recycle Utah is an amazing part of the Park City Community.  The staff are so dedicated to what they do - and what they do is important!  Most everything including bike tires and car seats can be recycled at the center and the Good Wood store and shipping box store provide ways to Reuse.  Thank you Recycle Utah!  The center also provides valuable education opportunities to school children and adults throughout the county.
Park City Conservation Association	52071		/users/profile/52877	linda47	Volunteer	5	09/09/2010	Working outside at the center is an eye opening experience. The number of people coming through is amazing. Many with questions on what can and can't be recycled. Some looking in the recycled wood area for just the right piece to finish their project or people getting ready to move and coming in for packing materials. The center is very organized, with simple directions for each job that needs to be taken care of making it easy for a volunteer to get right to work. Education and positive reinforcement given to people using the center is important to keep them informed about the current state of recycling.

Park City Conservation Association	52010		/users/profile/35455	Recycle Utah	Volunteer	5	09/08/2010	Thank you Recycle Utah for being the best little recycling center on the planet. Not only do you collect things that most other places don't, you also have a great facility where people can learn, hang out and help the earth. Great opportunities are available for volunteers and court ordered service workers. Great opportunities for businesses to sponsor bins and become "greener". And a wonderful place to run into old friends, neighbors and visitors. Recycle Utah also does an excellent job of teaching Environmental Education to more than 5,000 students in the Summit County School system. By incorporating the Utah State Core Curriculum into the lesson plans, Recycle Utah helps parents and teachers make sure the students get their share of ecology, conservation and preservation. Park City wouldn't be the clean and green place it is today without Recycle Utah. So thanks - and all of us appreciate what you are!!!
Park City Conservation Association	51976	1	/users/profile/52766	jasmine6	Volunteer	5	09/07/2010	My experiences at Park City Conservation are some of the best I've ever had. Last year, I was a disgruntled freshman-going-sophomore looking for something that would keep me out of trouble and actually do something to help people. I found that at the Recycling Center. When I began to volunteer there, I was of course a little shy, but the fact that everyone there is so incredibly kind and willing to help a new person learn drew me out of my shell pretty quickly. This was completely unlike some of my friends' experiences at other volunteering places, at which the new volunteers (especially minors) are treated like second-class citizens. They even went way out of their way to be kind to me. I was nominated for the Silver Bowl award for Summit County, a annual award to one stellar volunteer in each county in Utah. I, incredibly, won, and because no one else was going to drive me, staff from the center went with me to Salt Lake City and received the award with me. And it wasn't only to volunteers that the staff were nice- every single time someone came up to one of the staff with a question, they answered efficiently and kindly.  This is despite any personal trauma they may be facing, and despite the often precarious nature of Recycle Utah itself. Travelers from out of state, especially 'greener' states like California and Oregon have been awed by the amount of items Recycle Utah collects- and it's a nonprofit, unlike other recycling centers I've seen. Aside from it's incredible tenacity as a nonprofit, this organization offers a hand to kids who'd like to keep out of trouble, and to people (kids and adults) who are already in it. During my volunteering at Recycle Utah, I saw countless amounts of people there fulfilling their court-ordered volunteer hours. It's such a great resource, in both offering excellent recycling opportunities and a place to help bring disparate fragments of my community together. Because of all this, Recycle Utah gets a 5/5 rating in my eyes, and I hope to pull on some more work gloves soon!
Park City Conservation Association	51836	2	/users/profile/52609	alison8	Volunteer	5	09/06/2010	I helped conduct a survey about the recycling center and its services.  So I know that not only I think our recycling center is extraordinary.  Everyone else does too!  Consistently, people raved about the good wood project, the re-store, the workshops, the educational programs, the e-waste program, and of course the recycling options.  They recycle everything from bike tubes to old tennis shoes to energy bar wrappers to light bulbs.  They take everything!
Intermountain Health Care Inc	301806		/users/profile/392840	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	08/29/2016	Brian's comments above are clearly those of someone who is very uninformed about what Intermountain Healthcare does, and the services it provides. Intermountain Healthcare is one of the lowest costing healthcare systems in this entire country. They do receive tax breaks for being a non-profit hospital organization. A hospital that gave 352,887,953 in charity care in 2015, deserves a tax break in my books. Please do not use one bad situation you may have had, due to insurance or whatever issues you had, cause you create a greatly unjust review of an otherwise extraordinary company. 
Intermountain Health Care Inc	196440	2	/users/profile/256764	Brian211	General Member of the Public	1	03/25/2014	This is a group that hides behind a nonprofit status for tax breaks. Yet, they are as expensive as any medical group and they provide some of the worst care you could find in this country.
Intermountain Health Care Inc	10222	4	/users/profile/12089	powderhunter2	General Member of the Public	5	09/11/2009	My experience with Intermountain has been extremely positive.  I've had two children delivered at their hospitals.  Both times the experience has been wonderful. I've had to use their ER's several times, again the care has been fantastic.  Nobody likes the high costs of health care.  It is expensive everywhere, but when I compare the health care costs I had in Las Vegas to similar costs in at Intermountain.  Intermountain is much lower--with better care.  Thanks Intermountain
Intermountain Health Care Inc	9774	10	/users/profile/11594	Paul Ramsell	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2009	I want to thank Intermountain Healthcare for saving my dad's life.

Intermountain Health Care Inc	9497	14	/users/profile/11312	Intermountain resident	General Member of the Public	5	08/24/2009	When President Obama recently praised Intermountain Healthcare as a good example of how to provide high quality healthcare at a lower cost, I was not surprised. Our own experiences have proven this to be true. In fact, my daughter would not be alive today had it not been for the incredible efforts provided by a team of highly skilled clinicians working to save her. She was born two months premature at 2 1/2 pounds and her world existed within the walls of the the newborn intensive care unit at an Intermountain hospital. Much care was given to every aspect of her medical treatment, and it was very gratifying to me as a young mother to see that the staff were as concerned about her comfort and survival as I was. Today she is a young woman herself, and she actually worked at that same Intermountain hospital as a phlebotomist while attending college. And her favorite place to work? Why, the NICU, providing that same tender care to the tiny babies that she had received so many years before.
Intermountain Health Care Inc	9488	11	/users/profile/11305	Utah Resident	General Member of the Public	5	08/24/2009	All five of my children were born at Intermountain Healthcare hospitals, and that experience was top-notch.  Of course, like most kids, over the years they've had their share of bumps and bruises, and we've had many visits to Intermountain hospitals and clinics for care.In particular, I greatly appreciated the caring and expertise from the doctors and nurses when my son broke his femur and was hospitalized for a week.  From the surgery to the follow-up physicial therapy, everything was great.I feel like they care about my health personally.  As a woman, there are screenings that I need on a regular basis. I like getting a reminder letter and phone call to get me in for these important tests.  Although I've always been insured when I've used their services, I appreciate the fact that they offer charitable services to many in my community.  I personally know of several people who have been the recipients of their generous financial assistance.I'm not originally from Utah and I've experienced healthcare in other parts of the nation.  My perception is that I have it far better here for healthcare than in other places in the U.S.
Intermountain Health Care Inc	6515	17	/users/profile/8359	Public Advocate #1	General Member of the Public	1	07/12/2009	Must see documentary snippett filmed at Harvard Law School about one of the most egregious charitable health care providers, Intermountain Health Care in Utah.http://www.sybervision.com/sadbully/sadprivate/ewarren.htmThis tax-exempt business is the leading cause of Utah's #1 ranking of personal bankruptcies. It is a predatory wolf masquerading as an angel of mercy. It overcharges the uninsured by as much as 400% of what they charge insured, aggressively pursues collections, gets liens and wage garnishments and when they drive a family into bankruptcy or a family can't pay, they write off the uncollectible inflated debt as charity care. What a scam.It uses its war chest of hundreds of millions of dollars to buy off the local media with millions of advertising (television, radio, newspaper, billboard), stack its board with executives of major media and legislators, buys off leading politicians with donations and junkets, and invests in major local law firms to make sure these firms cannot represent plaintiffs who sue for malpractice. It's executives receive 7 figure salaries and 8 figure retirements.  It's not a charitable hospital but a corrupt tax-exempt scam.

World Link Partners Inc	234676		/users/profile/302026	torsand1	Donor	5	11/29/2014	95% of your money goes to help people in one of the poorest places in the world.  Many humanitarian groups take over 50% of your money to pay their workers' salaries.  The people who run this group volunteer their time, along with several others.  The babies to 5 year olds in this area are rated as the 5th worst in the world for childhood death.   I have been donating since 2009 and I feel so much better about myself because I am giving some of what I have to help others who really need it.  I have been to see the people WLP helps, in Guatemala, and can't believe how little money helps to improve their lives.  For example, it costs about $7.00 to feed a small child for a month.  When I was there not one person held out their hand and asked for money.  They are given opportunities to help themselves and not given money or goods (other than the food supplement for the babies).  The families now eat more than just corn tortillas (WLP has a gardening program for them).  The men make $50 a month, if they are lucky, and the training in managing a small business is giving the families an opportunity to increase that amount.  They are then given small loans.  The amount depends on what business they choose to create.   Most of the people pay back the loans and many take out a new loan.  Another wonderful thing WLP does is hire teachers to teach people who never had a chance to go to school.  This increases the likelihood that their children will learn to read, etc. and that they will go on to higher education (past the 6th grade).  WLP has taught several women to make nativities and they are being sold on-line by WorldNativity.com.  (See the corn husk figures with colorful materials--from Guatemala.)   A full set gives the women $50.  WLP also gave two young women a grant to go by bus to a distant town where they could learn to make scarves on a primitive loom.  They came back to their two villages and taught 30 other women how to make the scarves.  Each scarf has a lovely pattern and took many hours to complete.  To purchase one and help these women, please send an email to torsand1@gmail.com.  You will be emailed a picture of the scarves, the available colors and what the looms look like.  Each scarf is $20 plus shipping.  As you can see, I help a little besides donating.  Another great thing about the leaders of this group is that they travel to the areas each year to make sure your money is being used to help the people.  There are some wonderful people in charge of each project in the country.  I can't say enough good about WLP.

The group mobilized and drew approximately 1000 people to its May Mental Health Month events, launched a website, created a parents roundtable, and began collaborations with area health organizations including the Summit County Health Department, Valley Behavioral Health, and the University of Utah Department of Psychiatry.  Going forward, the group is planning several community events, including a diverse set of events for May 2017 Mental Health Awareness Month.

I found each person I was exposed to with high integrity and moral values.  As my relationship grew over the years, I had a sister who needed therapy along with her six year old daughter having gone through a divorce and sexual illness issues from a spouse.  I, along with my family members found the  counseling to be of the highest quality and met the needs of my sister and niece.  Today my niece is married with two children of her own and my sister has found peace and harmony in her own life.  They obviously learned the skills necessary to cope and become an excellent mother, spouse and friend.  It doesn't get any better than that.  Thanks ISAT!!!!

Utah Food Bank	49064	1	/users/profile/50316	patrice2	Volunteer	5	08/02/2010	We really had a lot of fun putting cooking instructions and ingredient statements on to donated pizzas.  We were then given a tour of the building.  I never realized how big the place was and how much food goes thru there to the various sites. And how big the need in the Salt Lake valley is.
Utah Food Bank	48603	4	/users/profile/49718	vickiec	Volunteer	4	07/22/2010	As a company we volenteered with three tasks.  We packaged spaghetti that was donated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints into 2 lb bags.  Then our assistance was needed in getting a mailer out that had been delayed by the post office.  Our last task was to decorate boxes that are filled with food and delivered to senior citizens who are home bound.  Over all we had a great time volenteering at the food bank and plan to help out in the near future.
Utah Food Bank	48243	2	/users/profile/49217	cs2	Volunteer	4	07/15/2010	My Roommates went on a group date to the Utah Food Bank to volunteer.  While there they had us go through the salvaged and damaged foods from the grocery stores and compile boxes of assorted food items for the food pantrys throughout the state to give out to those in need.  We have never done this before and all of us had a great time!  Everyone commented about how much they enjoyed our experience. The Food bank staff were organized and fun to work with.  The best part was that we all left with a good feeling knowing that we had done something good for not only a great organization but that really will help those in need.
The Road Home	319607	1	/users/profile/411304	Thecharitygirl	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2016	The Road Home is such an amazing and selfless organization. All of the employees genuinely care about the well-being of their clients and will take the extra step in order to help the best that they can. Their finances are very transparent and have been rated very highly on Charitynavigator.org due to their honest bookkeeping and effective services.
The Road Home	319230		/users/profile/410605	AndreiJohnsonSLC	Client Served	1	11/20/2016	You will see over thirty people shoot IV drugs a night, and that is when you're not looking. The Bathrooms are full of people smoking crack, heroin (off of tin foil) and meth. Literally 70 percent of the staff is on meth, and all this before you start to acknowledge what is going on outside... This place is nothing but a giant crack house. When security catch someone shooting up they let them finish, and then they tell them to stop. There are probably literally fifteen people out of the three hundred and fifty or so who check in every night who aren't addicted to hard drugs.  The staff are on drugs, which is ridiculous, and the dealers outside the place only face a month at most in prison if they're caught, part of the citys' liberal homeless initiative. So nothing changes. All day older african americans sell drugs right in front of the place, set up on chairs, and the two bathrooms outside the place have sharps containers for needle disposal, which are filled every day. You can shoot up in front of the door, on the stairs on the way in, wherever, all in front of cameras. This place doesn't help the employees, they're all recovering addicts who relapse in seconds. It doesn't help the homeless, because they can't get clean when people are shooting up and smoking crack and meth literally a few feet away from them. Spiritually the pit of hell. If you care about human beings you will not donate a dollar to this place, because it keeps people addicted, keeps them from getting clean. The season doesn't matter, it is this liberal all year round. I feel like I'm in Sodom and Gomorrah. I watch fifteen year old girls sell their bodies for two dollars for spice every day. I watch people have seizures everyday. The drug-addicted staff do nothing, in fact, I've watched a half a dozen of them relapse as well. This place is the great "I AM", the great "Me First". It possesses all the morality of Auschwitz. The volunteers, to be fair, don't spend enough time here to notice. They don't know when there are a dozen abscesses on someone's arm its from shooting up, not from chronic health problems.
The Road Home	125861	3	/users/profile/171019	erica dahl	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	I have served on many boards over the years and serving on the board of The Road Home has been one of the most rewarding experiences for me.  The staff is exceptionally dedicated to its mission to serving the short and long term needs of our msot vulnerable population in Salt Lake County.  Our board is very hands on and our donors are amazing.  I am truly grateful for The Road Home.
The Road Home	104500	6	/users/profile/140129	JoeGPWC	Volunteer	5	01/25/2012	This is a great charity because they not only meet immediate needs concerning a lack of food and shelter, but they also work diligently to find those in need permanent housing and teach them valuable skill sets.
The Road Home	104017	4	/users/profile/139373	vpapaderos88	Volunteer	5	01/20/2012	The Road Home contains some of the GREATEST individuals I have ever met. Everyone has such great dedication, compassion, and empathy for everyone that goes in and comes out of there. They have really made it an objective to serve their homeless population in the best way ever. They provide every individual with hope and the strive to a better tomorrow. I am so grateful to have volunteered in such an amazing place. 
The Road Home	81003	5	/users/profile/88490	bdaniels75	Volunteer	5	03/02/2011	I have volunteered off and on with The Road Home for a few years now.  The work that they do is beyond amazing.  It is wonderful to know that No One in the Greater Salt Lake area ever has to live on the streets.  I have volunteered taking calls and assisting residences, I have helped at a number of events, and even dinners.   The staff are beyond the most amazing people I have ever met.  The volunteer coordinator Ashley Farmer works tirelessly to make certain that all her volunteers know of their value to the organization.   Not only should you volunteer your time, donate funds as well to make certain they are able to keep up this great work.
Little Lambs Foundation for Kids	265950	1	/users/profile/354700	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2015	This is a great thing. It helps a lot of children in need. It is trying to show children that there are people in this big world that there are people who care about them.
Little Lambs Foundation for Kids	265242	1	/users/profile/353994	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/19/2015	Little Lambs is a great local charity that helps foster children feel loved as they transition into new living situations. Each child is provided with a special backpack filled with fun activities, toys, school supplies, personal care items & cuddly fleece blankets.  It is a great service project for groups who want to help by donating funds, items or help assemble these packs. It was a great experience for old & young to participate in this activity together & experience the joy of giving.
Little Lambs Foundation for Kids	265209	1	/users/profile/353961	Megan96	Donor	5	10/19/2015	This non-profit is such an amazing behind the scenes way of helping those in your community that need it the most.  I was able to help with making some crisis kits this year and it was such a great experience.  All the donations and time that go into supporting those in our community is such an amazing reminder to me that we are surrounded by goodness even during the hardest time of our lives.  The kits made my little lambs go to help women at CAPSA, the emergency room, and kids who would otherwise end up going to school with no school supplies.    Love this non profit.  
Little Lambs Foundation for Kids	258502	1	/users/profile/346999	Writer	Board Member	5	09/20/2015	Little Lambs brings joy and smiles to children in tough situations! Giving a comfort bag makes a huge impact in their lives! 
Little Lambs Foundation for Kids	258494	3	/users/profile/346990	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/19/2015	Little Lambs of Utah is a nonprofit organization that works countless hours to give comfort to children in foster care. They provide a comfort kit for ages 0 thru 17 years of age. Stefanee and Ted Chalfant started the organization in hopes to make the transition from home to foster care a bit easier for children. They have provided thousands of kits to many counties in Idaho and Utah. Every child is given a backpack, school supplies, personal hygiene items, a blanket and something personal depending on the age. I have never worked with a more dedicated, loving organization than Little Lambs.

Teamgive	116017	1	/users/profile/157966	Whitney N.	Donor	5	06/21/2012	TeamGive is a wonderful organization that raises awareness for rare neurological diseases.  Ive had the opportunity to participate in several of their events.  Each event has been well organized and fun!  For 2 years in a row my 2 young daughters have participated in a kids bike race and have loved it!   Its inspiring to see an organization bring people together that share a common concern for those they love.  Through TeamGive families, friends, and communities have come together for one common goal; to help those we love and care about find answers.

Teamgive	115642	1	/users/profile/157479	volunteerplease	Volunteer	5	06/18/2012	What an incredible opportunity to see an organization with such an important message delve in to the community setting.  I had the opportunity to volunteer on three different occasions and each time I felt like I was making a difference.  Learn about rare neurological diseases and meet children/families affected by the diseases.  Volunteer with teamgive today!
Wilderness Volunteers	263114		/users/profile/351825	Writer	Board Member	5	10/12/2015	I have been going on trips with WV annually for about the past eight years and absolutely love the organization. I signed up for my first trip as a way to not only give back to our public lands, but to explore a place I normally wouldn't visit/explore on my own. What a great way to utilize local resources -- like the NPS, BLM, etc., person connected with each trip. I loved what WV was doing and felt so much passion about it that I became a leader five years ago and am a recent addition to the board of directors. I finally got my brother to come to a trip this year and he was hooked and is looking at the trips for next year already! 
Wilderness Volunteers	148032	3	/users/profile/195944	HikerDude	Volunteer	5	01/14/2013	I did a project in Alaska with Wilderness Volunteers and it was outstanding. We built a trail in the backcountry. I loved the people on the team and the week we spent working together.
Wilderness Volunteers	109515	6	/users/profile/149106	SierraGeezer	Volunteer	4	04/10/2012	My wife and I have been on 2 trips with this organization, one cleaning up illegal campsites in the Sierra Nevada, and the other repairing and improving a trail in Glacier N.P.  Both were well-organized and the 10 or 12 volunteers on each trip a good group of people who did a lot of good work in a short (4 days, plus 1 free day) time.  Backpacked in to the Sierra, but had a USFS pack outfit bring in tools, food, and kitchen stuff, which was nice.  We all took turns with camp chores (cooking, cleaning, hauling water, etc), which were organized by our volunteer leaders, so that worked out well.  Liked Glacier because we hiked out to worksite everyday, but could enjoy hot showers a short walk from our campground.  In both cases it was clear that the rangers we worked with were very appreciative of our volunteer assistance.
Wilderness Volunteers	109156	7	/users/profile/148652	AndyL	Volunteer	5	04/05/2012	Have done several trips with this organization in a few different states. Hoping to do a trip in Hawaii next! It's a great way to see new places and meet new people without the $ it would take to do it on your own. The work is hard but satisfying and at the end of the week you leave with a with a sense that you did something important to help our public lands. The trip leaders I've worked with so far have been entertaining and informative and the office staff (Dave/Debbie) have been helpful and accommodating when I've had issues.        
Wilderness Volunteers	108302	1	/users/profile/147405	PhilG	Volunteer	1	03/25/2012	I've done several of these trips / work projects. I have been rewarded by good clean fun, hard word, and new friendships. My only complaint about this organization is the main office coodinator Deb. truly not a nice person. Truly a phony in many ways. She is the main reason why I stopped participating with WV and have decided to donate my time and energy to other ventures!
Wilderness Volunteers	105136	6	/users/profile/141141	zonie	Volunteer	5	01/31/2012	I have been going on WV trips for more than five years, first as a volunteer and now as a trip leader.  They offer more than fifty projects a year across the US, including backcountry restoration, trail maintenance, invasive species removal, etc.  The projects are very rewarding, in beautiful places, with interesting people, and very affordable.  Oh yeah...the food is remarkably good.  If you are interested in an outstanding and meaningful wilderness experience, you should check out WV.
People's Health Clinic, Inc.	315284	1	/users/profile/406610	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/27/2016	This is a truly amazing clinic. I've not found more passionate doctors anywhere. The staff is top notch and know what they're doing! The environment is positive and everyone really cares about making you better. I highly recommend visiting this clinic!
People's Health Clinic, Inc.	313027	1	/users/profile/404396	Marla10	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	 I am a volunteer at the peoples health clinic in Park City, Utah. Every time I am there, I feel privileged to be a part of this organization. They do so much  for the locals who are unable to get health insurance. They provide health care needs of women, men and children.  All the staff give endlessly to the clinic with love & respect. I can't say enough great things about PHC.  I urge everyone to learn more about PHC and give them your support. 
People's Health Clinic, Inc.	59441		/users/profile/64209	UTMtnSharon	Donor	5	01/05/2011	When I was a little girl in Louisiana, my mother showed me that those who had more had to take care of those who had less.  One day we were downtown when she saw a man who obviously didn't have enough to eat.  She stooped over to talk to him, then went into the nearby diner, and came back to the car. I asked "Mama, what did you say to that man? Why did you go to the restaurant?"She fixed her cat-eyed glasses on me and said, "That man told me he was hungry. So I told him I would give the owner of the diner $20 and he could go there until it was all gone."  I know that she would like what the Clinic does for people.  
People's Health Clinic, Inc.	58749		/users/profile/62807	brooks	Board Member	5	12/13/2010	In 2008 I was looking to volunteer some of my time to a community based organization that focused on caring for fellow community members. I was told about the PHC and after my consistent pestering of the people involved, I was finally asked to participate as a member of one of the PHCs various committees. After being involved with the PHC for a number of months I realized what an honor it was to be involved with an organization like the PHC. I began to see the mission of the clinic clearly and realized it was closely related to many things that are very important to me personally, good health, caring for others, keeping families safe, and the making of a better community. I am so grateful to be involved with an organization that truly cares about people. I am honored to be on the board of the PHC and see that in tough times, our mission is even more critical to our community, and that the community is stepping up to help each other. 
People's Health Clinic, Inc.	58740		/users/profile/62795	Derickso	Volunteer	5	12/13/2010	There are many places I could practice my phlebotomy skills, but  here I help people who really need it.  It's often through lab tests that people learn why they have been feeling bad, and can receive the care to feel better again. I love being in the lab when the Clinic is packed.  In between drawing blood I get pulled in to interpret for the doctors.  The good days are the busiest days, so there are lots of good days at PHC.
People's Health Clinic, Inc.	56525		/users/profile/59060	Whoaellee	Client Served	4	11/09/2010	I am a legal american living in PC . It's very expensive, and I can't afford rent much less insurance. I  am a mature single  seasonal worker  I am very grateful to you for donating your your time, financial  assistance and for helping me to have hope.......that maybe things are going to be alright. When you are sick and you have no insurance, and no money, there are not alot of choices. But through the Peoples clinic, I am able to seek the help that I need and not feel ashamed that i can't afford it. Thank you all for everything I really appreciate it!  L.R.
Wildlife SOS	19040	22	/users/profile/20288	LAKSHMI NATARAJAN	Donor	5	10/21/2009	I have been interested in animal welfare for a long time now. I still remember visiting Agra in 2002 and being deeply disturbed by the sight and plight of the dancing bears lining the road between Delhi and Agra. I was desperate to do something but had no idea where to start, so imagine my delight at discovering WSOS and the initiative to rescue the dancing bears in India. I had the pleasure of visiting their sanctuary in Bangalore in 2006 and given a complete tour by Dr. Arun. It is such a safe and fantastic haven for the poor animals and I salute all those involved in this initiative. What struck me most was that the people who make these bears dance are just as reluctant to see them suffer, but see no other options to earn a livelihood. Wildlife SOS has a wonderful strategy in tackling the root of the problem - they have trained these people so they can either set up and run small businesses or continue to work with the bears, this time for their absolute welfare. This has made all the difference in tackling this issue and rescuing the bears.
Wildlife SOS	16583	14	/users/profile/18325	frankster	Volunteer	5	10/20/2009	Kartick and Geeta have dedicated their lives to save the dancing bears (sloth bears) and the other animals of India. Their dedication and love for animals shines through in all of their work. They started WSOS with a goal to save all of the dancing bears by 2010. So far, in just 7 years they have saved 525.I have been infused with new hope and optimism by their results. And, their actions have inspired me to become fully involved in saving these bears.
Wildlife SOS	16002	18	/users/profile/17828	Eugene Isack	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I worked at Wildlife SOS as an intern at their Delhi office for 3 months. The amount of ambition in this organisation is astounding. Wildlife SOS already has several animal sancturaries around India saving every type of animal imaginable, ranging from birds, bears, cows, horses, snakes, leopards, bats, monkeys, and elephants. Their work involes a co-ordination of sting operations and informats for wildlife injustices, 24hr rescue hotlines, running several animal sancturaries and education for children and adults alike.
Wildlife SOS	14286	11	/users/profile/16246	Muffyjo	General Member of the Public	5	10/15/2009	I found WildlifeSOS on Twitter.  I am now following them.  They Tweet the plight of the abused, disadvantaged & neglected wildlife as if each were their own.  Compassion is shown with each message they Tweet.  Individual animals are addressed and success and loss is shared with the Tweeter World.  They are Educators and Saviors of the Animal Kingdom.  Thank You Wildlife SOS for showing the world compassion and love for the animal kingdom. Without the wildlife, our world would never be the same.  "Silence" would be the Sound of the Wild.
Wildlife SOS	12595	8	/users/profile/14620	kateish	Board Member	5	10/08/2009	I've worked in animal welfare for the last decade, and have never been so impressed as I was the first time I visited India and saw the work of Wildlife SOS. Their dedication is unparalleled, and they achieve so much with so few resources.
Wildlife SOS	12592	11	/users/profile/14614	smitajo79	Volunteer	5	10/08/2009	I have always felt deeply about wildlife conservation, environment protection and animal welfare but didnt find much opportunity to do something about it. But a chance meeting with Geeta Seshamani in 1998 got me involved with her work and now for the last 11 years, volunteering with Wildlife SOS (WSOS) as well as my capacity as a donor, has made me do substantial amount of constructive work towards the cause that is closest to my heart. They have a brilliant team of field workers, who are expertly trained and very passionate about the cause. There is never a moment in time when WSOS is not on the field rescuing endangered indegenious species, preserving habitat, saving lives, providing alternate employment to poaching communities. I volunteer for them time to time mostly on backend support. I also donate and coordinate with my peer for donations etc. I think WSOS is an extremely efficient organization in their field and need all the support they can get. I would go as far as to say that I think Wildlife SOS is the only hope for Indian wildlife.
St Annes Center Inc	318477		/users/profile/409661	DPNIXON	Board Member	5	11/07/2016	As a board member i have enjoyed being a part of the Lantern House (St. Annes Center). It has been a great experience for me to be a part of.
St Annes Center Inc	57339	1	/users/profile/60523	Zebulon W.	Board Member	5	11/18/2010	Three years ago, I decided to come out as a gay man. The experience shocked my very traditional family and I was asked to "not be gay" or leave my parents' house. I chose the latter. I wasn't prepared financially or emotionally, nor did I have the skills needed for living on my own.  My family and my church had been my support system for 18 years, and suddenly I didn't have them anymore. I was lucky though. I had a graveyard shift to work and a 1977 Cadillac inherited from my Grandfather to sleep in during the day. I also had a gym to go to for a hot shower and a hundred dollars in my checking account to eat on. I was only homeless for 2-3 weeks, and it wasn't too bad because I started out with enough resources and knowledge to get myself back on my feet. There are others without support systems, who don't have the knowledge and resources to get themselves on their feet. I believe those good people deserve a fighting chance, that's why I give to, advocate for, and volunteer at St. Anne's Center. I can honestly say, it has been a good investment. 
St Annes Center Inc	57323		/users/profile/60499	jbotelho	Professional with expertise in this field	4	11/18/2010	I've had the opportunity to work with St. Annes Center on a professional level over the last 3 years and during that time I have been extremely impressed with the way they manage their day to day operations.  St. Annes puts the client's needs and well being in front of every decision they make.  I had the chance to volunteer in their kitchen and witnessed the caring and friendly nature the staff at St. Annes has for their clients.  They treat everyone as an important individual, an action that is much needed, yet seldom expressed in the lives of many residence at the center.  They have done an amazing job adjusting to the growing needs in the community and have proven over and over to be a valuable partner in our community.
St Annes Center Inc	57319		/users/profile/60494	Michelle Perry	Board Member	5	11/18/2010	I have served on the Board of St. Anne's Center for more than  10 years.  One of the reasons I have served so long, and will continue to serve is  that I believe in what St. Anne's is doing.  Over the course of 10 years I have seen a lot of people's lives changed, people who have gone from hopeless situations to living a life of self sufficiency, from desperation to becoming productive members of the community.  St. Anne's helps thousands of people each year, providing food, shelter, and important services including case management.    I will continue to support St. Anne's through my service on the board as well as volunteering at the Center, financial support, and by encourageing others to get involved with what St. Anne's is doing.  St. Anne's not only changes the lives of those who walk through their doors for help but also changes the lives of those who serve and support St. Anne's.

I am so impressed with the work they do and the lives they change.  I know that any donation I make to St. Anne's is going to help a lot of people in a very positive way. 
St Annes Center Inc	57232		/users/profile/60165	John Patterson	Donor	5	11/17/2010	My wife and I choose to donate to St. Anne's because we know the money will be well spent and multiplied by the volunteer hours and matching dollars. It also goes to help those that really need it. The stories from clients we ate with recently touched our lifes and reinforced our belief that really good work is done here. The road back to a mainstream existence begins at St. Anne's. Through good case management and being provided the basics, many people have left the roles of the homeless and are living productive, happy lifes. I see one such lady in town and she always greets me and shares the latest update that is always positive...all thanks to the work done at St. Anne's.

Learn about rare neurological diseases and meet children/families affected by the diseases.  Volunteer with teamgive today!
Utah Pride Center	173429		/users/profile/229571	nikkiboyer	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	I am very proud of the visionary work that is done by the Utah Pride Centers staff.The Center is doing exceptional work with our youth.  We have a great model and have made great strides in partnering with the DCWS.  Our SAGE program, for the over 50's, is providing services to hundreds of seniors.We have mental health services, health and wellness services, a great anti-smoking program and do HIV/AIDS testing.Our out-reach and advocacy team reaches out to the broader community for trainings.Our Pride Festival is fabulous.  Over 30,000 people attended this last year.  The parade included over one thousand LDS (Moron) marchers.  We have a thriving Transgender program.Salt Lake can be proud of the work being done by the Utah Pride Center.UPC recently purchased a 16,000 sq. ft building in the heart of the city.  When completed, we will have a great gathering spot, complete with cyber-center, library and cafe.  It's hard to quantify the great and good work that UPC does in our community.
Utah Pride Center	173405		/users/profile/229549	Cred	Donor	5	10/04/2013	This nonprofit has one of the best Executive Directors in the business!  She has expanded UPC's reach and relevance to and for the LGBT community throughout Utah.  The support staff is professional and dedicated.  The programs offered make a real difference in the lives of the gay community, young and old.  Last week I referred a young lesbian to the UPC's licensed social worker.  The girl had just been released from a week in a hospital after a suicide attempt.  The social worker responded immediately with concern and compassion, and this girl is receiving -- for the first time -- experienced counseling.  This is only one example.  UPC deals with serious problems every day, and in a crisis, it is a life saver!  Utahns -- gay and straight -- are beneficiaries of one of the elite Pride Centers in the United States.  If you can contribute to United Way, or any other charity, please make a tax-deductible contribution to the Utah Pride Center!

It's nice for the youth of slc to have a place to go. I try my best to support anything that gives money to this great outlet. I am from Utah county and I wish the youth down here had such a place in thier vicinity. We need to keep supporting this place and one day they will be able to expand.
Utah Pride Center	5349	20	/users/profile/6669	Chelsea Volunteer	Volunteer	5	06/18/2009	I have been a volunteer at the Utah Pride Center for over two years. As an extremely busy individual with limited time to volunteer, I work with the Pride Center because I believe it is an organization that actually contributes to the community. Whether it is supporting other LGBT groups in the area or working with queer youth groups on the weekends, the Pride Center is one of the only LGBT groups in Utah that has enough resources to reach a broad set of folks in our diverse community along the Wasatch Front. Not only do I enjoy volunteering--in a variety of different capacities, but usually where I am needed most--but I appreciate the friendliness of the staff. It is so nice to go into an office when I get off work where folks appreciate the time I spend there and thank me for it. It feels great to be appreciated.My partner and I volunteer and give annually as well-- while we are not wealthy, we feel that our small gift is the least we can do for an organization that has helped so many of our friends in LGBT Utah.
Utah Pride Center	5330	20	/users/profile/7127	jerekeys	Board Member	5	06/18/2009	The Utah Pride Center has been the major driving force in recent years for LGBT equality in Utah. Their programs serve a wide range of people, from youth to adults, long-term political activists to newly "out" people seeking social connection. They host numerous community events, but especially the annual Utah Pride Celebration in early June. Center staff are compassionate and helpful, responsive on a wide variety of topics, articulate community representatives, and utterly professional. Simply put, the Utah Pride Center is the touching point from which all other LGBT issues in Utah radiate.

Summit Land Conservancy	35123	5	/users/profile/35964	billpc	Board Member	5	04/08/2010	I've been a fan and supporter of the Summit Land Conservancy for years.  It seems to get better and more effective year after year.  The staff is enthusiastic (and way underpaid) and creative.  The SLC Executive Director has a passion for open space and is very effective at communicating her vision to the community, her board and her staff.  In a down economy she is just as positive and even more creative with fund raisers, projects and team building.  The SLC has recently partnered with Park City Municipal to save 121 acres on one of our two entry corridors.  The city and Cheryl Fox were able to negotiate a conservation easement on this acreage that in years past seemed impossible.  The visibility that the Summit Land Conservancy has created is an example for all other non profits to copy.  I think the entire community will be stepping up to help out this incredible organizationBill Cunningham2945 American Saddler Dr.Park City, Utah

There are genuine people over there willing to help you with anything that you need help with. I enjoy going over there and confident that anyone that takes the time to go in will be satisfied.
Cottages of Hope Inc	189301	2	/users/profile/247041	HumblePie	Volunteer	5	11/25/2013	When I first started volunteering at Cottages of Hope, I was amazed at all the different services available.  Most people who are struggling in today's fast-paced, technology oriented society often do not know how to interact with it. Cottages of Hope addresses the basic needs of the Ogden community.  After the 2008 Recession, the marketplace is flooded with people who have not needed to look for a job in many years. Because they are not aware of the current norms of job-searching, resume building, and interviews, they are at a disadvantage to those who are aware. One of Cottages' area of expertise is training those people with more current norms.  Another area that I am impressed with is the training available to understand state and federal programs. One of the biggest problems today is the underutilized social programs available to people that need them, and the abuse by people that don't. Cottages works with people that can benefit from these programs while conveying a sense of responsibility to its clients. The object is to help people. By getting the help to people and helping them understand that the program is not the end-goal to rely on for the rest of their life, Cottages does more for our society than any other non-profit I have ever encountered.
Cottages of Hope Inc	189006		/users/profile/246700	mjestraus	Volunteer	4	11/21/2013	Cottages of Hope is a wonderful resource center for the Ogden Community! As a volunteer, I help people who come in to look for jobs on the internet in our computer lab, help clients update their resumes and cover letters, and even help them find housing. We are here to help the clients help themselves. We even offer classes that can help the client obtain the skills needed to be financially stable. Some of the classes we offer help clients become financially literate so that they can spend their money more wisely and hopefully end up saving to better their situation. Another class we offer helps with learning how to use the computer from the basics all the way to Microsoft Office so that clients can obtain necessary skills to navigate the technology world. My favorite part about Cottages of Hope is personally helping the clients learn the computer, find jobs and eventually get stable employment. The staff is awesome to work with and the atmosphere is friendly and productive.

Deseret International Foundation	245704		/users/profile/332913	hcole2	Volunteer	5	06/19/2015	CharityVision is one of the most efficient charities in the world.

Deseret International Foundation	201555		/users/profile/263046	SFAnderson	Donor	5	06/01/2014	Having been committed to humanitarian work and causes for more than 4 decades, I am very much aware of the many organizations working to help those in need of an helping hand throughout the world. I have reviewed more than 145 different humanitarian organizations to see which provide the biggest bang for the donor's buck.  I have found Desert International Foundation to be 100% on the up and up, delivering the promises they make and giving the donor a sense that their money is being used wisely and effectively. Their working model is one of the best I've seen. I only wish that more humanitarian groups could/would adapt this kind of a working model.  I have lived in some of the countries that Deseret International works in and have seen first hand the enormous need there is in these countries. What they are doing to address these needs is nothing short of remarkable. I give my 110% endorsement to this organization. My family has a number or humanitarian organizations we give to and Deseret Foundation is #1 on our list of organizations. If you want to donate and know your money is being used wisely, safely, and effectively, than this is the place to put it.    If you have an questions about my experience with Deseret International Foundation, please do not hesitate to contact me at: andersonsf54@hotmail.com 
Deseret International Foundation	196829		/users/profile/257286	tedvotes	Donor	5	04/01/2014	I love the fact that 100% of my donation goes directly to help disadvantaged people with medical problems around the world.  I really like Deseret's philosophy that they get local doctors who know how to deal with problems the US doctors rarely see, and give them the supplies and facilities to be able to help their own people.  This essentially leverages my donation 100 times what other charities can provide. 
Deseret International Foundation	162666		/users/profile/215897	Pat_29	Advisor	5	07/15/2013	I've been fortunate enough to see the inner workings of CharityVision. The organization is based on the idea that people given the ability will help those in their own communities. CharityVision is efficient, well motivated and directed by caring and concerned people who know how to create sustainable solutions to the blindness epidemic. I'm amazed at how many lives they impact through their charitable work and the network of people all over the world who are dedicated to restoring vision for people in need. What a fantastic organization! I highly recommend them as a trustworthy and viable service. Please support them both financially and by spreading the word about their noble cause.

Iron County Care and Share	2144	23	/users/profile/3445	StephanieFurnival	Board Member	5	12/15/2008	The Iron County Care & Share is an incredible program the provides so many services to our community. It is our local feedbank, shelter, christmas box, and so much more. The Center has worked very hard in getting their new food bank up and running and is currently working on raising funds for their new shelter facility. Our current facility is not meeting the needs of our community and the need to increase in the number of rooms available to men, women and families. The property has been purchased and is just awaiting the funding to complete the project. In todays day and age a little bump in the road can be the difference between having a place to call home or even a place to stay for the night. There are so many that are counting on your generous contribution to help them fill in the gaps that their family needs until they can get on their feet. During this season I would ask that you look within your means and remember that because you have been given much that you too could give. Peace:)

Iron County Care and Share	2120	27	/users/profile/3391	Donna McNabb	Board Member	5	12/11/2008	As a member of the Board of Directors and past Chairman of Iron County Care and Share-Utah, I have been touched by the dedication and compassion of our staff.  Sometimes a staff member has been, at one time, a homeless person or someone involved with drugs.  Because of the focused interest of case workers, the day-to-day sucesses lead to recovery.  The "family" atmosphere at ICCS develops confidence and trust.  To see men homeless for 20 years or more, being housed in permanent housing, beginning to contribute to society, wanting to help others and looking people in the eye when talking to them, has humbled me.  I can more clearly see that ALL people are God's children.
Iron County Care and Share	2118	27	/users/profile/3387	ICCS	Board Member	5	12/11/2008	The Iron County Care & Share is a wonderful place.  Everyone from the Executive Director, Bill Woods to the employees in the shelter, to those who stock the selves at the food bank are doing a stellar job.  They meet and greet those people every day who need a 'hand up' and some assistance with food, lodging and counseling.  They do it with a smile and are genuine in their care for those who need it most.       Our community has been very supportive in all of our food drive activities and continue to support with donations of all kind.  Many businesses voluntarily sponsor activities in an effort to help out in this tough economic time.       I appreciate the support we receive from all those who reach out to help.  Our board has been great to pitch in and support all of our activities with their time and resources.  It makes me proud to be a part of this great organization.Tom Walker
Utah Foster Care Foundation	147739	1	/users/profile/195475	Hank L.	Board Member	5	01/07/2013	I served for 9 years on the Board of Directors of the Utah Foster Care Foundation, 6 of those as Board Chair.  I serve on a number of other non-profit boards in the community, and I was fond of telling my fellow UFCF board members that the Foundation was my favorite.  Why?  Because, as a social worker with child welfare experience, I was particularly drawn to the organizations mission of serving and keeping safe Utahs abused and neglected children.  Because of the Foundation staffs commitment and dedication to the organizations mission, which served as a model for the board to emulate.  Because of the Foundation leaderships knowledge, skill, and expertise, which made my job as Board Chair all the easier.  I saw the Foundation leadership and staff as extended family, and never missed an opportunity to attend the all-staff meetings which brought together UFCF staff from across the state several times a year.  There was always plenty of joy and laughterand hugsat those meetings.  I suppose we were modeling what Utahs foster families experience on a daily basis as they provide love and safety to Utahs vulnerable children.  I send a virtual hug out to all of those families.  Thank you for all you do! 
Utah Foster Care Foundation	147657		/users/profile/195345	Heidi N.	Client Served	5	01/04/2013	I am honored to share my experiences with the Utah Foster Care Foundation. My husband and I began our journey into foster care over 5 years ago. Our first experience with UFCF was attending our pre-service training to become foster parents. We attended 32 hours of classes where we learned about child welfare teams, Utah Licensing rules, abuse & neglect, the impact of substance abuse on development, grief, attachment and trauma, permanency & adoption, and family cultures. The vast array of topics covered helped prepare us for our experiences with fostering children. Our trainers were well educated, open, and honest about what we would experience. It was such a powerful experience that we felt we because better parents for just having attended. 	Once we were licensed foster parents we were able to participate in continuing education classes. Each month we are afforded the opportunity to attend a myriad of classes on an array of subjects. Because of the diversity of classes there always seemed to be a class designed to cover the challenges we were facing as foster parents. 	 The Utah Foster Care Foundation's Wishing Well helpsnormalize the experience for children in care. Our family was excited for an upcoming trip to Florida with my husband's work. About 3 weeks before our trip we were placed with a foster child. We did not want to leave him behind, but could also not afford to purchase is airline ticket and a ticket to Disney world, and the additional hotel fees, etc. It was then we were made aware of the Wishing Well funds provided through the Utah Foster Care Foundation. Unfortunately, reimbursement rates given to foster parents for care cover living expenses but not much more. Which means when it comes to extracurricular activities we, the foster parents, often end up covering the cost ourselves. We were able to apply for help purchasing a plane ticket so that our foster son could experience a plane flight and a family vacation for the first time in his life. He got to go to Disney World, Gator land, Sea world, and the beach with us. During the flight, he was even able to meet the pilot and go in the cockpit. It was priceless!It was an amazing experience to be able to include him in our plans. 	Our family was also able to attend the yearly Foster Family Camp held at Aspen Grove. This event is held each fall in the beautiful mountains above Sundance. We had just adopted an 11 year old that has been in foster care for over 6 years. He had never been on a family vacation. He had not belonged to a family for a very long time. We were able to attend activities and trainings and be with other families like ours. There were several kids his age. He looked at me at one point during our stay with tears in his eyes and said "Mom, I belong here. These kids are just like me. They get it." How powerful that statement is. This camp made him feel like he belonged; to be with others that understood his struggles and challenges, and to be truly carefree. The Utah Foster Care Foundation provides several appreciation events throughout the year, giving our kids the opportunity to be just kids, not defined as "FOSTER" kids. These activities give them the opportunity to belong. 	 I have also had the opportunity to participate in the Annual Chalk Art festival at the Gateway. This event is held fathers day weekend and is meant to raise awareness about the Utah Foster Care Foundation and the need for foster families. Artist's color the streets with amazing art depicting a theme. We recently adopted a sibling group of three sisters through foster care. The oldest was able to participate as a student artist this last year. An experience she still talks about. This years theme was super heroes. She chose to draw wonder woman. She wrote around the side of her drawing "Be the change you want to see and become a foster parent. Thank you to the many Wonder Women in my life." That is such a powerful message coming from a 14 year old. I have never seen an organization so passionate about their work. Every member of the Utah Foster Care Foundation pitches in to make this event a success. They are amazingly organized and work cohesively as a team. I have been blessed in so many ways by the support this organization has shown to my family by their generous work, kindness, and love for children. I fully encourage your support of Utah Foster Care, their mission, and their programs. 
Utah Foster Care Foundation	147642		/users/profile/195312	Jeff DeLong	Donor	5	01/03/2013	In my experience as a donor with Utah Foster Care I feel like my investment is being used for such a great purpose. The kids that I support are getting to go to camp with other kids in foster care. They are hardly ever in the mountains enjoying the beauty of nature and with my gift they are there and getting to spend time with their family having fun, and staying safe. 
Utah Foster Care Foundation	122079	1	/users/profile/166208	peggys	Volunteer	5	09/09/2012	As a young newlywed and student at Brigham Young University I had a wonderful experience with foster care. My wife and I applied to be foster parents. Both of us felt that we could make a difference in the lives of children in need. It wasnt long after that we became involved with four young women between the ages of 13 and 17 who had been in trouble. They had experienced things in their young lives that most that age should not have. They needed a home. Even though both of us were young we were quickly faced with issues that were far beyond our maturity and experience. I was grateful at the time for the support that we received from the foster care professionals involved in that placement. Many years have passed since those young women were in our home and I now serve on the Board of Directors for the Utah Foster Care Foundation. What you should know about this organization is that they are tirelessly committed to the betterment of young people who find themselves in difficult circumstances. They are known for their ability to identify, train and support foster parents in making a difference in the life of a young person. The generous donated funds they receive are carefully monitored and most of the funds are spent in directly meeting the needs of the children. I would encourage you to get to know this organization and to support them in any way you can, because they make a difference  and dont we all want to make a difference.
Utah Foster Care Foundation	120261		/users/profile/163542	Big Dog	Board Member	5	08/09/2012	My first exposure to foster care was as a big brother. In 1969 my mother was working for the military family services agency. As part of that role she was exposed to multiple foster care cases. One day she came home and brought up the idea to our family of being foster parents to a little girl. My brother and I were very excited due to the fact that we were the only two children and we wanted a sister. Kathy came and lived at our home for several months and made us big brothers. I can remember being proud to have a younger sister. I knew she had come from a very troubled home environment. I knew that she had many struggles but I was grateful that we could open our home to her so that she could experience something different. I think my dad might have been hesitant at first but he agreed and went along with the experience. After several months she was reunited with her family. We were saddened. My brother and I were losing a sister and my parents were losing a daughter. Thats when I realized how important the experience was to my father. He genuinely seemed to be disheartened because of her departure. My mom told him that it was better to have loved and lost than to never to have loved at all. Now many years later I wish I knew what happened to Kathy. How did he life turn out? Was she happy? Where is she today? Im grateful for organizations like the Utah Foster Care Foundation. It works tirelessly to identify and to train foster families so that they can provide assistance to young girls like Kathy. Foster care can be a wonderful blessing in the life of a young person who needs an opportunity. I hope Kathys brief experience with us was a blessing to her. I know we all loved her very much. As an adult I have become associated with the Utah Foster Care Foundation. I admire their commitment and devotion to helping children in need. They need your support and involvement. The generous donated funds are managed wisely and almost exclusively spent in meeting the needs of the children. Please consider what you can do to help the Utah Foster Care Foundation make a difference in the life of young people.

I had been looking for quite sometime to find a charitable organization that I felt passionate about, and Habitat was the perfect fit. It's been fun to be involved with an organization that gives back locally, to the community that I live in. I love that Habitat gives people assistance to get into a home so they can do more with their lives. It is really a great organization that is changing lives.

Weber/Davis County, Habitat for Humanity of	296975		/users/profile/387757	mjlloyd	Board Member	5	07/18/2016	I really like the way my donations to Habitat for Humanity keep on giving.  The money is spent to build a home that is sold to a low income family on a 0% interest loan.  Their house payment is very affordable (less than rent) and the money that they pay is used by Habitat for Humanity to build more homes.  My donation comes back to build another home, and the cycle continues.

I have seen where a single home was being renovated for a family, then watched as the other homes on the street followed the lead and began cleaning up their homes as well.  It was an example of how one home can change an entire neighborhood
Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation Utah Leadership Seminar	225216		/users/profile/288985	beccaboo12	Volunteer	5	10/22/2014	HOBY is inspiring!! I attended as a sophomore in high school in 2006, and I lost contact with the organization until this year when I was asked to come back as a facilitator. I was reminded of the incredible impact this organization has on these young future leaders of the world. The HOBY Utah conference is uplifting, and every participant leaves with a renewed sense of confidence and responsibility. Although I attended as a facilitator, I was taking avid notes the whole time. HOBY reminds us all of our true potential...it is truly OUTSTANDING!
Hugh O'Brian Youth Foundation Utah Leadership Seminar	223424		/users/profile/287172	bvross	Volunteer	5	10/16/2014	I have been involved with HOBY Utah since 1998.  I have seen over 1,500 students come and partake of this wonderful adventure.  It is rewarding to see their enthusiasm and excitement as they leave our 3 day seminar and want to help make a change in their schools and communities.  I have had parents send me thank-yous for the change that they have seen in their children.  Many of our students are brothers or sisters of former students because they know HOBY will have an impact on them.  HOBY Utah teaches students to focus and have a purpose in their volunteering.

To see the change in the lives of people in this way is inspiring.  I wonder how it is possible for something like this to come together and it does time and time again.  If things like this happened more often there would be so much good in the wold.  I have watched individuals make huge impacts in their lives and their communities.  This is worth donating to.

Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance	192782		/users/profile/251742	DrJoe	Donor	5	01/18/2014	Writing this in Jan 2014, I have to report that the current Charity Navigator rating for SUWA is 4 stars, the maximum. SUWA is wonderfully active and effective in its efforts to preserve the uniquely gorgeous and inspiring scenery and wilderness status of Utah's natural wonders from so many varied governmental and commercial assaults. No other organization has this specific and necessary focus. Especially if you have ever traveled through any part of scenic southern Utah and been inspired by its beauty, do not hesitate to support this grassroots organization of truly dedicated people.

They have organized grassroots support in Utah and around the country for protection of the outstanding Utah canyon country managed by BLM.  The results so far include establishment of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and identification by BLM of millions of acres that meet wilderness criteria.  The big task ahead is to persuade Congress to give permanent protection to those lands as wilderness.
Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance	86896	1	/users/profile/97415	Joane White	Professional with expertise in this field	1	04/24/2011	I have been reviewing SUWA's financial documents and ratings from various sources.  Charity Navigator lists SUWA as only  2 stars out of 4 because of its declining growing and revenue sources.  As a result, its capacity rating is down to a 1 star out of 4. After reviewing the tax forms, it is obvious that a good portion of the salaries of SUWA's 21 employees are tucked away under program costs, even though programs are not their general function.  That shift did make their administrative costs look better but it was not enough to rescue them from one of the lowest ratings of the environmental nonprofits.

UFB is an amazing organization that helps us visually impaired and bling out a lot they have camps and programs where you are taught how to take care of your self and other very helpful skills. At these camps you get to meet new people and make new friends UFB has helped with that I've made lots of friends cause of all the things UFB does. In my personal experiences with UFB I've gotten to know many useful skills and meet so many kind people everyone works hard and makes everything fun some of my favorite memories come from UFB they help a ton and could do so much more to make others have fun experiences.

To make matters worse, I was six years old and blind. They school I was attending did not know how to help. I soon got a teacher for the blind and found friends, but I was struggling with life skills and having a rough time in school. I did not know how to read and I was falling through the cracks of education. Having zero self confidence was a issue for me, but I never wanted to show it. UFB came into my life soon after this, they had monthly and yearly camps to help me learn how to pour water into a glass, put on makeup and also how to stand up to myself in school. I soon started to play Goalball and this is where I started to take off. Having a safe place where everyone understands you and no judgment happens was great. Here I had a place to be great, build my self confidence and have fun. I have traveled all over the states and have had so many opportunities that i would have never had if it wasn't for UFB never giving up on me and bleeding their own lives into mine to make sure i was getting the help needed to succeed in and outside of school. UFB has changed my life for the better. Madelyn a college student at The University of Utah 
The Utah Foundation for the Blind and Visually Impaired	271147	2	/users/profile/359930	kleinschmidt	Volunteer	5	11/04/2015	I have been associated with the Utah Foundation for the Blind (UFB) as a board member, and more recently as a volunteer, for well over 20 years, and it is my pleasure to write a review.  UFB is an incredibly valuable resource for Utah children and youth with blindness and for their families.  Utah's public schools and the Utah School for the Deaf and Blind provide basic education and training for these special needs children, but with limited funding and teachers spread thin, the schools can provide little more than the basics.  UFB was founded in 1988 by TVIs (Teachers of the Visually Impaired) who realized that these children's unique needs were not being  sufficiently met by the education system and that supplemental services were critically needed.  Since 1988 UFB has provided education and training during non-school hours-education and training centered around Braille literacy, independent living, career development. orientation and mobility, social skills, and athletic and recreation skills. I urge any reader of this review to check out the UFB website at www.ufbvi.org to gain an appreciation of the varied and extensive programming provided by this non-profit's many volunteers and a part-time  executive manager.  Over the years I have had the pleasure of watching these children learn and blossom and grow as a direct result of their experiences with UFB, and I have had the satisfaction of watching these children move into adulthood and become productive, self-assured citizens. I enthusiastically  support  UFB and its remarkable contribution to the  lives of very special kids!    Julia J. Kleinschmidt, PhD, LCSWEmeritus Professor, Ophthalmology and Visual SciencesJohn A.

In this capacity, I was privileged to observe the care and concern demonstrated by individuals working there and by the organization as a whole.  The highest recommendation I can give is that I would send my child there... and I would.  I love their therapists and treatment programs.  I love that the youth who attend West Ridge Academy can participate in 1A  athletics.  I love how the staff is so aware of each student's strengths and weaknesses and so intent upon helping each in any way they can.  This is a great organization.

United Survivors Of Epidermolysisbullosa Corporation	233767		/users/profile/297700	Monsie R.	Client Served	5	11/16/2014	How has USeb changed my life with Epidermolysis Bullosa? Although I was raised to be confident, I still needed that reassurance I could do better than what people saw. I hardly ever met with others with EB, so I often felt alienated from the outside world. I did not feel confident that I would have succeeded by myself; however, I always had the mindset that I would someday. After getting married, I jumped right in experiencing daily responsibilities adults are faced with, but I have always wanted more because deep down I knew I could do more. I am such a free-spiritalways having the desire to travel, soak in, be inspired, but never dreamt I would see that day. My husband and I were gifted the opportunity by dear friends to travel to Utah, participating in the first USeb camp back in 2009. We were both overjoyed. It felt like a safe haven where I could be myselfnot censor myself, empathize, laugh, cry, sing, hug, and not feel rejected, judged, contagious, or gross. We loved every moment of it. It made me realize how society is programmed into beautified perfection. But really, what does that mean? Having an absolutely perfect body without scars? It is more. I speak for anyone that has a challenge they were born with or recently developed; it does not disable you from pursuing your dreams or bettering the world. We only disable ourselves with the way we think. It is what is insidethe heart and soul. After the wonderful experience at the USeb camp in 2009, I started going out by myself. I went even beyond that, traveling on an air plane by myself. To many, these are normal easy to-dos, but to me, it is like successfully constructing the most amazing artifact. EB does not define me; it is only part of my charm. I am human. During the recent ski retreat, I had that doubt come into my mind that I am going to be completely horrid at this! I tried being very active as a child by biking, horseback riding, and I even tried skating! It is has been many years since then so my core has not worked much, sadly. When I saw the morning group of friends that skied with their challenges, and the joy beaming upon their faces after their sessions, it immediately warmed my heart. Most of us chose to do the sit-ski in a bi-ski, which is an amazing creation!  My instructor taught me amazing techniques to help with my balance and lengthening my spine. Ive never been to a chiropractor, but it felt as if I was readjusted, in a good way. I could feel a huge difference health wise immediately after one session. The first day of learning, I was uneasy and not as confident, but felt more at ease during the end of my session. I was stoked for my next session being the next day, but the EB had me questioning about going again. Skiing didnt hurt me at all, but the overall norm of pain at the end of the day came down on me (a typical night for me usually). I changed my way of thinking the night beforerethinking this pain will not defeat me. Because, you know what EB? I just skied down a mountain today!
United Survivors Of Epidermolysisbullosa Corporation	212298		/users/profile/275278	novelettemunroe	Board Member	5	08/26/2014	This nonprofit is near and dear to my heart since I've been on the board since the beginning and I am a person with EB. I was very close to the team of people that made USeb a reality. They believed like I do in the importance of having an organization run by EB people that benefited EB people. EB is a disease that is all encompassing. It effects every single part of your life. It can be debilitating and crippling. Seeing others with EB having the strength to push through the pain and anguish can be very inspiring. Surrounding myself with EB mentors has bettered my life that is why doing it for others is important to me. Having EB mentors has allowed me to graduate university, drive a car, and travel independently just to name a few.  USeb has been able to help improve the quality of lives of many by having camps and helping show other survivors through experience that their lives can be more than just EB. That they can nurture their skills and talents into fruitful lives.  We have helped make people's lives more self-reliant by holding writing contest and giving away equipment like a laptop and iPad. We hope to continue doing those things and more in the future. 
United Survivors Of Epidermolysisbullosa Corporation	208432	1	/users/profile/271118	Taylor13	Board Member	5	08/02/2014	I'm writing this review from the perspective of a husband that saw the birth of this organization as my late wife, Jamie Diane Gibson Hartley, turned her dream into a reality: to help those struggling with her same disorder become more self-reliant like she had done. Our organization is unique because I have yet to see an organization that directly serves those who suffer from EB specifically.  There are many organizations dedicated to finding a cure for this horrific disorder, but, as of yet, and to my knowledge, our organization is the only one that addresses the current needs of people with EB. With the right assistance, people with EB can graduate from high school, got to a university, give back to their communities through employment, non-profits, and political activities, get married, and reach out to support the EB community in ways that only they can.  I know this because it's what my dear wife did.  She was a model to people with severe forms of EB.  She showed by example how to achieve your dreams in spite of EB.  She helped motivate others out of learned helplessness and depression, grab a hold of hope, and achieve things they never thought possible.
Pwa Coalition Of Utah	109239		/users/profile/94512	sadness	Client Served	1	04/07/2012	The only service I know that they give is free haircuts and those haircuts come from students from a school so it doesn't cost them anything. I know that I have not had any services from them other than that in years. I feel they should maybe sponsor some kind of activity each month for people living with HIV. I also hope they do the river trip. Many of us living with HIV look forward to this and there wasn't one last year. 
Pwa Coalition Of Utah	84984		/users/profile/94512	sadness	Client Served	1	04/07/2011	I am not happy with the services provided by this agency at all. I haven't seen anything really come out of this place. All the services that it says it offers, have been cut completely. The very last one, the yearly river trip which many of us count on each year, was cancelled this year due to lack of funding supposedly. The thing is, that they opened a thrift store to support the agency and now there are actually LESS services. I know they are making a profit, because they also get sizable donations from the community. I believe there is a misapproptiation of funds going on. I have heard that all the agencies money is filtered through the executive directors personal business account. It just seems that when you say you are an AIDS service organization, you should provide services with the money you get. I do see that other agencies are bringing services to meet there, but none are sponsored by the agency themselves.

Hundreds of complainst have been made to the orginizations board about the executive director and yet nothing has been done about her.  This orginization is only here to support the salarys of the employees and has cuts services to the HIV/AIDS persons it is ment to serve.  All programs that are listed on this orginizations web page are not happening and are not being offered.  There is no recreation program that is offered and the health and eduicational programs are non existent.  The Director works from home and takes product that is donated to them home on a regular basis.  It is my oppinion that the director should be accountable for a 40 hour work week as she is paid to be there.  The phones are not answered and phone calls are not returned.  This is the absolutly worse HIV/Aids org in utah.  I would like to see a change in theboard of directors as they have had the same governing body for years.

So i have been obsessed with keeping my teeth n always brushed consistently but I felt within the past few yrs I've lost the war on cavities and weak enamel with chips of teeth chipping off all of sudden which of course brought my self confidence went down drastically down to depression..I became unemployed and now on government assistance which is hard for me to accept but at this time as a single mother I learned you can work hard and have everything and one day everything can be gone.. In loosing literally everything to almost homelessness.. So last year I thought I was beyond blessed n extremely graciously excited to be accepted for the Share A Smile foundation so I may be able to smile and laugh harder again and importantly have the confidence to apply for jobs and so on.. And so I went to my initial orientation and read all the guidelines clearly and the packet that gives information of all the services they provide and  may help with your dental services and in return you do community service hours in exchange which was a no brainer.. I love to give and give back to the community.. So I knew my teeth maybe needed a root canal and bridges cause according to the packet this is what they provide and more for so much hours of community service hours for each service.. So I eagerly and quickly put in 40+  hrs of community service before my first visit.. And when I went to my first appointment with this Share a Smile foundation and I was treated horrible and the dentist came with no introduction or welcoming compared to paying for a dentist who are kind and understanding with some warm welcoming that I've been to in previous years.. So i thought okay since this is "free" service thats how they treat us like "scum".. Well thats part of my horrific side of this foundation experience ..To make it worst the dentist sits down and said well your teeth need too much work were just going to just take out all your teeth and get dentures.. A complete shock of over bearing thoughts of just unbelievable results. .. In the end I was crying uncontrollably that now I'm back to square one.. Is there another way or alternative I can turn to cause at this time I need immediate atttention and all the advice I can get??

Share A Smile Inc	57831		/users/profile/59303	EVogel	Volunteer	5	11/24/2010	Share a smile is an amazing organization dedicated to helping the most impoverished people in our community.  The work in partnership with the Food and Care Coalition in Provo Utah.  They have a beautiful clinic housed inside the Food and Care facility where dental and medical care is provided to the homeless and poor of the community.  All of the services are provided free of charge and the clients pay back the system by providing four hours of community service for each dental visit that they receive.  There are over 60 dentists, nurses and physicians now that come and volunteer time at the clinic.  All doctors and dentists volunteer their time.  Most of the supplies are donated by local businesses and foundations keeping overhead very low.  I have personally seen lives changed as people are treated.  One person recently had a heart attack while eating dinner at the facility.  One of our doctors was able to tend to her and help her arrange home health care to come in and continue her care.  She has a 9 year old son who would now be an orphan if it hadn't been for the intervention of one of our physicians.

Pregnancy Care Center Of Ogden	286989		/users/profile/377061	Rachel_H	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	What Do You Mean Im Pregnant?! I stared down at two pink lines that changed everything about who I was. How could I already be pregnant? My husband and I had been married only a short month and a half, we had just graduated college, and neither one of us had a solid income yet. We were just barely making it with only two of us. Not to mention, we had planned to take a few years to enjoy being newly married before starting a family! Over the course of the next 9 months we wrestled with many thoughts and emotions about the pregnancy, not all of which were positive. During that time, I understood for the first time in my life why someone might seriously consider having an abortion. On May 27th, 2012, we welcomed our son Josiah Philip Holdaway. As I grew into motherhood, I thought back on how much I struggled during my pregnancy and how happy I was now to have my son. I began to feel compassion and sorrow for the women who also struggle with the news of unexpected pregnancy and choose to have abortions. What joy these women miss! So I began to look for a way to help those women process their emotions about unexpected pregnancy. My hope was to help them realize that what seems like a disaster now, will be a blessing in the future! I found the Pregnancy Care Center of Ogden, a Christian life-affirming ministry that helps women in unexpected pregnancies find alternatives to abortion. Now I give several hours a week and part of our finances toward helping those women discover hope for themselves and their unborn children! Visit www.ogdenpcc.org to learn more! 
Pregnancy Care Center Of Ogden	105380		/users/profile/141589	utahbucks	Donor	5	02/02/2012	We have given to and volunteered with The Pregnancy Care Center of Ogden for over 12 years.  Why?  The Pregnancy Care Center helps us put feet to our desire to care for: women, men, children, and babies in our local community.  We have observed well trained staff and volunteers in their efforts to reach out to our community and have seen: professionalism, organization, graciousness, generosity, and self-sacrifice.  If you are not already supporting the PCC of Ogden, we encourage you to visit and consider how your time, talent, and treasure might help further the goals of the PCC.
Pregnancy Care Center Of Ogden	100217	1	/users/profile/121826	The Smiths	Donor	5	11/03/2011	What a safe place for couples to go when they have to make decisions about an unintended pregnancy.  This organization stands firmly for the rights of the unborn child in ways that are beyond the natural in this world but at the same time they provide very tangible resources for those who are going through or have previously had an unintended pregnancy.  Our donations to this organization are a great way for us to provide assistance to the many nameless babies who need advocates in the natural and to partner along with the PCC as they rely on the Great Advocate.  They are open about their finances and we are always pleased with their expedient response to our donations and their willingness to keep us informed on what is going on at the Center.

The Ivy Girl Academy	146544		/users/profile/193461	Kristin26	General Member of the Public	5	12/12/2012	The Ivy Girl Academy is a remarkable tool serving young girls.  In a time when these girls are being bombarded by false images in advertising and pressured at school and other venues, or perhaps even struggling at home, Ivy Girl Academy teaches them valuable skills and techniques for being strong and valiant.  It helps them strengthen their own value and self worth; it encourages pride in self; it teaches valuable tools to stand up for themselves; it enables courage, strength and hope; it teaches correct principles.  What a gift this is to our young, impressionable future leaders and mothers.

The atmosphere in the project rooms as the volunteers create these beautiful kits, (some have called them hygiene kits on steroids) has such a loving spirit. The men and women prepare every kit with beautifully themed and color coordinated packages. Every recipient feels the kits were made especially for them, and they realize that they are cared by those in this community. I believe so much in what they are doing, that I am now on their Board of Directors and am so excited to see what's in the future for them.  Maxine Rasmussen - Board of Directors Hearts Knit Together

The unique combination of quality mental health professionals, equine specialists and horses provides each client with opportunities to discover their own strengths, perceived weeknesses and improvement pathways. EAGALA just adopted a significant, yet achievable, vision for this organization: Every person around the world has access to EAGALA Model services. I support EAGALA and give to this cause because of the real changes that are being made in people's lives all around the world. In addition, I am confident that this organization is being managed in a way that will advance the organization's cause for perpetual positive impact.
Equine Assisted Growth And Learning Association Inc	135272		/users/profile/169998	Alicia11	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/07/2012	Exemplary organization.  Exemplary mental health, human service, professional and organizational trainings as well.  In the field of equine mental health -i.e.- the use of horses in mental health psychotherapy, the EAGALA model is without question or doubt the highest rating in levels of care, purpose, professional results and findings, accuracy, professional integrity and soundness in practice both professionally and spiritually.  I include the spiritual aspect in this last evaluation, as there are too many practices in the mental health field, including equine work that is in truth unsound, inaccurate and/ or unhealthy.  The trainings at each Level and the practice of this EAGALA modality is effective, amazingly accurate and very enjoyable!  To boot, one, whether the professional or the client, enjoys fresh air too!  EAGALA has both domestic and international affiliations.  Truly extraordinary and sound work!
THE HOPE ALLIANCE	316555	1	/users/profile/31369	robinwhitney	Donor	5	10/29/2016	Our teen-aged daughter went on a Hope Alliance-organized service trip to a rural Haitian orphanage last year, and it was endlessly eye-opening and illuminating for her.  She worked and saved beforehand to buy and assemble 50 sewing kits for local women there.  Not only do the residents have no money to make purchases, but there are no stores or supplies available to buy in the rural areas.  Thanks to Hope Alliance for organizing this type of service trip for teens, she came back with a much bigger understanding of the world, and the part she can play in making it a kinder, gentler place.  Hope Alliance doesn't just do acts of good work in areas that need it most, they also transform their volunteers into committed, life-long, go-gooders. And I think that's pretty incredible.

Color-Country Animal Welfare Aka Ccaw	197699		/users/profile/258424	robbiej123	Client Served	5	04/15/2014	While on vacation in Utah   I found a dusty, small black cat that was hanging around the general store in Torrey.  I asked in the store if anyone knew the cat and they all said they thought it was a stray.  I was quite concerned about this affectionate kitty.  At the store they gave me the number of  Dottie Weaver of the Colour Country Animal Welfare.  Within an hour  she came to pick up the cat .  I was so impressed with Dottie's commitment to the animals and she shared some of the the spaying/neutering/ear identification procedures and her care and feeding  of ferrel cats in the area.  Her love and commitment to the care of cats and dogs  in the area  improves the quality of life for these helpless animals. I gave a donation to CCAW  and even though I live in Vancouver, Canada I  feel a strong bond with the organization and  still plan to contribute.  This experience of dealing with Dottie and having a happy ending for the cat  was the highlight of my holiday.  Torrey,  Utah, you are lucky to have Dottie Weaver,who makes a real difference in your community!    Check out the website for more info!        Sincerely,   Roberta Jones

For the first 5 years, we only donated items for auction to raise funds for the program.  Finally, after yearly requests from Linda Myers, we went to the Rug Show to actually see what takes place and how our donations were used.  We were able to not only do these things but also to meet many of the grandmothers and other volunteers that make this program work.  We have owned a Pendleton store in Park City for 17 years, so the American Indian heritage is very familiar to us.  The Adopt-a-Native Elder Program has a direct positive effect on the lives/livelihood of these Native American people whose traditions ANE is trying to preserve.

Years of painting backdrops, doing photography , preparing graphic designs, posters and programs and being on the board of directors has been years a joy.  Being involved in an organization that provides something for our community that hasn't existed before.  This non profit provides incredible real life professional experiences, and contributes so much to our community.  From a superior ballet director to a real ballet production which gives the city and the participants an amazing visual art experience.

IMAGINE BALLET THEATRE INC	240754	1	/users/profile/327038	MoM6	Client Served	5	04/07/2015	About six months ago, we decided to send my daughter to this ballet school. I come from a family of professional dancers, so the quality of the instruction was essential in our choice, and I was pleased with the caliber of dancers that were performing in his company. I had no idea what an extensive and amazing atmosphere was being built in this school. My daughter feels like a part of a family and the director does everything he can to make every girl feel that connection. Our family is large and therefore sending our daughter to an extensive ballet program is a sacrifice and he strives to make sure that each child and each family doesn't struggle to pay and participate in his programs. This program provides each dancer with an experience that builds pride, self-esteem, and joy in addition to talent. His desire to contribute to the community through art walks and donations of Christmas trees and to help further local participation and education in ALL arts is admirable. Most of all, I am impressed with the quality of the experience provided for both the performers and those attending through live orchestration and beautiful costumes. I am grateful everyday when I send my young ballerina scurrying off to class, that I found Imagine Ballet and she can enjoy this type of education.

Over the next few years I became quite involved helping with fund raising, gathering and shipping relief supplies, and going to Zambia to distribute supplies.  Thanks to ZSF I've had some incredible life-changing experiences.  Based on my limited experience and knowledge, I think that ZSF has experienced frustrations over the years, like all non-profits do, but at the present I believe they are doing a great job in Zambia.  Their programs have a huge impact in the communities that they serve, and many lives have been changed for the better through the efforts of this fund.  I know the founder personally and hold her in the highest regard.  Her integrity and desire to help those in the most need in Zambia are beyond reproach.  I highly recommend this fund.

I meet quarterly with the board, I have reviewed their current audit, I know they have been audited by the Utah Consumer Protection agency and passed with honors, they are accepted by the CFC and the better business bureau.   It only makes sense to me that since they have been helping in Zambia for 16 years they must truly care about the Zambian people. I feel confident that while all charities have their challenges the Zambia's Scholarship Fund has met these challenges and are better and stronger for them.

Bountiful Community Food Pantry	151315		/users/profile/201981	Craig18	Volunteer	5	03/19/2013	I have been a volunteer at this organizations operations center for almost five years, three to five days a week. The greatest good  comes from the hearts of the volunteers who donate thousands of hours, driving trucks, lifting and sorting canned goods, moving donations to specified areas, and handing out these items to the clients, at times, upwards of 600 families a month.  The management has worked hard to not only take care of clients needs but has also formed working relationships with other community individuals and organizations who are trying to help those in need. As far as I know, we are the only organization in Davis County of this type that operates with only two paid employees, in my opinion underpaid I might add. The pantry exists not only to serve those on need of food assistance but also for the volunteers. I, for one, have grown in many ways from my associations with the good people who have given of their time and talents to make this a wonderful organization to be part of, from the board of directors down to the community service workers. Doing good is not always easy but at the Bountiful Community Food Pantry it abounds and is easily recognized by the smiles on both clients and volunteers faces, the laughter, and oft times tears of gratitude we hear, see and share. There are volunteers who have 10+ years helping the pantry continue to grow to meet the community's needs.  I would invite all who feel a need to find joy in service to come see for yourself what can be truly be a rewarding experience.

Salt Lake Arts Academy	286949		/users/profile/377021	Katy_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Surviving Middle School: Why I give to Salt Lake Arts Academy.  Adolescence can be rough for young people, and particularly at school.  Kids are asking themselves every day 'Who am I?, Where do I belong? Am I cool enough? Am I smart enough?'  All great -- and distracting! -- questions  that Salt Lake Arts Academy tries to help our students answer for themselves.Salt Lake Arts Academy helps all kinds of students figure out where they belong in the world by providing a free public middle school education, enriched by the arts, in downtown Salt Lake City.  I helped found this school thirteen years ago, along with visionary educators and fellow parents, all of whom wanted to make a safe, inclusive, diverse place for kids of all abilities to not just make it through middle school, but thrive.  Our vision included making sure that every student received at least one our of arts instruction, every day, all year long.  The result is a place of joyous learning -- daily engagement in music, drama, dance and visual arts makes kids feel like they belong to the tribe.  Everyone is given an opportunity to explore their world through many lenses, then focus in on their particular passion.  And engaged students become students who achieve in the classroom and beyond.   Public education, particularly middle school, often works for many students -- but for a quirky kid, a quiet kid, a loud kid, a bouncy kid or a bullied kid it can be a tortuous and nonproductive time.  I give to Salt Lake Arts Academy so that all those different kinds of students, help them find their passions, find their place in the world, and become creative and confident builders of their future. My children are in college now, but I continue to give to Salt Lake Arts Academy so that more students can experience the same inclusive, grounding community my daughters found.  I give because I believe in building creative minds.www.slarts.org

Farm Bureau is  organized  to support farmers  who face issues  with  water rights, environmental issues  and legislative issues that threaten interference with farming practices.  Utah  Farm Bureau  strongly supports an "Ag in the Classroom Program"  that provides information to teachers so that they  can  integrate  their  lessons with  lessons about agriculture.  Agriculture is  still our basic industry!!!  We sometimes   forget  about  where our food really comes from.

Bad Dog Rediscovers America	173077		/users/profile/229140	hboxwill	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/03/2013	Some say H2 Empower is my baby because I am the founder. True. But after working in Ethiopia for over 10 years I am still driven to help us grow because I have seen the children working in classrooms with no furniture or literally under a tree, classrooms that are so dark I couldn't read the blackboard, classrooms where there are over 90 children. H2 Empower is  working to improve these conditions by training teachers, providing books to increase access to knowledge, putting water and toilets in the schools where children had no access to water without walking to a distance creek. These small interventions impact thousands of children in a rural area so populated that a primary school has over 2,500 children. h2 Empower consistently works with the local community to address concerns, to enhance learning, to serve the whole family. I hope anyone who reads this review can support this work. Then you too can make a difference in the lives of these families.

Utah Tamil Sangam	151228	1	/users/profile/201834	chandrakumar	General Member of the Public	1	03/18/2013	The worst tamil sangam I have ever been to.

Their amateur shows creates a total disgrace to the Tamil community. I would never recommend this sangam to any of my friends!

I was scared, without resources, and fearful of the consequences of leaving my relationship.  But I knew I had to do something different for myself and my children.  I was being stalked and felt like I could never get out.  The Dove Center took me in and provided me with the resources that I needed to take the necessary steps to leave.  I was vulnerable and lacked focus.  The advocates and the counselors empowered me and provided me with the encouragement and strength to stand up for myself and recognize that I was capable of taking care of myself and my family.  It was the most difficult decision of my life, I don't think that I could have made it without their support.

Rinceoiri Don Spraoi Irish Dancers	205842		/users/profile/268098	SBrimhall	Client Served	5	07/13/2014	This is a family-oriented, performance-only Irish dance school. I've been dancing here for 3 years, and I couldn't be happier with Rinceoiri! There's a wide range of ages (preK-grandparents) and experience levels. Most everyone is friendly and willing to help, and the teachers are typically pretty easy-going, but good at pinpointing trouble spots and giving practical exercises and drills (often the drills are *very* effective, and you really know it the next day. RDS is also known as "Ben's Kickbutt Gym"). There is a focus on personal improvement (polishing technique, learning and perfecting new steps and dances), but most of the dances we do are heavily team-based. No solo pieces. There's a mix of very traditional (St. Patrick's Day) and more contemporary (new choreography set to Lord of the Dance music) (plus the odd German techno song for drills).   Costumes are simple and relatively inexpensive, and you only need one. (Plus, no wigs!) Hardshoes and ghillies (for girls) required once you graduate from beginner.  There are many degrees of skill even within the performance group. The people who know a dance better happily help out the people who are just learning it, and I've always felt totally comfortable asking for help from anybody. The teachers also choreograph certain dances so that sections are designed for different skill levels. If you're looking for rigorous practice and critical instructors who drive you to become a champion, this is the wrong school for you. If you're looking for a fun atmosphere with people who love dance and traditional Irish culture, and like to perform in the community, I highly recommend RDS.

Ive been coming 25 years and have not seen a decent Swan Lake in years.  But this truly was the best.  The changes of music, the choreography, even the children on stage led to a beautiful timeless performance.  I do not recall the names, but your two leads were incredible, youthful, sensitive, just like older teenage love would be, innocent, passionate.  The emotion surged to the mezzanine where we sat spellbound for the entire performance.  Never have I risen to my feet sooner after any production than this. This was absolute perfection.

That could have been done from home using phones, email, and the USPS. Lack of preparation to argue in favor of our position clearly annoyed a Senator who asked questions, then quickly ended the meeting upon receiving no answers to those questions. In hindsight, it is clear that the trip's true purpose was part of an ongoing scheme to take brief, regular vacations at the expense of the student body. Surely, an employee of the Department of Education is an UNPAID speaker. The longest "seminar" was actually a comedy show, as in a two-hour performance by a professional comedian.

Jewish Family Service	179168		/users/profile/235808	shiffy	Client Served	5	10/17/2013	How can I possibly thank Jewish Family Service enough.  It has helped my parents and me get through, Alzheimer's, Cancer and has been the wind beneath our wings during the most difficult of times. When I first turned to JFS for help, I knew in my heart that everything would be okay.Jewish Family Service started helping my elderly parents almost three years ago. They were 86 years old. As they were both Holocaust survivors, the JFS was able to acquire monetary help for them so that they could get homecare. The warm and loving ladies that take care of my parents, have made such a difference in their care. JFS has helped in so many other ways. Social workers and case workers have come to visit my parents to offer  conversation and just to show they were there to help in any way they could. There were also some young case workers, compassionate women who would visit my parents and lovingly spend quality time with them, just so that they would not feel alone. These young women were the highlight of my parents' afternoons and they looked forward to their visits with great anticipation. JFS also brought gifts during the holidays and helped in taking care of outstanding bills that my parents were unable to pay.   The most beautiful and outstanding feature of this compassionate and valuable organization is that the people working there are always looking for solutions to problems for the people they help. "Where there is a will, there is a way" should be their motto because they have certainly lived up to those words. How many times did I hear "How can we help". Lori and Hedy, Patricia and Iris, Sarah and others who have helped in different areas in order to make my parents' life easier. The people behind the name JFS are humble and sweet and most of all compassionate and extremely hard-working.  For so many, they are  lifesavers.  My father is no longer here; he passed away this past August.  He wanted to stay in his own home and not go to a nursing care facility.  He got his wish, and Jewish Family Service helped make his wish come true. No review can actually describe how thankful I am to this remarkable organization that knows the meaning of "helping your neighbor" .  We could not have done it without them and I pray that they will be around always, continuing their outstanding work. So many people depend on their good works. Thanks to the angels working at JFS in San Diego California and elsewhere.

AMERICAN APITHERAPY SOCIETY INC	88355		/users/profile/99345	Susan	Board Member	4	05/03/2011	I have served on the AAS Board for about 8 years. The Board, as well as the Members, are attracted to AAS because it promotes complementary medicine.  People who haved common conditions, and those with unusual conditions turn to Apitherapy and the support of AAS to assist them in healing and in maintaining their health.  People with MS or those with chronic pain or arthritis, for instance, who have had unpleasant side effects from medications, turn to Apitherapy, and many have significant relief.  The Society supports its members in many ways, and  I have been honored to be part of this Board and interact with our members.
Montessori At Riverton	154081		/users/profile/204912	Kiel	General Member of the Public	5	04/10/2013	I have had my children at this school for several years and I have not had any problems.  It has been an amazing school for my children.  They have only been treated with kindness and caring.  I have had a number of opportunities to volunteer and help the school in various ways.  During all of these opportunities it has brought a sense of togetherness and community responsibility.  For me this school has been a great blessing in mine and my children's lives.  It has been around for many years and I truly hope it will be around for many more.  It is one of the great parts of Riverton I am really proud of.   
South Davis Recovery Club Inc	196476	1	/users/profile/256808	Beccaboop	Volunteer	5	03/26/2014	This club is a nonprofit organization that has 12 step meetings daily. Its mission statement reads " The Backstreet club provides a safe place for those seeking recovery through 12 step programs.. It saved my life and continues to be a safe haven from the insanity of living life on life's terms while giving  directions on how to do so.  I believe if the 12 steps were introduced early in life, maybe our children would have a better chance of resistance from  alcoholism and/or addictions. And all 12 step alcoholic parents that display a good example to follow. May God Bless and keep us open.  peace. 
Rio Verde University Inc	15788	1	/users/profile/17630	DavidR	Volunteer	5	10/19/2009	I found Rio Verde University Department of Soil Science people to be very hard working, methodical, and their scientific director Dr. Jacobson to be very knowledgeable.

Sunshine Terrace Foundation Inc	217623	1	/users/profile/281163	VolunteerLogan	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	To understand the impact one person can have on an individual, volunteering for the "Adopt a  Grandparent" program is incredible.  We always think that everyone has family around but a lot of elderly residents don't.  I've enjoyed just sitting, taking a walk, doing a puzzle, whatever my friend wants to do.  And when I leave, he smiles!  I know the staff takes great care of the residents, too, but this extra bit of attention just for him is fun for me and means so much to him.
Amigos Of Honduras	217779		/users/profile/281322	Justgivin	Volunteer	5	09/26/2014	I have been involved with Amigos of Hunduras for about 7 years.  I spent a week and traveled down with the principals and saw first hand the great work they have been doing.  They focus on mainly build water project and building schools in the mountains of central Honduras.  The requirement is that the villagers do all the labor and Amigos provides the materials and engineering.  No overhead taken by organization and principals are top notch.

Interweave Solutions	238761		/users/profile/324176	Spiffykins	General Member of the Public	5	03/02/2015	I have seen the difference that training from Interweave Solutions makes first hand.  I have spoken with group members whose lives have been dramatically improved.  Interweave trains people how to better their lives.  They don't just give people money, they show them how to make money for themselves.   The self-esteem Magdalene gained helped her leave and abusive husband.  She told me how the support of her group was critical in helping her to have the courage to leave.  For Francisca, Interweave Solutions helped her business improve and she had the self confidence to demand her husband stop drinking all their small amount of money away.    Both these women have been impacted by the power of groups.  It is a tremendous thing to hear the stories of those who have improved their lives because of Interweave. 
Cottonwood Canyons Foundation	195722		/users/profile/94840	Richard Midddleton	Volunteer	5	03/17/2014	I met CCF through joining one of their wildflower walks when I first moved to Salt Lake City.  It was a wonderful way of learning about a part of the country that was completely unfamiliar, to me and added enormously to my enjoyment of the spectacular scenery here.  I soon found myself (with no previous experience!) training as a wildflower guide, a volunteer naturalist and a snowshoe guide, and have led field trips for the past 9 years.  The winter snowshoe trips especially are a great experience for students (mainly main-stream 4th grade, but including some older ones, special needs students, and other groups), many of whom have never been out in the canyons in winter before,.  Often they come back later in the year and delight in learning about  beavers, and hunting for aquatic macroinvertebrates (bugs!) in our lakes .   Also in summer, the 3-day wildflower festival in our canyons draws hundreds of people, not just from Utah but from all over the country, some experts, but many experiencing this magnificent display for the first time.  I believe that CCF is playing a vital educational role, and I'm proud to be part of it.  In addition, CCF is active in conservation, through programs such as trail maintenance and removal of invasive weeds, both vital in keeping our National Forest intact despite heavy recreational pressures.
Utah Partners For Health	112987	1	/users/profile/153762	kmicka	Board Member	5	05/25/2012	Utah Partners for Health is an excellent example of an innovative approach to the difficult problem of providing access to healthcare for the uninsured.

Northstar International Inc	241793		/users/profile/328449	DeweyJLevie	Donor	5	04/27/2015	I attended have attended the 2014 and 2015 North Star Conferences.  I have been very impressed at the good that this organization has done with the LGBT community and more recently learned of the good that they have done with the transgender community.  They do not waste resources!  They put resources to good use and utilize volunteers from the community for all that they do.  The Board of Directors are all volunteers and give of their time and resources to plan and put together a wonderful conference each year.  Their conference provides education that helps people to better their lives and serve others.  I believe than any resources that you provide will be magnified and produce a great impact in this community.

Utah Friends Of Basset Hounds	323405		/users/profile/417737	transplant11	Volunteer	4	02/18/2017	They truly care about their hounds!  No hound gets turned away, everyone involved volunteers their time (they take ZERO pay), and the vast majority of the donations go to care for rescues or find forever families  or fosters for them.  Board members and volunteers always go that extra mile for the benefit of the hounds.The Board , while devoted, could take better advantage of volunteers willing to take on some projects (instead of being limited to just "showing up").

Utah Asian Charitable Foundation	243442	1	/users/profile/330187	chrissie105	General Member of the Public	1	05/22/2015	If you go to the University of Utah then that's great but if not then you shall expect to not get this scholarship. The application review process is as biased as can be.  Literally 99% of applicants from the U of U Asian American Student Association gets the scholarship and no one else. Salt Lake Community College has an Asian Student Association and this year (2015) none of the students got the scholarship from SLCC ASA and 20+ members from the U of U AASA got the scholarship. Biased much? There is inequality towards the institutions other than the U of U. I don't know how the UACF does the process of choosing the volunteers to review the applications but 99% sure that they are affiliated with the U of U somehow. Don't ever donate to this foundation. They are sneaky and you don't wanna know what they do behind the scenes. 
CHILD AND FAMILY SUPPORT CENTER OF CACHE COUNTY INC	158646	1	/users/profile/210503	kreck	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/23/2013	This is an amazing organization with a mission to Strengthen Families and Protect Children. I have personally witnessed the many miracles that have occurred because of the CFSC, not only does it protect children from impossible situations such as physical and sexual abuse and neglect, but they also focus on strengthening the entire family through outreach and education. Most impressively however, the staff at the CFSC is by far the most impressive that I  have seen. Each year they serve thousands of children and families who would otherwise not have a place to go!!! 
COMMON GROUND OUTDOOR ADVENTURES INC	155058		/users/profile/205919	Coombs	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/16/2013	I have been affiliated with Common Ground for several years in several capacities.  Initially, it was with clients of mine who were adults with disabilities when I worked for an organization that serves adults with disabilities.  I then had a man with down syndrome who lived with me for 13 years attend several of their activities.  I also have had my son attend.  My son is on the Autism Spectrum and went rafting with them last summer.  Common Ground also came and did some fun activities with the students at my school where I am a Special Needs Preschool teacher.  Over the years I have been dog sledding, camping, went to Disneyland, rafting, canoeing etc.  as a volunteer or staff member.  We had a spectacular time every time.   It was always well organized, excellent food, and great fun.  We have loved our association with them over the years.

No one is disabled.  We are all able body person.  I am a retired Special Eduacation teacher.  SPLORE helped me to pick this as my career path.  katherine garlington
Guild Of The Utah Shakespearean Festival	236099		/users/profile/319882	GUSF	Volunteer	5	12/31/2014	The Guild does wonderful work supporting the Utah Shakespeare Festival.  From 2005 to 2014, they raised and donated $175,000 to USF for their use.
Empowerment Services	188030		/users/profile/245272	amywilly	Client Served	5	11/07/2013	Empowerment Services hosted the Utah Peer Conference for people like me with bipolar and I learned that people with mental illness can recover and have meaningful lives and be respected as peer specialists working in all sorts of places with other people helping them feel better about themselves, etc. The speakers were all great, the food was good and best of all the conference was free. I didn't know that peer run organizations existed or that peer specialists could get jobs because of their mental illness. Empowerment Services is educating people and telling them that it is okay to have a mental illness and that you will survive and be happy.
EQUALITY UTAH	276028	1	/users/profile/365723	Turner B.	Volunteer	5	01/08/2016	Since 2009 I have been involved with Equality Utah, first as a volunteer, later as a candidate for Ogden City Council I received their endorsement and support, and now I work for the organization as the Membership Coordinator.  In that time I've watched the transformational work that the organization is engaged in and witnessed the remarkable successes that our model produces.
YOUTH CHAMPIONS CHARITY INC	292021	1	/users/profile/382506	temitchell	Volunteer	5	06/03/2016	Youth Champions Charity is a great organization that is working to help children and young adults who are dealing with mental health issues, disabilities, disorders, abuse and life threatening  but their family is unable to afford treatment any longer. This is a worthy cause because without it these individuals have to suffer without the proper treatment. They have helped many individuals so far and will help many more in the future. 
No More Homeless Pets in Utah	47879	3	/users/profile/48697	rainy	Volunteer	5	07/08/2010	On the weekends NMHPU is at Petsmart with a group of loving dogs and cats looking for new homes and families for these deserving pets.  If you've been to Petsmart and seen the dogs and cats there for pet adoption weekends you've probably seen lovely cats and dogs.  Often when I'm there people comment that they want to take all the animals home with them; that's how  compelling the pets are.  The Staff is there to answer questions, educate and oversee the whole event and go over applications for adoptions.  But what you don't see is the enormous amount of work that went on before the event that day starting early morning till late in the evening.  Some of the adoption pets are living in foster homes; these volunteers live with the shelter dogs and will deliver the animal in their care to the location for the adoption.  But some of the dogs are in kennels, they are fed, exercised and gussied up, loaded into the trucks and driven straight to the event.  (This is the point where I'm exhausted and the staff is just getting started.)  Volunteers show up to help with this pre-adoption routine; if there are not enough volunteers the staff sholders the burden and handles things.  Some staff co-ordinates volunteers and some teach volunteers what needs to be done; how to handle the animal and how to answer questions all while watching the pets in the cages to make sure their stress level is kept low.  The most impressive thing to me about the Staff is their patience, when you see the pets they inspire compassion, but when you work with the public, homeless pets who need to be watched over, fed, watered, monitored with a third eye while  volunteers ask questions and the public looks at the animals!  It's the enormous amount of patience is what I'm inspired by.  Volunteers like me will take the dogs out for walks one at a time to stretch their legs; relieve themselves on a hydrant and play a bit with the dogs; I personally sing to them since they are the only creatures on the earth who have a taste for my songs.  I will clean cages; walk dogs and do anything I'm asked.  After a dog I have made friends with gets a home a feeling of huge satisfaction is shared by all.  I'm now a believer in the NMHPU moto "Together we can save them all."
ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA SOCIETY	255286		/users/profile/343669	Kanarrakid	General Member of the Public	5	09/08/2015	The Alzheimer's & Dementia Society has been a wonderful help to our community since another large nonprofit serving seniors with dementia closed here in Southern Utah.   They provide programs that have helped our family in our caregiving efforts.  We especially enjoy the   Activity Classes because my adult son with dementia has a social network again and I have time to run my errands and take care of my ill husband.
Thank A Hero Foundation	286805		/users/profile/376875	Sarah_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I give because they gave. On average I donate about 30 hours a week to help Thank A Hero Foundation meet the goals they have to eliminate military suicide by being there to help hold up the Heroes in need. I pack care packages and mail them (the picture is a recent holiday set of care packages!!), I run and get gift cards for groceries, make utility payments for Heroes, I post all over social media to help raise awareness. I donate every last penny I don't need to live. They are an absolute no more than 2% (in FY2014 they were rated at 2% because that was the year of renewals and filings, in FY2015 they rated at 0%!!) overhead which means that for every dollar they get in NO LESS than 98 cents goes directly to help Heroes. However, because they can't afford to advertise (it takes away from the need) they have very little come in. The board is all volunteer and they often use every penny they don't have an absolute need for, because the mission is THAT important.
KIDS HEROES FOUNDATION	284565	1	/users/profile/374622	Blythe K.	Volunteer	5	04/04/2016	This a wonderful organization, run by very generous and amazing people. They will take on anything that is asked of them, and don't turn anyone away that may need help. They go above and beyond what they are asked to do.
Whispering Canyons Foundation Inc.	167062	5	/users/profile/221910	coopsters6	Volunteer	5	09/04/2013	I hooked up with Whispering Canyons Foundation when we were helping a neighboring foster child make it to the facility to ride.  Within a short period of time I realized that I had found something very special.  I have  been a volunteer now for almost 2 years and have watched the staff and trainers work with many under-privileged and what would be considered "at risk" teens.  I have seen lives changed.  And that's enough to give any non-profit a great rating.  Whispering Canyons is a pretty small foundation with a big desire to grow and I would highly recommend it as a place to volunteer or to donate.
