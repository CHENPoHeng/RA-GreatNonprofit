Youth Journalism International	299356	2	/users/profile/390254	Mugdha	Client Served	5	08/05/2016	Youth Journalism International is an organization truly devoted to educating young journalists and introducing them to people worldwide who share their passion. As young person, it can be difficult to get an audience for your work. But YJI's global platform gives young journalists a wide and receptive audience to share their passion with. The program helps writers, as well as artists and photographers, grow and develop their craft with people who share their drive. It is welcoming from the very start, allowing students to connect with one another and learn from each other in an environment that encourages cooperation and collaboration. The mentors work closely with students to help them with their pieces, so students learn not only how to write good articles, but also how to be good journalists and embody the values of ethical reporters.  I've been writing for YJI since 2014, and in the past couples of years itself I've been granted a variety of opportunities to develop my writing. I've travelled to Texas, and Washington D.C., where I'd been given the opportunity to participate in journalism conferences, and also to Canada, where myself and two other YJI students met up with students there and wrote about our experiences.  YJI promotes lasting connections across borders, bringing together writers, artists, and photographers. The program has given me the chance to meet YJI students from Iowa, Missouri, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the Netherlands. Not only have I made good friends, but I've learned much about journalism from these amazing writers and inspiring experiences.

To learn about journalism you'll have to wait until you finish High School but with YJI, you can learn a lot within a short span and I'm grateful enough to have learned about the practical part of journalism, which I will be forever grateful to. In Africa many young people drop out of school immediately after finishing their high schools due to finance, thus pushing away their dreams faraway but with such non-profits around the world, those young people are presented with another chance to fulfil their dreams. Youth Journalism International is the best among all! Thank you for paving the way for my quest of becoming a professional journalism.

Client Served	5	08/01/2016	Youth Journalism International is an exceptional charity that uses journalism to build bridges between young people across the world. I've been writing for YJI since 2007, and as a student in the United States, I've made lasting friendships with other young journalists in Africa, Asia, and Europe. I've learned that whether we're American or Egyptian, Pakistani or Ugandan, British or Korean, we are all people who share many of the same hopes, fears, and dreams. YJI unites the world.In addition to its role as a global force for peace, YJI also gives young people a voice in a world where we're often ignored. Tomorrow's leaders are able to write about the leading issues of the day from their own perspective, and add their ideas to the global conversation about where we're headed as a world. And not only does YJI give students a platform for their voice, it also helps us find it. For kids who didn't grow up being told that their views mattered, YJI is there to help them realize their potential as global change-makers.For these reasons and more, I enthusiastically recommend YJI as one of the world's truly great nonprofits.

Through this organization, I've met many great people and gained a lot of treasured experiences. From the day I joined, I was welcomed heartily, and having such a supportive community of writers has given me a lot more confidence in my own writing.I've covered stories at the Peace in Connecticut conference for nonviolence and the Inspiration to Action panel, events that I probably wouldn't have attended otherwise, but that I was really glad to have gone to. And just recently I was able to go on the Toronto Tour 2014 and meet up with more YJI students in Canada where we collaborated on a bunch of pieces. I made a lot great friends on the trip and learned about their lives, which gave me great perspective. So many of the experiences I've had with YJI - ranging from camping, to trying falafel, to traveling to a country that I've never been to before - would not have happened for me without this organization. The best part is that after having these experiences, I get to share them with readers from all over the world.In addition, I've learned so much about journalism, writing, and about myself as a writer. Jackie and Steve are great mentors; they're incredibly dedicated and encouraging. I could not think of better people to learn journalism from.For many teens nowadays, it's hard to get their opinions across and be taken seriously. YJI does a great job helping youths around the world express themselves in a sophisticated manner. Even if someone's not looking to become a journalist, YJI is a great organization to be a part of, just for the new experiences and sense of community.

We've gone to plays, talks and speeches by incredible people and recently we even went on a tour of Toronto, Canada. In Canada, we met with 3 other reporters for YJI who we'd only spoken to online. It was amazing to have something in common with those girls and with other people all over the world. I've gotten to know some great people from right here in West Hartford as well as from other countries, like Uganda and Tunisia, through YJI. Reporters for YJI come from tons of different cultures and backgrounds and share their expeirence through writing which is posted online on YJI's website.

Youth Journalism International	113115	1	/users/profile/49868	joe18	Client Served	5	05/28/2012	I came to YJI as a 15-year-old high school sophomore with a keen but unfocused interest in writing. Through one-on-one mentoring and on-the-job news training with Jackie and Steve Majerus-Collins, I was set on the path that would make me an award winning professional reporter. Youth Journalism International took a raw, burgeoning curiosity and honed it into a passion and skill for investigation and analysis. It put me miles ahead in my first college journalism classes and gave me a leg-up when I began looking (and competing) for internships. And ultimately, it taught me ethical and technical lessons I still use everyday in my career as a journalist. Just as crucially, it introduced me to other young men and women from different backgrounds, classes and cultures -- a number of whom became lifelong friends. Opening a young person's world that way is invaluable and still a vital part of what this group does every day.
Youth Journalism International	48703	12	/users/profile/49868	joe18	Board Member	5	07/25/2010	When I was a high school student Youth Journalism International taught me the ropes of journalism - the essential reporting and writing skills. But more importantly, it taught me why journalism is important and instilled in me the importance of passing that on.Group founders Jackie Majerus and Steve Collins, both professional reporters, take the time to not only teach students what they need to know to become journalists, but instill in them that what they do matters - that they can correct injustices, inform people, connect them to their communities and help them to live better and more freely.My work as a student journalist helped me win scholarships, go to college, secure paid internships at professional newspapers, freelance for professional publications and ultimately land a full-time job as a working journalist. Few if any of those things would have been possible without YJI.The YJI experience also helped me to understand the importance of continuing to teach others and to give them the opportunities YJI gave me. It led to my mentoring young people from students the college paper where I was editor to interns in newsrooms, through YJI itself and in student journalism projects of my own.

I can say, in all honesty, that it was one of the best decisions of my life.  Through my work for YJI, I learned how to become an effective writer, researcher and communicator.  I had the opportunity to write stories about issues of real local interest: whether it was school board happenings, local sports results, or human interest stories, YJI gave me the opportunity to make my thoughts heard.   My work at YJI helped me obtain a substantial scholarship to college, journalism awards, and helped put me on the road that has ended up with my becoming an attorney.  Through the years, Steve and Jackie have continued to give that same opportunity to young people all over the world.  They are truly wonderful people who have given life to a wonderful organization.

At that point I was a teenager who wanted to get into writing and reporting, but had no idea how and where to start.  Over the next three years, I learned about writing, reporting and researching, skills which helped me through college, law school, and continue to help me in my career as an attorney.    I also learned that if you truly care, if you truly have a passion for something, you can make a difference.  I learned that because Steve and Jackie truly care about introducing teens to the world of journalism, and they have made a difference to teens all over the world.    
Youth Journalism International	51787	6	/users/profile/52530	collin-s	Former staff	5	09/04/2010	I was involved with Youth Journalism International when I was a high school student, from 1996-1999.  It is hard to explain just how important that experience was to my development, both academically and as a person.  I learned to write effectively for a variety of audiences.  I also learned to research topics so that I was telling a complete story for the readers of our newspaper.  I learned that when you work on a team, with a group, it is important to follow through on your work, because, in a way, everyone is depending on you.  Even more importantly, I gained self-confidence, in that I found out that with hard work I could put out a news story that was of interest to people in my area.Steve and Jackie are two of the most thoughtful, most dedicated people I've ever met.  They truly care about the members of YJI, and have done everything in their power to make sure that everyone has a positive experience.  You can find people positively affected by YJI on a local level, a national level, and a global level.The lessons I learned from Steve and Jackie served me well in college, in law school, and now as I practice law.  I can never thank them enough, and I can't say enough positive things about YJI.

From the beginning, Jackie and Steve served as mentors, honing my writing and interviewing skills. Their efforts led me to be more inquisitive, more thoughtful, and more capable of sniffing out a story from miles away. Although their efforts were directed through the lens of journalism, the results have served me well throughout college, medical school, and now a neurosurgery residency. Jackie and Steve, through Youth Journalism International provide young students with the skills necessary to develop as critical thinkers and flourish in any field or career.

One that allowed me as a student to learn and improve on skills you need for journalism. I also get to work with great people and It helped me get to the journalist job I'm in at the moment. This is a great organisation offering amazing opportunities. It allows you to connect with other young journalists around the world and learn the skills needed for a career in photography or journalism.
Youth Journalism International	126164	1	/users/profile/171246	bpond90	Volunteer	5	10/16/2012	As one of Youth Journalism International's first student reporters, I have been thoroughly impressed by how much this organization has grown and how much it has helped connect young journalists. Prior to working with Jackie and Steve, the founders of YJI, my interests were mostly in creative writing. However, with their guidance, I found a new writing outlet. Had I not been involved with YJI as a high school student, I would never have had the courage to apply to be a student reporter at my college's newspaper. I worked my way up through the ranks and even held an editorial position. I do not believe I would have chosen this path had it not been for YJI, and I'm grateful to Jackie and Steve for their continued support. Part of what is so fantastic about YJI is that the contributors are teens from around the world reporting on issues that matter to them. Another great thing about YJI is that the network doesn't end once you are no longer a teen. Many YJI student reporters have traveled or studied abroad and have had the opportunity to connect with other YJI members. I myself have experienced this and feel that it is one of the many things that makes YJI special. Youth Journalism International fosters a respectful atmosphere and connects budding journalists from around the globe, allowing its members to hone their journalistic skills and create lifelong friends in the process.

After YJI published my first piece,  I found that some people actually liked my writing, and so I decided to burrow further into journalism.                                                                                                               Today I have two international, one national, one regional, and two county-wide writing awards and at seventeen I became a published journalist for a newspaper here in Florida. I believe wholeheartedly that none of this could be accomplished without YJI, for YJI gave me the foundation not only stand on, but also to grow upon. The recognition I received from YJI gave me the springboard to launch into larger things and Steve and Jackie (the YJI co-founders) truly invested their time in me and believed in me to write important pieces. They fostered my love of writing and encouraged me in my writing pursuits.  YJI is more than merely a writing organization- it has the potential to change student's lives. Please invest in YJI, they could help so many more students if only given the chance.

I came along simply looking for a place to be heard, but found so much more. YJI has an incredible, hardworking, devoted staff who believes in us. It also has given me, personally, an opportunity to connect and build relationships with teens all over the world. Above all else, I found myself falling back in love with writing once again.While it feels great to begin to write as I please, YJI DOES need full time staff. The volunteers invest a lot of time and energy on us, and it is only fair to them AND us that they deserve a little something as well so they can better the organization.

At Youth Journalism International, we did, too. But we also did something concrete: we asked our students to write about it. Among the many eloquent pieces we received was one from a Pakistani girl, 15-year-old Arooj Khalid, who has been writing for YJI for more than a year already. It's a beautiful piece, courageous and true. And that's what makes YJI so special: We are out there helping young people around tell their stories, day in and day out. There's nothing else like it.

It's always done a wonderful job of helping young people around the world tell the stories that shape their lives. It's built bridges across cultures and opened minds in many ways. Only recently, though, have I realized how its extensive coverage of the arts is making a real difference. YJI students, like many, have done scores -- maybe hundreds -- of movie reviews over the years. They have also written dozens of theater and music reviews. They have gone to art museums. They have written about cultural institutions as varied as Mystic Seaport and the Louvre. They have interviewed artists and actors, poets and writers. They have done an astonishing amount to bring the arts to the attention of their peers and to the world as a whole. They have also jumped in at times to participate in appropriate artistic endeavors, including the recent 24-hour reading of Uncle Tom's Cabin at the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center in Hartford. And at least one alumni became a professional artists at least in part because his editorial cartoons done for YJI showed off his talents early.

The YJI team makes a point to promote a sense of community globally. They have done so by being personally connected to every reporter from all over the world. Then they even go further and connect those who are involved. I have made life-long friends with people through the YJI even though we live in different parts of the world.

Students find YJI a fascinating organization due to its professional conduct of journalism and nurturing bond of friendship within its community. The diversity of YJIs students from across the globe has made it an amazing stage for cross cultural understanding and building up bridges between youths of various countries. In addition, I have also found some amazing friends at YJI that I value the most. Among YJIs cultures are professionalism, freedom of speech, respect, openness, knowledge sharing, education and friendship and there are no room for any sort of discriminations.

Reporting with accuracy, truth, objectivity and an un-jaded and unique perspective, from locations around the globe, it is even more incredible that the moving, poignant stories are coming from our young people who are living their reporting. YJI helps to build bridges while empowering young people regardless of age, culture or gender, to seek the truth and share it. The founders, Steve and Jackie Majerus-Collins and the YJI volunteers are providing guidance and opportunities to young journalists in ways that many would not otherwise have available.

While quite a few articles (just a bit much to me) involve pop culture, the serious side of journalism, the quirky side of it, and somewhat longish form journalism have all been presented as well. It's hard to understand how the folks who work so hard for YJI, who've founded it and pretty much dedicated themselves to it since 1994, have received such little recognition for this - when they deserve so much more.

Jessica is an Egyptian YJI student, and being an Egyptian aspiring writer myself, I thought it would be a good platform for my work and a great opportunity for publishing. What I discovered was that it was not only a journalistic website, but also an academic organization that provides global youth with training and education in journalism. It was like enrolling in a journalism course for free, taught by two great journalists in person! I get one on one pointers via email/skype and I'm constantly being pushed to my utmost potential. I get to write about what I want, get published and learn, all in a family-like innovative atmosphere. The organization has also helped me make friendships around the world and exposed me to various cultures and peoples. It has kept me updated with my global surroundings.

Through my experiences working with real, experienced journalists and exploring with my peers, I was able to build confidence, gain invaluable writing skills, and learn to look at the world around me through many analytical lenses.The best part about my experience was just that: that it was undoubtedly MY experience. Steve and Jackie were always there, and they empowered me to take it as far as I wanted to go. They never wrote stories for me, but they always coached me to make sure I strove as far as I could. The network of peers (back then, a small group that met often in-person) was always there to discuss and gain additional perspective. Though journalism interested me in my teen years, I didn't pursue a career in print. However, I truly feel that YJI contributed to my abilities that got me where I am today, in the midst of a successful and illustrious career as a non-profit administrator and public policy advocate. There is no limit to the positive experiences this organization can have to any number of teens across the globe... if only given the right resources and support.

I ruled out high school art classes because I didn't want to paint pictures of my cat or make pots to put fancy flowers in. I needed a place where my opinion could be heard and at the same time build a portfolio for myself. At the time I met Jackie and Steve, YJI was a local group called The Tattoo that build a name for itself by featuring a vast array of local and international writers. I found my niche in the group as a cartoonist, and the group became a stepping stone for who I am today. I gained self confidence and a desire to express my opinion that I had failed to find elsewhere. YJI easily outshines any school newspaper, as it is far more collaborative and features what can only be described as some of the most talented teenagers in the world. No matter what your age is, your opinion matters and needs to be heard through, preferably, a median of your choice. YJI offers this opportunity like no other. Where else can you read the chronicles of a teenager who experienced Katrina first hand? The news? Your local newspaper? No. All you ever wanted to read or know about through a teenagers eyes can be found at www.readthetatoo.com. Simple as that.

I am both humbled and proud to have watched YJI grow from a periodic local newspaper printing to an international journalism program, involving and impacting students and young people around the world.Being part of YJI is what every teenager hopes for. A group of people who are warm and inviting and who nurture everyone's ideas. The most important thing I learned from my experiences there was that everyone has potential, and there really are adults who believe in teenagers. The leaders of YJI gave us all the confidence, guidance, and encouragement we needed while still letting us figure everything out for ourselves. Their support was priceless, and is a constant reminder to me to take the teenagers in my own life seriously, and offer the same support I received.

Steve and Jackie were wonderful mentors, and when they began to expand the group to include international writers, the quality of the paper only improved.

Just like it was said about the British Empire the sun never sets on YJI. It is international in the true meaning of the world stretching from california to china. After writing for YJI about my idol HE WROTE ME! Being a part of YJI is a garuntee for respect and a heard voice.

As a youth even the old ones who are still aspiring to achieve more success, you must not fold your hands until death fold them for you. The popular saying that "it is not over until it is over" is of great value in the sense that as a human being you must not be idle at any point in time."An idle hand is the devil's workshop".One of the most important and crucial factors in life is TIME and SEASON.As a youth you must know how to manage your time because time waits for no man.Laziness among the youths of nowadays in nothing to talk about.Young people derive more pleasure in partying,playing and the like forgetting that whatever we do today has a long way to go with our future.Writing is one of the best way you can use to equip and develop yourself intellectually,because it enables you to express yourself and as well impact knowledge into others. Beyond words of deceit, YJI in one of the international educative organizations you can belong to and your goals will be actualize.

With an active membership of people from across the globe, it allows students the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussion about the writing and editing process as they participate in it. Because YJI members and advisers have established its strong reputation throughout the years, membership in the group gives young journalists access to the opportunity to report the news that affects their lives - including news about sports events, natural disasters, and notable political changes. Because of my involvement in YJI, I have participated in events that few teens my age have had the opportunity to experience. Notably, I attended an event held by Bob Woodruff and his wife Lee after his injury in Iraq. From both a journalistic and emotional perspective, it was amazing to hear his story of his hardships and attempt to get back to his journalism career.As Associate Editor, I have worked on a project to incorporate dozens of interviews conducted by YJI members in a few articles about the most recent presidential election. YJI has allowed me to meet and work with dozens of people from across the globe, which are invaluable experiences that have continued to affect my life even after my high school years ended.

The ability to not only speak with and get to know others your age who are passionate about the news, but to receive critique and advice from committed volunteers has helped me feel so much more comfortable facing my future. I know that my YJI experience has changed my career path.
Youth Journalism International	54050		/users/profile/55234	john42	Former Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	It is difficult for young people to break into journalism. Before I got involved with this organization I had known I wanted to become a journalist, but there seemed to be few if any opportunities available. I was randomly browsing when I came across the group by accident, and I am so glad I did. It helped me on my career path by giving me the first pressing journalism experience I needed. Since then I have written for four local newspapers and have completed a professional journalism course. There are few examples today where real-life journalists help ordinary youngsters around the globe by giving purpose to their lives. This organization must be helped in every way possible, as it provides a rare and critical lifeline for aspiring young journalists.

Before, very few people took my writing seriously but YJI gave me the opportunity to publish my writing. YJI is an amazing  organization that has very talented and dedicated people like Jackie, Steve and Katie, who take the time from their busy lives to edit our writing and make everything happen. I am very proud to be part of this great organization.
Youth Journalism International	54037		/users/profile/55216	amacmusic	Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	Youth Journalism International gave me the unique  to share some of my interesting musical experiences in their online newspaper.  It was wonderful to be both the subject of an article and to have the chance to relate my side of the story.  Youth Journalism International gave me this very special platform to write my views and made me consider myself as a writer for the very first time.  I am extremely grateful to be a part of this wonderful organization.
Youth Journalism International	54027		/users/profile/55205	teague	Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	I began with YJI many years ago as a young writer introduced through a friend, this has over the years become an enveloping educational experience beyond any expectations. The dedication and learning provided by YJI to its students brings journalism to life for them, gives them the guidance and the motivation to write news, reviews, and articles on the world. Not just fluff but true journalism, of such caliber that Youth Journalism articles have won many awards including several I was part of. The dedication of Jackie Majerus and Steve Collins is immense. Their passion has brought about a whole new take on the world for me. I have met people from across the world, collaborated with them and made very close friends with several. I will soon be returning for my 10th visit, each time however long or short it is means so much. I am inspired and strongly support this organization into its future doing what they do best- journalism and educating young people and future generations. I am nearing completion of a novel that is being recognized across the world and has unbelievable contributors and support. The passion for writing has been boosted beyond my wildest dreams. I now have the where with all as does everyone, a second family and home, friends including some of my closest friends including one of my furthest close friends I spent a year with in my home in Canada, with me forever. I highly reccomend YJI and will support them to the fullest always.

Youth Journalism International	54011		/users/profile/55183	sarah36	Volunteer	5	09/30/2010	Youth Journalism International is a very impressive organization.  My oldest child first wrote a piece when she was 14 years old.  the editors made valuable suggestions without changing the tone of the piece.  It gave her much confidence knowing her writing was being read around the world and enjoyed.  She then wrote some travel pieces and had her photos public.  Other teenagers from around the world contacted her with their comments and own experiences.  She is now 18 and still keeps in touch with her YJI contacts.  What an amazing experience.  My other two children followed in her footsteps.  My youngest wrote an enlightening piece about her teachers going on strike.  This was a hard concept for some readers in other countries to understand!  Why would your teachers not go to work for two weeks, they asked. Youth get not only a sense of accomplishment that they are contributing to a newspaper read around the world, but also valuable advice about the writing and editing process.  They can learn a great deal from the other contributors and just reading the issues.  I look forward to every new issue and highly recommend this nonprofit as educational and valuable in making our global community come together as one.
Youth Journalism International	53966		/users/profile/55132	cpendle2	Former Volunteer	5	09/29/2010	I wrote for Youth Journalism International throughout high school, and have maintained ties with the organization throughout the decade since I left.The volunteers are outstanding, and provide tremendous mentorship; there were many late nights spent editing articles, as well as days spent on-site at various events and interviews. The mentorship extended beyond journalism, and as a high school student my experience within the group taught me to be assertive, to create and work on teams, and how to gracefully receive and learn from constructive criticism.Over the years, the volunteer staff has become friends as well as mentors, and I have had the pleasure of watching them impart these same lessons to new students year after year.I can honestly say that my experience within the group played a significant role in shaping the person I am today. Although I did not pursue a career in journalism, the skills I learned during my time with the group continue to be valuable, and have helped create opportunities for me that I might not have had otherwise.
Youth Journalism International	53963		/users/profile/55131	sara29	Volunteer	5	09/29/2010	I've always been interested in journalism - writing, in particular. When I was in high school, I wrote for the school newsletter, but graduating left a kind of writing void in my life that I was eager to fill! I found YJI by chance, through a Google search for "young journalists" or something similar, earlier this year. And since then, there has been no looking back.Youth Journalism International was founded and is run by Jackie Majerus and Steve Collins, who are dedicated to finding journalistic talent in the world, and helping young writers and photographers hone this talent. The freedom that they give volunteers in terms of content is extraordinary - you can write about what you like, or you can consider their suggestions, OR you can take up specific assignments that they might have to offer (an instance that I remember is that of interviewing 3 young men, early in their college years, who were cycling across America to promote education in Zambia). This means that, as a volunteer with YJI, not only are you given the opportunity to write (or take photographs), but you are also allowed to choose your own subject matter! As a result, YJI has been successful in creating a myriad of writing styles and ideas from all over the world, that converge, under Jackie and Steve's mentor ship into vibrant and dynamic teen journalism.
Youth Journalism International	53959		/users/profile/55129	cjbk	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/29/2010	This group unites young journalists from across the globe who would not otherwise know each other. The caring, professional leaders of this group take time to teach the fundamentals of reporting and writing to young people while allowing the students' creativity to shine through.Young people don't often have a voice even in Western countries and this organization provides a forum for students' voices to be heard and developed. The leaders of Youth Journalism International respect their members and do not shy away from publishing content about controversial topics.In an era where education funding is in jeopardy and most middle schools and high schools do not have a school newspaper or a journalism class, Youth Journalism International fills this void. Students leave Youth Journalism International knowing how to write clearly and concisely about complex issues, which leads to their success at college and in their professional lives.
Youth Journalism International	53403		/users/profile/54531	stefanrkoski	Former Volunteer	5	09/27/2010	Growing up in a small town and wanting to be a writer made me something of an oddity. Not having any family or friends who were writers meant that I was pretty much on my own when it came to pursuing my passion. When I joined YJI though, I found mentors who took an interest in what I wanted to do and helped me develop my writing talents. It gave me a solid grounding in journalistic writing, providing both editorial and personal support whenever I tackled tough issues in my articles. For a teenager still trying to find his way around with the written word, it was invaluable experience. It also connected me with kids the world over who also shared my interest in writing. In the years since then a number of them became some of my closest friends.YJI provides both a platform and a broad base of support for young writers to excel in their craft. With more funding and a regular staff, they'll be able to help a lot more kids like me who needed guidance and expertise to realize their full potential as writers.
Youth Journalism International	51985	3	/users/profile/52781	nancyhsu	Volunteer	5	09/08/2010	Youth Journalism International is definately what its name says it to be -the best youth journalism available on the net! It's a seriously great experience as a reader and a writer.

Youth Journalism International	51939	1	/users/profile/52717	saumya1	General Member of the Public	5	09/07/2010	I am a teen based in India and have been watching this organization closely. My brother is a reporter for YJI and I have seen him work with the organization. It is very beneficial to see so many young people from across the world interact with each other. YJI has been building a bridge between diverse group of people. Besides, the work done by its reporters is very interesting as it is different from usual stuff and written for teens. If provided with resources YJI can do a great job in spreading awareness across the globe.
Youth Journalism International	51894	1	/users/profile/52683	ckurz	Volunteer	5	09/07/2010	I have been involved with YJI for almost a year, and I absolutely love it! I had always enjoyed writing, but never thought that I would find journalism so fun and interesting. In the short time that I have been a reporter, I have aready attended several plays, after which I worked with other members to write reviews. I believe that YJI has improved my eloquence and quality of writing, and I now have the courage to write my first piece by myself. I am so glad that I joined!
Youth Journalism International	51893	4	/users/profile/52682	ericsimmonsevo	Former Volunteer	5	09/07/2010	YJI is an amazing program. I was involved with this program while in high school for a few years. It was always a pleasure to be a part of a group that helps future writers (and artists) write stories that are published in the local paper as well as online. I can remember our local team in Bristol, CT working with kids from all over the country and all over the world submitting amazing stories from life as a teen, surviving high school, and more in depth and personal stories such as the life of a girl who's life was turned upside down because of Hurricane Katrina, and a student's struggle with his sexuality. It is a very educational program, as I learned to write and edit stories that were to be published, and worked with other writers at my age that were just as passionate as I was. This program really helps students realize their potential as writers and editors, and many of the stories have won local, regional, and national journalism awards! I continue working with the group after I had moved away to Florida, still publishing stories until life got in the way, but I am always there to support their cause and help other students achieve the experience and inspiration that I had while being a part of YJI.
Youth Journalism International	51889	1	/users/profile/52677	kiernan	Client Served	5	09/07/2010	Youth Journalism International provides young people with oppurtunities that they cannot recive with other organizations. Because of YJI, I've had the ability to spend several days at ESPN covering their 30th anniversary, ride on Senator Joe Liberman's campaign bus during his successful 2006 senatorial campaign, interview several composition professors at distigushed New England colleges, and most importantly, meet and interact with students all over the world. This is, I believe, YJI's most important feature. Apart from the superb educational value, apart from the great experiences, this culture of cross-cultural understanding is what makes YJI special. Suddenly, when I hear about a bombing in Kabul, or an earthquake in Italy, or a drought in Egypt, it's personal. I have friends there. I've read their published work, and I've read their emails to the group. Sometimes I'll have spoken with them on the telephone, or on Skype. It makes world events a real concern, and makes abstract problems on the other side of the globe important to me. The United States is fighting a was in Afghanistan. Because of YJI, I think about not just the American cost of the war, but the cost to the honest working people of Afghanistan. YJI did that for me. It has given me- and others- a whole new look on the world.
Youth Journalism International	51874	1	/users/profile/52670	tc1	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2010	I first found the Youth Journalism International newspaper by accident and have been a fan ever since.  A teenager's outstanding account of the New Orleans disaster, a series of stories on teen suicide, an Afghan teen account of travel through the Khyber Pass, reviews of plays and music and many more stories led me to encourage my grandchildren to volunteer and write for Youth Journalism International.  What an educational experience for them.  They not only became much better writers and reporters but also they became aware of other aspiring teen writers from all over the world.  They are able to write of their first-hand experiences with the help of the two Journalism editors.
Youth Journalism International	51871	1	/users/profile/52665	yelena1	Client Served	5	09/06/2010	I've been a student in YJI for about a year. I got to do a lot of cool things like go to the first live theater performance I've ever been to, write about a hearing at the state capitol and other events. I've made good friends of many ages, including some from my age group and some older people who have been in YJI for a long time.
Youth Journalism International	51815	7	/users/profile/48622	joe16	Former Volunteer	5	09/05/2010	One word for YJI. Awesome! The organization is like a family. Everyone is each others' mentors. They always push you to try new things and be more daring and courageous. As an individual, YJI, is able to tap into a potential that may have seemed non-existent. News reporting and cartooning was my outlet and it was so much fun. I gained confidence by going out there and talking to people and asking questions and learning how to ask the right questions. It's not about how action-packed or glamorous the story is, it's about getting it right and making interesting enough for people to care. YJI teaches about the basics of communication, social networking, and professionalism. I went to school for art, but I use the skills I learned from YJI to promote myself as an artist in the challenging art world. YJI understands that the youth is the future, and by teaching the youth how to report, analyze, and project the news,  YJI is nourishing the vitality and longevity of positive and quality news/media.
Youth Journalism International	47839	11	/users/profile/48622	joe16	Former staff	5	07/07/2010	YJI is a positive outlet. Whether it be journalism, cartoons, etc, YJI exemplifies an upbeat and youthful voice. Current trends and worldwide happenings, the youth has something to say and YJI provides the tools and means of doing so. With such a dedicated staff, YJI is a leader in global communication and  is creating a cohesive and harmonious social network. YJI is not just a group, but rather a movement of creative and diverse media.
Youth Journalism International	51814	7	/users/profile/52567	katiegrosser	Volunteer	5	09/05/2010	It's every aspiring young journalist's dream - an organization headed by wonderful and helpful people who give you the opportunity  to work on your writing skills and receive constructive criticism.I started writing for YJI a few years ago.  Some of my best articles have appeared in "The Tattoo".  What I love about YJI is that it truly is international.  It brings together young people from all over the planet in one project.  "Teamwork" takes on a whole new dimension if it means having to write e-mails across various time-zones and Skyping way past one's bedtime in order to get an article done properly.  But it's all worth it.
Youth Journalism International	51808	1	/users/profile/52560	jackie-majerus	Volunteer	5	09/05/2010	I began working with young writers, artists and photographers on a weekly basis in 1994. My involvement grew over time and now I give several hours each day to YJI. Working with students at Youth Journalism International is among the most rewarding things I've ever done in my life. These young people are bright, talented, compassionate and eager to learn. We set high expectations for them, from ethics to storytelling and they consistently deliver.Through serious news stories, feature writing and reviews as well as first person journaling about such diverse topics as high school life, Hurricane Katrina, family travel to an ancestral homeland and fasting for Ramadan, YJI students offer the world a new perspective.They are the future of journalism, a field which badly needs an infusion of good young people. But they are so much more. YJI students have also gone into law, medicine, teaching, homemaking, computer technology, social work and more. We are very proud of each of them. Many alumni stay involved and help younger students.No matter the field they choose, they all gain confidence in themselves by conducting interviews and writing powerful stories. They learn that they, too, have a voice, and they learn how to use it effectively.One of the most rewarding parts of leading this wonderful organization is seeing the many friendships that develop between YJI students around the globe. Without YJI, these young people would have a narrower world view and something would be missing from their lives -- the friends they met and the perspective they gained by getting to know young journalists in other countries, from cultures and religions other than their own. It's extremely gratifying to see understanding and then bonds of friendship develop between them.YJI students and YJI alumni have spirit, energy and great ideas. They give me great hope for the future and for a peaceful world. I can't imagine my life without them.
Youth Journalism International	51806	8	/users/profile/52555	Nebraska1026	Former Volunteer	5	09/05/2010	I first found Youth Journalism International online when I was 12. I can not stress enough how the organization had a profound impact on my life. As a writer, both Jackie and Steve helped me fine tune my craft, and as a result I won several writing awards with YJI.On a personal level, Jackie and Steve mentored me and, on numerous occasions, opened their homes to me when I needed it most. As a writer from Nebraska, it was through their guidance that I eventually ended up at a large private university in Boston. My work through YJI changed my life and helped me become the person that I am today.
Youth Journalism International	51799	9	/users/profile/52544	pushkal	Volunteer	5	09/04/2010	In my country India, the awareness about journalism education at high school level, a stepping stone, is too low. I was meandering in my quest for guidance and I came across YJI. I think, YJI gave me more than just guidance, it came as a godsend. First of all, Jackie Majerus and Steve Collins are inspirational. Handling hundreds of students across the globe is no ordinary task. Secondly, the professional approach with the mix of values has incentivized journalism education. Thirdly, intra-organization interaction infuses motivation and a strong desire to perform. Although, we are miles away from each other, I feel that my editors are with me. Fourthly, YJI is globalisation incarnate. The fact that today I have friends in Afghanistan and US and potential friends all across the globe speaks for it. The diversity of views and ideas is really enriching. Finally, YJI has given a forum to the teens from across the globe and in the process tapped a huge resource.
Youth Journalism International	48911	12	/users/profile/50126	mariah	Volunteer	5	07/29/2010	In 2008 I needed an internship for my high school, but opportunities for young journalists or reporters are extremely rare in my area. I searched everywhere for something that would work. One day, I found the Tattoo online and sent them an email asking to be involved. A few months later I heard back from YJI, which was a new organization at the time. I jumped at the chance to work with them and it has been great. Although I don't write as much as I used to, it has been wonderful writing articles and working with the other talented students involved in YJI. I don't think I could have had an experience like this anywhere else; you get to interact with kids from all over the world, do something you love, and feel like part of something amazing.
Youth Journalism International	48712	10	/users/profile/49881	amandalehmertgmailcom	Client Served	5	07/26/2010	I started working with the Youth Journalism International staff as a 15-year-old high school freshmen. There I learned everything I needed to know about being a newspaper reporter. I wrote editorials, news stories, and even movie reviews.While I was part of the groups, we won dozens of journalism awards -- many that pitted us against professionals in the field. That is a testament to the high quality of this learning experience.Through regular meetings and intensive, personal guidance from advisers Jackie Majerus and Steve Collins, I grew as a person. The skills I picked up -- writing abilities, learning how to talk to strangers, self-confidence, an appreciation for people of different backgrounds -- helped prepare me for college. They nurtured me as an individual in a way that many kids don't get in a traditional learning environment.Today, I have been a professional journalist for seven years. I continued to stay in touch with YJI, volunteering whenever I can.
Youth Journalism International	48135	13	/users/profile/49074	michelle35	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/13/2010	As a high school newspaper adviser, it is not only important that my students' published writing receive recognition, but also that they receive a measure of their journalism skills.   Eight of my students, including a very talented young student who received Student Journalist of the Year. won honors in YJI's 2010 Writing and Photography Contest.   The staff was kind, courteous, and supportive during the process, and extra conscientious delivering the news, certificates, and trophies (as well as t-shirts and caps).  The trophy for Student Journalist of the Year rivals any trophy award for a high school level contest, much less professional-level contests.  YJI is a fine place for high school journalists to practice and hone their craft.
Youth Journalism International	47846	15	/users/profile/48632	mariechen	Volunteer	5	07/07/2010	I am Mariechen Puchert, from South Africa.I started writing with YJI in 2008, my final year of high school. I have always loved writing and discovering YJI was like a dream come true. In 2009 I started my studies at Medical School and the ability to carry on writing for YJI enabled me to maintain my sanity to a large extent. There is very little space for creativity at med school and even though I may not be studying journalism, literature or law, writing is still integral to my life.YJI does not only take your pieces and publish them. The editors work with you from the moment you decide to write something. When you send them your piece, they edit it and send it back to you with comments and advice for future writing.Before joining I was a very good poetry and prose writer, but what I knew about journalism and objective reporting was limited to what I learnt in school. Two years later, those skills have been sharpened.A great thing about YJI is that everyone is connected via the internet and the group often does packages. In 2008 we did a package on the Beijing Olympics and the Presidential Elections in the USA. These kind of projects enabled us as well as our audience to experience a myriad of different views and effects in different countries. I believe this fosters international understanding and co-operation at a most crucial level.In June 2010, I travelled to North America and was hosted by YJI for two days. I got to meet many of the people involved with YJI - editors, journalists and alumni. I know that YJI has done this for their foreign students before and that they will do it again when possible. This is also a great growth experience for young journalists.
Youth Journalism International	47841	10	/users/profile/48624	nornny	Former Volunteer	5	07/07/2010	I'm proud to be a former writer for The Tattoo in its early years. It has been great to see the organization take off from a small local newspaper organization for teens to something much larger and international based.It was great to see this organization transform from a personal passion into a real non-profit and I am rooting for them to now become a SUCCESSFUL non-profit. The founders have given up countless hours, what little income they make working in print journalism these days, and their endless passion to mentor and teach TEENAGERS and get them just as invested and excited about journalism. It doesn't take much to imagine how difficult it is to get teenagers excited about anything, nonetheless a field like journalism. But year in and year out, YJI finds and fully commits to developing a community of teen journalists, by giving them a voice to report on events around the world and working with each individual to refine their writing styles, teach them reporting techniques, and immersing them in a real pen-to-print life cycle, all well before most of these kids even write a college application.
Youth Journalism International	47806	11	/users/profile/48576	nicky1	Volunteer	5	07/06/2010	Hi, I'm Nicole Megan Gounder from South Africa,and I'm currently a student reporter for Youth Journalism International. I joined YJI towards the mid-year of 2009.I was currently 6 months out of high school doing my first semester at university.Like any other varsity student, I was clueless as to what I wanted to do with my life, but YJI helped me realise that my true passion lies in media. It's not just an organisation for teen writers.It's much more than that. Jackie and Steve do a great job of getting to know us,which makes it easier to share our thoughts and stories with the rest of the world. Three years ago, I would have never imagined myself taking the journalism route. Youth Journalism International is a great platform for writers all across the globe to get to know each other,share their thoughts,cultures and news  regardless of race,gender or nationality ! Behind this organsition are the most amazing mentors who help and guide you with the stories you have to share. It was a stepping stone for me and I'm sure it will be for future teen journalists!
Youth Journalism International	46071	16	/users/profile/46960	katie16	Volunteer	5	06/28/2010	I never fail to feel inspired when I think about how far Youth Journalism International has come.  It all started in 1994 with Jackie and Steve, two reporters in Bristol, Connecticut, who volunteered in their free time to teach local teens about journalism.  That, in and of itself, would have been a tremendous achievement in a world where teens are often hard pressed to find an outlet for their creativity, intelligence, and ambition.But it soon became clear that the organization could  and should  become much more.  Teens around the globe started reading American students work online and emailing requests to join.  Seemingly overnight, YJI changed from a weekly journalism workshop in Connecticut into a global organization teaching students not just about reporting, but about the common bonds that unite all people across all national boundaries.  Thanks to my involvement with YJI, I have been privileged to email, speak with and even meet young people from all over the world.  I do not exaggerate when I say that nothing fills me with pride and hope for humanitys future the way this organization and its students do.  Certainly, students who work hard learn a lot about reporting and writing.  But just as valuable, if not more so, are the intercultural friendships the group cultivates.  I can think of no better forum than YJI for young people to teach each other about their respective worlds  about how they think, and feel, and live; about what makes us all different, but more importantly, about what makes us the same.  And I can think of no better way than that for the world at large to begin working toward peace.It has been an honor to work with the bright, talented, kind young people who have made YJI a part of their lives.  I hope they are as proud of themselves as their editors are of them, and I hope to work with them for many years to come.
Youth Journalism International	44895	17	/users/profile/45805	edrees	Volunteer	5	06/22/2010	Youth Journalism International is a platform for the new generation to evolve their voices from each corner of the globe; the voices that come with innovation, truth and opinions of youthfulness. YJI has been working to value the works of youth not only in the Journalism category, but in all other categories by spreading about their talent and their values effectively. YJI has been acting and would continue to bring cross cultural understanding between the youths of the nations which would definitely broaden up the scope of globalization. Since one of the core agenda for YJI has been focusing for a peaceful world through dialogue and understanding, it would certainly induce the new generation whom would act as the leaders of tomorrow to always consider the peacefulness of issues.  As YJI gives awareness to the youth and world about the youth, it wont be far away for YJI to become the worlds best source of information principally in regard to the youths perspective. I joined YJI in 2005 when I was in my teenage and I got amazed from the work of teens that had covered topics such as guidance for high school to issues of 9/11, biased journalism or travel articles. Initially I was nave in writing, but the motivation and supports that were generously provided by the founders of the organization STEVE Collins and Jackie Majerus enriched me with a massive interest for writing and Journalism. With the great experiences and the mass of knowledge I have learned since I got associated with YJI, currently I feel proud for being listed as the member of the Board of directors of this great organization. My interest, support and loyalty would exist as long as the concept of YJI would exist.
Youth Journalism International	44625	2	/users/profile/45534	wesley1	Volunteer	5	06/20/2010	I joined this organization at a young age. But right from the start, the board and staff helped me feel welcome and encouraged me with each and every one of my pieces. They also gave me numerous opportunities to write pieces and provided me with the means to access people and places I couldn't by myself. This is not like some paper set up so kids could just write what they want to. This is REAL, professional journalism that provides news by teens that teens can use. It more than adequately prepares adolescents for taking on a career in journalism.It also gives teens great experiences that they could not have anywhere else. Some of my highlights of working with Youth Journalism International have been sitting in the press box with big newspaper correspondents and TV Reporters at an Obama rally, talking with CT Democratic senatorial candidate Ned Lamont and interviewing CT Senator Joe Lieberman while riding on his tour bus; all of this before I even turned sixteen. No other organization could do that.
Youth Journalism International	44615	1	/users/profile/45523	sam12	Volunteer	5	06/19/2010	From economic problems to serious ecological hazards happening in the world today, our quality of life as we know it is under constant threat. That's why it's refreshing and relieving to know, first hand, that there is an organization out there who devotes it's energy into a positive cause in the most genuine manner. Youth Journalism International is doing a wonderful public service by expanding the voice of journalism to sources you won't be able to find in your run of the mill, agenda driven media today. I have had the privilege to personally get to know the founders of YJI, and I am honored to say that they are great friends of mine. The work they have done so far should serve as a template for other nonprofit organizations on how to conduct themselves. With the economy on the brink of shambles, it's hard to trust a reliable source for anything without feeling like someone is out to rip you off for their own personal gain. YJI is as pure and genuine as it gets, as they bring light to voices and readers from all around the world of all walks of life. Their efforts in the global community should be commended, and they will always have my full support and loyalty to help with the group.
Youth Journalism International	43806	1	/users/profile/44690	cara5	Volunteer	5	06/12/2010	I'm Cara and I've been with YJI since September 2009. When I joined I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's been better than I could've ever imagined. I don't know any organization like this: truly committed to young people, journalism and, not at all least important, cultural exchange. It's not simply an organization that teaches young people about journalism and provides them with a place to publish their articles. It's so much more. It's about learning about yourself and the world, too. It's a way to break barriers and to make young people care about people who are thousands of miles away. And isn't that one of the things we need most in this age where divisions become ever deeper and fear creeps into everyones life in one way or another? Where will we be if we stop caring about the voices of people like us, whether they live right across the corner or in a place we'll never visit. It doesn't always just have to be doom and gloom and seriousness to have an impact. It might just as well be about sports and hobbies. The realization that other people share the same hopes for the future is one of the most precious gifts for a human being anywhere. This is exactly what YJI is doing: making people get together and start understanding each other. You don't have to agree with someone to respect and understand them. By giving young people a voice YJI helps build a world with more understanding. Jackie, Steve and Katie are amazing and committed people. I'm so glad there are people like them around. It means a lot to me they're so devoted to this organization and encourage  their students to improve their skills. If I hadn't found YJI I may not know yet what I know now: I want to be a journalist. Without YJI I wouldn't have had this amazing experience. Joining YJI is one of my best decisions so far.
Youth Journalism International	43234	13	/users/profile/43614	steve23	Board Member	5	06/08/2010	I hope many of our students and friends will write reviews of Youth Journalism International. We would love to hear what you have to say!

They've helped me improve my writing and communication skills in the stories I've written for them, and have also indirectly improved my writing and communication skills at school. YJI has given me the confidence I need to get my foot in the door in the journalism world, and to plan ahead for a future career.I'm looking forward to improving my skills and having lots of fun with YJI for years to come.

I am grateful that there are organizations with staff that are so committed to those in need of help.  The impact that they have made with children in remote parts of the world is astounding.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	313634		/users/profile/404988	BT1750	Donor	5	10/23/2016	Save the Children is doing great work around the world.  About five years ago, we gave our two children sponsorships as part of their Christmas present.  They both sponsor a child in Ethiopia their same age and gender, and have found it to be a great experience.  Two years ago, they asked to sponsor two more children in Uganda.  They love exchanging letters with the kids and learning about their lives.  Save the Children is making a difference for kids all over the world, improving healthcare, education and livelihoods.  Thank you for all you do!
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	313073		/users/profile/164496	DCGal	Donor	5	10/21/2016	I'm very impressed with Save the Children's impact, they really make a difference. And I love that US kids are being helped as well as children around the world.  I sponsor 2 kids, and give to every emergency. It must be so hard for the staff on the ground, to see so much need and suffering close up.  They really care about children. And they get great ratings from the charity watchdogs so I feel good about spending my money with them. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	120894	1	/users/profile/164496	DCGal	Donor	5	08/17/2012	I have been a Save the Children sponsor for a couple of years now, because a friend of mine was already a sponsor.  And more people should do it - especially with an organization as trustworthy as Save the Children.  I became involved after visiting part of the developing world in Africa, where I felt somewhat hopeless and wanted to do something.  So this friend recommended I sponsor a child there, which I do now and I am expanding my list of sponsored children every year, including a child in New Mexico.  It's gratifying, and I know my money is being put to good use.  Save the Children knows how to get things done, plain and simple.  Every organization that raises money will send you things via the mail, etc - that's what they do.  I also work with a wonderful animal shelter and I have an inside view on their fundraising - you have to do those kind of things to raise money to keep the lights on and do the great work these groups do!  If you don't like the mailings, just pitch them - or give them to someone. But spending $28 a month or giving a donation to Save the Children will be the best donation you've ever made.  
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	312939		/users/profile/404313	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	I have been associated with Save the Children for over 5 years. I have volunteered with them, sponsored children, and visited their programs overseas. Save the Children is very responsible with donations, and the staff is very dedicated to their work, and are not paid as much as they would if they were in the private sector, but they do so because they are dedicated to the health and well-being of children in the United States and worldwide.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	312657		/users/profile/192704	Mary150	Donor	5	10/20/2016	I respect Save the Children -- for its mission and its results. Every child deserves a future -- and Save the Children does whatever it takes to make sure they have it. They make sure children grow up healthy, educated and safe. They take care of children's unique needs when crisis strikes. They are outspoken champions for children's rights. Plus they get stellar reviews from every rating agency, so I know my support is well spent. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	312604		/users/profile/403979	bdaly22	Donor	5	10/20/2016	I have been a donor for nearly 30 years. Save the Children does great work around the world and here at home. It was founded on the simple belief that every child has the right to a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. Save the Children is transforming homes and classrooms across the country and around the world, giving moms and dads the helping hand they need and giving kids a change to reach their full potential. It is a truly 5-star worthy organization.

My Family have been sponsoring 2 kids (1 in Bangladesh and 1 in USA), for the last 2 years and it has been very rewarding. Teaching the value of giving back to my kids at very early age is priceless. We have to make a better place for them!  It is very easy to sponsor. Save the Children's internet page, allow you to choose the country and program that you will like to sponsor. They send you regular updates and reports with accomplishments. Even my child was able to have an active roll during International Day of the Girl in NY. I was moved with all the good and positive  things that this organization has been doing. Congratulations to Save the children !! Thanks for the chance to be part of it and make the difference!

Recently we had a meeting the HR director who had returned from a trip to Africa.She shared with us photos, stories and case studies of the amazing work they are doing.  Her excitement and passion for her role, organization, and a women helping children was inspiring.  It is a pleasure working with everyone at Save The Children, - all levels.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	306422		/users/profile/397680	dianasmith	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2016	I am a freelance graphic designer with 30+ years experience, and have been involved with many nonprofit organizations over the years. But my longest association has been with Save the Children for whom I have worked on a project-to-project basis since 1999. During that time I have participated in over 500 projects for many different departments within STC,  and worked with dozens of people. I have always been impressed by the hard work and dedication of everyone I come in contact with, and frequently amazed at the amount of time they devote to their jobs, even after normal business hours.  Because I freelance from my home, I keep crazy hours myself, and I often get project-related emails long, long after 5 pm, or on weekends, or find myself on a phone call with someone still on the job as they travel by train to or from the office. Save the Children employees are truly passionate and excited about the work they do.   Also --  since I've worked with them for so long -- I've had the opportunity to see STC steadily grow and expand its reach to help more and more children and their communities in the U.S.  and around the world. And because I've been involved with so many different projects in so many different departments, I've been in a unique position see the variety of creative ways they raise funds, their careful use of those funds, and the scope and progress of the programs (often innovative) they develop and implement to  improve the lives of so many. Save the Children really is a great nonprofit!Diana Smith

In whatever situation they involve themselves, whether in UK or overseas, they aim to maintain high standards and integrity.   I am also impressed with how they are at the forefront of finding new ways to develop their work through partnerships with the medical fraternity, developments in technology and understanding and engaging their supporters.  They have enabled me to support their efforts in ways that use my strengths, time and interests.  Their aim has always been to become redundant in this world.  Impressive.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	226669	1	/users/profile/290401	Tasnima R.	Donor	5	10/25/2014	Save the Children is a top-notch charity. It excels as an efficient organization that provides a significant percentage to actual programs for the betterment of lives in need. They are in the upper crust of charitable organizations in my opinion because of their focus on EDUCATION & SUSTAINABILITY as well as basic needs such as immunizations, food/clean water, resources and disaster relief. Their philosophy of providing training to ensure families and communities are able to sustain themselves to break the cycle of poverty is empowering and allows preparedness in the face of crisis. When I did my research a decade ago, I went with them as a well-run non-denominational charity with an effective approach and I'm happy to see they have been consistent in their integrity. A big THANK YOU always to the workers at my sponsored child's field office as well as those around the world. Thank you for your dedication, hard work and care.

The Grays Harbor Community Foundation was extremely pleased by the complete and compelling proposals Save the Children submitted and awarded the two grants the full amount requested. Once funded I had the privilege of visiting the site in our community where services were provided in the Early Steps to School Success Program. I was blown away by the thought and effort put into designing this program, and ensuring that it had local buy-in to increase the likelihood of success. Their work is grounded in research as well as real-world experience and it truly shows in the end result. What a fabulous program we still use as an example of work we have funded when speaking to potential donors and other  members of the community.

I can tell you first hand of their passion for the work that they do and for the children that they support. This organization provides desperately needed help for millions of the most needy children in the world in the areas of nutrition, education and newborn survival. In addition, they are expert at rapidly responding to the needs of communities hit by a sudden crisis situation or natural disaster.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	221866		/users/profile/285561	sallyann73	Donor	1	10/10/2014	as a holiday gift i sponsor two children.  the children were chosen by my grandchildren and instead of gifts to the grandchild each child has agreed to go with out gifts in order to sponsor these children.  i thought it would be away to lean about many things.  in three years there has been no correspondence from the child or from a representative from save the children.  i am seriously thinking of stopping this sponsorship and look into another group.  when i have called the office they suggested that i go on line to find some suggestion.  i found that unhelpful as my computer skills are limited and it did not work.     any suggestions are welcome.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	210397	1	/users/profile/273160	arsanchel	Donor	1	08/12/2014	At first, I just thought that STC had a skeptical record keeping system. Now, I feel after reading reviews written by others that there may be intentional maneuvering involved. I first became a sponsor in 2008. Over the last six years, all of my original children have left the program and have been replaced by other children not of my choosing. The first mismanagement of funds occurred when my Visa was doubled charged for sponsored children. I was able to get this stopped. Then, a few years later, my Discover Card was doubled billed by STC sending the card over the credit limit. After I called STC, the Discover card company was concerned because rather than refunding the amount, STC arranged to make all of my sponsorships be $18 per child per month. I paid the over the limit amount from my bank account. Since then, I've paid by check. In 2014, when I used my MasterCard to start a new sponsorship, I found that STC had charged two additional payments even though I was paying by check. Then when STC moved, two of my May checks were lost and though they have been found they have yet to be deducted from my account making it necessary for me to mentally do this every time I do my online banking.   Family, friends, and church members have urged me to stop giving to STC. I still have four children in sponsorship after reluctantly giving up four others I feel that STC has me over a barrel due to the relationships I have developed with these four children. Giving to an organization should not be a stressful heartache. I urge people to find other worthy sponsorship and global assistance charities to donate to.

It was nice to grow up in a home where we learned about needy kids and hwo to help them. I help Save the Children now. It's a nice family tradition. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	206536		/users/profile/268976	GenerousGal	Volunteer	5	07/18/2014	I had a great time volunteering with Save the Children. I mostly did administrative work, but I did do some fun, challenging project and attended very informative briefing from their staff experts. I came to know how committed they are to being super efficient and totally respecting the donor's wishes. Nothing goes to waste here - you'd think they were an environmental group with all the recycling and everything.  
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	203432		/users/profile/265354	ronnieb	Donor	1	06/21/2014	This organization has been taking money from my bank acct after I have tried numerous times to cancel my donations.  I would urge you to never engage in any donation with this group. I was finally driven to close my bank acct to get rid of them. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	194216		/users/profile/253738	TeriVanGoGo	Donor	3	02/12/2014	I sponsor two girls here in the USA and have for several years.  I appreciate the work that Save the Children is doing.  Especially that I was able to select girls in the USA to sponsor, in order to support children here in the States that need just as much assistance as those in other countries.  While the donations are not allotted for your specific child, I am hopeful that the money I am donating actually goes to the children here in the USA, rather than abroad.  I have questioned my membership several times, but feel that this organization is still beneficial, so I continue to make monthly contributions.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	192920	7	/users/profile/251945	jayspar	Donor	2	01/21/2014	My review is not reflective of the work of STC but from the perspective of a long term donor.  Every month for 30 years STC has debited my bank account with me increasing the gift periodically as funds were available. That is until this summer when I notice the amount coming out increased by 12%. I contacted donor services and was told that they had sent me a letter "inviting" me to increase my gift and since I didn't contact them to say not to, they went ahead and did.   I had to prevent them from increasing not agree to it.  In the tone of the response, the increase was my fault.  I was incredulous.   The anonymous donor services rep offered to reverse the increase if I had been offended.  I responded to end the donation since I felt I could no longer trust them not to try to slip something by again.  The response to this was not what I would have expected to a 30 year donor.  I was no longer sponsoring anyone specific and obviously my gift was not sufficient and the "opt out"  method got them more increases than drops.  Even still, when they ended the draw they ended just the base gift and I am having difficultly getting the "increase" stopped.  Donors should not have to work hard at giving and through me sharing my experience with colleagues and friends they have lost many more donors than just  me.  I will direct my gift to a organization that hasn't so many donors that it can blatantly risk offending and still come out ahead.  
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	177996	2	/users/profile/234598	Jenna13	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/15/2013	I recommend Save the Children, both as a donor and as an employee, for the following reasons:1) the organization focuses its services and programs for children both in the U.S. and around the world; 2) the talented staff are dedicated and results-oriented;3) investing in children is the smartest, most effective way to create a lasting impact. Save the Children is a leader in the industry - driving best practices through collaboration, research, and evaluation.  It's a priviledge to be a part of such profound work - work that saves lives, protects children from harm, and gives children the opportunity to learn and thrive.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	165394	3	/users/profile/219851	TJGR	Donor	5	08/19/2013	Save the Children does amazing work. It's nice to know that they focus on children. While some of the kinks are still being worked out, as they have grown substantially over the last 10 years, they have managed to respond to disasters when children needed them. It was surprising to learn that they setup safe spaces for children after the Sandy Hook shootings and they were on the ground in Oklahoma helping everyone get back to "normal". People don't realize when there are tornadoes that means day cares are shut down and parents are faced with finding emergency child care so they can go to work.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	164371	4	/users/profile/218446	dkgorrell	Donor	2	08/07/2013	Today I received a "Cold-Call" masquerading as a local cellphone origination. I was greeted with a Boiler Room voice pleading with me to increase my very long-standing donation. I listened to the pitch and then asked for a supervisor. The supervisor told me that they were "representing Save The Children." I explained to her that their company's business model was deeply flawed and that I would hold Save The Children responsible for perpetrating a phone scam in pursuit of additional revenue. As a result of becoming a victim to this tactic I will have to very seriously reconsider the continuation of my 15+ years of support for Save The Children.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	161920	2	/users/profile/214802	Katie W	Volunteer	5	07/02/2013	As a resident of Fairfield County, I am honored and thrilled to have such an outstanding organization in our community.  Their tireless effort to raise awareness for children is inspiring.  What I have come to appreciate most about Save the Children is their ability to respond immediately to emergencies here in the United States and overseas.  During Hurricane Sandy this past year, Save the Children responded almost immediately, setting up child friendly spaces for the children displaced by the storm.  Even almost a year after Hurricane Sandy, Save the Children is still helping victims of the storm rebuild their lives.  Their work in Newtown is also something that should be recognized.  Save the Children was a present figure after the Newtown tragedy, setting up spaces where kids could learn to cope with the tragedy they witnessed.   I am proud to be a Save the Children supporter.  They are a fantastic organization and deserve tremendous credit for all the work they do. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	161918	3	/users/profile/214798	HelenaEdison	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/02/2013	Save the Children is an invaluable partner in carrying out  lifesaving interventions through their health care programming and utilization of front line health workers. Their newborn and child survival efforts are absolutely essential.  Their recent innovations and awareness efforts include kangaroo mother care, "steroid injections for women in preterm labor to reduce deaths due to premature babies breathing problems;  resuscitation devices to save babies who do not breathe at birth;  chlorhexidine cord cleansing to prevent umbilical cord infections; and injectable antibiotics to treat newborn sepsis and pneumonia."   
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	158813	10	/users/profile/210754	Chrissy4	Donor	1	05/26/2013	I have been a donor for STC for well over a decade.  I've had some things happen in the past that I wasn't too happy about...for instance, when the little girl I chose to sponsor moved out of the area, I was just randomly assigned a new child without being told, given the choice to cancel my donations,  or pick another child myself.  All in all, it was a minor thing, so I let it slide.  Then, my credit card expired.  I kept meaning to call, and kept forgetting (I was pregnant with my daughter and had an extremely rough time, being on bed rest for 3 months at home, one in the hospital, so forgive me for it slipping my mind.)  I had forgotten about updating my card, but no need to worry, STC somehow did it for me...that's right, they somehow found my new card info and started billing me again...WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.  The final straw, I went through a pile of mail last night and found yet another mailing from them.  I get mailings at LEAST once a week (most of them, like this one, have something about important account info on them.)  I was about to throw it out, when a little voice in my head said to open it.  I opened it and read the letter inside.  THANK GOD I did.  They are now sending out letters telling people that they are going to automatically raise my DONATIONS by $3 a month!  I have to send in a slip of paper in order for them NOT to do this.  Needless to say, I am so over this charity, and I will be cancelling all donations to them from here on out

However, I don't plan on contributing any additional dollars, since Save the Children has risen to the top of my list of obnoxious charities, sending me requests for funds by mail every few weeks, interspersed with frequent phone calls.  Since I have a policy of annual donations only, most charities disappoint but Save the Children heads the list.  Incidentally, I am contacted by the Salvation Army once or twice a year and I was happy to increase my donation to this group last year.   
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	151644	5	/users/profile/202483	Bruce18	Donor	1	03/26/2013	As a son of a non-profit CEO I am also outraged by the salaries of STC and World Vision executives. As a leader in Christ, you are called to sacrifice, not enrich yourselves. My father would at times pay his staff before himself - indeed even sometimes borrow. They rested on their faith, meeting for prayer every morning, and God did not fail to provide the needs of the staff and my family, as well as the constituents of the organization around the world. I am ashamed that I have supported these two organizations for a decade without ever researching the salaries you pay yourselves. Enjoy your reward now Mr. MacCormack and Mr. Stearns, and encourage your cohorts to fully embrace theirs as well. For it is built upon the suffering of those whose stories you exploit for gain. Consider yourselves paid in full.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	148950	2	/users/profile/198414	dlrmgtsolutions	Donor	4	02/05/2013	To those who are surprised or offended by the salaries of the leaders of this organization, I would ask you to consider the enormity of their work.  This is a charity that is managing over half a billion dollars annually.  This charity has a global reach.  The level of sophistication required here, demands the best and the brightest talent available.  I can assure that these salaries are far less than these leaders could garner in private enterprise.  Perhaps this is the reason that Save The Children has such a high rating from Charity Navigator and the donors themselves. God bless you all,-Ken
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	147480	1	/users/profile/108392	DoonDocs	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/31/2012	I work in the industry and I deeply admire Save the Children's work. Having seen their work in Ethiopia during the hunger crisis last year, I can tell you first hand how effective and efficient they are. To see them teaching oppressed Somali girls to read and reviving children who were nearly starved to death was nothing short of miraculous. The best thing, though, was to see how much the children loved and trusted the staff. Their workers are among the brightest, nicest, most generous people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. I also like that they are independent and have a strong governing board and impeccable ethics. All around fantastic charity for a great cause.

I would not under any circumstances donate to an organization where the CEO receives a salary of almost $400,000. I can only imagine the organization's justification for this. Shameful. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	147332	1	/users/profile/194659	stevens316	Donor	5	12/27/2012	Did lots of research trying to find an organization to donate to at year's end. After some extensive vetting I'm very satisfied with this one. Not only do they get very high marks for financial efficiency, they have a lot of awards and commendations for the quality of the programs. (So they aren't just fiscally prudent, the money actually does good.) I was also happy to see that they have programs that range from disaster response to education and that sort of thing. Certainly in the top tier of charities that help kids!
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	146539		/users/profile/193452	Carol88	General Member of the Public	3	12/12/2012	I have been looking for a charity that helps the improvished children of the world.  Save the Children stands out from all the others.   But I was amazed of the salary of the CEO.  It is so contradictory of the work that this charity does.  Do you really need almost $400K a year to live comfortably?  I have always wondered where the funds are spent having managed a non-profit organization in Massachusetts. Even there it was questionable with management and paying for their families health care out of donations.  I am reconsidering my donation to this organization.  My money would be better spent traveling to these areas and giving the money directly to the families in need.

In particular, this year, I used the publication on teenage pregnancy being a leading cause of death in the developing world. This topic is not really addressed in the literature, but the Save the Children looks into this problem which is actually a really big deal. Thank you for advocating for this and many other forgotten or unaddressed causes. Your publications and research cis being used academically and professionally!

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	145155	1	/users/profile/191711	Sue_47	Donor	4	11/30/2012	Save the Children melts my heart the work that they do. You can't imagine a child going without clean water, essential medical supplies and food, but they do it all, and then somehow create programs for education in their own environment and beyond. What I do love about them, is that they do not just concentrate on third world countries, but also poverty in first world countries on our own doorsteps. They seen the silent struggles within our community that often get left behind. They are a great organisation and I am proud to be a regular donor to their cause.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	145094		/users/profile/191655	Martha18	Donor	5	11/30/2012	We have sponsored three children through Save the Children over a period of many years. Each child has received very important educational benefits as well as essential help with nutrition. The communications with the field staff have always been very informative and have given valuable and pertinent information about how funds are used in the specific areas of the countries in which the children live. Also the reports from the organization as a whole provide good detail about the use of funds and how these make a very real difference in the quality of life of children in need of support. Our family will continue to donate to Save the Children as long as we can. We believe in their work and trust them to make responsible use of their resources.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	144764		/users/profile/191308	Angelo R.	Donor	5	11/30/2012	Every year I make donations to Save the Children, particularly dating back to August of 2008, when my identical twin brother and I set the Guinness World Record for the Longest Tennis Rally and did it to support Save the Children. Our record was hitting 25,944 balls consecutively without having breaks for eating or drinking - at that point approximately 25,000 children were dying around the world on a daily basis of preventable and curable diseases. We ran a car wash, silent auction and tennis clinics and cardio classes all to raise money for charity. In addition to their work around the world Save the Children is typically a first responder for catastrophies here in the US, with the latest example being Hurricane Sandy. I am proud to continue to support Save the Children, not only because they help people in need, but in particular because they help children in need. Finally, the majority of the funds that I and anyone else donates gets put to use (over 85%) while other charitable organizations use the funds for large company salaries.

They are very efficient with donations and I have seen them on TV many times and trust them with my money. I have donated what I can over the years. My employer matches my donations as well. Poor children in the United States and around the world need help because they can't take care of themselves. My son works there and I am inspired by their work. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	144596		/users/profile/191135	epic	Donor	5	11/29/2012	I am a donor for Save the Children and have been since 2004. At first, I donated to them after the tsunami in Asia but I have donated every year since then because Save the Children is one of the most efficient charities in program to expenses ratio. I have learned since then that they not only provide emergency relief but also other non-emergency programs for children (like education) overseas and in the US, a fact I didn't know. They also appeal to me because they support all faiths and religions and not just one. Children are universal. I am a father of 2 kids and that is what made Save the Children appeal to me. Also, they are open and transparent with their communications and actively listen on social networks. I really like their ties designed with children's artwork. Too bad they don't make them anymore. I like them so much that I work for them too!

Their work is vital in getting food and education to underprivileged children, and to make sure that the governments are accountable to this often overlooked group.  Our children determine our future, so we need to make sure they are given the opportunities needed to succeed, and Save The Children does this very well.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	141515	1	/users/profile/187853	SK13	General Member of the Public	5	11/20/2012	There are lots of organizations out there right now who claim to do good work and use your money wisely, but honestly, I don't think a lot of them are as transparent or responsible as Save the Children. I don't give to an organization I don't trust, but Save the Children does an incredible amount of work all over the world and the money really does go where they say it goes. They also want their programs to be self sustaining, even after they leave. Working with communities and families to develop solutions that have long term positive effects is an approach I will support! 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	141402	1	/users/profile/94477	Barak	Donor	4	11/19/2012	There are undoubtedly many choices when it comes to making a charitable gift, and quite a few if you are looking to sponsor a child. I did my homework and looked for one that had good rankings from the charity watchdogs, transparent reporting and a strong track record. Save the Children seemed to fit all those criteria very well. I have been sponsoring my child for over two years now and I am very happy with my choice. I have received several letters from my child and have seen actual reports of improvements made in his and his village's life. Yes they solicit me often for additional gifts and to sponsor another child, but what nonprofit doesn't, and besides, who can really fault them for trying to raise as much as they can for their cause?

How much of my previous donations did they waste on begging for more and yet another round of address labels ? Is there anyone who gives charitably who needs more of these ? On top of all that I found today that they pay their CEO almost 400K a year. Another wildly overpaid "charity" employee. I have asked to be removed from all their records as their way too frequent appeals are bordering on harassment, and the CEO makes way more than I ever have .

The wonderful thing about the child sponsorship program is that the funds go to the community, not just the child we sponsor. We hear about where our donations are going - to education, health programs, better equipment and supplies for schools - and it feels good to know that we are helping a community provide the right tools for children to get a better start in life. Some of the children in their programs have gone on to become health workers in their communities, or teachers, or even become Save the Children employees! This is a terrific organization with programs this world needs to become a better place.

I saw that they did excellent work that really helped disadvantaged children in poor communities. They also do great work during disasters like earthquakes, floods and famines. They have no political or religious agenda -- they just want to do what's best for kids, no matter who they are or where they are (including in the United States). They also have an excellent reputation for financial accountability. I think they put something like 90% of their funds towards programs, so they're not wasting people's donations on fundraising and excessive salaries. An investment in children is an investment in a better future for everyone, so I continue to support Save the Children. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	121756	1	/users/profile/165667	HoneyBadge	Donor	5	08/31/2012	Wonderful organization that really understands the needs of kids and how best to address them. First learned about them during the Haiti earthquake, think I saw them on CNN or some major news network. Before donating I did some research on them and learned they do a lot more than just emergency response. (On that note, they aren't "ambulance chasers", when they respond to emergencies they actually have worked in the country for decades.) They do education and health and a load of other stuff with communities. I also recently learned that they work here in the US which is important to me. (We should be helping ALL kids around the world, but I have a special place in my heart for my fellow Americans.) Sometimes they send too many e-mails but I live with it since the issues are important. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	121754		/users/profile/165555	YankeeDoodle	General Member of the Public	5	08/31/2012	As a longtime CT resident, I had been loosely familiar with Save the Children, having heard their name for 30+ years.  I never quite knew exactly what they did - I always thought it had something to do with children in Africa.  However as I traveled the world in the late 90's and early 00's, I begin noticing Save the Children offices/vans/staff in a lot of place:  in the slums of Old Delhi, India; in a school in Kathmandu, Nepal; in the Mindanao, Philippines; in Indonesia responding to the Tsunami; in the Dominican Republic; and then in New Orleans helping to sort out the aftermath of Katrina.  I have since become a supporter, donating to their Haiti earthquake response and Japan Tsunami response.  I love what they do and any organization that helps hundreds of millions of children each year around the world is invaluable in my book.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	121605	1	/users/profile/165457	Alena M.	Volunteer	5	08/29/2012	I started volunteering for Save the Children in January 2012.  It is an amazing organization to be part of!  Not only are the peope very dedicated to their jobs and the mission, but the organization as a whole prides itself on being accountable for their actions.  What could be a better cause then helping out children in the USA and around the world!  Save the Children has been around for many years and they have helped millions of children and their families.  After volunteering for few months, I was hired and work for the organization full time.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	114949		/users/profile/156623	Chip Rohlke	Professional with expertise in this field	3	06/13/2012	I'm an ordained Chaplain who was in the Peace Corps in 1977 living on $120 a month & loving it. I've had a non-profit for 20 years -Christ is Creator Ministries that has built an orphanage in Romania, helped women in crisis pregnancies, ministered to inmates in prisons, and done numerous mission trips in haiti, mexico & Romania. I did it all with very little if any help & seldom if ever ask for it. i believe God will provide & He has.  My problem with huge non profits is they are without exception playing on peoples emotions and make it easy to salve their conscience about each of our responsibility before God to change the world ourselves. Every one of us needs to pour our hearts & lives into the terrible darkness of this world and make a change instead of thinking we can send a check and God owes us something. He demands the same thing Christ gave...everything.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	113231		/users/profile/154090	Jacqueline C.	Donor	5	05/30/2012	I always donate to worthy causes--and this one is definitely one.  I typically consult with Charity Navigator before proceeding.  Save The Children Federation, Inc. is a worthy cause.  I learned from my beloved mother's loving example to help mothers and children.  This charity means so much because it supports an enormously worthy cause, which means so much to me in carrying on our tradition.  Also, Save The Children has teamed up with The Red Cross in providing children with centers of their own during natural disasters like hurricanes and tsunamis--on a global scale.                                                                                          I am especially proud to have pioneered this safe space concept.  So, during natural disasters, children are occupied with fun activities instead of dwelling on what can be quite traumatizing, they are in an atmosphere of loving kindness.  When I found out that The Red Cross took my concept from Hurricane Andrew and teamed up with this charity in taking my concept global, I knew it was a great cause because it shows that Save the Children really loves and worries about a child's well-being--on all fronts--physical and mental.  I will continue supporting them and would love to even help them further at some point, in the future.  May God bless each and every one of the mothers and children, as well as this worthy organization, which (despite paying their CEO kindly), remains one of the highest rated charities.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	109831		/users/profile/149604	Kristine H.	Donor	5	04/13/2012	I trust Save the Children and have always been confident that my donations are going to help children around the world. I will be a donor for life.

Neither do I like being continuously bombarded with their paper based repeat mailings. I find the frequency of their mailings intrusively obnoxious.Save a few trees and reallocate the dollars to more effectively their mission.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	109741		/users/profile/149501	Alaina Spaziani	Advisor	5	04/12/2012	I am very impressed with Save the Children's fundraising and marketing campaigns. In addition to efficiently targeting thier main demographic though proven methods, they have recently branched out to target communities that are not traditional donors. For example, they partnered with a famous internet gamer to raise money through World of Warcraft and it was a successful venture. Thier use of social media has been effective at targetting the younger generation. 
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	109655		/users/profile/149400	JustHelping	Donor	4	04/11/2012	I've contributed to Save the Children on a few occasions, and recently decided to become a child sponsor. $28/month is about my financial limit.  World poverty and inequality are enormous issues that aren't going to be solved by NGOs, but until the world community decides to end poverty, I'll be supporting Save the Children. $.90 of every dollar I give to them goes to the field. The remaining $.10 helps ensure that those dollars are used in the most efficient, responsible, and sustainable way.  I highly recommend Save the Children and encourage anyone to become a child sponsor or donor. You will not regret it.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	107930	1	/users/profile/146602	uncultured	Advisor	5	03/15/2012	For the past 5 years, I've had the privilege of seeing Save the Children's work in the field first hand in Bangladesh. I'm ethnically Bangladeshi and my parents are from Bangladesh. I should also point out that Save the Children allowed me to go into the field with them despite not being an employee and NEVER EVER receiving any salary, stipend, or payment for my time in the field with them. I also have to admit, before 6 years ago, I never had even heard of Save the Children. I learned about Save the Children from local Bangladeshis. You think Americans are skeptical about NGOs? You haven't met a Bangladeshi. In Bangladesh there is a saying which in English translates to "NGOs eat the cash". Yet, for some reason, Bangladeshis love and respect Save the Children. Going into the field, not reading the brochures or watching the TV ads, I could see why Bangladeshis respect this NGO. What they do works and it changes lives. And, in the areas of disaster relief and child health, it directly saves lives and averts deaths. You are making a difference when you donate to this organization. I know this because I've seen it with my own two eyes. Reading the comments about this charity, I can see that some people cite the CEO's salary as an issue of concern. But I'm writing this review in the wake of the scandal and controversy surrounding Invisible Children (an organization that only sends 37% of donations to the field). Quite frankly, I think there are a lot less efficient ways to spend your donation dollars.  Because the fact of the matter is many similar sized charities (e.g. World Vision, Red Cross, etc) have higher executive compensation. If how much the CEO gets paid gives you pause well then good luck finding another charity with as much experience, know how, scale, scope, reach, success, and (most importantly) RESULTS that pays their CEOs less than Save the Children. And as a final note, in response to the person who gave Save the Children 1 out of 5 stars for issues with "their" sponsor child, what people need to understand is if you are sponsoring a child it's not YOUR child. You are helping a child - not owning them. And, especially in Bangladesh, many children simply don't have the means and resources to respond as often as we'd like. Save the Children also works in a way that child sponsorship goes towards helping communities - not individuals. Because it takes a village to raise a child and so Save the Children works by transforming and empowering communities. And any good NGO that has a reputable child sponsorship program (e.g. World Vision) does the same.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	107901	1	/users/profile/146553	Patrick12	Donor	1	03/14/2012	I was very disappointed in my experience with STC.  I became a donor in 2010 and chose a girl in Bangladesh as "my" child.  I looked forward to hearing about her life there, and had visions of my son and she writing back and forth.  Not too long after I joined I received a copy of a picture she drew.  I sent a letter to her praising the picture, asking to tell me about her day, etc.  A couple of months later I got a very brief, 5-7 line letter from her.  And.......nothing else since then.  I sent her another letter about a year ago, a birthday card last fall, and an e-mail in December.  Nothing.  I emailed SAT in Connecticut, but got a standard "We can reduce the number of communications to you if you want (i.e. their pitches for more money), but no response to my question of why I was getting no mail from my sponsored child.  I sent a snail mail to Connecticut in January asking them to stop charging my credit card (and explaining why).  The letter was never acknowledged, and the charge showed up on my Feb. bill.  I called their main office, and the lady I spoke to was sympathetic, but did not know why I had received no response from my sponsored child in over a year.  I'll know in a few days if she cancelled the monthly charge like she said she would.  To this day I've never received a response to my snail mail.  What happened to it I wonder?  It's too bad because they *appear* to do good work.

Save the Children Federation, Inc.	107455		/users/profile/38282	lemurlover	Donor	5	03/02/2012	I have been very happy overall with Save the Children.   I sponsor 4 children through them currently, in 3 different countries, although 3 of those are rather new, and I don't have data on them yet.  But I've sponsored a child continuously through them for about 18 years (4 different children).   They are great about sending regular updates, and handwritten letters and drawings from the sponsored children.   I have sponsored the girl in Nepal the longest, and it gives me an immeasurable joy to see how she has progressed over the years... when I first started sponsoring her she looked frightened and probably didn't have much of a future, being a girl in a culture that favors male children, and being an Untouchable (Dalit) in a poverty-stricken community.   I am able to send her small gifts, which the STE country coordinator emails me about promptly, to say what was received.  In the past, I've even received photos of my sponsored child with my gifts!  So I know they arrived, and that she got them.    I actually love to write to the children, and I have read a statistic somewhere that sponsored children who receive letters from their sponsors (even just one letter a year) do significantly better (some 30% or so) academically than children who do not receive letters.   I can't change the whole world, but maybe I can help a few people out there.   And Save The Children makes that possible.   I traveled to Nepal a few years ago, and while I wasn't able to make it to the far-flung region where my sponsored child is, I was able to meet with the STE country coordinator in Kathmandu.  She was great -- she made time to meet with me and she was incredibly kind and thoughtful even though I'm not a big donor to STE.   I really like the STE website which allows donors to login, see photos of their sponsored children, and see what is being done in their specific communities.   Also, their website (after you've logged in) allows you to send an email message to your child.   This is a great feature!  The only negative thing I have to say about STE are that if a child moves out of STE's impact area (something over which STE has no control) they will give you a new child to sponsor.  That has happened to me twice, and it makes me sad....because of course you want to see the child grow and flourish.   I think that when kids turn 18 in the STE program, they are "done" and at that point you get another child.   But I don't see how STE can do much about whether or not a child moves out of their impact area.   I have heard people complain a about being bombarded by mail from STE, but that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.   I get regular (but not overboard) mailings from STE, just enough to keep me informed.   I do wish there was a way for me to continue sponsoring my child for longer.   I know that the Christian Foundation for Children and Aging allows donors to sponsor the children through their twenties (for university or trade school or whatever) for the same cost as sponsoring a child in grade school or high school ($30/mo).   I wish that Save the Children offered a similar program.   
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	107084	1	/users/profile/144947	SuperMike	Donor	3	02/25/2012	CEO 2009 compensation $365,130 (source: Charity Navigator).  I donate about $350 per year to STC. 1,042 donations of $350 are required to pay just the CEO's salary.  Does that seem a bit excessive to anyone other than me?  I am considering re-directing my money to another organization where the CEO's salary is more reasonable.  Any suggestions?
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	102369	1	/users/profile/133281	bkbarbato	Donor	5	12/16/2011	I wanted to support STC's midwifery training program. I had a list of specific questions about the program that were answered via email by the Acting Associate Director of Operations for the Newborn and Child Survival Campaign.  It has been my experience that other charities do not offer such one-on-one communication. When I have a question a representative guides me back to their website.  
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	97060	1	/users/profile/113473	fudgewhitegrey1111	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/01/2011	It's simple. If you want to help poverty stricken children, STC is your best bet. forget all those other organizations. STC is by far the most reputable and efficient children charity out there. I dont know where all these negative views are coming from because in the world of charity anyone whose been around long enough has not only heard of Save the Children, but also recognizes it as one of the leading non-profits.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	95473	1	/users/profile/110838	Greg3 email here	Donor	1	08/10/2011	Five members of my family made one-time donations in memory of a loved one two years ago. SInce then we have ALL been inundated with STC mailings and emails despite numerous calls, letters, and emails from each one of us requesting that we be taken off their lists.  It is a total waste of money that could be used to help children!  It has changed the way I think of STC, and that's a shame. I could not find an "unsubscribe" link on their website, nor is that an option to check on the printed donor forms.  When I emailed (again) last year and requested to be taken off all lists,  I got a response back that said I would receive (and I quote) "a reduction in volume of communications from us".  That was a first -  not "you have been unsubscribed from all communications from us".  Reduction in volume? I have personally received 5 mailed solicitations in the last 4 weeks! All 5 of us have tried repeatedly with no success to be removed.It has gotten to the point that when any of us receives a solicitation from STC, we send emails to each other with the title "STC again". It has become a bad family joke.  But it is really very, very sad when I think of the wasted cost. I called again a while back and was transferred to someone who said STC gets calls like mine all the time.  The person said it was an "executive decision" not to take names off, and also there are numerous non-integrated mailing lists and that's probably why we all get so many mailings.  I said I keep sending back the donor form with "remove from all lists" written on it and the person said it won't do any good. I am not revealing gender here because I don't want anyone to get in trouble.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	88598	3	/users/profile/99881	billtc	General Member of the Public	3	05/11/2011	Clearly a worthwhile organization, and I strongly support the work they do.  However, one should use caution if using monthly credit or debit cards to donate to their monthly program, because it can be difficult to discontinue the charges.  There is no option to cancel at their Web site, so I mailed a letter asking them to discontinue the monthly charges to my account.  Nonetheless, a charge appeared in my account two weeks later.  About three weeks after that, I received a letter from them asking me to "update my account information"; they clearly still hadn't processed my cancellation, so  I called and gave them a verbal cancellation.  A charge AGAIN appeared on my account the following month!  I think I finally got it straightened out with a repeat phone call. One also wonders why they have such an expensive monthly sponsorship program; other charities seem to be grateful for smaller donations.
Save the Children Federation, Inc.	81377	5	/users/profile/89073	jeanne Aschermann	Professional with expertise in this field	2	03/07/2011	I worked for SAVE  and while it is better than many organizations such as World Vision they are not good at providing the professionals needed to design a project or program. Often  bad projects especially in education are developed. That is because professionals do not write the projects and they are destined to fail.  Project managers are told to write positive reports anyway which I did many times.  Corruption happens because their projects are not well managed or supervised. I could have easily walked away with the money for my project because there was no spot checking to see if I was doing what I was supposed to be doing.  I met some of my colleages in the field who were doing just that.  I saw other projects which were definitely irresponsible. This is in a former soviet country. I will not divulge the country.  The project managers I met were also not of a very high quality. I

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	128407	2	/users/profile/173565	Sandy36	Volunteer	5	10/24/2012	In addition to having an artistic and social focus, GNHCC has a wonderful outreach component that takes music out to the community via free concerts. Here in Connecticut it gets dark so early in the winter and the holidays can be such a difficult and lonely time for some. In addition to its elegant signature concerts at Battell Chapel at Yale University, the GNHCC performs at senior housing centers and at events like the annual benefit for Ronald McDonald House.  Singers (approx. 120) receive the gift of being able to give back, to spread cheer and support the efforts of other non-profits. It it best stated by this Latin phrase: "Musica laetitiae comes medicina dolorum" --Music is the companion of joy and a medicine for sorrow."
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	126529		/users/profile/67320	BetcR	Volunteer	5	10/17/2012	This group uses the by-line "Building Community One Note at a Time!" and they really keep that as a guiding force in what they do. From building a close social community within the group through social and civic events, to building connections out in the Greater New Haven community, GNHCC views community interaction as an integral part of their mission. They support the group's mission statement through reasonably priced concerts, high school collaborations, a fantastic Choral Conducting Assistant Scholarship, Ronald McDonald House "Trees of Hope" involvement, and have offered workshops open to the larger musical community. GNHCC will be celebrating the 50th Anniversary next year and wants to support local and emerging Choral composers by commissioning two NEW Choral works inspired by this special milestone. I came to the chorus as a lone seeker and within a year found myself welcomed in to not only fond friendships, but a dedicated support system of committee and Board members. Come to our concerts and you can actually hear the sound of community!
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61638	1	/users/profile/67320	BetcR	Volunteer	5	01/29/2011	This chorus lives up to its motto "Building Community One Note at a Time" in many ways. The singers and professional staff are friendly to newcomers and really make an effort to make everyone feel welcomed. Members become friends and share time outside of the chorus rehearsals, too. They also reach out to the community at large. Since they do not require auditions, anyone who loves to sing can join. Because of the efforts of Artistic Director Chris Clowdus, this works to the benefit of the individual and the group - he finds teaching points throughout the rehearsals, to help everyone improve. On the larger community level, the Community Impact Committee has worked hard to provide opportunities for the chorus to reach out to the general population, through performances at nursing and elder living venues, and most recently by working with a chorus in a local magnet school, to present a joint holiday performance. The letters the students wrote back to the chorus make it clear how much they were affected by the opportunity. One student wrote that she wanted to pursue singing lessons now, and another wrote that he was inspired by the welcome he felt from the adults in the GNHCC. Creating opportunities to share this important cultural experience with those who might not ordinarily be able to attend such events, is a cornerstone of the chorus' mission. The Chorus also offers workshops to the community, and a Choral Conducting Scholarship, open to a College-level music Major at area colleges and universities. A talented Yale student is the current recipient. The Chorus has been working hard to develop these Community Impact programs, and to upgrade its accounting system and other operating facets, so that it can be more effective. An Advisory Committee was recently formed, from members of the New Haven community, to help guide the chorus to greater growth and influence over the coming years. I am proud to be involved with this group.

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	73583	1	/users/profile/80414	Alaina D.	Client Served	5	02/23/2011	GNHCC is a wonderfully inclusive community chorus, open to all members of the community, regardless of singing ability!  When I wanted to get back into singing, I searched online for local choruses.  Many of them were auditioned-- I was very nervous at the thought of having to sight-read music in front of an audience!  Not only that, these choruses seemed rather "stuffy" as they were singing more traditional choral songs and arrangements.  The GNHCC welcomed me during my very first practice with open arms, no auditions and they instilled confidence in my ability to sing with them by welcoming me back again and again.  Their music is sometimes traditional, but mostly current, international, and eclectic, featuring composers from all walks of life.  It's inspiring to be a part of this chorus and I look forward to our practices together every week!

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	79715		/users/profile/87056	JulieS	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	I have been a member of GNHCC when I lived in the area, and have also attended concerts as an audience member. There is a lot of talent there, especially for a non-audition choir. The membership represents the diverse community of New Haven area. The music is well-selected and very enjoyable. Also not easy...the choir director and members work hard and always pull off a beautiful concert.

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	79393		/users/profile/86717	Susan S	Volunteer	4	02/28/2011	I have sung in the chorus for a few years. The people are very welcoming. I don't have a "soloist" voice and it is great to have a non-audition chorus where you can improve your singing and sing complex music but is also large enough that you don't have to feel that you need to be completely perfect or have a beautiful voice - a solid chorus voice is appreciated too.  I am proud of the chorus for trying to be more community minded. I thought our free concert for the "underserved" was a great idea. Even though the weather did not cooperate, I hope we do it again. The music is always interesting and challenging. I would like a little more time hearing my part's notes but overall I think the director has a good balance with his conducting and definitely pushes us to be better.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	78563		/users/profile/85844	Sara Keyes	General Member of the Public	5	02/27/2011	I have been attending GNHCC concerts for about 40+ years, as a supporter of my sister Kathy Traub, a long-time member of the chorus, and active person with multiple roles in the organization.  I personally enjoy most of the repertoire presented by the group.  I prefer classical music, but I also like a fairly wide variety of popular musical numbers, e.g., South Pacific, Cats, Sound of Music, etc., as well as folk, gospel, ethnic, and some jazz.  The one concert that stands out in my memory was one featuring Italian Opera and Neapolitan music, perhaps ten or so years ago.  I always enjoy the December concert, with many offerings of the Christmas season.  As far as the venue is concerned, Battell Chapel has very good acoustics, but parking and steep outer steps are problems for many of us who are beginning to be affected by physical betrayals of joints and other ailments.  I hope the chorus could find an easily accessed concert setting, perhaps a city or university auditorium to hold both a growing chorus and those who wish to be supporters (without having to worry about steps and parking).

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	74194		/users/profile/81068	Mary Connors	Client Served	5	02/23/2011	The Greater New Haven Community Chorus started with a small chorus of about 60 people back in 1989. I joined the chorus at the time to improve on my musicianship on the guitar.  It allowed me to phrase in my singing and guitar pieces The bigggest reward to this organization is it is a cheap way to learn music and a rewarding path to becoming part of an ever growing family which reaches out to its members, their families and the community.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	73904		/users/profile/80768	Gudrun	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	The Greater New Haven Community Chorus is extremely true to its name!  It is open for everybody in the community - no auditions - and it gives back to the community again and again with concerts in community and senior centers and most recently by cooperating with a public school.  It is a wonderful experience to sing with the chorus.  The last concert in December filled Battell Chapel almost to capacity and the quality of the performance was outstanding!

The conductor (ok, can't remember his name bu that's my defect, not his!) seemed exceptionally attuned to the strengths of his chorus in his selections which enabled them to be exceptionally capable of delivering a stellar performance.

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	72956		/users/profile/79752	Keith S.	Volunteer	5	02/22/2011	Last fall, I had the privilege of being a guest singer with the Greater New Haven Community Chorus.  The program would have been challenging for even a professional chorus, so I was skeptical of the chorus's ability to "pull it off" on the first train ride from New York City to the Yale area. My skepticism could not have been more foolish: the choir, although completely volunteer and composed mainly of untrained music enthusiasts, attacked the program with a vigor and passion I have not even seen amongst groups of paid professionals.  Everyone in the chorus was not only giving 110%, but was willing and able to follow direction / instruction and tips from the guest singers regarding the music.  Most importantly: they were all singing with passion and joy.  On the night of the concert, it was apparent to both myself and my fellow guest artists how influential this group has been in the community.  The choir sang with passion and artistic integrity, and it was clear in the faces of the audience that each person in the room was touched by the passion of the singer.  More importantly, each audience member left the concert a changed person because of the music that they heard.  They all stuck around to talk to the singers and find out more about the chorus.   The Greater New Haven Community Chorus has created an environment in their community that fosters and supports creativity.  More importantly, by the power of song, they have brought the community together in support of music.

It is now extending its impact into the community by providing free concerts 2-3 times a year, andn this year will participate int he celebration of The International Year of The Woman to raise awareness of violence against women.  The chorus will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2013 and is planning toward that goal, many events to commmorate this COMMUNITY chorus and its open door poilcy.  It is the oldest, continuously operating, non-auditioned chorus in CT and possibly the USA.

If you are not very experienced, there are many experienced hands who are more than willing to help.  The members are friendly and diverse.  The director is quite talented and knowledgeable.  If I hadn't moved, I would still be singing with them.

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	69637		/users/profile/76096	elliemac	General Member of the Public	5	02/16/2011	I started singing with the Greater New Haven Community Chorus approximately 10 years ago. I have sung mostly the Christmas/Winter concerts because of my family schedule but it's been an experience I would encourage anyone to try out. As a non auditioned chorus, you don't have pressure to be the best, you just have to love what you do and DO your best.  Our Artistic Director, Chris Clowdus, makes sure that we all work hard to give our audiences the best performance possible, bringing out some beautiful music from sometimes over 100 voices. We have had concerts in local nursing homes and charity fund raisers which are great ways to help out the community and warm your own heart at the same time.  We also donate many tickets to local charities to make sure they can come and enjoy the local talent.

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	62089		/users/profile/67872	Judith Buzzell	Volunteer	5	02/01/2011	The Greater New Haven Community Chorus provides a wonderful service to the New Haven community.  Because there is no audition required to be accepted to the chorus, anyone who loves to sing is welcome and able to join. The chorus has over 120 enthusiastic singers who range in age from early 20s to late 90s. This opportunity for an authentic inter-generational experience is rare.The chorus gives back to the community by giving two concerts, at reasonable prices, a year; one in the winter and one in the spring. In addition, it provides free concerts to the elderly and at other community events. This year, the chorus joined with the high school student chorus at Hill Central High School to provide a free concert to citizens of the New Haven community.

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	62057		/users/profile/67825	Kimberly-Bayne F.	Volunteer	5	01/31/2011	This non-audition community chorus welcomes new members with open arms.  It has been many, many years since I sang with a group and the members are very supportive while you learn in this nuturing environment.  Not only are they supportive within the group, but I am very impressed with their efforts for community outreach.  This past December we performed a concert for the underserved in the Greater New Haven area with a group of students from a school that wants to cut music from their budget.  Making music accessable not only to the community, but to the schools can change peoples lives.  
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	62045		/users/profile/67813	WSP62	Board Member	5	01/31/2011	GNHCC has a vision statement:  to build community one note at a time.  Empty words?  On the contrary!  Week by week, relationship by relationship, this vision grows deeper.  I was first enthusiastic about joining the chorus because the director, Christopher Clowdus, was a fellow classmate at Yale.  Given our shared commitment to music, we had sung and performed together.  Since our graduation, his professionalism and musical talent have continued to grow, and he continues to challenge each of us to test our reach toward being "our best" together.  His leadership, the leadership  of the board, and the commitment of chorus members provide all of us with the privilege of singing together without drama or egocentricity.  The result of our shared energy and ethos has built a loyal following who turn out for our concerts, including our most recent December concert to a full house at Yale's Battell Chapel.Compared to some of our members, I have belonged to GNHCC for a relatively short time, and yet, have been welcomed genuinely like a good friend.   I have been moved by the group's vision to share the love of music in the local community, as well as openness to explore partnerships within and beyond New Haven.GNHCC?  It's an organization with energy and vision--an arts organization to watch!

Their musical offerings have been diverse, exciting, and relevant to the times and the community. The chorus members' delight, dedication, and enthusiasm shines through at each performance. The fact that this is a non audition chorus amazes us, for the quality of the music and voices is exceptional. This is what community is all about! BRAVO!!
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61916		/users/profile/67665	anne Storz	Volunteer	5	01/31/2011	The Greater New Haven Community Chorus is exactly what it purports to be: a vehicle for men and women in the area who love to sing -- a place where they gather to do just that every Thursday evening, under the direction of a professional, music-loving conductor.  There's no auditioning, freeing up those who might shy away from such a "trial." The atmosphere and demands are warm and friendly, the goals are high but attainable.  There's opportunity for those who want to exercise their organizational  as well as their musical skills, but "showing up" and singing with eagerness and attention is the main criteria.  We have fun!
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61886		/users/profile/67623	sundried	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	I have been with the Chorus for many years.  It draws together people of different backgrounds - some musical, some not - yet bringing together  beautiful programs. It has been educational, friendly, and best of all, it is where I met a fellow tenor - my husband.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61866		/users/profile/67600	SusanShultz	General Member of the Public	4	01/31/2011	In my three years with the Chorus I have found them a dedicated, welcoming group and extremely interested in being involved in the community. This past year we did a free concert for the underserved with the Hill high school chorus (i.e. free tickets to various social service agencies). It was a great outreach idea and something I hope/expect the Chorus to continue. We also sang at a Branford Senior Housing center in order to bring our music to those who are less able to travel.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61856		/users/profile/67590	Jean	Volunteer	5	01/31/2011	I have sung with the Greater New Haven Community Chorus for three  years. I was unable to sing with them for the 2010  Holidays performance and so played audience.  They were superb. It is an non -auditioned chorus, but the work and musical training available was well evident. This Spring I will be singing again with GNHCC. I was welcomed back as if I'd never been away, only slightly warmer that new members are greeted and encouraged to become part of the group. New music is presented for each performance, allowing us to share in many types of music, and receive the musical training to support these  pieces.  If you live in the greater New Haven area, it is well worth stopping in at a rehearsal to see if this community chorus, now 100 member, would interest you and enhance your life as it has many other people.

Located in the heart of Yale University, we are surrounded by a multitude of cultural events, which we proudly count ourselves as part of.  I encourage all who know music, listen to music, or love music to come try us out.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61830		/users/profile/67558	Another Alto	Volunteer	5	01/31/2011	I have been singing with the Greater New Haven Community Chorus for over twenty years.  To me, singing with a welcoming  group of people who love music, and experiencing the joy of learning a new song and working on it until it becomes a beautiful sound is thrilling.  Being exposed to a variety of music and learning about music from  talented directors,  as well as  singing with people of all ages and from  all  walks of life  is enriching.  And contributing to the community through our concerts and our singing at area schools and nursing homes is rewarding. New Haven has  much to offer in terms of the arts, but  I think the Greater New Haven Community Chorus, which is a non-auditioned chorus and open and welcoming to all  , really performs a unique  role.  It allows anyone , regardless of talent,  to participate in the creation of  beautiful music.

It is not until you sing with a choral group like GNHCC that you realize how powerful voices can be when singing together.  You learn a true sense of community, following strong and talented leadership, learning how to be better than you were from their tutelage, sharing ideas, and listening to one another.  The finished product is a beautiful and spectacular event that moves people right to their core being.

The beautiful spectacle of the holiday concert, staged in the magnificent Battell Chapel, sent spirits soaring for listeners and performers alike.My wife considers herself privileged to be a part of this outstanding group.

We really get the opportunity to grow and improve our voices with GNHCC.  The most amazing thing is how interesting and friendly people are that are involved in the chorus.  You get to meet people with so many different backgrounds and talents.  The work that we put into singing a beautiful piece pays off. Everyone who attends our concerts can't wait for the next one!
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61772		/users/profile/67485	GuSch	Volunteer	5	01/30/2011	Being a singer in the Greater New Haven Community Chorus is a wonderful and very rewarding experience.  The chorus welcomes everybody who enjoys singing (no auditions) and building community is a true focus.  The conductor Chris Clowdus has a remarkable skill of bringing this large group together and give their very best at every concert.  The last concert in December 2010 was an amazing experience with Battell Chapel almost filled to the last seat.  The space was filled with JOY.   I personally very much like the outreach to the elderly and the schools and enjoy to sing at senior homes and with high school students like we did in December.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61771		/users/profile/67484	Fran	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2011	I have faithfully attended all of the Greater New Haven Community Chorus concerts for more than 5 years...and have been, without exception, always entertained, enchanted and invigorated by the caliber of their performances, and also by how they "live" the meaning of community.  As a non-audition chorus, any and all with a strong interest in signing can join.  They partner with other choral and educational groups to perform and share the gift of song with community members that might not otherwise be able to attend a performance.  And every performance I have attended leaves me feeling fortunate for having been a part of such a great musical experience...the quality and professionalism of the chorus, their conductor, the many amazing soloists and talented accompanists always leave me looking forward to the next experience!

No auditions, but high standards for learning and practicing. The group represents a wide swath of area citizens, with a mixture of ages, backgrounds, races, and more.

The venue was particularly effective for this type of music.  Parking was convenient, the building was accessible and eateries abound.  The quality of the program was superb, including the blending of voices, the  soloists and the orchestra.  The conductors knew their stuff and gave us a great start to the Holiday season in a very traditional, "British" setting.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61740		/users/profile/67449	mdooley	Volunteer	5	01/30/2011	I have always been involved in the arts and especially love choral singing.  I was looking for a new and more challenging experience, so I went in search of choral ensembles with a varied repertoire.  I found the GNHCC on line and after reading about their mission to the community, reading past concert programs and viewing photos, I decided to attend a rehearsal.  The full, rich sound of the chorus was breathtaking and the members were warm and welcoming.  The choral director, Chris Cloudus, provides direction that gives us a deep understanding of the music, technically as well as emotionally.Our organization is multidimensional and has many opportunities for its members to provide cultural experiences,  education and social support to our community.
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61738		/users/profile/67448	JudyK	General Member of the Public	5	01/30/2011	The GNHCC was a wonderful find for me. I wanted to sing, but not audition, as I haven't been in a chorus for decades. So many members welcomed me very warmly!  I was somewhat intimidated at the thought of singing Vivaldi's Gloria and parts of Handel's Messiah, as I don't read music and it all seemed quite difficult. However, the director, Chris Clowdus really goes out of his way to help us learn many of the basics of reading music while we're rehearsing.  I was delighted at what I learned, as well as being able to perform this beautiful music not only for the paying public, but for other groups as a community service to spread some holiday cheer. It was a very proud moment having family and friends attend the public concert, and I can happily report that they all enjoyed it very much. The GNHCC is an amazing organization!

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61734		/users/profile/67443	Zoilin	Volunteer	5	01/30/2011	I have been involved with the Greater New Haven Community Chorus since 1983 when the artistic director was Ron Konetchy.  While not a professional singer, nor do I have any musical training, throughout the years, the GNCC has taught me a lot about music in general; how to sing;  and has helped me realize the dream of singing for my community.  the most outstanding aspect of the chorus is how it "builds community one note at a time." We live to that motto.  People come in from all walks of life; once per week we get together, we meet and learn about each other, and we make beautiful music togehter.  It is three hours  of beautiful choral sound. Another wonderful aspect of the GNHCC is its community outreach.  The Chorus reaches out to community organizations, the elderly, the schools and colleges, and identifies venues where we bring our music for all to enjoy at no cost.  We provide opportunities for youth and students to sing with us and to grow musically.  The Greater New Haven Community is better off as result of the Greater New Haven Community Chorus.....We love to sing and bring people together!
Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61692		/users/profile/67383	Katers501	Volunteer	5	01/29/2011	I joined the Greater New Haven Community Chorus and year and a half ago and quickly became an active member of the group because I strongly believe that it is a wonderful organization, and one that is crucial to the vitality of the Greater New Haven area. One of the best things about the group is that is a friendly, welcoming group.  From the minute I walked through the doors I felt like I was an important part of something.  I've been in many choirs, and left them after a year because I didn't feel welcome and didn't know anyone's name.  But after one year in GNHCC and I was part of the technology committee, a soloist, and knew everyone around me.  This is a true testament to the wonderful leadership here at GNHCC. This choir allows anyone to be a part of it, regardless of singing and music experience, which creates a rich and diverse brand of people.  And it's an organization that gives back, with free concerts and a burgeoning community outreach program that is always looking for new ways to be involved.  The choir has performed at nursing homes, charity events, and local schools, in within three concert seasons. I'm so happy to be involved with the choir.  I foresee many, many years with the GNHCC>

Greater New Haven Community Chorus Inc	61623		/users/profile/67303	Susan	Board Member	5	01/29/2011	Greater New Haven Community Chorus (GNHCC) is a non-auditioned, non-professional, volunteer chorus currently entering its 48th year as part of the cultural fabric of New Haven, Connecticut and surrounding towns.  In this chorus, singers of any ability can experience the joy of choral singing.  GNHCC achieves the highest possible level of performance from a non-auditioned chorus while offering an opportunity which is rarely afforded to adults in contemporary American society.  Engaging and instructive rehearsals allow singers with little or no previous musical training to learn and to grow as musicians while the chorus prepares at least two major concerts each year.   Drawing voices from the many towns across the region, the chorus, which currently numbers about 120 voices, embraces the diversity of the community in every sense  age, ethnicity, economic status and musical proficiency.  Living into its mission to contribute to the personal and cultural enrichment of the community, Greater New Haven Community Chorus has developed its own Choral Conducting Assistant Scholarship program, through which an aspiring area university undergraduate student gains rare podium time as a conductor while being mentored by GNHCC's extraordinarily talented Artistic Director.  Reaching out to the community beyond its regular concert season, the chorus also performs free concerts and partners with individuals, organizations and schools to offer workshops and benefit concerts. Greater New Haven Community Chorus is a remarkable treasure because it engages both its audiences and its singers in a way which connects with 'real' people on a visceral level and which makes choral music fun and approachable by everyone.

New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	194346		/users/profile/253947	MaureenSG	Client Served	5	02/15/2014	We had to surrender our 3 year old husky, Cleo when our home was repossessed and we were forced to move into a hostel. Cleo was very loved by our family, he was absolutely beautiful. We'd had him for 2 years and rescued him from an abuse situation... but he was not a friendly dog. He was fearful of people and never really recovered from his abusive treatment. He would lash out without warning even at people sitting down ignoring him, we had to leave a trailing leash on him at all times. He was a lovely dog when he was calm but he could change in an instant. He never managed to bite any of us but he tried, and when we went to see him in the shelter he had gotten even worse and was charging us in his kennel. The only other shelter in the area turned Cleo down and told us to have him put down. But these people gave him a chance, they worked with him for a week but he just couldn't handle the noise and stress of the shelter. We wanted to take him back, but had nowhere to put him, and they couldn't get away with placing a dog like that into someone's home. We went in when they said he was due to be put to sleep and my husband went in with him. They were very gentle and explained plainly why they had to do what they did.  We wish things could've gone better for us and Cleo, but at least when he met his end, he was among caring, friendly people who gave him a chance where others wouldn't.

How could we EVER think about replacing him. or get over him? There could never be another like him..my crying was non-stop.....THEN my husband got up one Saturday morning two weeks after our loss, and went over to our neighborhood animal shelter, three miles away, because he heard that some new dogs came in, one of them a boxer mix...he saw the pup, but when he mentioned we had just lost our beloved pitt mix, the eyes of the shelter workers lit up! "Do we have a dog for YOU!" should have been the caption...! They asked my husband if he would be intereeted in a lovely pitbull who had been there for six months now, who was beautiful and loving and funny...but had  no takers (people so wrongly fear the breed!)...Jay saw Zeus, and that was that! He was PERFECT..so much like our Pokey, but his OWN dog, too!  Jay came home, woke me up, and dragged me and my visiting granddaughter back to the shelter (I had a fear of going to shelters..to me, they are places of desperation and misery and my heart breaks..Pokey was a rescue, but my daughter brought him TO me..I can't go to places like that..they give me nightmares!    Well, was I surprised when I walked into the New Fairfield/Sherman shelter..clean, cheerful and more like a boarding kennel, full of personable and knowledgable people, whom you can tell personally care for and love each animal they shelter...Zeus had been socialized, excercised, TRAINED to do tricks, and was in wonderful physical and mental shape..he had been loved! It was written all over him! True..he was a bit energetic from long hours being penned, but he is trying very hard to please us, and  is WONDERFUl with other dogs at the dog park (they have a pen at the shelter where they allow the dogs to play with each other at times, too..it makes a big difference!) NOBODY can believe he came from a shelter, he is so calm and friendly and well-behaved...some of it is just Zeus being ZEUS, cos he IS a great dog that just needed a chance, but a LOT Of it is the loving care and attention he received at this shelter...I give it an A-PLUS!!  They even gave Zeus his own web page to help publicize his situation, and many times when we walk him around time,strangers will say, "Is that ZEUS? I saw him in the Citizens News!" They really try hard to place their dogs...and care about each and every one of them (OH YEAH..they have a nice room full of kitties, too!)   SO..if you are 'Shelter-Shy" like I am..this is the place for you! It isn't really Animal Control; it's Animal Rescue! Even the Animal Control officer, who must have been the one to pick up the brown stray pitbull roaming New Fairfield at Christmastime, came tosay "goodbye" to Zeus as we took him off to his forever home! A more loving and caring bunch will be hard to find...(I won't name the other shelter I went to this past month, but those poor dogs...don't have a chance. It is never opened when people can get to see the dogs, and the animals look so sad and desperate...barking and crying and jumping in their own poop...not opened weekends when people can go with their families to find a pet to love...they are the ones you see in the commercials. I still have nightmares of that visit and want to go get another one from there..but I haven't gotten up the fortitude to make that trip yet..!)     .PLEASE don't be afraid of this shelter in New Fairfield..it is as pleasant an experience as you can ever possibly have for a situation like this! Even if you don't adopt a pet..make a contribution! They do great things over there! I wish I could post a picture of Zeus hugging Tony, a volunteer shelter worker, before we took him home May 20th...he is the picture of love and happiness...we have a lot to live up to here! LOL! (Not a problem..don't worry! LOL!) LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

We went to several shelters before NFSAWS and were not happy.  At NFSAWS they treat their animals incredibly well.  I was so happy to see all the dogs playing together in a fenced in area at the shelter.  It's great to see the dogs be able to truly run around, play, and most importantly, become well socialized with other dogs.  We got to meet 3 different dogs on the day we first visited NFSAWS; all the dogs, regardless of age, that we met were very well behaved, which made picking just one a difficult choice.  In the end, we got our Muffin who is easily the most fabulous dog we have ever had!  :-)

We had trouble choosing which dog we would be taking home!   All of the dogs were wonderful that we had seen.  They seemed to be very happy there and well taken care of, unlike the other places we looked, which were for the most part well-intentioned, but frightening places.   A week after our first visit, we brought home Muffin.  She truly is the greatest dog ever from the greatest shelter ever.

You could see the connection and love they had for him.  Once we met him, he never left us as we filled out paperwork.  All the dogs were playing in the back of the shelter in a big beautiful yard.  The yard had all different terrains to soot the needs of all the different breeds.  He was able to take home his favorite toy, which turned into his security blanket.  We got a call a few months later checking to see how he was doing.  They seemed extremely please to hear that he adjusted instantly.  They asked to send pictures as they would love to see how he's grown.  Call us crazy, but from time to time we'll ask him where Sherri is and he perks up and his eyes sparkle.  Although we are from MA, we recommend NFSAW to everyone who is looking to adopt.  Defiantly worth the 5 hour drive.  Thanks NFSAW!

So I've had lots of experience with various animal shelters.  A few months after we lost our two senior cats, my husband and I decided we were ready for a new family.  We began searching and were not happy with what we found.  All of the shelters we visited had way too many animals, were dirty, smelled and many of the animals were sick.  Then we went to NFSAWS and it was amazing.  The shelter was clean without that horrible odor.  The animals were in good health and obviously treated well.  Staff and volunteers were very friendly and helpful and loved the animals.  Our oldest son is a vet tech and he was very impressed with NFSAWS.  So much so that he has adopted two of their cats also.  NFSAWS is the was all shelters should be and I highly recommend you visit them to adopt your new family member.

True story:  Jack was in the back seat with my daughter and he inadvertently lowered the window with his paw...then jumped out!!  We were beside ourselves, with cars screeching to a halt and our little (well, actually, our fat) Jack sitting in the middle of the road with traffic stopped all around him.   My daughter was so upset, thinking that he loved the shelter so much that he didn't want to come to his new home.   Seven months later, he won't leave our sides- ever.  He is so wonderful and we can clearly see that his experience with NFSAWS only enhanced his true JR personality.  He was very well cared for there and we are very appreciative.

Our most important criteria was a pooch who would get along with our ornery cat. We inquired about a few dogs from various shelters, but it was hard to get information on whether they were good with cats, and the last thing we wanted to do was bring a dog home only to have to return him. Baker was a little smaller than the dog we pictured ourselves adopting (we were thinking of a huge black mutt), but his photos were sweet, and the video that NFSAW included was adorable. Sherri answered all of my husband's questions promptly and honestly, and we completely trusted her. We drove up to meet Baker on a Saturday, and it was love at first sight. We wanted another week to get ready for him, and Sherri understood and kept him for us, and she also answered my many e-mails asking more questions about what he ate, what he liked to do, etc. When we picked him up the following Saturday he had just had a bath, and we got a folder with all his health information as well as the story from his transfer up from Tennessee and contact information from his "rescue mom." We sent Sherri photos of Baker we took that day, and she seemed genuinely excited and happy to hear from us. Nearly two years later, we still follow the shelter, support it financially when we can, and are so grateful that they took such good care of our dog in the few weeks before we discovered him. Baker had a hard start, but he's the best dog ever, and I know that NFSAW was instrumental in helping him get a fresh start.

Potential adopters are viewed as more than paying customers, and the result is a better outcome for both pet and owner (the thank-you letters, photos, and notes from adopters - sometimes long after the adoption - substantiate this).  We are all fortunate to have such an organization in our community!

I always know my donations will be put to good use.  Over the years I have donated blankets and towels but recently they've begun taking print cartridges through Staples.  What a great idea!  This way people who don't live near by but still want to support them may do so easily.  I will continue to send my cartridges to Staples in their name for as long as they keep up the great work they do!

New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	72325		/users/profile/79077	mcdilucca	Volunteer	5	02/21/2011	I volunteered here when I was in my senior year of high shool with my friend Kellie. We chose NFSAW for our SEE project so we could help animals and raise money for the ones in the shelter. The staff was amazing on helping us with our project, and let us come anytime to fulfill our community service hours. They also introduced us to all the animals and let us play with them. We enjoyed seeing the animals, and doing our bake sale that raised over $200 dollars for the shelter. Wish college wasn't so crazy or we would come and vist again. 
New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	71315		/users/profile/77983	leejam	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2011	I am very appreciative of all that the NFSAW does for the needy animals and our community.  Not only do they help with the welfare of uncared for or lost animals, but they also contribute to their community through other recycling activities for cell phones and computers.  You can find the donation boxes at various places around town in New Fairfield and Sherman.  I am very thankful to the NFSAW, as I know that the volunteers work very hard, dedicating their own personal time for an important cause.  It takes a lot of work to organize and manage the various fundraising and community events required to help the NFAW shelter survive, such as the Holiday Boutique at the Senior Center and the wine tasting event held in Sherman.

The shelter itself is one of the nicest facilities I have ever seen and the staff is wonderful.   I was a little afraid to visit the first time, as I was concerned the cats would be sad and in cages.   Instead, we found a beautiful, light filled room with cats running freely all over.    Much better than living in a stone wall in the cold.  Thanks to all the volunteers that take such good care of the cats and dogs lucky enough to end up there.

They truly have the animals' best interests at heart, which has been evident with every interaction I have had with them over the years, including as a visitor, adoptor and donor.  NSAW is truly a benefit to the community and the unfortunate animals lucky enough to find their way here, making NFSAW very deserving of your support.

They did a through background check on us (as they should!) including calling our vet to make sure that the pets we have currently were up to date on all of their Vaccines.  They allowed us to bring our 2 dogs to meet the new dog before we made our final decision to adopt.  They provided us with his full medical history as well as the frontline and heartworm medicine that he needed.  It was obvious from the start that they really cared deeply about "Kovu" and were dedicated to placing him in a stable, loving home.We are thrilled with the level of commitment that NFSAWS shows to the welfare and well-being of the animals in their care.  We love our new pup and can't thank them enough for helping to bring us all together!

General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	I am friends with Suzanne Poscich Glynn who has told me the most wonderful stories of animal rescue and foster care during her tenure as a volunteer at the NFSAW.  As a Dog and Cat person myself, it makes me really happy to see people like Suzanne, a busy professional during the day preparing our youth for life as a teacher spend her precious spare time to help these beautiful animals that are in need of TLC, a meal, a place to sleep and eventually a permenant home.  It makes me feel guilty that I don't have the time to get involved myself, but seeing the passion in which she brings to our discussions about the animals that have been saved from abuse and abandenment, has had a profound impact on me personally.  The work that Suzanne and the other volunteers do at NFSAW is pure selfless love and kindness. Thanks guys - Monty Nebinger

Of which I have attended many fundraisng events and donated funds, the best I can afford to do.  It is wonderful to see the community rally together to support these orphaned animals.  The most recent event I attended was at the New Fairfield Senior Center where there were art & crafts, baked goods, art by local artists/residents, and many auction items that I spent/donated my money to.  Not to mention the amount of volunteers and the incredible job all the volunteers did.  Unfortunately, it never seems that there are enough funds raised for the NFSAW to address all that's needed to support these orphaned animals & help find them homes.  I certainly hope that the NFSAW is fortunate enough to be the recipient of this very generous grant.  Thank you. John GlynnNew Fairfield, CT 06812

New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	64690		/users/profile/70726	Jessica C.	Client Served	5	02/08/2011	A few years ago we were looking for a buddy for our puppy Sam. He had a lot of energy and needed someone to burn it off with other than us and our every day walks. We looked everywhere until one day we found our Molly formerly known as Socks on the New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Website through PetFinder. Like most dogs she had a sad past, but we knew she was the one. NFSAW was quick to respond, unlike many other organizations. They gave us a complete history, and tips as to how to adopt the dog and introduce it to our Sam to make sure they were a good match. We had to "Interview" with them first to make sure that we were good for her, and I really liked that. It made me feel good to know that all the dogs in their care received excellent treatment, along with excellent and responsible parents. I'll never forget how Molly ran to us like she had known us all her life. It was love at first sight! Thank you NFSAW for saving our angel and bringing her into our lives! We will always be grateful. =)

Not only are all of the board members, employees and volunteers caring, giving and enthusiastic but we all have the same goal and that is to help care for animals and make sure they find their forever homes. It is a true reward to know that every single thing that we do to for the shelter, even if we are just talking about it in conversation, is benefiting animals in need. It humbles me to say that I am a part of this magnificent team of individuals and seeing the way that all the animals are cared for is truly life changing.

New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	64033		/users/profile/70000	gmandy427	General Member of the Public	5	02/06/2011	I have seen the New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society in operation, from the vantage point of public perception and information.  I read about their interesting events in the newspaper (like wine tastings and dinners) and look at the pictures of pets up for adoption, who need a forever home, some with special needs.  That reminds me: years ago, my family fostered pets for the group before they had a shelter.  We ended up adopting a scroungy stray cat that we fostered through kitten-birth.  She ended up being one of the loves of our lives, so happy to have her in our family. I have seen the enthusiastic volunteers outside stores in Sherman and New Fairfield at bake sales, and my mother-in-law waits avidly for their Holiday Boutique to come around.  She is also in their ranks of bakers, assembling tasty treats to tempt humans to buy.  I am always happy when she buys me something there. It tastes better because you're helping animals. This organization has a bright, clean selter, always presentable to the public and serves the public well!   
New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	63924		/users/profile/69882	jlmacbloom	Donor	5	02/06/2011	The New Faifield Sherman Animal Welfare Society is a premier volunteer organization serving our two towns for the greater good.  The Society has exemplary standards for animal rescue, compassionate care and humane education.  The founders were a very few (what would be now called "cutting edge") local folks who saw a need and fulfilled it.  Over the ensuing decades, the several presidents who followed were dedicted to saving pets, with one hundred per cent devotion.   The organization has a history of rising to the occasion, appointing an Advisor Board in the 1980's to raise the money to build an animal shelter facility, which was accomplished by seven years of intense multi-faceted publicity efforts, successful grantswriting and many fundraising efforts such as an annul advertizement Journal and raffles (offering items such as dinners, lunches and breakfasts for two and gorgeous hand made quilts designed by NFSAWS members).  Advisory Board members travelled on many interstate trips to see existing shelters to gather information to create the best possible facility that could be done at that time.  Extensive research was conducted to find and apply for appropriate grants.  The Pet of the Week started at this time, with apperances of dogs and cats in The News Times,the regional newspaper.  The local newspaper, the Citizen News, also cooperated with publicity by printing frequent articles submitted by the Society on interesting topics such as local spay neuter statistics which were compiled from public records, an article about the Humane Society of the United States' Humane Education Center (located  in Connecticut, and the announcement of a national humane eduction award won by a past president. The organization has a unique and much-anticipated annual fundraising boutique, revealing the artistic side of the crafters who work hard all year to fashion Christmas tree decorations and other holiday and pet products The orgainization has a modern flair, joining the internet age for even better communication.  It is a safe, clean, kind, good group for a stray dog or cat to be rescued by. and the group holds the promise of contiuing to rise to the occasion as the future. unfolds

We had never adopted from them before. We fell in love with this little kitten as his picture was posted on Facebook in which our family was able to see. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly, and ushered into the room to spend some time with the kittens. We found Sherri and her staff very open, caring, friendly and really spent the time speaking to us while we were filling our adoptive application out. We also found the shelter to be very clean and organized. The adoption process went smoothly and we were able to pick up our newest family member after he was neutered.

The care with which animals are placed is amazing.  They know their animals well and can create the perfect match to meet the client's lifestyle, family, and living situation.  As a result, I volunteered for many years at the annual holiday craft fair.  While I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews, what sets it apart is the fact that they work tirelessly to educate the public on the humane treatment of animals in a variety of ways - from newspaper articles to working with students and staff in the schools.  As a teacher in the local school district, I engaged in deep discussions with my students around issues such as puppy mills and animal testing.  What better way to change the world than to start with the future pet owners of America?  Knowledge is power...
New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	63678		/users/profile/69619	house	Volunteer	5	02/05/2011	I have volunteered at other Shelters and I find the NFSAW is a wonderful Shelter. Their dedication and going beyond what is reqired for their animals is a daily practice. I feel there is no other shelter more deserving to receive this reward. My only observation of the shelter that I feel needs inprovement is that, they leave the animal alone for 16 hours a day. A lot of times they have puppies, that is too long for them, especially when the employees leave earlier. They need to really look into that situation.Maybe this award can help them hire a part-time evening employee.I really hope they win, they truely are a great Shelter.

The staff and volunteers were incredibly helpful, offered great advice for introducing the newest members of the family into our house, and even called to check in on us a week after the adoption.  This is a caring and dedicated group of people who will really do all they can to find good homes for their boarders.  Our two towns are lucky to have them here!

We were very pleased with how smoothly the process went and how well cared for Jake was.   The shelter was very clean and organized. Jake had his own folder explaining the adoption process as well as all of the necessary vaccinations.  To this day, we use his original folder from NFSAW to store his vet paperwork.  He has been a wonderful addition to our cat family.  I would definitely adopt another kitty from this shelter.   Thanks NFSAW for a great cat!!

We also have a dog named Peanut who was equally saddened by the loss of our cat.  We decided as a family that it would be good for all of us, including Peanut, to add another member to family to help ease the saddness.  We decided on another dog.  After searching many shelters, we landed upon NFSAW.  We found Nix there, a rescued one  year old from a high kill shelter.  We were thrilled to learn that NFSAW rescues dogs from high kill shelters. The entire adoption process with them was easy, yet thorough.  We were able to bring our Peanut by to meet Nix, who we have now named Marley.  We knew he was the perfect match.  After the several shelters I have been to, I was pleased with the process and pleased with how organized and involved they are with each animal.  Marley has been the perfect addition to our home and we couldn't be more pleased!

We brought the dog into our home and called the NFSAW  and they immediately helped us, as the dog's owner had already contacted them to find her dog. Within a few minutes the dog was reunited with his owner. This all transpired at 7:00 a.m. through their emergency contact number. I want to thank all the volunteers that work for NFSAW for their outstanding service to the animals of this community. You made a very lost dog (and the people who love him) very happy !!!!

We moved in 2006 to Oregon. We still support the shelter and all of it's wonderful commitment to animals. They are a wonderful group of people and I really miss working with them.

My family and I were left with heavy hearts and a lack of fresh, slobbery dog kisses.  We soon found that NFSAW had a puppy who was 14 weeks old.  Her name was Skye and I was the first to go and see her.  Well, of course it only took seconds to realize that this was my next dog :)  she was not only beautiful and  spunky like all puppies but she had the personality of my next best friend.  I was then put through the "shelter pat down" to make sure that my family home would be the best place for Skye.  We passed and my whole family met Skye that week.  They had the same feeling as me and the past 2wks have been that of laughter and fun.  We recently had our follow up call from NFSAW and told them how thankful we are and we hope to get some pictures on their face book page soon.  Thank you NFSAW for your time and thought but most of all Skye.   Thanks- Jessica Mancini, Ridgefield, CT

Our Cub and Boy Scouts have enjoyed volunteering with NFSAW to support their fundraising events.  They have taken many of our pet toys and accessories and given them to families in need.  The NFSAW staff has always been very compassionate and helpful in guiding us in our search for pets when we lost a cat or dog.  The animals under their care always seem happy, healthy and clean.  They too are the benefactors of the great work provided by the NFSAW team.

I came with him, and for two years on Saturday morning, he and I cleaned cat cages, folded laundry, washed dishes and played with the cats.  During that time two of the cats ended up finding forever homes with us.  The staff there was very caring, and the animals were well cared for and loved during there stay there.

We asked to see two feral pairs that were in a foster home. After spending time with them we (sorry!) split the pair and took the two liveliest. The other two were very companiable (with each other ) but did a lot of sleeping. Well, 2 years later we're still getting these two (one male, one female) acclimated to indoor living but they really love to race around, cuddle at night --not during the day!--and eat!. Thanks NFSAW
New Fairfield Sherman Animal Welfare Society Incorporated	62101		/users/profile/67884	amgfnyc	Board Member	5	02/01/2011	I started volunteering as a dog socializer at NFSAW shortly after moving to Connecticut in 2004. I quickly saw what a great organization it is, and wanted to become more involved. Fortunately, I was invited to join the Board, so with the help of the other 11 Board Members, I have been able to help guide the organization over the last several years. We have a nearly 100% adoption rate, which is a testament to our great Shelter Manager who is able to promote our pets effectively. We also are able to save a lot of dogs from Tennessee where the euthanasia rate at shelters is very high. We have been lucky in the last few years to receive grants to make some much-needed improvements at the shelter, including new dog kennels and a new sump pump system to stop our incessant flooding in the basement! These grants allow us to use our donors' dollars for direct animal care. NFSAW is a wonderful organization and we hope to continue our success.

I joined when my then 7 year old son was struggling so badly in school that he would physically shake with anxiety, was unable to focus at all in school, was incapable of making friends.  Because of the support I found in this organization, plus the invaluable and practical information it provided to me, my son is now attending a well-respected college and receiving straight A's!  Smart Kids told me he could get there and without their support, I am not sure he would.  Thank you Smart Kids!

I joined Smart Kids as a volunteer over 7 years ago when I thought my world was ending and my child was failing, and this organization buoyed me, supported me, educated me, and helped me to give my child the assistance he needed to be successful.  Smart Kids is a community of parents willing to lend a shoulder or a hand, with tons of information on the website, newsletter, and through local programs to motivate parents to push schools to get support.  Most importantly, it helps parents to believe in their children, which is the key factor to a child's success.   My son is achieving A's and B's in High School, and I am sure its because Smart Kids helped me around the hurdles that were preventing his success.

I really thought no other child has his issues...what's wrong with my son.  But here in black and white this newsletter was talking about the same issues my son struggled with.  Each month when I got the newsletter in the mail I would drop what I was  doing and read it front to back.  It was a life saving resource and I do mean this  literally!  It changed my entire outlook and armed me with so many valuable resources.  I can't say enough about them.  Joanna Kline (son Jesse Kline was the 2007 Smart Kid Award Winner).

I read it every time I get them and I share the information with my family and teachers.  I have a son who has multiple learning disabilities and was diagnosed of ADHD at the age of 4.  Since he started elementary school, he was also diagnosed with emotional disability, speech/language delay, sensory disability, and executive functioning disability.   When I first learned about my sons diagnosis of ADHD, it was very overwhelming.  I had no idea the magnitude of how ADHD and other learning disabilities can affect ones life.  I imagined that no matter how much I read about it and talked to teachers and parents who have gone through the same challenges, that there would be an easy fix.  My son is now 7 years old and we are still continuing to see these challenges.  Its a lot better now than where we first started.  Thanks to the support of Smart kids, family and friends, and teachers in our community.  Smart kids has been a huge impact on my life as I read the newsletters and visit the website often searching for answers and clarification.  The information on the website is empowering and gives me hope that my son can excel in school and in life with his multiple disabilities.  Im not alone in this journey. Im just one of many parents who have daily challenges.  The website is a wonderful, smart, genius non-profit hub that I will continue to support as new information is always presented from a professional, educational, clinical, and research background that I respect. I have taken so many notes from Smart kids and I appreciate very much what a great job you are all doing.

Client Served	5	06/27/2013	As the parent of 3 children, 2 with LD, I cannot adequately express my gratitude and admiration for SKLD & Jane Ross. When my son entered public schools we knew he would be needing more than the typical child. The schools only refused to acknowledge that any problems existed & patronize the overprotective parents.  After butting heads with the school system for 3 years and reading everything I could find on the Internet, I finally found Smart Kids.With SKLD I found support, resources and education. Their only private agenda is to help each child achieve their potential. They help families acquire the information necessary to make educated decisions  that are best for their child's needs. I cannot imagine what the outcome would have been without SKLD but I'm pretty sure it would not have included college and the happy, self assured, creative young man that my son has become.Because of my involvement with Jane & Smart Kids I am confident that I now have the tools I need to see my young twice gifted daughter through what is sure to be an amazing journey rather than the stressful experience it might have been with out the experiences I have had with Smart Kids with LD over the past 12 years.THANK YOU JANE & SMART KIDS!!!

Winning this award was a great boost to my son, who despite his learning disabilities managed to graduate from high school a year early. The award served as an incredible validation that he was capable of great things and that he did not have to be defined by his learning disabilities, a message which he had definitely NOT received from all the usual public school academic outlets.

Being a film/video major my son collaborated with his roommate, also a film/video major, to submit his retrospective.

Our school district initially did a short evaluation, and placed him 6-1-1 classroom, of which we disagreed.I read all the information from the Foundation, and sent Sammy's IEP for their experts suggestions.   We challenged the school district placement with the feedback from the Foundation, as well as many of their publications.Sammy is now in a regular Kindergarten class, with a personal aide, in a charter school.  Although it has only been a few weeks, Sammy is doing well and wakes up every day ready to go to school.Thanks to the support and information from the CDLS Foundation, we were able to advocate and give Sammy an opportunity to achieve his potential.

We were in the middle of the grieving process (yes grieving) that you have after your child is born differently abled, when I finally felt able to call the number given to us by our Dr.  The voice of the woman who answered the phone was compassionate, kind, and confident.

We reached out to the foundation once we got the diagnosis and was immediately welcomed.  We received a wealth of information that we were able to pass along to my son's physicians.  We were also put in contact with doctors though the foundation that were able to help guide his treatment while hospitalized.  They are always available to answer questions that come up as our son gets older and faces new challenges.   Without their care and support, we would not be able to say our family is thriving.

At that time there the research was in it's infancy. There was no identified gene and no known testing or screening.   We utilized the CdLS foundation as a resource to manage symptoms and to provide some support in knowing that we were not alone.

CdLS is very rare, so rare that very few doctors, seemingly, have even HEARD of it, and misdiagnoses are way too frequent.  Failure to thrive, our granddaughter was labeled, in a massive medical shrug.   WORD NEEDS TO GET OUT about these rare disorders, so people don't have to struggle to deal with the unknown.  Once we found a doctor who had a clue, and got a diagnosis, and we knew what to research, we found the Foundation, and their help cannot be overstated.  They operate as clearinghouse for crucial info, organizers of support gatherings, encourage the research of specialists in the field, and coordinate outreach groups so some of the estimated 20,000 as yet undiagnosed CdLS folks can be helped, too.   We know where to turn! CdLS Foundation!!!!

The foundation was an amazing help to us during that time and since then to be honest.   For a time, after she was first diagnosed,  I was the Awareness Coordinator for WA.  Between that and just being a parent I was able to get so much information and help in dealing with her, her doctors, the early intervention programs and more.  They hooked me up with other parents in the area and I was became a part of a email group that was a huge help with issues and problems specifically related to the syndrome.  I live in a small town and we don't have any kids with this here as well as when you tell people they are really surprised.

I was immediately connected with local families, they helped ease my fears of what doctors were saying about my son, and within days had a huge welcome packet delivered to my house. The services they provide families free of charge is beyond expectations. Any time the doctors are stumped, they get in touch with CdLS experts and always help answer our questions. The conferences & gatherings they hold to meet with experts & other families is amazing and so helpful being able to connect with other families of this rare syndrome. With their help, it is much easier to realize the blessing these children are in our lives instead of spending all of our time trying to figure out everything on our own. Our lives would truly not be the same without the amazing CdLS Foundation.

Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	164299		/users/profile/218343	Lynnette M.	Client Served	5	08/06/2013	23 years ago my life was turned upside down when my firstborn child was diagnosed with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. I was shown an outdated photo and given inaccurate information about his life expectancy and condition.  Without a computer, or internet in those days, my only source of information would come from a phone number given to me by the genetics counselor who thought "it might help".  That number was to the CdLS Foundation.  My son was just days old, but that number gave me access to a lifeline of hope.  That day, my lifeline came in the form of a sympathetic ear, accurate information, and written materials.  Over the years it has included consults with medical staff, support from  professional staff, attendance at family gatherings and conferences, and a wealth of information and discoveries.  I have met so many wonderful families who share this journey.  The Foundation's dedicated staff have enabled the organization to grow in leaps and bounds and continues its mission to support families in every way possible.

One of my first calls was to the CdLS Foundation. Within hours they sent information about CdLS, put a packet of follow-up information in the mail (which we received 2 days later), connected us with another CdLS family living in CO and talked us through how to jump into this new world we were suddenly a part of. While the diagnosis was tough to hear,  we wanted to quickly learn as much as possible to get our son the services and support he needs to live his best life. The CdLS Foundation gave us a jump start and also invited us into the family with open arms. We've been grateful for their help! Our son is an amazing little guy and is making HUGE progress with his new therapies. And we are looking forward to going to the West Region Family Gathering this September to meet other CdLS families. Thank you CdLS Foundation!!

Unlike other conditions, CdLS has only one source of accurate information and support in the entire country. It was the first call we made. There wasn't a voicemail to leave a name and number, it was a person.. Answering the phone.. After one phone call, our world stopped spinning out of control.   We had hope, understanding, support and a true feeling that we were not alone. The entire staff remembers your family. They invest their heart not just their time. They support the entire family, not just my grandson.  No matter what we are facing, we know whenever we need advice, they are there for us.  They truly foster an environment of community and family. The CdLS Foundation walks our journey with us, every step of the way. We would be far less educated and alone, but because of the dedicated staff at the CdLS Foundation, we are armed with all the latest information, and someone to guide us..

They have been our lifeline through the darkest days and helped us through so many challenging times.  They are professional but warm and caring.  They continue to actively research all aspects of the syndrome so that families can make informed decisions for their loved ones.

This past summer we attended our first CdLS conference hosted by the Foundation. Whatever hesitancy we felt melted away within the first few moments of stepping inside the door. Whether it was meeting other CdLS families, speaking with physicians or therapists, or simply watching our daughter interact with her new friends, we could not have felt more embraced or at home.  The staff and professionals associated with the CdLS Foundation are an amazing and inspiring group truly dedicated to championing for families.

I talked at length with the folks from the foundation.  They hooked us up with a national expert who then spoke directly with David's local doctor.    The foundation is a central place of up to date information, support, and connections.   More recently when my son went into the ER, the resident physician stated that he didn't know that much about CdLS and he wanted to look it up before he decided on any more treatment.   Because of the foundation he came back to say that even though it looked like a behavioral episode, a complete medical work up was indicated because behaviors are the result of underlying medical conditions.     David  had a medical problem which required surgery that night.  The foundation is very responsive to people's concerns, and questions.

I was overwhelmed with emotions.  Because my daughter was diagnosed at birth, I was still in the hospital recovering from a C-section. My family members were able to access the CdLS Foudation's website and print off a great amount of information for me to read. Things that I would have wanted to do if I had access to the internet.  It took me a few weeks to bring myself to call the CdLS Foundation, but it was one of the best phone calls I have ever made. The sense of relief and belonging after that phone call was overwhelming.  I believe that they are fantastic, so much so that every year our family hosts a fundraiser for the CdLS Foundation to give back to an organization that has helped our family so much.

I was shocked and devastated with the diagnosis. A nurse had given me a card with the CdLS Foundation's telephone number. I screwed up all the courage I had and made the call.  The telephone was answered, and L. listened to me cry. I don't know how long she stayed on the telephone with me, but it was awhile. When I hung up that phone, I had a promise of literature and the telephone number of a local family to contact. Within days, I had brochures, handouts, and copies of Reaching Out, plus a family album that showed me I wasn't alone ~ we weren't alone! There were other families ~ successful families ~ like ours. Over the years, some of the best resources and friends of my life are contacts that I have made as a result of that initial telephone call. I can't imagine what would have happened if the CdLS Foundation didn't exist.

Unfortunately my current situation is one over very little income.  Red started rubbing his ears, so I looked and by my untrained eye I could tell he had a pretty bad ear infection that was causing him pain. I started to panic.... I called several vets to see if they would work with me on the costs, or accept payments. No luck.  I happened across Starelief while scouring the internet.

God bless the great folks behind the veil at STARelief org. and the generosity of all who donate to this great program. Special thanks to the board for their compassion and expertise in recognizing when a familys plea is dire and genuine.I am a disabled veteran and my pension was terminated leaving me with only 133 monthly income. I have a family of five that includes myself, wife, son, 5 yo Eskie "Levi", and cat. With limited income i was unable to provide flea treatment for my pets and as it turned out Levi eveloped a severe reaction from fleabites and began knawing at his back pulling hair out in clumps. His situation was extreme so I had to act fast. I went online first to diagnose >        flea dermtitus - allergic reaction to flea saliva.Next I tried to find home remedies that would help at all with some good success.     I was able to make his head gear to prevent anymore self  mutilation and creation of any more open sores.I found that Benedryl would help relieve some itching and i could use the extra betadine from my surgery to clean and disinfect his wounds until healed enough to clean with baby shampoo.He was now infested w fleas and his sores looked infected. So again i go online and find our pets saving grace. . . STARelief org! Without Starelief our "Levi" would still be suffering without the proper medical attention that provided relief from the pain and discomfort of his condition.Also  equally important is the HUGE sigh of relief felt when our feelings of anxiety and helplessness  were lifted just by knowing your pet will be comfortable and healthy again!> Thanks!!

I am writing to say thank you for giving me such a great life.  I hear my new mom and dad talking all the time about how much they love me and how amazing their life is now that I am a part of it.  They are the best!  I go for long walks every day (sometimes 2 miles, usually 4 miles), I get to go to work with my mom every day, dad plays with me when we get home, they take me to the dog park on the weekends so I can play with my friends and be a dog.  Mom tells everyone I am really good at my job as a therapist, that I make everyone smile that comes to see us.  Everyone talks about how gentle and smart I am and well trained I am.  I guess so, all I know is that mom tells me what she wants me to do, I do it, then I get a belly rub or a treat.  Pretty sweet deal for me if you want to know the truth!  Anyway, I got to thinking that none of this would have happened for me if it hadn't been for you guys, so thank you.  Doesn't seem like enough, but I really mean it.  We wanted to help out more, maybe give another dog like me the chance I had, so mom put a check in the mail for you today (I helped her mail it!).  Mom is sending some pictures of me at work.  It looks like I lay around a lot, but mom says it's gotta be exhausting for me to be so darn cute that she doesn't blame me one bit.  (Like I said, pretty sweet deal!)I hope you guys are around a LONG time and are able to help a lot more dogs (and people too).  Mom says you guys made her world more beautiful when you gave me to her.  I'm thinking you changed my world for the better to be sure!  Thanks again!

STARelief and Pet Assistance	304544	2	/users/profile/395727	catmandude	Donor	1	09/14/2016	As you may be aware, many websites contain fake reviews made by either members of the organization seeking funds, paid 'reviewers' and/or their friends, family members, etc. Based upon my recent, ABSOLUTELY AWFUL, first-hand experiences with STARelief and its  executive director, Heather (detailed below), ONE MUST SERIOUSLY QUESTION THE VALIDITY OF ANY/ALL POSITIVE REVIEWS re: STARelief on this and/or any/all other websites. In lieu of any available NEGATIVE star ratings (-5 stars wouldn't be a low enough review for STARelief), I give STARelief THE LOWEST POSSIBLE REVIEW AVAILABLE. IN SUMMATION:  PLEASE donate your funds to a verifiable, REPUTABLE organization (i.e. NOT STARelief). My experiences are detailed below re: the absolute hell that I was forced to experience over the course of the past +/- 2 weeks in my failed efforts to obtain ANY assistance - let alone TIMELY help from STARelief. As a DIRECT result of across-the-board failures and COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE delays by STARelief and executive director, Heather, my beloved 4-years-young cat, Joey, suffered immeasurably and unnecessarily - then had to be euthanized - FAR too prematurely. If that wasn't bad enough:  Never receiving payment confirmation to the vet clinic of the paltry, belated, $100 ALLEGED grant, I emailed STARelief 12 days after being approved for the ALLEGED grant - simply requesting email confirmation of payment to the vet clinic.  Instead of providing the reasonably requested confirmation - again: 12 DAYS AFTER THE FACT, Heather withdrew her NON-EXISTENT grant, knowing full-well that STARelief WOULD thereby STIFF my ELDERLY (86 & 90 YEAR-OLD) PARENTS out of reimbursement for any of the $266.95 that they were FORCED to place on their credit card - as a DIRECT result of Heather's COMPLETE and UTTER FAILURE to 'step up to the plate' in a TIMELY manner - or, more accurately: AT ALL.  Rather than utilizing any LEGITIMATE criteria - i.e. for no VALID reason, Heather's decision was based upon her ornery disposition and clearly biased attitude - which was quite evident throughout the entire hellish, grueling, time-wasting and ultimately fruitless application process.  Prior to her decision to retract her paltry $100 grant (that, as it turned out, never existed in the first place), it was CLEARLY explained to Heather (via the email grant payment request confirmation) that my elderly parents are on extremely limited fixed income AND that my 90 year-old Dad is suffering from dementia - which will soon require substantial eldercare costs.  Made no difference, whatsoever, to Heather - as she continued her pattern of sheer callousness by first, retracting the paltry, ALLEGED grant - in a most-condescending and patronizing manner, no less - then abruptly told me (via the same email) to never contact her again. Does it GET any better? It goes without saying that no human being should EVER treat ANY others in such a manner - whether or not under the guise of 'volunteer'.  There's simply no rationale - and NO EXCUSE - for such behavior. As such, I STRONGLY advise that any and all who may consider donating to this - at best: poorly run (dis-)organization, or at worst: complete sham and/or scam to RUN - not walk away - and FAST. Your (and my future) donation(s) will be FAR better utilized in most ANY organization OTHER than this disgracefully botched operation.  And if there's any justice in this world, it will come in the form of ZERO additional donations to this despicable (dis-)organization - as well as a full-scale investigation + shut-down of its sham operation by the state attorney general's office. An appropriate prison term hopefully awaits, as well. How Heather can even GLANCE at her own reflection and/or sleep at night is beyond comprehension.  For your reference, below is the copied, pasted and edited email sent 9/14/16 to STARelief executive director, Heather - which speaks for itself: ************************************************************************* After this email, I wont bother you again  as my next email will be via formal complaint to the CT State Attorney Generals office (copied on this email) re: the absolute SHAM / SCAM OPERATION that youre running in Stamford. Id refer to STARelief as an utter joke  but it would be far too complimentary and theres NO humor in taking advantage of ANYONE  let alone those in legitimate need. Additionally, I will post online reviews and comments reflective of my DISGRACEFULLY POOR experiences with you and STARelief  on every available ratings website  including all non-profit review sites - ensuring that NO ONE else receives such despicably callous, un-empathetic, unsympathetic treatment by you as did I.  Unlike you and/or the dis-organization that you claim to run  Ill be 100% transparent:  You never had ANY intention of helping me  PERIOD... Instead, you took every opportunity to deny my VERY REASONABLE  AND approvable application for financial aid. As admitted by your webmaster, Andy, your online application is rife with tech (AND procedural) issues. As youre well-aware, the tech issues wiped out my entire first application  on which I worked for several hours (for ALLEGED EMERGENCY care  no less). In addition  as mentioned, you require documents that in many cases (such as mine) do not exist  AND you require estimates for vet care.  While I fully understand the need to qualify and quantify applications on the basis of financial need, NO ONE should be denied simply because he/she doesnt collect unemployment, food stamps, etc.  thats absolutely absurd. There are other ways to prove that a need exists  however, your website remains shortsighted in its requests for information that may not exist. And worse  it doesnt provide the applicant any alternate means to provide such information. I offered to provide you with legitimate, alternative proof of my hardship  yet you failed to take me up on my offer. You then asked me if I would consider driving to Stamford to visit your discount vet  then pulled the plug on me for simply  and reasonably - asking to check online reviews for your vet (after just being horrified while reading reviews of my 2 most recent vets  as I LONG-awaited your follow-up). First of all  note to (your)self  and this just in... (as if you didnt already know): vets are neither car dealer service shops nor home improvement contractors. As such, vets dont provide estimates  especially for emergency pet care. Get real. Secondly  your definition of emergency is more than a tad off.  How can you claim to offer financial aid for emergency pet care (for emergency medical treatment for my bleeding and dying cat, Joey  the circumstances of which you were well-aware at that point), then: A) require that your ungodly, longwinded application process be completed PRIOR to one even receiving ANY (ALLEGED) consideration for EMERGENCY assistance, then... B) make me wait several HOURS to speak with your webmaster, then... C) require that I re-apply to even be considered, then... D) unfairly deny approval due to documents that dont exist, then... E) ask if Ill consider your discount vet, then... F) make me wait OVERNIGHT  AS MY BELOVED CAT, JOEY LAYS SUFFERING, then...  G) unfairly deny approval AGAIN  claiming that it wasnt an emergency because I checked online for vets who handle emergencies  and their reviews  ALL WHILE AWAITING YOUR REPLY, then... H) you disappear off the face of the map (AND fail to return the detailed voicemail that I left on your cell phone), then... I) make me wait several MORE HOURS  AS MY BELOVED CAT, JOEY LAYS SUFFERING, then...  J) spinelessly  in your stead (or  more accurately: as you hide under your desk) you have Amy email approval of a (very lame), ALLEGED $100 grant (coupled with the threat that if I didnt accept by days end, shed (ALLEGEDLY) give it to someone else, then... K) after I email Amy (well-before the days end) with my acceptance of said (lame) offer, the ALLEGED grant $ is NEVER sent to [the vet], then... L) only after I email you to request confirmation that the grant was paid to [the vet], as promised, (shockingly!) you reply with a withdrawal of your ALLEGED grant  12 DAYS AFTER THE FACT? Instead of doing the right thing (including returning the voicemail left on your cell phone), you cowardly had Amy CLAIM that you were on vacation. Did your cell phone voicemail go on vacation, too? Do you make a habit of offering such ALLEGED emergency pet care aid  stalling the process long enough so that the affected  and beloved  pet suffers needlessly to near-death (especially when youre well-aware of the circumstances)  unfairly deny the approval (not once  but twice)  then go on vacation without notifying the applicant  mid-process  as the pet is, by then, near death? As Lincoln stated: You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time, but you cant fool all of the people all of the time.

STARelief and Pet Assistance	303969	2	/users/profile/395124	Barbara265	Donor	5	09/13/2016	I was a volunteer on a project with a family that was housing multiple cats with litters in a run down home that eventually got condemned. Someone suggested I reach out to Starelief to get some assistance for the kittens. After assessing the situation, Starelief not only helped with the kitten litters but worked with their vet to get the Mom's neutered & also provided much needed medical assistance for some of the other cats. They also helped with food and cat litter since the family was in obvious need.  It's been a few years since our first introduction and all of the cats have been relocated with their help (either tangible or simply being pointed in the right direction).

As we were struggling with her expensive surgery bills, STARelief helped us with some of the costs.  To give back for their assistance, I have a minimal amount deducted from my checking account each month.  A small amount does add up over time and can greatly assist STARelief to help other animals and their families.Marjorie SwartsClient Served and Current Donor

Everyone is completely dedicated to keeping pets happy, healthy and home!  Also important is that everyone in the group truly likes working together and everyone pitches in to help each other.  Great group with a great mission!
STARelief and Pet Assistance	161136	2	/users/profile/213655	moocow	Volunteer	5	06/21/2013	I have worked with or donated to several organizations over the past few years and STARelief & Pet Assistance has proven to be one of the best.  A group of dedicated volunteers give their time and energy to helping people keep their beloved pets healthy, happy and home rather than surrendering them to shelters (or worse, euthanasia) due to lack funds.  STAR's mission helps alleviate the burden of overcrowding in shelters and is an important one, especially since many of the pets they help are elderly and would likely have trouble getting adjusting to shelter life.  STAR is small but they do a tremendous amount of great work for the size and funding of the group.

I also volunteer at our local animal shelter and the number one reason pets are surrendered to the shelter is because pet caretakers can no longer afford to feed or provide medical care for the beloved pets.  Stamford Animal Rescue has been able to help pets and the people who love them by providing food, shelter and medical care that is needed. 
STARelief and Pet Assistance	280925	1	/users/profile/370922	avahsmom13	Client Served	1	02/25/2016	I am absolutely 100 percent grateful for the help i have gotten for my 6 (now 4) cats i have chosen to bring inside from outside where i found them. I had two females, 4 males, and a ton of kittens were being cranked out. I just couldn't afford the vet bills for the spay/neuters, and i was going through a rough time because i had just gone back to school, raising 3 kids and 6 cats on loans, so i got help with feeding my kitty's as well. Again, don't get me wrong, i appreciate the help. What i do not appreciate is the insanity i have encountered with the woman who came out to help with the cats. I will not name names, but someone came out to transport the cats to and from and to drop off food.  At first everything was great, she said i could get all the cats fixed etc... When she brought one female, and two males to the vet one day, she came back with one. Apparently, the female was pregnant and she gave permission for her to be boarded at the vet, without even asking the owner first. (Me...) One of the males was given away for adoption, and this was afger she asked if i would consider it, and i answered with : "sure, i'll CONSIDER it." I wrote her many emails about the fact that we want that cat back, that i discussed it wit my kids and we want him back, but to no avail. The cat that was boarded? I asked repeatedly when i can get her back, when can we visit....all answered with vague "soon, or when the babies are born..." after a while i just waited, waited for her or the vet to tell me when i can get her. Then, i find an email in my box saying i have abandoned her and her babies and to not accrue any more charges in boarding at the vet (which i never even granted permission to have done!) she and the babies have been give up for adoption. I am LIVID. and sad. She is my pet. I love that cat, my kids love her, and this nonprofit has just swept her away...why? Could it be i was being judged the entire time by this woman who drives a really nice car and lives in a really nice house and had to come to the side of Stamford that no one likes to visit to see me? to help me? who told me point blank that 6 cats are too many? I think so. But it doesn't matter. What matters is this woman stole my cat. I had been in contact with the vet, i had been visiting her just days before i got that email, and i'm told i have abandoned her? And seriously, how do i hold her accountable???I can't figure out who is in charge of the place. Just be careful. Get the help u need but don't believe anything these people say.

Gypsy was unfortunately diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time, and a newly formed tumor of melanoma. I wasn't sure how I was going to try and pay for more vet bills, but between STARelief and an anonymous donor I was able to get my baby dog back into good health. From the start to end of applying for a grant with this organization I was completely calm, and offered assistance and sympathy when I needed it the most. This is a wonderful thing that is hard to come by these days. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your help with gypsy's surgery. She is fully recovered as of today, stitches are out, and she is completely cancer free now. I hope STARelief is around for a long time, as well as the staff.

I have worked in the veterinary field for 30 years.  I am a veterinary hospital manager.  I have often run into clients that want to do what is best for their pet but are unable to cover the entire cost of their care.  This week a young couple with a toddler came in with an injured beloved kitty.  A fractured arm was more than they could afford right now, the father was losing work hours soon.  They responsibly discussed their financial situation before coming in and at every point of their pet's visit.  When I was able to call STARelief and get a donation for them it gave Teddy a shot at life. They committed to the other half of his care and now Teddy is home in recovery.  STARelief is thorough, prompt, caring and responsible.  It gave me an opportunity to save a kitty's life and make a family happy.  THANK YOU STARELIEF!

STARelief and Pet Assistance	198986	1	/users/profile/259816	AlexisKostich	Client Served	5	04/25/2014	I recently had a medical emergency with my Shar-Pei, Sasha. She had a tooth broken in an attack by a deer and it eventually became infected and needed extraction, but every vet I spoke with quoted me a price impossible to pay - starting at $800 for a simple extraction up to $3,000 for a root canal. I was devastated at the thought of watching her suffer because of lack of money and began looking for help. There are many veterinary assistance organizations but most merely help you set up and manage your own online fundraiser. What we needed was a program with emergency funds available immediately for Sasha's painful tooth. From the first contact onward STARelief handled my problem with the greatest care and professionalism. They were courteous, immediately responsive by phone and email, and expedited my application for funds during a holiday weekend. They contacted my vet to verify the estimate and even notified me of my award on a holiday date itself. These volunteers went the extra mile to help a suffering dog, and without them I honestly don't know what we would have done. The very next day Sasha was scheduled for surgery and the broken, painful tooth was successfully extracted. It was even worse than originally thought - splintered deep below the gumline - and a root canal would have been out of the question. Even the extraction was complex. Sasha was sent home finally comfortable and pain-free with a neatly stitched gum over a missing canine tooth site. Her eating or chewing would not be affected at all. The difference in her behavior was immediate - she was wagging her tail, happy and full of energy again. She must have been completely miserable from the tooth. I can't thank or praise STARelief highly enough for the wonderful resolution, service, and emergency award they provided Sasha - and over a holiday weekend to boot. Thank you for all you do, STARelief!

STARelief and Pet Assistance	161069	1	/users/profile/213561	Rocky C.	Volunteer	5	06/20/2013	What attracted me to STAR is its mission: keeping pets happy, healthy and HOME. There are so many wonderful organizations devoted to helping homeless pets find forever homes and that is also a wonderful purpose. But the unique aspect of STAR is that people who are facing financial or personal trouble are often put in the terrible position of giving up their pets who, let's face it, are family members, because they simply lack the resources to keep them at home. What is a more worthy purpose than helping someone already facing difficult financial circumstances than to keep their beloved companions by their side? The dedication of the STAR volunteers is also very impressive. I am very happy that I have had the opportunity to meet the organizers and other volunteers and give back to our community through these efforts.

STARelief and Pet Assistance	150475	3	/users/profile/200655	luis.a.espinal	Client Served	5	03/04/2013	This review is in direct response to the change in my life that STAR (Stamford Animal Rescue) has been able to provide in my personal life. I reside in my home alongside my younger brother who has Moderate-Severe Autism and Neurological disorders. Throught his childhood, my brother has led a somewhat difficult life with the inability to interact well with others his age and lacked the social ability to reach out to any individual in his life! This changed two years ago in a drastic manner! A family friend of ours was the owner of three beautiful kitties! One was Blade, the other Princess, and the third, in particular, was especially attached to my brother, his name is TUX!  Tux is a long-haired, black/white tuxedo Manx kitty! He does not have a tail. This  fascinated my little brother to the extreme!! He was so intrigued by how soft and fluffy appeared, and most of all he was intrigued by his lack of a tail, which is a genetic trait of his breed. Tux was immediately attached to my brother. Our family friend decided that Tux would be better off in my home alongside my brother. It was settled, Tux moved in with cat carrier and litter box. He decided to make my brother's room, his own. Unfortunately, until this point in my life, I have had numerous expenses that were out of pocked, therefore, caring for Tux was somewhat of a burden! After a year I found out about STAR and through their Pet Food Pantry, I realized that Tux will not be a burden on our family. The kitty food and litter provided to us by STAR has truly allowed me to comfortably keep Tux in our family, because I honestly can not see a life without him in our household.

We were in incredible distress over the health of our beloved dog. We spent every penny we had on his care and had to make the awful decision to cut his care short due due to finances and brought him home against doctors orders. We were searching for help and found the Stamford Animal Rescue's link on the Humane Society's website. We wrote an email describing our situation and we got an almost immediate response. The compassion that we felt from someone we didn't yet know was just astounding. Our dog is receiving excellent care and is well on his way to a full recovery. We are eternally grateful to the Stamford Animal Rescue - they are true angels!

I contacted Stamford Animal Rescue to ask for help.  Thanks to Heather and the wonderful people there, Feona was able to be seen immediately.  Unfortunately, it was cancer and was too advanced for treatment.  I was only able to find this out and decide on a course of action because of the generosity of the people at STAR.  Since finding out Feona and I have had 2 months of quality time together.  We were able to get pain medicine too.  They felt like a friend at one of the worst times of my life.  Thank you to everyone there....I wish there were more people like this in the world.  It would be a better place.   Sincerely, Staci

I have two full grown cats, a juvenile kitten and a stray outside whom I feed.  As you know kittens can eat you out of house and home and my two older cats (a voluptuous 13.5 lbs and a muscular mush 16 lbs) can eat and eat and eat.  All my cats and stray are rescues.  I can't see my life without them.  When I approached STAR, I was hesitant,  embarrassed that I needed help and grateful.  When I entered the facility, the people were warm, giving and respectful.  The food is greatly appreciated and needed.  Thank goodness for people like STAR who can have us live with our precious furry family and give them the food they need with respect.  Three cheers and a 5/5 star rating for STAR!!!

They helped my 2 dogs get the vet care and updated shots they needed last month. I was looking for some help to get the needed visit for them  couldn't afford the high vet costs of taking both dogs in. Sickness struck our house last year so we really appreciated the help from STAR.

STARelief and Pet Assistance	141630	1	/users/profile/188000	Jco221	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	I am so proud to be part of this organization.  Animal abandonment is a REAL problem in this country and it leads to overcrowding at shelters and to senseless killing of otherwise healthy animals. STAR's mission is to end animal abandonment.   They work with many local rescue organizations and shelters. It is a joint effort. It can be done.   Everywhere you look, you read something about animal adoption, people rescuing animals at high kill shelters, and people giving animals a loving home. It is amazing. Unfortunately, there are a lot of horrible stories too, BUT the word is getting out there - we are their VOICE and we need to do as much as we can to give them the love they give us so easily.   I am so, so impressed of what STAR has accomplished already, in just less than a year of operations. I know with the public support, this organization will continue to do GREAT things for our pets.

I've met Heather, STAR's founder, on more than one occasion and can vouch for her dedication.  Even though I did not get my rescue pooch from STAR (they're a newer organization), I recently attended a fund-raiser for them. There can never be too many organizations caring for animals in need of human kindness.  STAR is a genuine star in the galaxy of animal rescue organizations.

They go above and beyond their call of duty helping those in need on so many levels. Whether it be a senior citizen who can't feed her faithful canine companion because she had to choose between getting the medication she needs or feed her beloved dog, or the young mother struggling to make ends meet after being laid off. STAR is their to provide food for their precious pet if needed through their food pantry, making sure that animal gets to the Vet to get the medical attention it needs, it could be sending out a professional dog trainer like myself  to help the family struggling with behavior problems with their favorite canine they can't bare to give up....the list goes on and on. STAR IS THERE TO HELP. They work hard to keep that furry companion in its home as well as striving hard to help that homeless animal find a loving home. They are truly a gift and an asset to the community by touching so  many lives both human and animals. Please spread the word about this amazing organization!

This helps pet owners to be able to keep their pets, even if they are having difficult financial times.  Through attending their events and having my son volunteer with them, I have been able to see that they are well-run by truly caring people.

We just adopted a 10 year old beagle who was found wandering the streets in extreme need of dental care.  He was rescued, but if his owners had known about the work STAR does perhaps they would not have abandoned him.  Providing the ability for people to keep their pets is so very important, more people need to know there is a place to turn.  I hope to be able to do more to help STAR raise funds and awareness in the future.

Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	281426		/users/profile/371474	Writer	Client Served	5	03/02/2016	Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue is a huge resource to Chinchilla owners, I wish I had found the website years ago.   The owner Andrea is a wonderful, compassionate person with a huge heart and love for Chinchillas, she is a wealth of knowledge on an exotic animal that even to this day there is not much out there that is correct for properly caring for a Chinchilla.   I fortunately found her rescue while searching the internet in December 2015 trying to find information on caring for a sick Chinchilla since my 9 year old male Chinchilla Chinchee Clover had a chronic ear infection that I was treating under the care of a Vet and he had stopped eating.    She responded promptly to my phone call and was of immense help with tons of advice.   Due to the ear infection Chinchee developed two abscesses near the ear that I had to have lanced by my Vet.  I medicated him with antibiotics and pain meds and hand fed him daily for over 2 months with progress, he started eating on his own again and acting more himself, running in his Chin Spin wheel, begging for attention, etc....  But sadly the infection was just too deep in his ear canal to be cured, and the abscesses kept growing.  He took a turn for the worse on February 25th and I didn't feel it right to continue treating him, he was suffering and I just could not allow that any longer,  so I had him put to sleep on February 26th.  Andrea spent hours on the phone with me over the  last couple of months, she was my light when everything was so dark.  She gave me hope and actually gave me more time with my beloved Chinchee.   She was quick to ship me items I ordered from her store, I just can't say enough good things about Andrea.    Thank you Andrea, may God bless you and your rescue.   Sherri in Virginia
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	275363		/users/profile/364967	Writer	Client Served	5	01/01/2016	Hello my name is Bryan C. I am a first time chinchilla parent and my little girls name is Miss Chinchi. I consider myself an animal lover and I have had many furry companions throughout my life. Even with the experience I had with the many different species I didn't know a thing about Chinchillas. I actually helped my sister and brother in law obtain Miss Chinchi, she made Christmas of 2012 very special. My brother In law is a Marine and with that job comes A LOT of moving around. My sister and I lived together for a year and during that time Ms Chinchi and myself fell in love. Due to my sisters lifestyle we decided it would be best for Miss Chinchi to stay with me and she has been my most special friend ever since. So with no knowledge on Chinchillas I knew I had to learn everything I could to make sure my little girl was properly cared for. With a few books and lots of Internet study I learned a lot. Foreverfiestychinchilla.org was one site in which I felt had the most accurate information on the web. Just 6 months ago Miss Chinchi became deathly ill. I had been to three different vets and nobody could tell me what was wrong with her so I took it upon myself to figure out what was wrong with her and Foreverfiestychinchilla.org had all the answers. I followed all the steps which were so brilliantly described on the website and I began to make progress. I sent an email through the website and thats when I met Andrea. Andrea offered her phone number to me a complete stranger and we talked about Ms Chinchies symptoms and how I had been treating her. With the website and Andreas help I was able to save my little girl when the vets had no clue. I finally found a decent vet that performed an abscess surgery and diagnosed Ms Chinchi with Malocclusion which I thought was a death sentence but of course Andrea had all the experience with Malo as well. She reassured me that it is not always a death sentence, she was there for me and answered all my questions through and after surgery. I am so thankful to Andrea, her hard work and extensive knowledge on Chinchillas. Ms Chinchi and I are forever greatful that someone like Andrea has such a passion for these special and sometimes forgotten about little wonderful furry creatures. I highly recommend Forever Fiesty Chinchilla as being one of the best in chinchilla knowledge and care. Thank you Andrea for your service I wish we had more people like her in this world where most people have lost their compassion for life and all of earth's wonders.

This was a surprise to me because I thought  I had two males.  I was clueless on how to care for baby chins.  Andrea was a life saver and guided me through the next several weeks!  If it wasn't for Andrea these baby chins didn't have a chance with me. They are now very happy and living a happy chin life.  Andrea didn't know me from a whole in the wall and spent many days and nights on the phone with me, helping me care for the babies and of course Mama and Papa chin.   The time I will forever be grateful for Andrea was when my Bootz became ill. I was devastated and called Andrea.  Once again Andrea was there for me. She and her husband took the 1 1/2 hr trip to my home to try and save my Bootz.  Unfortunately he was too sick and didn't make it.  She not only comforted me, but took care of all the arrangements for Bootz to be cremated and have his ashes returned to me.  I can't begin to express how grateful I am for Andrea and her Rescue Organization.  Andrea did all of this because she has a huge heart and loves  these furballs!  Recently my basement flooded and needs to be fixed.  We now have mold, therefore the chins couldn't remain In the finished (now ruined) basement.  Due to having a few week old baby in the upper house (house full of baby stuff), I don't have room for the chins. Not only is Andrea currently taking care of my chins until our basement is fixed, she and her husband came and got them for me. Once again all of this on her own precious time.  If any organization out there deserves support this would be the one!  I wish I could do more!  Andrea.....I will forever be grateful.  Thank you thank you!

It has been almost a year and my Chin was began having issues with his digestive tract.  I took him to the vet and had him tested for Giardia.  The test was negative, but they did not give me any suggestions on where to go from there, nor did they respond to my phone calls requesting additional help.  I contacted the pet store where I purchased him, and they were not as knowledgeable in Chins as I needed.

Andrea spent the time to explain eating habits, treats and the flora of their digestive tract.   She gave me suggestions on what treats to feed him and when.  These are all natural and healthy for him with high fiber and no sugar.   To sum it up I am grateful for the time she has spent with me and the knowledge she has shared.   Thank you Andrea.

'12 and had her until last week when i had to surrender her to one of the most caring and generous rescue i've ever had the pleasure of giving up an animal to. Andrea came all the way from CT to my home in southern maine to pick up my Chin. The woman that gave her to me never properly cared for her before so i pretty much got the brunt of the financial tidings involved with having a mangled toothed chinchilla. I am a college student on my own with bills to pay and never thought my chin would be so expensive. Though i loved her very much, i simply couldn't afford her. Andrea set up a vet visit for her the day after she made the drive to pick her up! I couldn't be more thankful for her and her husband for the commitment they make to all these exotic chins. She emailed me what the vet said and the relief was off. I am sad i couldn't keep my 19 years old beautiful chin but i know FOR SURE the rest of her life will be lived out in peace and with other friends just like her.

She immediately got back to me & spent hours on the phone helping us.  We are animal lovers with no chin experience & I was totally impressed by her love, compassion & knowledge for these little furballs. Our chin delivered two babies a few weeks ago & once again I emailed Andrea about newborn care.  Not too long later, she was calling me.  Then at four days old, our runt was severely injured & his life was literally in our hands.  After three visits to two different vets, it was Andrea who helped us to keep this baby alive.  During one of our many phone calls, I became totally overwhelmed & just started to cry.  Andrea very calmly talked me down off the ledge & gave me the confidence I needed to handle this situation.  She still checks in on us & even gave me the number of her hotel when she was going to be away for business.  There is nothing in this for her other than knowing our chins are okay.  I am happy to report that both of our babies and Mom are thriving, thanks to Andrea.  She is truly the Guardian Angel of Chinchillas and I am so very thankful for having found her.

Rescuing these sometimes neglected or abused animals can be difficult but so rewarding. Besides taking care of all her animals, she has time to help the rest of us with supplies and advice. I have one chin that requires hand feeding 3 times a day and it is Andrea that keeps me supplied with the Critical Care he has to have. I can alway count on her to ship promptly and help me keep a constant supply on hand. There is more to rescuing than just putting an animal in a cage. 
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	180853		/users/profile/237563	chincoteaguelovr	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/22/2013	I run an animal rescue in CT and recently read an article in one of our local on-line papers about this Chinchilla rescue that is actually in the same town as my rescue.  After reading the article I contacted Andrea and asked if she'd like to have her Chins appear on a TV segment I do for the local news called Lost & Pound. The segments air on the Sunday news in each of 3 broadcasts.  People are invited to call the number shown and the adoption process begins.  Andrea agreed and I met her at the TV station.  I have to say that her professionalism and knowledge of these little GORGEOUS creatures was wonderful!  She gave me some wonderful information that I was able to relay to the viewers and hopefully some good will come out of it.  The Chins she introduced me to were comical, sweet and VERY well kept.  I am completely impressed all the way around!!!

Our little girl not only endured two procedures that the vet did to try and fix her teeth, Boo also got a huge abcess on her back from the unsterilized needle used to administer subcutaneous fluids which also required yet another surgery to clean it out.  When this vet wanted us to bring Boo back yet again for another attempt at "fixing" Boo's teeth, we knew for sure that this vet was not the right one and started looking online for help.  That's when we found Andrea.  She is so willing to spend hours of her time helping us and hooked us up with an amazing exotic vet who knows chins about as much as Andrea does!!!!  I don't believe that Boo would still be with us if it weren't for all of Andrea's help.  We order all of Boo's supplies from ForeverFeistyChinchillas along with some people items too.  The quality of the items we have ordered have been nothing but excellent.  Andrea is passionate when it comes to rescuing chins, she is one amazing woman and we can't thank her enough for all of her help.  
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	179172		/users/profile/235811	tamontana	General Member of the Public	5	10/17/2013	I met Andrea when I became the unintended recipient of two chins.  Some idiot had them outside in the heat with a "free" sign.  My stepdaughter got them out of the heat and called me as I work with animal control.  First problem, we have no place to keep two chins with a kennel full of dogs and cats,  second, I know next to nothing about chins.  She took the time to answer my questions, and told me how to care for them.  She offered to make the long trip to my house on a weekend to look at the chins to determine the sex and health of them.  She determined they were very neglected and ended taking them both.  Don't know what we would have done without her help.  She went out of her way to help me and these two poor chins and very likely saved their lives.

I soon discovered that 'pet store' foods were not the best for Chins, and could actually be detrimental. After searching the web for Chin foods/products/toys and Chin care information, I realized immediately that Forever Feisty was the absolute best source for top quality products for our Chin friends.  And then how very happy I was to come to learn that Andrea is not just 'selling product' but is an advocate for the well-being of these delightful little ones.  She is aware of the high numbers of surrenders for the Chins, and works tirelessly to educate and inform people to this plight.  I am very grateful for my association with Forever Feisty... and so is my original rescue, Virgil, and now too my new three elderly rescues!
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	175009		/users/profile/231311	Vyxxin	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/07/2013	As chinchillas are an exotic pet with an exceptionally long lifespan, the need for specialized rescue of chinchillas is a dire one. Andrea of Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue is by far the best Chinchilla specific rescue on the entire east coast. She devotes so much time, effort, money and care into her organization and it truly shows. She's helped far more chinchillas than ANY other rescue I know of both through her own facilities AND through rescue referral. She "investigates" new rescue options out of state so that should she not personally be able to help an owner, she can refer them to another rescue that is up to her high standards of care. As I said, due to chinchillas being an exotic pet the need for specialized rescue is high. In general, many local humane societies and animal shelters just cannot provide the care for these animals. Andrea does. She's very thorough with her records and application processes. She provides the animals in her care with the same type of care that animal could expect in a private setting. She's just an exceptional human being running an exceptional facility!

I work at Peaceful Acres Horses, a horse rescue and sanctuary for horses and people, so my expectations were not easily met. Prey animals like horses and chinchillas are highly neglected and cruely used for selfish purposes by humans. I love to provide care for those that cannot help themselves. I googled chinchilla rescue and Forever Feisty instantly caught my attention. The website is full of health facts, real information, and a clear message that the chins are not being sold just to get rid of them. The chins rescued by Forver Feisty are truly given every chance to have a great life and a loving forever home, even those that may have been neglected in the past. That is one purpose of a rescue-to give second, third or how ever many chances it takes for the rescued animal to have the life it deserves. Andrea, the founder of Forever Feisty, knows all you can know about the proper care for chinchillas. I trust her and her opinions. The chins that are part of this rescue are taken care of, loved and only adopted out to those who can care for them just as well, if not better. As of Sunday Dec. 2, I am the happy new mama of Hudson and Charlie-two six year old male chins. Thank you Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue!

My daughter has been wanting a Chinchilla for some time and after 3 years I finally gave in.  She heard about this website and we filled out the application.  We heard back fairly quickly and soon scheduled a time to visit with the Chinchillas.  The rescue was clean and it was obvious that Andrea has a sincere dedication towards caring for these animals. She took a lot of time to make sure we (in particular my daughter) had "done her homework".  She also gave us time to play with a few Chinchillas in to see which one would be the right fit.  We eventually picked "Hawkeye" :) Andrea brought him to our home and made sure again that we were going to care for him .  She also made it clear that if we could not handle him that she would take him back and if we had any problems to call her no matter what time of the day.  Thank you Andrea for your caring and dedication, I would recommend this rescue to anyone who is serious about caring for these beautiful endangered animals!

She has amazed and impressed me by being one of the most honestly caring and giving people I have had the pleasure of getting to know in the world of animal welfare, and chinchillas in particular.  I contacted her out of the blue when my two 12-year-old chinchillas were having major health issues and I was at the end of my rope (as were my several vets).  I had never been to her rescue, my chinchillas and I had no real connection to her, and she had no good reason to offer me any sort of advice or assistance at all  except that she honestly and truly cares for the welfare of chinchillas  any chinchillas.  It quickly became clear that it didnt matter if she knew me or my chinchillas, or if I was planning on giving her a huge donation or whatever.  What mattered was that my chinchillas were in trouble and that she maybe could help.  Help, she did.  She spent so much time on the phone with me, offered advice, caring, reassurance, and more  all without asking a thing in return.  I am so grateful for her and for all she gave out of sheer generosity and honest caring (and yes, btw, my chinchillas are still here  in part, I think, thanks to her).  Thank you, Andrea, for being there, and being the truly caring, knowledgeable and giving person you are.  You are a breath of fresh air and my chinchillas and I are better off for it!

I have never met such a caring and compassionate human being. I was a complete stranger yet she was willing to drop everything and come to the aid of my chinchilla "Buddy". She gave me some first-aid supplies and a couple hours of her time. She was able to tell that he had a very bad hair ring and that it was cutting off the circulation. Andrea went above and beyond and found us a good vet in the area. She even paid for the visit, when we insisted on paying her back she told us to donate it to the rescue. She is AMAZING in every sense of the word.You can tell how much she loves the little fuzz-butts. She is very knowledgeable about the health and needs for these special little critters. Meeting Andrea has really made me view the world differently. I truly feel privileged  to have met such a wonderful person, and I HIGHLY recommend her beautiful rescue.

I filled out an adoption application, got approved and this is when i finally got to meet Andrea. Andrea is completely and totally amazing! She is super friendly, EXTREMELY helpful, knowledgeable and chuck full of chinchilla info. When i went to her rescue to pick out the chinchilla i wanted to adopt i looked around at the cages(which were all very well kept and clean) and all of the chinchillas seemed to be very comfortable and happy. Thanks to Andrea I finally was able to get a chinchilla of my very own, Hawkeye (he's so adorable!).  Looking back I'm really glad that i ultimately chose to adopt as oppose to purchasing one from a breeder, i would DEFINITELY adopt a chinchilla from her again. :)

We went and picked him out with help from Andrea, the rescue owner.  She has about 100 chinchillas in her immaculate basement, and I think every little critter down there adores her.  She delivered Trapper to our house herself and gave us some suggestions for our cage, and stayed with us for over an hour making sure Trapper felt safe and comfortable.   I ordered a pile of chinchilla goodies from her website that she delivered to us, that I found to be better priced than Petsmart.   I cannot think of a single aspect of the adoption process or the rescue itself that could be any better.  I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone who wants to adopt or surrender a chinchilla to use this agency.

Chinchillas are exotic pets and with that comes specialty care that can only be administered by knowledgable, dedicated and loving people such as Andrea and her volunteer staff. Tireless hours are spent making this rescue top notch! Their facilities are pristine and their vast experiences allows for them to match the perfect pet to the perfect home.

I recently had two that contracted coccidia. Andrea was with me every step of the way to helping them recover advising me on what to do and what questions I should be asking the vet. She was available day and night for me to talk to and was even the reason I had those two babies. She even went above advising me on their care. The ordeal lasted about a month and through no fault of my own or Andrea's advice my babies passed. Even after that on nights where I was so upset and couldn't sleep I knew I could call Andrea and she would talk to me. She became more than just a trusted adviser she became my friend. I still have three chinchillas and if I have a question about something going on with them I know I can call her and get great advice. She truly is an amazing, loving, and caring person. I will continue to support her rescue in any way that I can. I am just grateful to know her and grateful for all she does for the fur-babies that come to her.

Upon entering Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue for the first time, my husband and I were in awe by what we saw; over 100 chinchillas organized in a colorful, calm and cool environment.   We immediately noticed the time, attention and love Andrea invests in her rescue.  Every chinchilla (or chin family) has a safe, clean cage, fresh food, water, nutritious treats, and an assortment of handmade chew toys, hammocks, ledges and hideaways.  All of these products are also available to buy on her website, because Andrea wants chin owners to have access to the very best for their pets.This summer, I volunteered at Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue.  It was not until this experience that I realized how truly incredible this non-profit rescue is.  Andrea pours her heart and soul into her passion, usually working late into the night.  She monitors her chins closely, interacts with them constantly and caters to all chinchillas with special needs.  She knows that many of these chins will stay with her forever because of the specific care they require.  If a chinchilla has any medical complication or genetic history with the chance of problems in the future, she will not adopt him out.  She only allows chins that are physically, emotionally and socially sound to leave her rescue.  The health and happiness of all her chinchillas is Andreas priority.Thank you Andrea, for all that you do for chinchillas!

While we all loved him, his care had gotten to be too much for our growing boys with too many other interests. I had tried to interest many friends and relatives in taking him but no one had room in their lives. I even called local preschools and nature centers and stumbled upon FFC's info. They were at once responsive and quickly connected me with an adoptive family. A wonderful mom with three sweet young daughters came to my house and packed up the Chinch with all his belongings.

After some research we decided to adopt instead of starting with the raising of another baby. We filled out the Forever Feisty adoption application on line and started the process.  After a phone call back from owner/director Andrea, we set up an appointment to go and meet some perspective adopties.  After making the two hour journey and spending a couple of hours at the rescue we decided to accept a pair of two year old females.  As per Forever Feisty's rules, the girls would be delivered within the next couple of weeks to our home which gave us plenty of time to get set up for our new arrivals.  As promissed, we made a date and time for delivery and Andrea came to our home and placed our two girls in their new cage not without explisit instructions on how to proceed.  After seeing the care and love Andrea pours into her 100 Chinchilla population and the knowlege she has and will share in caring for Chinchillas I knew we had made the right choise in adopting from Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue.  We are truely fortunate in having someone as dedicated to Chinchillas as Andrea in our area who we could adopt from.

While I had a strong bond with her, I knew in my heart that I did not have the time she needed, and she was getting lonely and dejected.  With a heavy heart, I searched for local adoption but had no luck. By very good luck, I happened upon Forever Feisty and sent off a letter about my situation.  They do not serve the area where I live and I did not excpect a response.  To my suprise, Andrea not only had really helpful advice about my chin's care, but said that she had a woman who was looking to adopt a 2nd female chin (and it is hard to find a non-bonded female).  Andrea helped us get connected even though we are 300 miles away, and we were able to arrange for a meeting, which lead to my little Tiki going off to her new home, with a new chin friend and much more human contact that she deserves.  I don't know what I would have done without Andrea's generosity of time and knowledge.  Andrea also makes herself available for any questions or assistance after the adoptions take place.  Even though my little Tiki is 300 miles away, I feel better knowing that she is in a prescreened, caring home and that she will be well cared for.  And, yes, I will be traveling up to visit Tiki in the future.  Thank you, Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue! Wendy J.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	88596		/users/profile/99879	JuicyItl529	Client Served	5	05/11/2011	I recently found myself facing the hardest thing in my life thus far, I had to rehome my 2 chinchillas.  I had been living in an apartment for 8 years that had black mold and no matter what we did on an over the counter level we couldn't eliminate it and it had got so bad I could no longer even contain it.  Over the years I started having breathing problems and my boyfriend and I both found ourselves hospitalized due to mold inhalation.  The slum lord did not care about the house and said she is just going to paint over it, what a fool... we have since called the board of health and the town and are trying to get the house condemned.My entire life I have been a huge animal lover and while at this house I managed to collect my own little zoo but adopting a bunch of animals (all of which were dumped randomly at various pet stores in my area).  I thought I was doing good by rescuing them but ended up with 3 rabbits, 2 chinchillas, and a hamster.  We finally found a new apartment that was in our price range, close to our jobs and accepted pets (as sadly most apartments here in Westchester NY do not).  However there was a catch, the landlord has a 2 pet max and we have 6.  She also complained about how much noise the chin's cages made, and their saucers spinning, along with their excessive gnawing on everything (in their cages).  Between gnawing on their chin safe wood shelves and their lava ledges and the occasional chewing on the bars trying to get to one another.Well 2 of my buns are a bonded pair are staying with us.  The third bunny has moved 10 minutes away to my mom's house as that is her little buddy.  The hamster has moved into my job at a daycare center and is going home with a co-worker on weekends.Now I was down to my pair of black velvet chins whom I've had since the girl was less then 4 months and the boy from a few months after that.I am beyond devastated but after spending over a year trying to find this apartment and spending a ton of money to move into it, we are at a point of rehome the chins or have all of us be homeless.My girl chin (Clarice) is 3 months shy of turning 4 and the boy (Dallin) is a bit older but nobody really knows just how old (we are guest-a-mating 6 years old).  We felt that although this has me emotionally a total wreck for the 2 months we have been looking for a new home for them that they are still both young enough that if transitioned correctly and given enough love in their new homes they should both be able to do great and have happy healthy full lives.After exhausting all my possibilities of trying to convince one of my friends/family members to take my babies (so they'd stay close and guaranteed in good hands) I tried getting in touch with every shelter/rescue within a 3 hour drive.  I got very few responses back and the ones whom did reply simply stated they were full and couldn't help.Then I got an email back from an amazing woman named Andrea from Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc.  Tho her rescue was full she did everything she could to contact everyone in her power to help me find a home for my babies.  Through her I met an angel named Julia up in Albany who already has 3 chins but agreed to take Clarice home.  I spoke to Julia for a few days online and we began to follow each other on Facebook, I found her to be a genuinely kind person who really cares about her chins and I feel would be a good fur-mom to take over for me in raising Clarice.SO... I packed Clarice and all her stuff into the car and drove almost 2 hours upstate to meet Julia (halfway) to introduce her to Clarice and send them home together.  Tho she has only been living there for a day Julia says she appears to be adjusting well and in time she is going to try to see if she will play with the 2 other girl chins she has.  We have already spoken of me going all the way up to Albany to visit Clarice in her new home once she gets all settled.  One of my best friends who is also a huge animal lover and has a small zoo of her own has seen just how traumatic this has been for me and is going to try to take Dallin home (even tho she already has 5 male chins).  This would keep Dallin 15 minutes from me and allow me to visit regularly and hopefully miss him a little less.If this arrangement doesn't work, Julia has said she will take Dallin and I would bring him with me when I go to visit Clarice.All and all this has been so stressful for me and I can't believe I have to part with my children but Andrea did an awesome job of helping me out and finding them a new home where I believe they will both go great.A huge thank you to Andrea !!! When we get ourselves fully economically stable and can own our own home I will get back in touch with her to hopefully bring home a new chin or a bonded pair which we will be able to keep at our forever home.

Matches between human and chins are as expertly made as if Andrea were a high priced marriage broker.  During the second stage of adoption, the onsite visit to Forever Fiesty, my 12-year old was introduced to several chins and was undecided until the third chin chose her, playing with her shoe laces then climbing into her lap.  It was a match made in heaven, nurtured by Andrea.  As Andrea brought Snow to us, she was dedicated enough to help us rebuild our incorrectedly assembled cage, and to help define Snow's new routine at our house.  Knowing how delicate these wonderful animals are, we are comforted to know that Andrea's advice, counsel and love is only a call or an email away.

After being hospitalized for 5 days, she was actually getting worse, because of some of the meds she was getting had been getting and been force fed for 5 days without any signs of pooping. On the fifth day the vet decided Daisy should be put to sleep because she was not going to survive.During this process I had been in contact with Andrea daily.We took Daisy home from the vet and then started to treat her with natural stuff that Andrea suggestedPineapple juice- to break up any organic stuff that might be causing any kind of blockage.Pedialyte - to keep her hydrated Mylacon - to treat her gasalong with some of the meds the vet gave us to use.On the second day she still had no poop and Andrea then suggested that we try giving her pumpkin for her constipation. Within 3 hours of giving Daisy her second dosage of pumpkin she pooped for first time in 2 1/2 weeks.Under Andreas' guidance Daisy is making remarkable progress and is getting back to normal.As far as I'm concerned Andrea saved Daisy's life and she has great knowledge on treating chinchillas. Her communication with me(living in Florida) on treating Daisy is second to none and shows her dedication in taking of her chinchillas in her rescue and those that are privately owned. Been able to talk to someone by phone instead of waiting for a reply on a forum is really beneficial and I cannot thank her enough for what she has done.In the future I will donate to her rescue so Andrea can continue to provide the care she gives to chinchillas in her rescue.Andrea you are the best.Thanks,John

There is no exotics vet in my area and have not have great success in past dealings with veterinarians. I emailed this chinchilla rescue asking for help. I received a very prompt email providing me with much information of which I was ignorant. I wrote back with several other questions and again received great attention and care. My little guy is still recovering, but is doing much better thanks to their help. Not only was having their knowledge and experience helpful, but just knowing that someone out there cares about a stranger and her little chinchilla is very comforting! Thanks so much for your help!
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	49359	8	/users/profile/50517	paulagsell	General Member of the Public	5	08/06/2010	Hi my name is Paula Gsell, I am the proud owner of a one year old male Chinchilla named Tortoro. I was thinking of maybe getting a second Chinchilla for a playmate and friend for Tortoro, when I came across forever Feisty Chinchilla. I filled out an application and shortly after was able to get an unbleievable amount of information regarding my Chinchilla's personal heath and about how one goes about bringing a new chinchilla into your home. It was amazing the information that was given to me. I had read a few books prior to getting my Chinchilla, but it did not have the information I got here at Foever Feisty.This is a wonderful place, these people really love and care so much for these beautiful loving creatures. I took the information I learn here to improve the living condition for my Chin, new house a change in food, and bedding. I am very thankful for this rescue service and the love they show for the gift of life!SincerelyPaula
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	48749	5	/users/profile/49937	chinmom1	Client Served	5	07/27/2010	As one of Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescues clients I have been more than impressed with my experiences. Andrea is a dedicated rescuer and a true hero to the little furry friends. I have, to date, adopted 4 chinchillas over the same amount of years. My chinchillas have all come to me healthy and continue to remain so. After contacting Andrea for my first rescued pair I have had the priviledge of being able to contact her continually for advice or with questions. She always replies within 48hours at most and will have exactly the answer I need. Her continued dedication to chinchillas and their forever families shows true love for her work. I have recently had the priviledge to visit her rescue in person and was impressed with the cleanliness of the space and the obvious health of all the chins in her care. I have been and will continue to recommend anyone to contact Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue for information on adopting a chinchilla and their continued care.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	48727	5	/users/profile/49903	bridget-h	General Member of the Public	5	07/26/2010	I visited Forever Feisty Chinchillas with a friend several weeks ago. My friend has already adopted four chinchillas through Andrea and was stopping by for a visit. Although I am not a chinchilla owner, I have adopted all of my prior pets through shelters and rescues (my current cat is a rescued feral). I was very impressed by the quality of care that Andrea provides to her chins. Their living space is immaculately clean and well-organized, and the chins are friendly -- some, even curious. I interacted with a few of them, and they were friendly, calm and curious. Andrea spends the majority of her time caring for and being involved with her chins, and it shows! She explained that she will not adopt to "just anyone" and is very concerned with placing her chins with those who are committed to learning how to care for one properly. Some of her chins have been rescued from situations where they were not properly cared for, and she is committed to making sure the situation does not repeat itself.I highly recommend anyone who is interested in learning more about chinchillas or is interesting in adopting one to contact Forever Feisty Chinchillas. Andrea is a wealth of knowledge and experience and she clearly is committed to the work that she does.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	48723	5	/users/profile/49899	ellspeth77	Donor	5	07/26/2010	When Andrea called to ask if I would be interested in helping out Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue, my response as an animal lover was a quick "sure!"  Every experience with the organization has proven that these folks take their mission seriously and put their animals' welfare first. Besides Andrea's made with love food and wellness products, (no wondering where it comes from or if it's OK for your little one) the rescue itself is surely heaven on earth for the chins.  Spotless is the only description for the townhouse style neighborhood, with plenty of bright light, fun colors, and it's own recreation/"park" area.  The chins are the stars here, though (sorry to the human landlords!).  They are clearly happy and comfortable in the temperature controlled environment as evidenced by the well loved chew toys and darling personalities of the chins I was thrilled to handle. Most chins have carefully chosen roommates or if not, nearby neighbors serve as company for those in single units.  Hearing some of the tales of woe these now lucky chins have had to endure before arriving at Forever Feisty, and then seeing them in their current digs, is enough to redeem one's faith in the human race.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	48722	2	/users/profile/49898	chinchillin	General Member of the Public	5	07/26/2010	I attended a pet adoption/volunteer day a few weeks back in Stamford, where I met the Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue, its founders and some of the lovely chinchillas. My sister-in-law has adopted chinchillas from this organization before, and - from a first hand experience - the founders of this organization take excellent care of their chinchillas, ensuring that every adoption of each animal is placed in a loving home, like my sister in laws, with people that are acceptionally in tune to caring for these creatures unique needs. All in all, I feel the dedication and passion behind the founders organization, as well as the maintenance, organization and structure of such a well tuned operation, make the Forever Fiesty Chinchilla Rescue THE ONE and ONLY place to adopt these beautiful creatures.

We are always looking for new opportunities to understand animals. In searching local animal adoption to create a education discussion for our club I came across this site and spent an hour learning enevrything I could need to hold a discussion (I started not being able to spell chinchilla). The site covers housing, feeding, health care, and playing with these little animals. It is very clear that the rescue loves these chinchillas and want the best for them. Because of 4H I am often asked animal care questions and typically I have a general answer but I am adding this rescue site to my list of references. I also was really please to read specific product to purchase that the site feels are better than other available items. When you find a good product it's ok to say so.

I searched the net and came across the Forever Feisty Chinchilla site and was overwhelmed with the amount of information available about chinchillas.  The site was well organized, easy to use and answered all of my questions.  It would be really great if all websites provided this kind of information.  I would recommend this site to anyone who wants to have a chin as a pet.

They care and maintenance of this facility is superb.  All the the chin's in this shelter get terrific care and loving attention.  I don't know how they do all they do. The screening process for placing the adoptive chin's is second to none.  All the information provided by the owners is well thought out and honestly presented.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	48160	2	/users/profile/49105	butch1	Volunteer	5	07/14/2010	As a volunteer at the Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue, I assist in the maintenance of the rescue including making all of the wood products for the cages and ensuring that the chinchillas have a safe and clean environment.  I have known Andrea for 20+ years and have found her to be extremely passionate related to the care of chinchillas.  She has created and documented a wealth of knowledge from personal experiences and from spending countless hours researching all manners of documentation available.  This is evident based on the breadth and wealth of chinchilla information that can be found on the rescue website.  Her tremendous dedication to the well being of the chinchillas makes me want to continue volunteering and supporting the rescue.

Andrea contacted me and we talked on the phone at length. She was full of information, positive changes in chins food, cages, health. She made great recommendations for a new cage and helped me order it. She was available and returned my calls/emails promptly. Andrea's concern/passion/dedication are for the chins and educating chin owners. She is patient, kind with great follow through. I purchase all my chin products through the rescue even though she gave other internet sites to view. The information Andrea provided and knowing that she is available to answer any questions or give any help is priceless. I highly recommend anyone who has a chin or considering adopting one contact Andrea and adopt through this rescue.

You could tell from the application and phone interview that Andrea was cautious and very picky about who she would place her chins with.  She let me know all the pros and all the cons of owning chinchillas.  When I decided that I still wanted them, I visited with them first and was given a lesson on caring for chins.  Before the chins arrived, Andrea sent me a list of all the supplies I would need as well as helpful websites.  The best part is the follow up emails checking on the chins and trying to help answer any questions I might have.

After going through the adoption process with Andrea I know so much more about healthy eating, exercise, bonding and play.  We now have two tan chins who are a joy.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	11333	8	/users/profile/13278	julieluvsnej	Client Served	5	09/29/2009	We recently adopted 3 chinchillas from Forever Feisty.  Andrea was amazing throughout the adoption process.  She is very thorough in her education of families interested in adopting chinchillas.  Her screening process includes an application as well as a phone interview. You can tell by just one conversation with her that she is passionate about her rescue. She took a lot of time trying to match the needs of my family with the personalities of the chinchillas.  Andrea has been extensive in supplying us with resources on the care and keeping of our chinchillas.  As my ten year old daughter said, "If it wasn't for Andrea, we wouldn't know what to do with our 3 chinchillas."  Thanks to Andrea for a great experience!
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	4441	17	/users/profile/6155	Lisa	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2009	I have known Andrea for 20+ years-before she had found her 'calling'. I remember the thought she gave this new endeavor. Andrea never rushes into anything especially when it concerns animals. She always has the best of intentions.  How the rescue has grown both amazes me and concerns me. I would like to think that all people think long and hard before bringing an animal into their lives, but for those that haven't, there is an excellent caring environment to place a chinchilla. The knowledge Andrea has is a blessing to those that need her. She will offer her time and experience, again for the benefit of the animals.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	3764	14	/users/profile/5538	friendofsquirrles	Board Member	5	04/22/2009	I remember the first Chin that the founder of Forever Feisty Chinchilla brought home.  She had her own, tranquil, climate controlled room.  Imagine the amazement to see this carried over into Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue.  The rescue houses over 50 Chins, all pampered and addressed by name.  The wooden living quarters contain all the necessary accoutrements for a healthy, playful life.  In addition to the perfect climate and continued tranquil environment, the Chins have a separate play area for time outside of their living quarters.  All of this accomplished with donations of both time and money along with the natural caring of Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue's founder.  It is both an honor and a privilege to have been asked, and to serve as a board member of this generous organization.

Right away Adrea showed that her main concern was the chins and that the people adopting should want what is very best for them.  This is exactly what I hope all rescues are like because it is what they ought to be.  I was impressed by her knowledge and intuition as well as her radiating love for every chinchilla she has.  You could tell just by speaking to her on the phone that she would not have it any other way and these chins have a place in her heart.  I had a wonderful experience adopting.  It was easy, and I felt that Andrea prepared me as much as I needed.  As soon as I am ready for another chin I will be back :)
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	2849	18	/users/profile/4494	Nancy	Client Served	5	02/25/2009	We adopted a five year old chinchilla from Forever Fiesty in July, 2008 and were very impressed with both Andrea, her knowledge of chins, the cleanliness of her facility, the thoroughness of her vetting process, her desire to ensure that the chins are placed with good homes, and her interest in making an ideal owner/chin match.  At the time, my eight year old son had expressed an interest in owning a chinchilla.  We contacted Andrea after going on PetFinder.com and filled out an extensive questionnaire.  Andrea expressed concerns about my son's ability to properly care for the chin as well as how our other pets would interact with the chin.  She discussed these concerns in great detail with both me and our references.  Andrea provided us with a wealth of information regarding chins including housing, diet and exercise.  We visited her facility to meet several chins which she felt might make a good match.  I was amazed at how immaculate the facility was and was impressed by Andrea's obvious love for her animals.  After agreeing on a match, Andrea brought the chin to our house to ensure that we had a proper set up and to help smooth the transition.  She continues to be a source of information and to take an active interest in our chin's well being. I feel very fortunate that we adopted our chin from Andrea.
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	2727	21	/users/profile/4366	Charley's Mom	Client Served	5	02/17/2009	My husband and I bought a chinchilla as a Christmas present for our daughter. We did not do any prior research (BIG MISTAKE) and much to our suprise owning a chinchilla was nothing like we had expected! This little rodent was chewing on everything insight (furniture, walls and cords). He was a very distance pet and was not sociable like we had expected. Feeling like we made a huge mistake I went on the Internet looking for help. I came across Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue - LUCKY FOR ME. I spoke to the owner, Andrea, frequently for weeks and sometimes hours at a time. She was so full of knowledge, patience and gave me such wonderful advice. If it was not for Andrea I truely feel that we would have given our Chin away. Now, two years later, I cannot image our life without our little boy, Charley. We have learned to chin-proof our room with Andrea's advice and Charley has grown to be very sociable with us. He will jump on our laps, chase us around the room and give us nose kisses. Forever Feisty is a wonderful organization and I praise the work they do. They love and care for these animals and are always available for questions and advice. I live in Louisville, KY, but I wish I lived closer so that I had the opportunity to visit this Chin Wonderland. If you are thinking about adopting a chinchilla, I cannot stress enough to do your reseach. Chin's are not the pet for everyone, but thankfully in our situation, Andrea was able to help us realize that a chin could fit like a puzzle in our family!
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	2722	19	/users/profile/4354	jls10a	Client Served	5	02/13/2009	When one of my two chinchillas died in September 2007, my surviving chinchilla went into a deep state of depression. My fun-loving, playful, affectionate chinchilla became very lonely and it was very difficult for me to watch him suffer.  I contacted Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue, Inc. (the "Rescue") and requested a chinchilla that was the same gender and age as my surviving chinchilla so they would have a better chance of spending the rest of their lives together.  Within days, the Rescue called me and my references and not too long after, a beautiful 7 year old male, chinchilla showed up at my apartment.  The two boys bonded almost immediately and now enjoy playing and cuddling together endlessly.  The new chinchilla (now called "Hercules") cured my surviving chinchilla's loneliness and has adapted so well to living in his new home.  He loves to run around while tweeting very loudly and enjoys being pet on the side of his face.  I cannot thank the Rescue enough for its generosity, love of chinchillas, and most of all, Hercules, who brought life back to my beloved chinchilla.

As the weeks went on, we realized he was serious. We were happy to support his new interest however, we were astonished when we visited a local pet store and discovered how expensive a chinchilla can be. Our industrious son did not give up. He researched for days and discovered "Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue." The adoption fee was quit reasonable so we filled out an application and anxiously waited for a response. A few days later, we were happy to hear we were accepted. Andrea contacted us and we were introduced to our new members of the family. Immediately, we bonded with our new boys; Scooter & Ollie. My son has never been happier and I have to admit, they are awfully cute. Best of luck to anyone who chooses to take the route similar to ours.

So when I decided to adopt a chinchilla (my first chin had passed away) I found Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue. 4 years later I still consider myself extremely lucky to have found them! At first I wanted one but fell in love with a bonded pair. One year later I decided to adopt another pair. I now have 4 healthy chinchillas from them! And I can tell you that the rescues dedication does not stop at the adoptions. They have been helpful to me over the years in so many ways, answering questions, giving me healthy options for diet, environment, and housing for my 4 guys. The rescues owner has even gone so far as to help me find a vet who specialized in chinchillas, was local to me, trustworthy, and knowledgable. She continues to stay in contact with me to this day. It's a comfort to me knowing that I can still call and get any questions/concerns addressed. Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescues caring and love for both the chinchillas and their new families is truly neverending!
Forever Feisty Chinchilla Rescue Inc	2430	13	/users/profile/3919	jklimek	Client Served	5	01/09/2009	My 11 year old grandaughter has had many pets, including cats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, turtles, frogs, hamsters, and a snake.  When she announced that she had decided to own a chinchilla, I had never seen one, and only thought about making coats from them.  Our vet told us that we should obtain one from a breeder, since chinchillas raised in pet stores may bite.  We went to the Internet, and found very little, until we landed at Forever Feisty, which was only two twons away.  My grandaughter telephoned, made an appointment, and we went to chinchilla-land, full of dozens of warm, cuddly, friendly, happy animals and an absolutely totally devoted and dedicated owner, who went to great lengths to insure that our house would remain both devoted and deicated to raising a chinchilla.  "Sir-Fur" arrived and it took a few days for him to warm up to his new environment.  Dylan spoke to the owner almost daily, getting tips and ideas about how to incorporate Sir-Fur into the family.  That was months ago.  One of the highlights of the recent holidays was having Sir-Fur in her "traveling cage" out with the rest of the family during some of the festivities.  This has been a remarkable experience, with new knowledge about a group of animals that began in a small part of South America, and now have become a part of our lives.  The support and knowledge and help from the owner has been exemplary.  I am not only a client, but also a donor, since I think this entity should survive and thrive.
OPIN	258225	4	/users/profile/231312	janer179	Donor	5	09/18/2015	I have been involved with OPIN since their inception both as a donor and a volunteer.  It is one of the few animal organizations I have encountered that has not let ego nor money nor power overtake their love and care for the animals.  All of their funding goes to their programs, especially medical care for those pets who may not survive without their help.   Several dogs have come to them with Parvo and were saved because of the care they were able to provide.  These dogs would have been put down or died if not for OPIN.  Their focus is ALWAYS on the health and welfare of the animal whether it be for medical care, finding proper adopters, or offering help to those who can't afford to care for their pets, and those in domestic violence situations.  The list goes on, but when compared to other organizations, OPIN wins . Our four-legged friends can't help themselves, and other groups somehow lose sight of that.  OPIN does not.
OPIN	175010	3	/users/profile/231312	janer179	General Member of the Public	4	10/07/2013	OPIN is an organization that was set up to support the Stamford Animal Shelter with funding and hands on help for things that are not paid for by the City of Stamford.  People are not aware of how many animals are in need of medical care that come in to the shelter.  OPIN has spread its wings to far more than this by providing foster homes for dogs that don't do well in a shelter environment, providing free dog training in order to minimize the return of dogs to the shelter and to help people help themselves with regard to training.  They took in a burn dog victim of cruelty when nobody else would and provided funding for her care.  They go far beyond the reaches of their original idea when it comes to care and provision for dogs, and they work with other rescue groups to find good homes and get the word out on the pets that are available for adoption.  OPIN is a wonderful organization that has created awareness, financial help, and TLC for those pets and owners who are in need.  Thankfully there are many caring donors who can keep OPIN alive and growing.  OPIN puts the needs of the animals first which is a priority that sometimes gets lost in the business of other groups.
OPIN	258190	2	/users/profile/281689	Simicc1	Donor	5	09/18/2015	OPIN has been a positive force in  Stamford,  CT and surrounding areas promoting adoptions and so much more.  Offering free training classes for anyone who needs help.  The training classes have helped keep pets happy in their homes and out of the shelter.    They work tireless to promote spay/neuter,  microchipping,  education, adoptions, fostering, vaccinations, and much more.  OPIN has provided the funding for medical attention to animals in need which city shelters do not provide and finding homes for these pets once they recover.  Thank you OPIN for always being there for people and homeless animals.  
OPIN	218138	3	/users/profile/281689	Simicc1	Donor	5	09/29/2014	I have watched the great people of OPIN for many years, I am always floored by their ability to do so much for so many animals. Because of their efforts, I am honored to live in Stamford.  
OPIN	258163	2	/users/profile/346647	Writer	Donor	5	09/18/2015	I  have seen OPIN grow over the years and watched as it has broadened its animal rescue and welfare capabilities.  It is one of the 'great ones'!  It has an exceptionally dedicated group of volunteers who work tirelessly.  The level of integrity of the Board and the volunteers is unparalleled.  It is an amazing organization.
OPIN	258115	2	/users/profile/346598	weilselc	Volunteer	5	09/17/2015	I have been involved with OPIN as a volunteer since 2008.  This is the most dedicated, compassionate, giving group of people -- and they are all volunteers.  There is a very small core group of board members and program directors that gives enormously of its personal time and personal resources.  And those individuals are backed by a larger group of sincerely committed people that rallies to every call for help -- of time, expertise, and/or financial support.  These people are all absolutely and tirelessly dedicated to rescuing, and improving the status of, homeless pets.  They deserve everyones most unselfish support of their efforts so that they may continue their lifesaving work with needy companion animals, who cannot speak for themselves.
OPIN	258108	2	/users/profile/346592	Spazoo	Volunteer	5	09/17/2015	From the minute I heard "the Lucy story" I became a fan of  OPIN.  Their level of commitment to the animals in our community is unmatched.  From the dogs they pull from the pound and place in either foster or boarding, to the ones in distress that they fundraise for, to the awesome events they host to get these animals, especially pitties, before the public- they are very visible and doing an awesome job of educating the public.  Not only do they talk the talk but they walk the walk and are ever so loving and compassionate towards all the dogs they own and represent.  I am very grateful for OPIN on the behalf of the pups who need their amazing assistance.
OPIN	257904	2	/users/profile/346378	C.M.G	General Member of the Public	5	09/17/2015	I have lived in Stamford for over twenty years and have witnessed the so many wonderful, beautiful benefits to this city, the animals that live here and the citizens that live here due to the fantastic groups of people like OPIN and others. I am constantly in awe of their dedication to make this world a more loving  and safe place for animals and the people that love them. 
OPIN	257796	2	/users/profile/237054	Nick N.	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	My first OPIN review was written in 2013 and two years later I would recommend them even more.  They are incredibly dedicated to the well-being of animals.  If you are looking for an organization worthy of a donation in the form of either your time, needed items, or funds, you need look no further.
OPIN	180372	4	/users/profile/237054	Nick N.	Volunteer	5	10/21/2013	Weve been fostering dogs for OPIN for several years and they have been wonderful to work with every step of the way!  Our current foster is a special needs dog with medical and temperament issues.  OPIN has been working diligently to find him a forever home while providing much support and guidance.  The message here is that even a special needs dog is worth saving and OPIN will go to great lengths in an effort to do so.  They are a very caring organization and we are happy to help their cause!
OPIN	257762	2	/users/profile/346228	Writer	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	OPIN is a dedicated group run by all volunteers. Committed to the motto "each life matters" I have witnessed time and again, the passion and care given to all animals. From complimentary microchip clinics, obedience training, spay and neuter as well as medical attention all creatures great and small always get what they need.  I have fostered many dogs that were surrendered to OPIN, and I look forward to fostering more.  I also have made monetary donatations, and see each dollar going to work for the benefit of displaced animals. I feel very fortunate and proud to be a part of such an amazing organization. 
OPIN	257750	2	/users/profile/346216	Cristina7	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	Ive been part of OPIN a little over a year and I have seen first-hand how passionate and caring this group of amazing people are. My friend and her dog Jakie have received assistance from OPIN to get him microchipped and neutered and this wouldnt have been possible without OPINs help. Now Jakie lives a much better and safer life with her mom and they will be forever thankful for all you have done. Thank you OPIN! 
OPIN	257727	2	/users/profile/346194	LeslieBru	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	OPIN is a wonderful organization for animals and a fabulous resource for helping animals and the humans who love them.  I can't tell you how many times people have come to me looking for help adopting, looking for fosters, looking for advice, looking to re-home their pets and I have referred them to OPIN, who have gone above and beyond to help them.  Everyone I've ever referred to OPIN has praised them for their warmth, experience, helpfulness and humanity.  OPIN is what animal rescue is all about.   
OPIN	257191	1	/users/profile/345600	Kimberly122	Donor	5	09/14/2015	OPIN is such an amazing organization, helping so many precious animals in need. OPIN has so many loving, life saving stories such as "Lucy" ...Check out Lucy's story, she is the reason why I started donating to OPIN...and its because of so many other loving stories that I continue to support this organization all the way from California.
OPIN	255812	1	/users/profile/344196	AlexPeri	Volunteer	5	09/10/2015	Having been a part of OPIN for many years, I've seen it evolve into something better and better each year.  This rescue group has great goals and dreams that will certainly become a reality with all the dedication and commitment each Volunteer and Director has for the welfare of the animals and families that need their assistance.  "Each Life Matters" is something they live by.
OPIN	254349	1	/users/profile/164496	DCGal	Client Served	5	08/29/2015	I had watched OPIN from afar, and was really impressed with their efforts to improve the lives of dogs in Stamford.  And then OPIN helped me and my husband adopt the most amazing dog Milo.  As first time dog parents (we were a home of many cats!), they were extremely helpful in answering all our silly questions, gave us great advice and were there for me to lean on when sadly Milo ate something that perforated his intestines, and we lost him after only 4 months.  We we were heartbroken beyond repair.  And while we haven't adopted again, these folks are the real deal and know what they are doing.  I would adopt from them again in a heartbeat and hope to soon.  
OPIN	254114	2	/users/profile/342422	Ktish	Volunteer	5	08/26/2015	OPIN is such a wonderful organization. The volunteers go above and beyond helping homeless pets. 
OPIN	219607	3	/users/profile/283222	jhevans	Client Served	5	10/03/2014	OPIN and those associated with the organization are so generous with their time and hearts. When our family needed help finding a loving caring home for our two labs OPIN came to the rescue. Not only did our dogs land on their paws they are still together which was an incredible relief. I have visited the dogs in their new home with my adult kids and have an open invitaion to do so at any time. Thank you OPIN and in particular Ali for being there when we really needed help.
OPIN	219397	3	/users/profile/189795	AliG	Board Member	5	10/02/2014	OPIN is a 501(C)3 all-volunteer pet rescue group in theory, but in actuality; OPIN is the synergy formed by altruistic volunteers, gracious donors and kind hearted community members that stride daily to make the world a better place for pets in need with a long term commitment to putting an end to pet homelessness, while sharing the deep rooted understood belief that each pet life matters! I am so proud to be part of OPIN, Inc.
OPIN	143345	7	/users/profile/189795	AliG	Board Member	5	11/27/2012	I am a volunteer and Board Member with Outreach to Pets In Need (OPIN) and this organization has entirely changed my life!  The synergy among the volunteers has helped the Stamford shelter pets and the community pets in so many positive ways!  The OPIN sponsored dog training class has helped so many dogs get adopted, and at a much quicker pace.  The foster program has taken dogs from the shelter and given them a chance to live in a traditional home environment- this helps showcase the dog in the community, provides a reduction in stress related shelter occurances and is such a rewarding experience for the foster families! The free microchip programs have protected hundreds of pets throughout the community, the snip program has reduced the number of potential homeless pets, and the regular community events have been a great place to bond with, and meet fabulous pet lovers throughout the community !
OPIN	219372	4	/users/profile/282996	runningval	Donor	5	10/02/2014	OPIN is one of the most giving group of people out there in the animal world.  Their care, compassion, and dedication is never ending.  They go beyond the call of duty whenever called upon.  Not only do they place, foster, and find foster homes for animals that would never stand a chance, they also pick up a large percentage of financial bills for these animals.  They are such an incredible asset to our community, and their hard work and efforts should never go unnoticed.  
OPIN	219294	5	/users/profile/282922	PiaaMiaa	Client Served	5	10/02/2014	Our experience with OPIN has been incredible from the start.  We began as a "foster family" for a 3 pound Malchi.  She entered our home and never left.  She brought new life to our 10 year old Havanese and a new dynamic to our family.  She shows love everyday, as if she knows that she is one of the lucky ones who found a family that loves her.  Ali Girardi, "knew" that when we said yes to fostering that she would loose a foster family, becuase she and the folks at OPIN know how to align pets with the right family.  We would say to EVERYONE - be a foster family, it is so rewarding! We applaud the work that all of the OPIN Volunteers are doing and thank Ali Girardi for our PIAA MIAA Ferraro!
OPIN	219270	4	/users/profile/189830	Randybiagi	Donor	5	10/02/2014	I have been able to witness, first hand, the level of time and depth of care and compassion this group affords to the pets in need within our community. They diligently focus upon ending pet homelessness and devote all their time and energy into making the World a better place for the pets in need!
OPIN	143378	7	/users/profile/189830	Randybiagi	Donor	5	11/27/2012	I recently began fostering a dog for Opin - this group is amazingly supportive and the true love of pets is shared by all ! Their presence and  level of compassion within the community is top notch !
OPIN	218768	2	/users/profile/230290	PMorr	Volunteer	5	10/01/2014	I've been a volunteer and donor for the past couple years.  The leadership team and network of other volunteers are committed to reducing animal homelessness in the community and caring for animals in need.  The organization has very effective processes and programs in place to support these goals and plays an active and important role in our community.
OPIN	174072	1	/users/profile/230290	PMorr	Volunteer	5	10/05/2013	I have been volunteering for OPIN for about six months now.  I have fostered a dog, taken shelter dogs to obedience training, and helped with microchip and adoption clinics.  There are many noteworthy aspects of this organization; but, I will share three items that are most important to me.  First, I like the proactive approach taken by the organization to prevent pet homelessness.  They offer free obedience training classes to help people in the community with their animal's behavior issues and offer free microchip clinics to reduce the number of lost dogs.  Second, I like the dedication of the senior leaders and the other volunteers.  They work tirelessly to support the cause.  Third, and probably the most important, I am very impressed by the effective partnership between OPIN and the local animal shelter in Stamford.  The shelter is grossly underfunded.  OPIN works to find foster and permanent homes for animals brought to the shelter.  The adoption rate from the shelter is extremely high.  I am very proud to support this organization.
OPIN	218648	1	/users/profile/282226	Xell C.	Donor	5	09/30/2014	I have supported OPIN and their incredible work, for years.  Their service to the animals, Stamford Animal control and the public goes beyond the average non-profit organization.  They are amazing and deserve recognition!
OPIN	218180	1	/users/profile/281734	Alison32	Client Served	5	09/29/2014	OPIN is a wonderful organization that fosters, adopts out, protects, loves, and advocates primarily for needy, displaced, and deserving animals  The founders and volunteers are organized, professional, beyond dedicated, and passionate, and are committed to working with the community to promote the absolute best outcomes.  A+.
OPIN	218174	3	/users/profile/281725	LisaS203	Volunteer	5	09/29/2014	OPIN is all about the animals and their happiness and well being.  Truly  caring and compassionate organization always looking out for the voiceless animals.  I recently started fostering dogs with them.  They ensure the animals have the best medical care if needed and go to loving forever homes.
OPIN	218156	3	/users/profile/281706	Diana N.	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2014	As a resident of Stamford and animal lover, I am extrmeley impressed by what OPIN does to keep Stamford's pets safe, healthy and out of the shelters.  All 6 of my pets have been microchipped for FREE thanks OPIN's free microchipping events.  I have since gotten to know Ali Gerardi, but the first time I met her she offered to cover the costs of neutering my pitbull. When my dog seemed stressed, Ali personally called me, offered me advice and invited me to OPIN's free dog training classes on Wednesdays. The organization as a whole is extremely involved and beneficial to the community.  Keep up the good work!
OPIN	218154	3	/users/profile/281703	Woohoo	Volunteer	5	09/29/2014	The most passionate and dedicated group of truly amazing people. The best interest of the animals is always top priority.

OPIN	205207	2	/users/profile/267326	Jeanne31	Volunteer	5	07/05/2014	Since my move to Stamford 30 years ago I have volunteered for many non-profits. Of all the organizations for which I have given my time and money, OPIN is by the far the one with the most heart for their cause. Outreach to Pets in Need is just that. Reaching out and helping prospective or current pet owners and their pets. Whether helping with medical costs, food, low-cost neutering/spay programs, training and education, fostering, SafePet program with DVCC (Domestic Violence Crisis Center) everything they do, they do with both their hearts and their heads. They have assisted in so many fosters and adoptions. I am so proud to be a part of this totally volunteer-run organization. 
OPIN	177265	2	/users/profile/233799	Angela68	Volunteer	5	10/13/2013	Everyone at OPIN are making a huge difference in the lives of so many animals! It's a privilege to help out. The most compassionate caring individuals!

OPIN	175285	1	/users/profile/231625	mrsbolla	Volunteer	5	10/08/2013	OPIN, is the fundraising arm of Stamford Animal care and Control, without this wonderful Animal Rescue Group, I'm not sure that SACC would be a no-kill shelter. This Non-Profit is completely volunteer and they give their time, money and love to the unwanted pets that come into SACC . They personally get to know each and evey one of the animals thus ensuring they can find them new loving permament homes.
OPIN	174781	2	/users/profile/231089	Heather Craig	Volunteer	5	10/07/2013	Our community is plagued, as many other communities are, by a unstoppable flood of homeless pets.  OPIN is a perfect example of how an organization can bring a community together to provide stop-gap measures that allow the Stamford Animal Shelter remain a no-kill shelter.  The OPIN volunteers are inexhaustible in their efforts to provide homes, medical treatment, food and funding for the shelter and foster animals.   With the help of their volunteers, the local veterinary hospitals, foster parents and constant fundraising and awareness events, OPIN is a shining beacon for the City of Stamford and surrounding areas.  I am proud to call myself an OPIN volunteer.
OPIN	174732	1	/users/profile/231038	EliseJ	Client Served	5	10/07/2013	OPIN is an example of the very best of a local non-profit having grassroots impact improving the lives of animals in the community. The leadership of the non-profit is excellent and incredibly responsive, and they have been extremely helpful working with animals in need.  The organization truly goes above and beyond and I am supremely confident that every dollar given to OPIN is maximized in value and goes to help animals.  
OPIN	174160		/users/profile/230369	Sally43	General Member of the Public	4	10/05/2013	I helped out at OPIN functions several times and I also know the co-director personally.

I highly recommend supporting OPIN!
OPIN	174025		/users/profile/230241	Judy88	General Member of the Public	5	10/05/2013	My friend Jenny (co-founder) of OPIN gives so much time and energy to help animals in need. These amazing groups of volunteers help animals in need and no challenge is too big for them to tackle. They resolve the problems for each animal with medical care and adoptions. They also have programs such as spray/neuter and also have micro chipping during the year. They also offer free training classes at the Stamford Animal Shelter. OPIN is a wonderful non-profit organization that does amazing work for our area in Stamford. Kudos to this wonderful group of caring people with their loving hearts for all they do for our four legged friends!
OPIN	174000		/users/profile/230216	cynmarc	Volunteer	5	10/05/2013	Just started volunteering recently, everyone I have met who is affiliated with OPIN is dedicatedbeyond belief!

OPIN	173928		/users/profile/230090	Lori80	Client Served	4	10/04/2013	My husband and I adopted our second furbaby from the Stamford Animal Care and Control and we still have her as a family member.  She is an all white with a black patch American Bull Dog mix  and she is just a wonderful member of our family.  We were insulted when we were asked to come to the shelter twice to meet Chloe.  We had a resident dog who was dog selective.  Maybe they seen something on the first visit that we did not.  So we returned a second time, driving about one hundred miles to pick up Chloe.  OPIN is a great organization who truly care about the animals and the state of repair that the shelter is in at any given time.  They are PAWSOME 
OPIN	173826		/users/profile/229975	Gaby P.	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I first started going to the Stamford Animal Shelter about 4 years ago to make donations of food and other needed items.  Eventually, I adopted an old dog who had been dubbed "Grandpa" but I changed to "Rufus."  Thru OPIN, Rufus was micro chipped.  When Rufus finally succumbed to his deteriorating health due to old age and I had to let him go, I received touching condolence cards from Laurie Hollywood and the wonderful people of OPIN.  They never forget an animal that comes through the shelter doors.  I recently started volunteering my time at the shelter and I'm inspired by the total devotion that's so evident from the members of this wonderful organization.  Just this past Wednesday, during the training session that's provided free of charge to the community, there were so many volunteers present that I think practically every dog at the shelter had a person to either guide them through the training or take them for a walk around the grounds.  It was absolutely heartwarming.  I, in turn, am now devoted to them.  Rock on, OPIN.

Everyone at OPIN gives tirelesslessly of there time and love for the well being of animals through this organization. Keep up your wonderful work! I was thrilled to be able to have my cat microchipped at a free OPIN clinic a year ago.  Tried but can't answer the questions below re volunteering/contributing or impact organization has, sorry.

OPIN	173469		/users/profile/229614	bfox	General Member of the Public	5	10/04/2013	I don't know how they do it!   I read the posts on facebook and it breaks my heart  .... partly because of some of the inhumane situations these poor animals come from but mostly because I am too emotional a person to volunteer and make a difference as these people do on a daily basis. They dedicate their life to helping the helpless....there is a place in heavan for them as well as the animals (and people) they bring so much happiness too! I can't say any more than that! 
OPIN	173460		/users/profile/229602	jburnett	Donor	5	10/04/2013	My family have been volunteers / adopters / donors to the Stamford Animal Care & Control shelter for 20 years.  When OPIN came into existence, there was a remarkable improvement in the care, publicity and efforts to get the dogs and cats at the shelter good medical care and publicity to get them adopted.  I can't even begin to illuminate how much OPIN has improved the quality of life for the animals at the shelter, and hopefully for the staff as well.  These animals desperately needed someone on their side, and not just someone doing a job.  OPIN, and the addition of the great Laurie Hollywood as shelter director, has made all the difference for the animals.  OPIN is a true grass roots organization run by dedicated volunteers.  If OPIN doesn't qualify as a "Great Nonprofit" then no one does.  
OPIN	173317		/users/profile/229460	Cfa072009	Donor	5	10/04/2013	I met OPIN through a Facebook posting that was sent to me about a shelter who had rescued a pit bull whose body was covered in burns and whose two pups had died in the same fire.  I read Lucy's story and fell in love and donated to the care for this wounded baby.  They posted updates of Lucy's progress right up to her adoption by twin sisters who were vet techs who cared for Lucy.  I continue to donate because it is clear they make a difference and they engage their donors, rare for a nonprofit.  I continue to stay apprised of their recent works, and in fact donated again yesterday.  I have never been their, but when I was verifying who they were the Executive Director  took the time to speak with me on the phone and explain their mission.  I only wish I lived in Connecticut and closer to their facility.

I'm so thankful to be a part of such a dedicated group of people that work non stop to help save, protect and nurture needy animals that would otherwise perish at the hands of shelters and unfit owners.  I can truly say that OPIN does the work and performs the miracles of angels. Thanks to the knowledge they share,  I have been able to educate family and friends on the importance of adoption and to make them aware of the need to commit to doing their part to save the lives of other unfortunate animals.  Thanks OPIN for all you do - I am proud to be able to play a part in your efforts.

This group of dedicated voulunteers in conjunction with The Stamford Animal Shelter do amazing work with an attitude that no challenge is too big. They resolve the problems for individual dogs with special medical needs or adoptions as well as the local Stamford, CT area pet population with programs such as spray/neuter, and micro chipping. We have not encountered a better run local non profit in our many years of supporting various organizations. Hopefully future years of support will allow them to help even more of the animals that are desperately in need of our help.   Mike & Kathy A.

She had cancer 2 times and had a growth removed and was also spayed. Opin even found donors to help pay for her operations--just amazing! Princess never would have survived if it wasnt for Opin. They found her wandering the streets and in very bad condition.  They are incredible people full of love and compassion       They made sure she was well nurtured and even got her a foster mother to help her transition to a fur-ever home..    They made sure that I would provide a decent home for this poor traumatized dog.  Opin even delivered her to me on that special heartwarming day when I met these beautiful people!!

OPIN	144472		/users/profile/191008	Leslie Y.	General Member of the Public	5	11/29/2012	The volunteers from OPIN work tirelessly to help homeless dogs and cats in Stamford. They recently organized a free microchip clinic with the cooperation of a local car dealership that volunteered the space. The OPIN volunteers spend a great deal of time at the shelter facilitation adoptions, giving quality time walking and TLC with the animals.  The shelter is a rundown dump, but because of OPIN it is bursting with LOVE. Many of the dogs are pit bulls difficult to place but the OPIN volunteers see through the perception and even organize weekly, free, dog training classes.

OPIN	144289		/users/profile/190811	bauers2	Client Served	5	11/29/2012	We were connected with our beloved pet Murphy through OPIN.    Murphy was 9 1/2 yrs old, and over 90 pounds when we got him.   His owner was a Vietnam Vet who had taken ill and was unable to continue to care for him.   After place after place told the owner that Murphy would have to be euthanized because of his big size and advanced age, he found OPIN.   They found Murphy foster homes; bought him bedding; and took note of his habits so they could educate his new people including improving his eating habits.   They took photos of him and used their connections with the Stamford Animal Control to  get the word out about this wonderful dog.  They screened us carefully.   They brought him to our house and made sure it was a good connection before leaving him with us.   They checked in on him throughout our time together.  Without OPIN Murphy would have senselessly been killed because he was big and old.   Because of OPIN we just had 3 1/2 fantastic years with a loving companion.  We will be forever grateful for all their efforts with Murphy and trusting us with him.  We will definitely contact them when we're ready to adopt again.
OPIN	144151		/users/profile/175268	Rescue1	Client Served	5	11/29/2012	We have always known about OPIN, and always adopted rescue animals, but recently worked with OPIN to adopt Jack, a 10 year old beagle that OPIN found wandering the streets.  They took him in, saw to his health care (24 of his teeth had to be pulled) and put him in a wonderful foster home, where we found him.  We were allowed to foster him for a bit to see if he fit in with our other two dogs and our cat, and then decided to adopt him.  OPIN was great through the whole process, I think the work they do is selfless and amazing.  We learned about a free micro chipping they were doing and got one of our other dogs micro chipped a few weeks ago.  I would recommend them to anyone looking to adopt a dog or cat.  RESCUES ROCK!!

They found me my "new best friend", and did an careful follow up after the adoption as well.  Their SNIP program has reduced the number of unwanted pets in the area as well.  They also do a great job on Facebook communicating about available pets.  This group has literally changed my life.... many thanks to them.
OPIN	143361	1	/users/profile/189814	Anya K.	Volunteer	5	11/27/2012	Outreach to Pets in Need is by far the best non profit i have been involved in thus far. The events they hold for the community are run entirely by volunteers and have an enormous impact. One that sticks out in my mind the most is the free micro chip clinic. Without micro chips, the vast majority of dogs and cats that get lost will never return home. There are vets that will charge upwards of a hundred dollars to microchip your animal. Instead, OPIN did it for free for anyone in the community. The money they raise at various other events goes towards putting programs such as this micro chip clinic into action. The volunteers all care so much about the animals that they are helping and they help make the lives of the animals in Stamford Animal Control so much happier. Before volunteering with OPIN, i thought i would never be able to volunteer at a shelter because it would make me too sad, but instead, i leave every time and feel so much happier that these animals were able to bond with a human and have good experiences with people, especially because so many of them have suffered under the hands of humans in the past. Not to mention the fostering that OPIN tries to do for as many animals as possible. Every dog that I have seen go through the shelter and then become a foster pet makes a huge transformation. You see the glimmer reappear in their eyes and they become all around happier animals, making it more likely that they will get adopted, and then in turn, another shelter dog will be fostered. I can't say enough about the impact OPIN has made on my life and the bonds i have made through this organization, both animal and human. 
OPIN	131720	1	/users/profile/177299	OPIN Vollie	Volunteer	5	10/31/2012	I've seen how OPIN has made a huge improvement for the Stamford Animal Shelter pets.  They have provided good quality pet food, leashes, training collars, shade tarps for the dog runs, fly deterrents products for the Summer when flies are just biting dogs everywhere, doggie swimming-pools, water buckets for the kennels, dog coats for the winter, adoption vests, dog & cat toys, cleaning and office supplies, folders and important literature for adoption packages, wall boards for notices, adoption photos, information to volunteers, etc.,  They list all the adoptable pets on PetFinder and advertise them through Facebook, anything they can do to find these pets a good loving home, they do it.  The list goes on and they are always looking to improve the conditions and promote the adoptions of pets.  I am so happy to be a part of their work and mission to "putting a stop to pet homelessness".
OPIN	131684	1	/users/profile/177258	OPIN Cares	Board Member	5	10/31/2012	OPIN has been and continues to be the only group that provides the primary vet care for all the Stamford Shelter pets, which have meant for many pets a second chance in life.  Vet care such as:   a) Preventive meds, treatments and procedures (e.g., vaccines, Heart gard, Frontline, testing and removal of tumors, deworming, dental cleaning and procedures, happy tail treatment, spaying/neutering rabbits, etc.)b) Curative meds, treatments and procedures done by a general vet (e.g., kennel cough, broken legs, ACLs, ear infections, ear oblations for extreme ear infections, allergies, chronic conditions such as Lupus, etc.)c) Specialist visits, surgeries and treatments, some of the most used by the Shelter:  Orthopedist, Ophthalmologists, Dermatologist, Neurologist and Oncologists d) Physical therapy such as swimming therapy and manual exercises to strengthen musclesAll of this care is not covered by the City budget and therefore would have been denied to these amazing pets if OPIN did not provide it.  Thanks to OPIN and it's amazing donors and supporters!!!
OPIN	131675	2	/users/profile/177249	Alexandra P.	Board Member	5	10/31/2012	As a Volunteer and Board Member of OPIN, I've worked closely with the connection OPIN has with the Stamford Animal Shelter.  There are so so many different ways that OPIN has supported the Shelter and the one that I am involved with most is the dog training, evaluation and professional home training sessions that are offered to each adoptable Shelter dog.  In an effort to improve the chances of the Shelter dogs being adopted, prevent adopted dogs from coming back, and keeping non-shelter dogs from entering the pound, OPIN pays for weekly training classes taught by a professional behaviorist. These classes are for the Shelter dogs, but are open to the public and other dogs 'free-of-charge'. OPIN also finances the temperament evaluations of every dog at the Shelter. And, OPIN pays for two private training sessions at home for dogs adopted at the shelter. The evaluations, as well as the home sessions, are done by professional trainers. This alone has made a tremendous difference and makes me so proud to be a part of this amazing group.
OPIN	130547	2	/users/profile/176019	jennycolucci	Board Member	5	10/28/2012	Since 2007, thanks to the generous support of the animal lovers and donors in Stamford and the surrounding communities, OPIN has been able to financially support the Stamford Animal Shelter animals with such things as medical care, foster care, supplies, medications, mciro-chipping, dog training, dog evaluations, advertising, website assistance, public awareness, post adoption in-home dog training and volunteer help.  Working with the Stamford Shelter Director, Ms. Laurie Hollywood, we have been able to offer the public outreach programs such as FREE weekly dog training classes, education, low-cost spay neuter programs, FREE micro-chipping, medical assistance, foster care for victims of domestic violence and special benefits to military veterans adopting an animal.   We have done so much already but there is so much more to do.   Thank you supporters.  Thank your for making Stamford, CT the best municipal shelter in the State of CT.  We look forward to helping to build a better city shelter.
Pet Assistance Inc	323487		/users/profile/288746	fspups	Client Served	5	02/20/2017	Shamrock,  a just turned 12 year old Springer Spaniel and just the sweetest baby, was originally rescued from Hurricane Katrina with her sister, Clover.  After waiting 18 months to see if their family would be found, I was finally able to adopt them.  I took extra care with their health.  Clover was the healthy one, but Shamrock always had something: stomach issues, cherry eye, small benign tumors.  But even being diligent and getting regular health check-ups didn't prevent her sister Clover from dying in 2015 from liver cancer.  So I now I have Shamrock and watch her carefully but even all that couldn't have prepared me for her bleeding from the mouth.  An emergency vet visit resulted in her needing surgery to remove a lump the size of a tootsie roll pop from the back of her tongue.  Problem was she was diagnosed on a Saturday and operated first thing Monday morning, so most places that might have helped with the financial situation said no because the surgery had already happened.  But not Ruth at Pet Assistance, Inc.!  She was willing to consider my predicament!  Now since the surgery, other issues have cropped up and of course the vet wants his payment.  Ruth understood the difficulty and came to my aid for Shamrock.  I see Shamrock getting better every day and cannot thank Ruth enough for helping me give her a treatments so she has a chance to live. It is hard when an animals life hangs in the balance based on finances.  Mine are so limited now due to Social Security which barely covers regular expenses and increases in Medicare take a big bite out of that.  I once was a writer and editor by trade but with everyone using the internet, the services I provided are readily available all over the net and the books I have written get lost in the millions now available. Thanks to  Ruth and her Pet Assistance Inc.  Shamrock  has gotten treatment and I am not in the financial dog house for the rest of my life!

Pet Assistance Inc	309163		/users/profile/400522	Jennifer593	Client Served	5	10/09/2016	My cat  Ally whom I've had for 12 years, was diagnosed with diabetes in August of this year. It just out of the blue, she started losing weight rapidly and acting strangely.  She drank water like she couldn't get enough and hid in my back bathroom from everyone.  She bearly ate and quit grooming herself.  A vet that could get us in on short notice told me it was a UTI and medicated her, but she didn't recover so I took her to our family vet who worked hard tosqueeze us in. Our veterinarian told me she had diabetes and had to do several tests to look for any kidney or pancreas damage among other things.  I suffered a stroke 8 years ago this month and have been on disability since. When I first started rescuing animals, I had a wonderful job and didn't fear the unexpected.  I desperately needed some help with these tests. I couldn't fathom putting my sweet Ally to sleep because she was diabetic and I wasn't able to provide all she needed right away. I too am diabetic so our strong bond....had new glue. I sat up all night long searching the internet for help and I found Pet Assistance Inc. I wrote a letter and they answered my plea for help right away. They had me fill out the application and send pictures of my sweet girl.  We talked about the details of the testing,  my love of my furry children,  and several other things. They were truly interested my my Ally. Well, they approved us and went through my veterinarian to set everything up.  Ally is back to her old self again. Gaining weight,  socializing,  playing and taking her shots like a trooper.  Pet Assistance Inc saved her life. They gave us both a new start and saved me from having to say goodbye to this vibrant girl. I just can't thank them enough. Jennifer Longdail Yuma Az

I searched and searched for help for our baby girl. She has been with us almost 13 years. As i searched locally for assistance, and after many "no's" I emailed Pet Assistance. Ruth contacted me and there help saved our dogs life. Ruth got in touch with the veterinary and agreed to help. It was amazing after searching for so long, the quickness in which Ruth responded. It is because of Pet Assistance that our Scooter was able to get her surgery. Ruth even talked with the vet and we are now paying off the bill at $25 a month. There is no way we could of afforded the surgery, and after it was done, it was quite a bit more than we though it was going to be. I spoke with Ruth on the phone. I didn't realize it was 10:30 at night (her time) but not only did she help, she paid more that the original ammount she said she could help us with. Just talking with her helped us at this very scary time.  Scooter is now healed from her surgery and doing very well. If not for the kindness she showed, I fear Scooter would not be with us now. This is an amazing organization and I urge anyone who can, to donate to Pet Assistance.They really do help and they were a light in our darkness and we will be forever grateful, Ruth and Jim

My baby (Dog), began to have trouble urinating on a weekend. I got him into a vet, to find out he had bladder stones and needed immediate surgery or he would not make it. The amount of the surgery was way beyond my means, and the only other option was euthanization. I was told to go home and think it over, say my goodbyes if no other option, and then contact them back. I was able to contact Ruth who, not only talked to me like a human being with care and compassion, but she also was able to help towards his remaining medical care, and even had other organizations to contact to help towards it as well. She has kept in contact to check on my fur baby, and he and I are so grateful for her and this organization.  Thank you Ruth and Pet Assistance for giving me and Bubby the support so that he can live longer with me and that I did not have to make the devastating decision to chose between medical care or death for him.

It was later in the evening in San Diego when I emailed Pet Assistance, since I was worried about him and in a major financial bind.  Not only did I get a call from Ruth at Pet Assistance right away, but she advised me to get Jackson to a vet immediately.  I quickly picked up on her concern and that she truly cared.  I was able to find a vet that was open after normal business hours, had him checked out, they performed what they needed to get done for him, gave me his medication and Ruth with Pet Assistance took care of the rest so I could focus on getting him better.  I cannot begin to express the relief of finding such a valuable non-profit.  It is a terrible feeling with your fur baby isn't doing well and you do not have the money to get them the help that they need.  And my older ginger cat who is also having health issues would miss his warm snuggles every night.  So far he is healing well and Ruth has checked in asking how he is doing several times.

Zeus is a 3 year old Rottweiler who has had Addison's Disease for 2 years, and is newly diagnosed with Diabetes. Pet Assistance helped Zeus with his medical expenses and we are just so amazingly gracious for the grant that Ruth provided. I hope that when I am in the position to do so, I can offer a donation so other companion animals may have Pet Assistance as well. Thank you for helping Zeus recover and feel better. We love him and cannot imagine life without our "sweet boy."

Not only was the application process understandable but the contact with a live person, Ruth, was excellent.  While waiting for the surgery date she helped me find other organizations that could assist.  Not only that she was a wealth of knowledge when asking me about the vet and his practice and what to look for and what costs are necessary and were not. She was with me from the beginning to the end. Without her my baby boy Elvis the Rat Terrier would not be on his way to a full recovery and a long life.  He still has his cone on and is refusing to let that stop him from trying to play fetch or even soccer.  THANK YOU SO MUCH

Just before Christmas 2015, he became lethargic and seriously ill; upon examination, it was discovered that he had an intestinal blockage and pancreatitis (caused by blockage).  Sammy needed emergency surgery, but we just didnt have the money to spare.  If it had not been for Pet Assistance, we would have had no choice but to humanely euthanize my young canine friend. A HUGE thank you to Ruth and Pet Assistance, Inc. for your support, for giving us a future with Sam & for enabling a lifelong friendship for these two (picture of Parker & Sammy heading out for a hike).  May your charity be as blessed as those whom you have served!

Pet Assistance Inc. helped me with Gar's surgery bill and now the stress over payment is one less major worry as my boy recovers.

I've never been so touched by and impressed with a charity's involvement in a benefactor's well-being.

Long story short, I didn't have the money & could not foresee when I would.  When needed, Ruth stepped up with a generous donation which made it all possible.  Quick, efficient & most of all, caring.  Providing help when needed.  How else do you rate a charity organization, but on results?  This one is a winner!!!      Gratefully, Riley & Jerry

His owner was able to pay for the staples, the pain meds and antibiotics, But failed to get a cone for the dog. The next day Mojo had gotten all of the staples out of his head and when I saw it, It was already getting infected. Because the gash was so big I thought he would need to get it re stapled but his owner couldn't afford it and neither could I. I offered to take the dog so he could heal at my house and get his meds twice a day and I bought a cone for him, and I started looking into organizations that could help get the staples put back in when I got an email back from pet assistance Ruth was very helpful! and gave me a lot of great advice. Mojo ended up healing just fine without needing the staples again. thanks to all the great advice I received Mojo is 100% healed up and doing better than ever! thank you Ruth!

We took him to a vet who did an X-ray which revealed he either had a large tumor or had eaten a foreign object that was lodged. We were told that the next step would require an MRI just to diagnose the problem. The costs for just that (without even knowing what the next step would involve were in the thousands). My husband had been recently laid off and with 4 children we just could afford it. I called almost 20 different places for help and no one would offer any type of assistance.  My last "Hail Mary" call was to Ruth at Pet Assistance. Not only was she willing to help me financially, but she found a Veterinarian who was also willing to help. Ruth being the caring person that she is, met me at the Vets office and helped walk me through everything and continues to follow up with us. Because of her and Pet Assistance, Cooper is doing well and back to his old self.  Without them I really don't know what we would have done! I'm so grateful for everything she's done!

Pet Assistance Inc	252347		/users/profile/340407	KingdomPrincess	Client Served	5	08/10/2015	Dakota, my best friend and rescuer, has suffered an immense amount in his life. I adopted him from a local rescue that rescued him from being locked in a bedroom of an abandoned house. He had physical deformities and, due to the gross negligence of the rescue itself, was a very sick boy. When I picked him up, he had kennel cough so badly that he was near death. We spent the first six months of our relationship on the living room floor together as I stayed with him, comforting him as his body battled violently. Needless to say, a strong bond developed. Once recovered, Dakota, who is a chocolate lab, turned out to be the most fun-loving, loyal, and entertaining dog. Little did I know, the tables were about to turn. A couple years later, I became ill and near death myself. It was Dakota who then became my rescuer, getting me up to eat and take meds. when I couldn't get up on my own, and tenderly offering companionship by my side. I owe my life to my friend. Later in life, Dakota developed fear aggression that was aggravated by becoming epileptic.  After working with many trainers and getting him on the right dosage of seizure meds., he is much better but, can be unpredictable due to the seizures. Later still in his life, he suddenly went lame in one leg. Upon several examinations, it was determined that his entire knee had disintegrated and the tendons around it were torn. The surgery was more costly than i could afford. We are preparing for surgery now thanks to Pet Assistance who offered to help that last portion of what needed to be raised. Most other assistance organizations could not help him either due to lack of funds or because Dakota has multiple issues. It is heartbreaking not being able to help your very best friend. Thanks to Pet Assistance I will be able to get Dakota's much needed surgery and give him the rest of his life pain free. I couldn't be more overjoyed and thankful!

We took him to Applewood and they were so swollen that we had to come back a week later he was on 3 antibotics. After about a week we thought he would be better but the infection was opened and started bleeding and he started crying in pain so we decided to take him to the emergency clinic and they were gonna hospitalize him for 1000 dollars but we couldnt afford it so we had to take the less expensive treatment and bandage it and give him a pain med until the morning to see the daytime vet well thats what we did. We brought him in today and they took him for emergency castration surgery. We could of had very severe consequences if it wasnt treated but with this wonderful charity they helped us get him healed. Yall are such beautiful angels and when I get on my feet I will donate back to this charity. Words cannot explain how thankful I am to get help from your organization.

Of course this had to happen on the weekend, after all regular vet offices were closed in my area. The only place open was the ER facility.  The prices are about double the usual rates.  I didn't have the money to pay for the procedure, and they don't offer payment plans. I was getting desperate,  as Simon's condition worsened.  I spent hours trying to get help with phone calls, and internet applications. Frantic, crying, and desperate, I found Pet Assistance.  I called, and a wonderful woman named Ruth answered.  I was expecting an answering machine, and was surprised to get an actual person.  Ruth asked some questions, and verified my information. In less then 30 minutes she spoke to the ER staff, and  arranged payment for my cat's procedure. During the next few days she gave me advice, and inquiried about Simon. Ruth and Pet Assistance, literally,  saved my cats life. The vet said he wouldnt have made it to morning without the catherization.  I am so grateful to Ruth and Pet Assistance. They were an answer to my prayers, and because of them I still have my little buddy.

I explained that my dog Tootsie a dapple mini dachshund was very sick being seen at the vets in the last two weeks and on antibiotics, prednisone and pain killers for suspected bladder stones. The weekend day my dog Tootsie took at turn for the worse and Ruth suggested that I get the dog to the emergency clinic as soon as possible. I am all alone having recently a massive heart attack and subsequent quadruple bypass surgery.  It was very hard for me and Tootsie was my inspiration every morning to grit me through recovery and then rehabilitation. Always willing to be by my side and walk as much as I could never complaining.  I brought her to the emergency vet and I was very worried about Tootsie and very worried about the charges after hour vets charge. Ruth was there through all of it with me , she talked yo the staff, and to the  vet taking care of Tootsie. She was the friend I needed at this critical time. The vet  said after reading the X-rays she had a  bladder stone stuck in her urethra. I asked what could be fine and the vet explained she had to remove or get the stone pushed back in the bladder or undergo emergency surgery.  I called Ruth and she talked to the vet and she suggested that I approve the vet yo try to free the stone. The procedure was a success and Ruth was there to help pay girl the bill. I font know what I would have done if Ruth was not there for not only emotional support but financial help for Tootsie and  I . I have been out of work since my heart operation and had little funds to spend on vet bills. Ruth and Pet Assistance were there to help me through this difficult time. Tootsie subsequently had to have Bladder surgery to remove the stones. Ruth was there throughout the process with not only financial assistance but that support  that a friend  could give. I am humbled yo know that Ruth and Pet Assistance is there for people and their pets offering financial assistance and compassionate understanding. Tootsie is doing wonderful now, and  we both thank Ruth and Pet Assistance from the bottom of our hearts!

I have witness Maggies determination and persistence in bringing awareness to the plight of cancer patients and their families through the work of Gardnerss House Inc.  I have witness Maggiess determination traveling to New York and Washington DC, in an attempt to bring awareness to her organization and raise funds  to provide better services to cancer patients and their families. The innocence in her work awakened the charitable spirit in me and compels me to support her cause. Maggie is one of the most forever- giving person I have ever met. I enjoy being in the space she dwells. 
Gardner's House Inc	317616	2	/users/profile/245285	Prettynpink	Board Member	5	10/31/2016	Gardner's House Inc is the only organization in the community that is really supporting families affected by all types of cancer with basic needs, there are so many organizations telling us they have support, but when families go for help they set the bar so high the families are not qualify for assistance. The middle class families cannot get help if they owned a house or a good car, or have a spouse working, they have to fall below the poverty level first and then the government will step in. Gardner's House is trying to prevent families  from fall below the poverty level while they are facing cancer. Pleas support this unique  organization, the funds raise go directly to help families with cancer. Thank you

Maggie, founder, is herself a cancer survivor. She works very hard to find and match resources to those in need. She is passionate about what she does and tries to bridge the disparities in services made available to the underserved communities

Maggie, herself a two-time breast cancer survivor has made it her life's work to assist all who are affected by the dreaded disease with basic needs; an aspect in the fight that is too often overlooked or completely ignored. 
Gardner's House Inc	225727	2	/users/profile/289485	amosjack2	Volunteer	5	10/23/2014	I am amazed by dedication and commitment of Gardners house members and volunteers in reaching out to cancer patients and their families with encouragement, financial and emotional support in the Hartford Connecticut area. I recently attended Gardners House  annual pretty n Pink fundraising  event. I heard the names of those who have lost the battle, and saw the faces of those who are still fighting the battle, I was overwhelm with a sense of   I need to do more to help  Gardners House Inc help more cancer patients and their families. This disease is claiming too many of our brightest people. I wish more people and organizations can contribute to Gardners House Inc, so we can celebrate  those who have triumph over cancer.
Gardner's House Inc	225438	1	/users/profile/289213	Teaparty5	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2014	I got to know Maggie  when I was looking for an organization to do a fundraiser for. Maggie and Gardner's are well thought off and know in the community because of the tremendous work she does. I was really impressed that she is able to reach so many women and their families basically working on her own. Gardner's house is one of the only places that I know of in the area that speak to unique needs of women of color affected by cancer. Thank you Maggie for all that you do!
Gardner's House Inc	217706		/users/profile/281245	Dbest	General Member of the Public	5	09/26/2014	Maggie Gardner of Gardner's House is the only one that I know of in our city who provides assistance to not only the cancer survivor, but the family as well.  She assists families in finding services to address a variety of basic needs that become dire when a cancer patient loses the ability to provide financial and/or emotional stability for themselves and/or their families.  There are times when Ms. Gardner spends her own money to help someone in need.  She is one of the most caring, kind and generous souls I have had the pleasure of knowing!

The founder, Maggie Gardner, is gem. She is a down-to-earth, easy to talk to person who works tirelessly towards her goal of helping others. The world needs more people like Ms. Maggie! As a volunteer, I can say that she has truly changed my outlook on life and made me a better person. I highly recommend this organization to anyone looking for a volunteer opportunity or to anyone who's been affected by cancer. Please make a donation if you can...Gardner's House and the people it serves could surely use the help!

Gardner's House Inc	216058		/users/profile/279501	Maggie38	Board Member	5	09/20/2014	As a cancer survivor my self, I do understand the need for support services and basic need for people affected by cancer. The people in the Hartford and surrounding area are in great need of an organization like Gardner's House Inc, there  are so many young women who are being diagnose with  cancer and have know one to turn to on their level, some have died and leave young children behind. Thank God for a place such as Gardner's House Inc, who welcome every one who are affected by cancer know matter what type of cancer.They all are affected in the same way. I am so proud of the organization for standing up on behalf of those who can not stand up for them self.I am praying that more people support GHI so more people can be helped.
Gardner's House Inc	215898		/users/profile/46304	bcolombe	Board Member	5	09/19/2014	Gardner's House, continues to  provide valuable support services to the underserved of the Hartford Area with particular emphasis on the African American and Caribbean communities.  Its president, Maggie Gardner, has received numerous awards from the civic and other organizations in Hartford, and has been recognized as both Woman of the Year and Business of the Year.  She has a personal experience and understanding of the local  resources for both physical and mental support available to cancer patients and their families.  She is a contact point for food and household goods distribution, and for referrals to medical and other personal services. She continues to expand her contacts with other charitable organizations in the area.  She supports the needs of both individuals and families who have been impacted by cancer and is, herself, a most valuable resource.  
Gardner's House Inc	45410	11	/users/profile/46304	bcolombe	Board Member	5	06/24/2010	Maggie Gardner was there for my mother in her last years, providing her with a loving and supporting presence and aid.  Now Maggie seeks to give that support to others who find themselves with no one to help with the basics of life desperately needed in order to survive and heal.  Despite the existence of Social Workers, Departments, Committees and the like, Society has turned its back on these cancer survivers who have lost everything as a consequence of their fight with this disease. Gardner's House will be a refuge in this struggle for survival with dignity.  It will provide needed referrals to compassionate people and resources, those known to deliver from Maggie's own experience in fighting her cancer.  With a proper facility that hopefully will be obtained soon, Gardner's House will be able to provide shelter to those in need, healing meals and practical and emotional support for these victims of their disease and society's indifference.
Gardner's House Inc	215014		/users/profile/278340	Latissa	Volunteer	5	09/14/2014	GHI is a great place to start if you are looking to do something meaningful to help Cancer survivors and their families.  Founder/CEO Maggie Gardner works tirelessly to make sure that those who need the services of food and rent or mortgage assistance or  advocacy, resources or special gifts or assistance, actually get it.  She needs more monetary support to accomplish this.  It is horrible to have to turn someone in need away!  Maggie has survived this disease twice and truly understands what it takes to live with adversity and beat the odds.  I commend GHI for the positive service that it provides to the community everyday.  Latissa Jackson
Gardner's House Inc	210053	1	/users/profile/272794	Senise	General Member of the Public	5	08/11/2014	There is no other nonprofit in the Hartford area that provides the kind of service that Gardner House provides to families that are devasted and sometimes decimated by cancer.  I applaud Maggie Gardner for her insight and complete devotion to her work!

Gardner's House Inc	127895		/users/profile/46972	tropic17	Volunteer	5	10/23/2012	Fantastic organization--reaching out to those with limited means who have cancer and providing practical guidance, support, and kindness in times of great need.
Gardner's House Inc	46087	7	/users/profile/46972	tropic17	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2010	My connection with Gardner's House was forged from shared experience of having loved ones who have bravely faced the rigors of cancer diagnosis, illness, and treatment. I was connected to Ms. Gardner while beginning my own research in this area as a Yale faculty member. As a two-time cancer survivor herself, I was immediately struck by Ms. Gardner's insight, compassion, and unwavering commitment to persons seeking assistance through her services. She has correctly identified "basic" needs--i.e., money for food, shelter, and transportation--as a key to assisting those who face cancer in the context of already limited resources. She tirelessly advocates for services to this end; to expand the efforts against cancer to move beyond a search for cures, to include the considerations of survivorship and quality of life for those living with, or in the wake of, illness experience, their lives forever transformed. Ms. Gardner's experience is unquestionable, her knowledge of extant resources encyclopedic, coupled with her inspiration and vision, she and her organization are uniquely positioned within the realm of survivorship services, to address needs that have heretofore gone unmet with the Hartford community, and beyond.
Gardner's House Inc	125389		/users/profile/43705	gardners-house-inc	Volunteer	5	10/15/2012	Serving at Gardner's House Inc is a great oppertunity to be a part of some thing wnderfull, watching hope come alive in the eyes of cancer survivors is priceless, Gardner's House is fantastic
Gardner's House Inc	43152	11	/users/profile/43705	gardners-house-inc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/07/2010	There is a great need here in (Hartford one of the poorest city in tha country)/ North east, for support services and basic need, for people who are facing Cancer, i know first hand the devastation it causes to one life, when proper resorces are not in place to assist you to get through these dark times.  life as you know it is no more, who can we count on, where do we go, just to stay alive, to stay off the street, to be able to help our children and our families, there is no place, that is a one stop shop for us. We are rejected , we are not qualify for help with basic needs unless we are lying flat on our faces, even tho we have worked and contribute to the system, it punishes us for doing that. This is why Gardner's House Inc was born to bridge the gap between the patient and the person, you cannot treat one and not the other, we are one of the same.
Gardner's House Inc	124813		/users/profile/47018	happy2	General Member of the Public	4	10/08/2012	GARDNER'S HOUSE INC Is in my opinion an organisation that is very needed in these times. I am familiar with Maggie and  i am amaze at the stories of how help is being offered. No one knows the need until one is in the situation and have noway to turn to for help. it is unreal when you need help the most that there is noway to turn. No one seem's to care but there is hope at Gardener's House Inc . One voice one person at a time .  I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS ORGANISATION.
Gardner's House Inc	46138	5	/users/profile/47018	happy2	General Member of the Public	4	06/28/2010	It is a great joy to write a review about Gardner's House because I have sat down with Maggie on multiple occasions as she discuss and show to me the work and future goals for Gardner's House.Maggie has a heart for the people especially those living and suffering with cancer.  This is a personal project for Maggie and the workers and volunteers of Gardner's House because not only is Maggie experiencing and living as a survivor of cancer but she has also live with the fact of friends and family who has pass on with this disease.  I must applaud Gardner's House in the tremendous work they are doing to help patients and their family to go through what they are going through.  I had the great privilege of spending 2009 thanksgiving with Maggie and her phone never stop ringing with persons who just needed words of advice and encouragement.  I was very amaze at the big Heart she has because even though she had family around on this day, she still found the time to spend with these people because she consider them as family and I realize there and then that family never gives up on family no matter who or where they come from.Gardner's House is a place where you can never be alone.  They fight for you even when all your strength is gone.  They will make all your phone calls and do all your running around to ensure you receive all the help there is possible.  If I had a million dollars and I had to choose a non profit organization to give it to, without a shadow of a doubt one hundred percent I will give it to Gardner's House.  So I will urge all who are reading this review, I Know in some way or another cancer has affected your life whether through family, friends. co-workers, neighbor etc. so if there is any way you can help Gardner's House, please do so and to the friends and family of Gardner's House keep up the great work.  God bless you!!!!love Kim.

She. being a survivor herself knows the difficulties she has encountered trying to get the proper medical care and services.  She is very compassionate and has a great zest for life. Although she has encountered numerous obstacles in her life, she is very optimistic that things will get better.  She has made great sacrifices to help others even when it seemed as if she was not getting any help. There were times when she drove people to doctor's appointments, when she didn't feel too great, but she sacrificed her well being to help others who were going through their own ordeal. She has helped numerous individuals who had no where to turn and  continues to give 100% of herself and services towards educating the public on the impact of supports and healthcare on a cancer patient and their families. Gardner's House is truly an organization that truly cares about people and prides themselves on being there for those in need.
Gardner's House Inc	122315		/users/profile/166561	tinybubbles55	Client Served	5	09/14/2012	When I was at my lowest in life God sent Maggie into my life  she is always there to listen and try to help . Many times I am feeling  over whelmed and  shut in Maggie calls to check on me or say would you like to go here or there with me just getting out makes so much of a difference in me.  even though Maggie  has medical issues herself she always tries to put other peoples  needs first. I was the first person of Gardner's House Inc. and have volunteered for many things to help. Maggie organizes Christmas parties for the children and adults with cancer so that they have a nice Christmas. I am  hoping  by writing this that someone out there may read this and help  further the good of Gardner's House  we just got an office but need furniture we need a van for transportation so we all can do things together   even to just be able to grocery shop most of the cancer patients in Gardner's House do not drive or have transportation. Maggie uses her own car and Gas to do all this . I would also like to say I am very disappointed with the Komen Foundation for all the Years we  at Gardner's House  have volunteered and  help support  you. You have not helped us at all. God Bless you Maggie love Elizabeth Hird
Gardner's House Inc	122279		/users/profile/166514	bwcolombe	Board Member	5	09/13/2012	I am a Board Member of Gardner's House and proud to be!  Maggie Gardner spends all of her waking hours in the service of other cancer victims, helping them to survive when the usual social service networks have turned them away.  She fights for their right to a clean place to live, to keep the electricity on,  to obtain nutritious food and to keep the families functioning together as they fight this disease.  People who cannot afford their medicine, who are about to be evicted, who need money and help with a visa for passage to the states to seek medical aid, to keep their children in a proper environment - these are just a few of the situations of the people she has helped.  Gardner's House is their refuge and Maggie Gardner their angel here on earth.  If would be wonderful if no one needed Gardner's House, but fortunatly, it is there for those afflicted with cancer and who are losing hope.  By her example,  she gives people the means to regain their spirit and strength, knowing there is someone who cares and can help.

At the time when you need the support the most it is glad to know that there is someone you can count on. Indeed Maggie has struggled to get support for Gardner's House, and continues to do so, despite her own personal struggles. Maggie with Gardner's house has help many persons with no way else to turn, needing support and comfort.I have no doubt that the organization will grow from strenght to strenght with God's help.

Have know here for quite some time I can honestly say that believes in her cause and has unwavering commitment to  people not just persons seeking assistance through her services, but any person need help. Maggie is there. As a two-time cancer survivor she selflessly advocates for services to broaden the current  efforts against cancer by moving  beyond research for cures, to include the considerations of survivorship and quality of life for those living with, and their families. Gardner's House is doing some tremendous work help cancer patients and their family understand and cope with this illness. Even during the many radio interviews her issues of concern and advocacy are for better quality of care so ordinary people can have a life even after surviving cancer.

That is why I will continue to help as best as I can.

I was forced to live in Hartford's North End. I moved into an apartment with just my clothes and an old couch I was given to sleep on. I was fighting for my disability and living on SAGA $206 a month. I could not get any help anywhere everyone kept saying I am sorry but we can't help you . CRT told me I made to little money for them to help me.  In final desperation I called Senator Eric Coleman Office and his Secetary told me about this great lady who was trying to help cancer survivors Her name was Maggie Gardner and that I was her first referral she gave me her number and I called her she was the most caring and sweet person gave me numbers and contacts to call one was Congressman Larson office I called got his secetary Lisa she was an angel they helped me get my disability hearing  Maggie took me to my hearing and stayed with me. meeting Maggie my angel must have been gods will. even though I am still cancer free I still struggle daily to meet basic needs.

When in need of help after being injured in a mortar attack in Iraq no one was there to help me. I reach out to several other non profits including the wounded warrior program and all had one reason or another that they couldn't help. WVFV found me and to my surprise flew down to FL from Connecticut without blinking an eye. I was taken back at their kindness and generosity of time spent on me. The time they spent on me was well worth it. I later went on from pulling myself out of a hole to running one of the most successful agro-business programs in the country. I was later awarded several awards for my community work including the second highest award in the country the 2013 Presidential Citizens medal, the Florida "citizens service before self" by the congressional medal of honor, "Good Person of the Year" award and several more. WVFV mission is clear and effective and has since help thousands of veterans like myself with getting their lives back on track.

I'm a disabled OIF/OEF veteran, with extensive physical disabilities from service connected injuries in Iraq.  I came home and started a small ranch in Oregon, and Work Vessels for Veterans came through with a much needed grant to purchase an ATV for me.  With the ATV, I'm now able to check fence lines, do repairs, bring in injured or sick calves and sheep, haul hay out to my farthest pastures, bring in water trailers during summer months, and accomplish much work that previously I was forced to rely on the kindness of friends for.  This organization is highly professional, deeply supportive, and personally invested in every single veteran that they help.  Furthermore, they encourage vets to help not only themselves, but to succeed and grow until they can help other veterans in their own turn.  This fosters a sense of community that goes beyond our military background, and invests into the wider society that we are all reintegrating to.  Please know that donations to this organization go to real live people, and to veterans who actually NEED the assistance, and use it to better both themselves and their greater communities.

I've been out of the military for 15 years, but I figured it was worth the try.  I contacted Cathy at WVFV and submitted my business plan and some other information and explained to her that I would greatly appreciate any support the organization could provide.  To my surprise Cathy responded and within a few weeks WVFV had invited me to a charity event in New London, CT to receive a grant to use in my business toward the purchase of equipment, desperately needed.  I was very happy to hear they had reviewed my submission and I am extremely grateful for the grant.  I think this organization is very professional, timely and efficient.  I graciously accepted the grant and promised to hire veterans when my business expands.  I have also made a personal goal to pay forward the grant by supporting this organization in the future with my own donation.  I want to thank Cathy and her team for the quick response and the generous grant.

Work Vessels For Vets Inc	227349		/users/profile/291077	DaveML	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	I witnessed Work Vessels for Vets originally beginning by donating a work vessel, or in this case a work boat, for a returning vet so that he may begin a lobster business.  This was a moving, inspirational event to see a young, hard working veteran be given an opportunity and direction to transition from military life to civilian working life. Since this humble beginning, the term "vessel" has evolved to include so much more than the literal meaning of "vessel".  I have seen the organization  assist with anything from specialized vehicles, to computers, work with land owners to help establish working farms and so much more.  This organization strives to meet the needs of a wide array of veterans to make their civilian transition easier.  Our vets have chosen to serve our country, and when they return, they sometimes need help so that they can continue to be the self-reliant, hardworking men and women that they always have been.  A great, honorable organization!

The most amazing attribute of this organization is the sense of empowerment it gives real American heroes who are often altogether forgotten when the battled moves on or the war is over.  As an employer why wouldn't you hire a veteran and this worthy organization provides the tools needed to get these people back to work.  I applaud the work of WVFV and I hope you'll consider helping a vet today!  
Work Vessels For Vets Inc	227325		/users/profile/291055	Monica67	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I was introduced to WVFV several years ago and watched it grow from a few volunteers and friends providing what little they could do to make a difference. They have grown into an entire world of loving, caring,  generous, family, friends, celebrities,  veterans, and supportive communities throughout the country that have gone above and beyond to make a positive impact on the lives of those we wish to honor for their service to our country.  I am honored to know these people and what they represent.  In a media controlled world where sports players are held in higher regard than colonels and dramatic common street thugs are getting paid astronomical amounts of money promoting morally questionable lifestyles,  it's a breath of fresh air to know that good people are placing the spotlight and efforts towards those that deserve to be honored. I support WVFV any way I can, any chance I get, and hope that many more people become more involved.  Thank you WVFV for all that you do to honor those who've sacrificed so much for our country and for letting people like me be a part of something so great.

They put all the donations plus more of their own into direct care.  Their team provides the support both emotionally and financially at ever possible request to get a Sailor, Soldier, or Marine back on their feet and beleiving in themselves.  They are currently providing a possible Tractor and some land and mostly saving the life with their offer of support of an amazing Sailor I am working with so he can support his family on the farm he inherited. This is just one of the many things this amazing team provides.  It doesn't get better.

During that time,  I have seen the results of the efforts of the WVFV team and it just re enforces my desire and determination to help as many of our military men and women as we possibly can. Getting laptops into the hands of a soldier returning to further his /her education is critical in their success. The gratitude the show and the excitement the feel when they receive the laptop makes doing this all worth while. Thank You to the WVFV team  and as always a big THANK YOU to our military.

A lot of organizations strive to create massive change and benefit so many that they end up benefiting none. As I volunteered with Work Vessels I saw first hand the huge impact they had on so many individual lives. It was inspiring to watch and I think without trying their impact becomes massive as the people they help and empower go on to become leaders in their own communities. They are doing terrific work!

The group of volunteers is amazing and inspired us to get involved. We have created an annual event, Operation Lobster Dinner(now going on it's sixth year). The dinner provides a free lobster dinner to active, retired veterans and their families free of charge. All additional proceeds are given to work vessels. During the planning stages of this event, Work Vessel volunteers assist in the organizing and planning in every detail.

Five volunteers formed a charity that helps returning combat veterans get the equipment (hence, "Vessels") they need to start their own businesses.   Since 2008, these volunteers (there are NO paid personnel) have assisted 700 injured vets from across the country by being the nonprofit conduit where a corporation or individual can donate items such as computers, trucks, tools, tractors and farm implements, vans, cars and laptops for business school.  They purchased 15 acres of farmland where 24 vets with PTSD and physical injuries rehab while growing tons of food (literally) for soup kitchens.  They started with a lobster boat donated to an injured Marine who is now a fisherman in Narragansett Bay, RI.  WOW!  GO see their success stories  at www.workvesselsforvets.org

North Star Foundation	289542	4	/users/profile/379793	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/11/2016	I worked with North Star and have find all the negative reviews to be quite accurate.  I wonder if the positive reviews come from personal friends of Patty Dobbs Gross, possibly whom she asked to write a positive review for her organization.  I have great difficulty believing that Patty Dobbs Gross could do anything right regarding any service dog, except by fortunate accident.  I believe firmly that if anything goes right with her, it's by luck.  Everyone has to make a living, I guess, even if it's by scamming vulnerable people who have children with disabilities.  As an example, Patty paired me with a family with two autistic children to train a service dog of about a year old.  The dog had no basic training of any skills whatsoever, not to mention any service dogs skills, and was unsocialized and/or perhaps badly bred as to temperament, and had growled at and then bitten the children several times.  For relaying this information to Patty with my and the family's concerns, and supporting the family with the dissemination of facts to Patty, I was harshly punished - not paid, and Patty turned on me as if I were a villain for reporting the facts.  She was happy to take the money I raised for North Star (I raised $2,000 for this organization (before I knew what an awful person Patty is) and was never even thanked for my efforts and for raising the money.  She just took the check and never even said "thank you."  When I asked to be paid before going to my next appointment for a service dog because I hadn't been paid in many weeks after being promised weekly payments for my time, I was summarily dismissed by Patty of North Star because of my reporting the bites on behalf of the family by the service dog mentioned above.  If she expects you to volunteer, she should say so up front, not trick or bully you into working as a volunteer.  I would have been happy to volunteer for an organization that places genuine service dogs; but, to volunteer to resolve behavior problems in dogs that aren't reared to be service dogs in terms of breeding, socialization and raising - NO, I did not volunteer for THAT job.  To add insult to injury, I have the same disability as her son - Asperger's Syndrome (high functioning), and she tried to exploit me in the ways I described; so, personally, I would not describe Patty as disability friendly and supportive of people with this disability as she certainly was not supportive of me and refused to pay me.  I finally did get paid, only after threatening to sue her using a proof the many e-mails she sent me over several weeks saying "the check is in the mail," which were lies, plainly and simply.  Buyers beware. Instead,  I would recommend Susquehanna Service Dogs in Philadelphia, a more reputable organization that does breed genuine service dogs and has an established breeding and training program.
North Star Foundation	281423	2	/users/profile/371471	Writer	Client Served	1	03/02/2016	We received a beautiful dog from North Star, that was clearly not going to have a well controlled demeanor. Patty had hired a trainer who was very excited to do the job, but Patty never paid her; so she quit. Patty insisted that she left to train dogs for soldiers, but she told me that she wasn't paid. I was told I could find someone myself, and that Patty would fly down to check on us. Neither my trainer, nor the other, ever got answers from Patty on ways to train for kids on the spectrum. We were all in the dark. Bottom line, we loved our dog, who died at 5 from a heart tumor, but he was not what we expected at all.
North Star Foundation	201896	6	/users/profile/263475	trainer4love	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/05/2014	I was curious how this organization was doing and now I see that the truth is finally coming out. Im a professional trainer that was contracted to work with a family that received a dog from this organization. To start with this dog was not of the caliber ofservice animal which is what the family was expecting. I voiced concerns several times, but it all fell on deaf ears. Communication over this year period was horrible for all parties involved, the family and myself. Patty is over defensive and looks to blame instead of looking for solutions. It was truly a heart breaking situation to see the thousands of dollars the family had invested into a subpar dog. We even had an external second opinion and that trainer too felt this dog was not right for service or even therapy dog work. Most of the training I did was correcting behavior issues instead of focusing on tasks to help the child. In the end I was owed over $1000 for training services and still have not received any compensation. I felt so bad for the family that I volunteered to train a different dog for them when the time is right. Oh and at the last APDT (dog training) conference by chance I overheard another trainer that was talking about how she was yet to be compensated for training a North Star Dog. Hmm there is a theme here Maybe Pattys heart is in the right place, but the organization itself is completely mismanaged and in the end the children are missing out and the families are broke. 
North Star Foundation	201439	6	/users/profile/262920	FedupwithBS	Volunteer	1	05/30/2014	As a former volunteer trainer for Northstar, and I say volunteer only because I never received payment for my services as promised by Patty.  It is very sad that Patty is your best friend and supporter until one questions her or corrects her misdirected attempts at training a service animal.   I'm the first to tell you it is true a service dog can create miracles in the lives of children on the autism spectrum.  Northstar & Patty is NOT the agency you want to partner with.  You can read in her responses to any criticism against her or Northstar the level of un-professionalism in the tone of her reply.   Northstar Dogs are pawned off to unqualified puppy trainers who end up paying for all expenses for the puppy including vet bills.  Then at 12 to 14 months old they are turned over to the family with no support or training prior to the placement or post placement.  Then trainers like myself are hired at half what we normally charge out of the kindness of our hearts, to be stiffed by Patty.   Another lie is that Patty does all the work she does for her families free of charge and without salary.  That is a total lie!  Patty pockets the majority of every dollar Northstar receives and makes countless excuses to her vendors as to why she cannot pay them on-time, if at all.   PLEASE Do your homework and think very carefully when making the decision to purchase a service dog from Norhtstar.  You will not get what you are promised and will end up with a very expensive family pet.    
North Star Foundation	174483	8	/users/profile/230759	amd180	Volunteer	1	10/06/2013	amd180 I am an extremely honest and precise person (and am often told a very much: over trusting individual) so I beg Ms. Dobbs-Gross (Patty), do not call me liar (as you have others) as you will only be making yourself look more desperate.  I have written documentation to support every aspect of my experience with the North Star Foundation. I wrote to the Foundation to request that I be accepted to foster/ train a pup for the autistic spectrum child.  Months went by-then in March I was contacted by Patty's assistant to accept a pup (standard poodle) to foster/ train.   The Foundation did not vet me at all-almost sounded relieved when I said yes.  There was appropriate communication - initially then things began to fall apart.  I am reassured by Patty that she will communicate with the family etc.  (unfortunately the family, like me was just left on our own devices). When the pup was dropped off, he was nervous for awhile but turned out to be a very smart, brave dog and when exposed to children was a little skittish but after exposure warmed and was very tolerant.  (So, I do not know of the breeding program, my experience with the pup was quite good) However, early on he became quite ill, they did not tell me about his eating habits, inhaling food was brought to a whole new level...he ate so fast he got aspiration pneumonia.  This is where the problems began....I did not mind paying for food and other necessities but the vet bill came at $3500.00 (I paid) because I was told I would be reimbursed by the end of the week....first lie. Patty told me how poor the Foundation was at this time, so for payment of the vet bill I donated my stipend...did no good. Expenses (on my part) and excuses on hers continued - There was quite the rush to remove the pup from my care-I truly think they misjudged me and felt I would not release the pup... (I wish I had not-see email below-) Her excuses continued...pups dying, hard to raise funds, having to pay her assistant and airfare for her assistant, my pup and possibly one other person.... (I won't wax on this-as it falls in line with the other reviews regarding lack of contact etc.)  She tends to contact a person only if she needs something; how sad, a good idea gone so bad. Here is the content of my last email (SURPRISE I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING)-next stop-most likely a lawyer...  "Hi, On September 5th you wrote "I am attending a fundraiser on Sunday and will earmark a portion of the proceeds to go to you to reimburse * vet bill...I will be sure to stay on top of our payment schedule." First off we never discussed a payment schedule- second what happened to the proceeds of the fundraiser? Please do not inform me of all of the hardships of new litters and their expense, having to pay other puppy raisers (ESPECIALLY since I donated MY stipend to the Foundation) or other difficulties you or the Foundation has, as I have my own and in no small part due to the Foundation's lack of responsibility to me. I have let you know my...  I took excellent care of **the pup** - in good faith-and let him go to his new home for **the child's** sake.  I feel that **the pup** was the only leverage I had in recouping my costs but did not want to punish **the child** for the Foundation's failures.  Well, I see 'no good deed comes unpunished'. Please let me know what I can expect. Best..." ** I did not want to give identification to the child so I replaced the words** Final amount owed: $4012.03

I read at least two other ones along the same lines and my experience with you and North Star is similar although not quite as intense.  I am surprised that you do not remove the negative ones from your site and only leave the "glowing" testimonials.  If you take exception to this comment please explain your ineptness and absence of direct and on point answers to direct and on point questions.  I have a number of those I could quote but it would be  a waste of time.  Too bad zero stars rating  is not an option. 
North Star Foundation	150419	5	/users/profile/200583	RichL3399	Volunteer	1	03/02/2013	I am a long time dog trainer and pet professional. I was asked by North Star to foster a dog for a family.  Of course I jumped at the opportunity.  I saw the web site and eagerly awaited the day I would foster  the dog.  I had already fostered for another agency so I couldn't wait for the training I was told I would receive for my new foster dog.  After recieving my dog, I was literally alone.  There was NO training, NO support, and honestly NO knowledge from Patti Gross whom I had spoken with only once.  I was on my own for vet bills, dog food, even heartworm medicine.  Worst of all, there was absolutely NO training for me and when I called, and called, and called, I finally was told that it would all be forthcoming.  Another lie.  The dog that North Star had given me was fearful and had even growled at a small child who was not even touching the dog, and when I told Patti Gross that I did not trust this dog to be placed with a child, she told me to make it work because the dog had already been "sold" to a family.  I was absolutely floored!  Shortly after, I met anotehr foster who was also attempting to communicate with North Star,  Same story,  This woman has absolutely NO CLUE how to raise or train a dog.  She is the mother of an autistic child.  She is not in any way even a barely competent dog trainer...she is a scam artist.  The other foster home complained that the dog they had been given was also fearful and unstable and they felt that it should not be around small children.  After reading a few reviews from parents, and learning that PAtti Gross breeds dogs in her basement, without even AKC papers at a bare minimum, I am even more outraged.  You are breeding dogs with epilepsy, diabetes, and dysplastic hips.   I was so disgusted by this experience that I have now decided to train to become a certified canine behaviorit and certified service dog trainer at a New Jersey based non-profit, that gives free service dogs, not charging families $10,000 or more, for something that is not only unstable, or downrighgt dangerous. This otehr agency does not charge parents, and does not even allow families to demean themselves by begging, I mean fundraising, so that the CEP can get a salary.  And really, North Star CLAIMS to have placed only 100 dogs in 10 years?  That's only 10 dogs per year.  That's small potatoes.  And, if the dog I fostered and the one the other family fostered are any indication of the quality of those 100 supposed service dogs Patti Gross claims to have placed, North Star is either just an inept group, or downright scammers.  The non-profit I am now hoping to work with has placed hundreds and hundreds of service dogs, and has an amazing foster trainnig program, one that is taught by one of the top dog behaviorists in the country.  Novel idea, a service dog actually being trained by a professional dog trainer.  PLEASE do your homework and don't give ANYONE your money or your trust until you see results.  North Star is not the only inept one out there either...unfortunately, many of these agencies do not even have a basic knowledge of canine behavior.  And sorry Patti, being a mother of one special needs child does NOT make you an expert on anything.  How much salary do you take per year from your 10 "service dogs" placed by a "team of North Star professionals"?  It is so sad that so many families are being scammed by you.   I wonder who really wrotethose positive reviews too, since I have not heard a single good thing about this group from a parent or foster.  Please do your homework if you are looking for a service dog.  Please stay away from this woman.  She doesn't even return calls unless you are giving her $10,000 dollars.  After that, you'll never hear from her again. So sad.  So evil.  Why can't I give North Star 0 stars.  The minimum is still one star.  They don't even deserve that.

North Star never paid for the first year of routine vet bills (per the contract), didn't pay the bill for our dog's specialist evaluation at 1 year and absolved themselves of anything to do with our dog, our son and our situation.  $5,000 is A LOT of money to pay and have an organization have no responsibility for the outcome.

North Star Foundation	117472	3	/users/profile/159712	peach26	Client Served	5	07/01/2012	I was searching the internet for a non-profit that would help my daughter get a service dog. She is 5 years old and has been diagnosed with autism. We feel like there is a lot of hope for our daughter, if only things would fall into place for her. She is non-verbal, but passionately speaks her own language. It's this passion and drive that we love in her! I found North Star's website and it stood out to me. Patty's ideas about service dog placements fascinated me because they are unique. We absolutely did not want a service dog that had been trained with convicts in a prison. We also did not want to wait 2-3 years for a placement. Precious time would have passed in our daughter's life. I contacted Patty and eventually she got back to me. I spoke to her for quite some time in a phone call and I really felt that she understood how badly we want to help our daughter. We were willing to do whatever it took to help her get a dog, but we couldn't do it on our own. Amazingly, we were able to to raise the $5,000 (our half of the cost) through very generous friends and coworkers. A couple months later, we met Buzz at the airport. Buzz is a gorgeous Labradoodle. He is incredibly sweet and well trained. At this point in our lives we do not own a home with a yard, so raising a puppy would have been very difficult. Buzz came with advanced training because he is 2 years old. Patty connected us to CaliPals, which is an organization that raises service dogs and trained pets. Patty has paid for everything she said she would and we have never felt neglected. Our daughter loves Buzz and calls him "Bunny." She changes her "z's" to "n's." Buzz has helped her make friends with a set of triplets. She has started talking more and is even making great strides in writing. He hasn't magically fixed her, but that's not what we expected. I think he makes her feel safe. He follows all of us around our home and likes to lay in our laps. He has made all of us so happy. He is like our second child. It's hard to have a bad day when we see Buzzy and our daughter playing quietly together. I think we made a very good choice to go through North Star. I would highly recommend working with Patty.

Our youngest son Matthew, who is now 12 years old, has aspergers and retinitis pigmentosa.  He is legally blind and only has 15 degrees of central vision; no peripheral vision.  We thought Matthew would really benefit from having a North Star dog.  The main thing is that we needed a dog, who might get stepped on occasionally or tripped over, that wouldn't take it personally and would still love him and want to be around him to play.

They were very easy to work with and we have had a wonderful experience integrating a service dog into our home. The dog has assisted our son by decreasing stress and providing emotional support, but he also is learning to track and perform other tasks to assist our son.

My son has autism and we received Bailey our therapy dog when my son was 8.  She brought him back once when he wandered off and stopped him from wandering once too.  Priceless!  Along with the unconditional love she gives all of us, the peace of mind she creates in our home and her beautiful sole our lives have been forever blessed.  Words can not express what Bailey means to us and how wonderful North Star Foundation is!!!
North Star Foundation	115867		/users/profile/96028	Deane M.	Client Served	5	06/20/2012	Our relationship with North Star began in 2008; it was a few months after our son was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (on the autism spectrum).  Patty believed adding a North Star dog to our family would help our son with his social and emotional challenges.  How right she was!  We added Radar to our family and the changes started to happen.  It was subtle at first.  Some eye contact here, a brief word to strangers who approached us while out in public there.  Then one day, without prompting, our son took the lead in speaking to strangers who approached.  Despite me backing off a few yards away, he continued to speak to these ladies on his own for more than ten minutes.  How far he's come!  My initial goal with out North Star dog placement was for our son to "live in the moment"; to notice the world around him.  This goal was met years ago and our placement has far exceeded our expectations.  I have, on several occasions, recommended North Star to people for a variety of reasons.  I keep a stack of North Star pamphlets at home and have distributed them when I've felt someone might benefit from their services.
North Star Foundation	85932		/users/profile/96028	Deane M.	Client Served	5	04/15/2011	We began our relationship with Patty and North Star in early 2008.  As a Mom of a child with Asperger's, I hoped adding a North Star dog to our family would help our son see the world around him; to live in the moment.  Having Radar join our family has done that and so much more!  This placement has exceeded my expectations in so many ways.  Just recently, not only did Jason (our son with AS) talk to strangers about what his dog provides for him but he continued to speak to the strangers despite me walking away.  This was a huge step forward and not something that had ever happened.  Having Radar there gives Jason a certain level of confidence.  He knows people find his dog really cool and Jason doesn't miss an opportunity to educate the public!  We have recently become even more involved with Patty and North Star by puppy-raising.  It was a wonderful learning experience and a labor of love.  Patty is always available to her families (both those who have received dogs and those raising puppies for other families) as a valuable resource and wealth of information.  She personally answered my many questions without ever making feel inadequate.  This work North Star is doing is so important.  I only wish more rescources were available to them; they could help so many more families like ours!

Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/13/2012	The North Star Foundation, lead by Patty Gross, is the one of the oldest service dog organizations for children with autism and other disabilities. Patty has worked very hard to establish an outstanding line of golden retrievers to perform this work and has established herself as an authority in the use of service dogs for children and their families. 
North Star Foundation	85453	1	/users/profile/95346	Caitlin A.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/13/2011	About 7 years ago, I first heard about North Star. As a clinical psychologist who specializes in working with kids on the autism spectrum and someone who has worked with various service dog organizations as a puppy raiser, it was a perfect fit and I was able to raise a puppy for a child with autism! I was very, very impressed with all North Star does for the families it works with. 
North Star Foundation	108878	8	/users/profile/148177	Christina_Bauer	Client Served	1	04/03/2012	We originally posted a positive review of NorthStar within hours of receiving our puppy. Since then we have been consistently disappointed by NorthStar and Patty Dobbs-Gross. Lets start at the beginning: after some emails and phone calls between our family and Patty, she offered us a dog for which the adoption had just fallen through. When we visited NorthStar in Storrs, CT, we were appalled by the conditions: the house was filthy, the kitchen where we first met the dog was not fit for human use, and a litter of puppies was penned into a makeshift plywood enclosure in the garage. We understood from Patty that her autism dogs were part of a special program intended to bring out forgiveness, which was managed reputable breeders. On the second visit, we left with the puppy, a used cage, some paperwork, and some brochures to share with other ASD families. We paid $5,000 for the dog over two installmentsat first we were told the dog, vet care and training cost $10,000 and that we could get her help raising the other $5,000 from family and friends online, but somehow we got the bargain price of $5,000 for this dog that magically was available when we called. As we settled into life with our autistic seven-year old and a new puppy, working with Patty became frustrating in the extreme. It took multiple calls, voicemails and emails to get her response to simple questions, or movement on promised training support. The dogs paperwork consisted of a blurry fax of a litter report dated 4/20/2011 with some vaccine stickers taped to it. It was impossible to tell if this was in fact a report for our dog, or for someone elses entirely. The only place our dogs name appeared was on the fax coversheet, and even then her name was communicated as something different. The technician at our vet said she had never seen such shoddy paperwork, and as a result we had to repeat the full round of shots supposedly done by NorthStar. To top it all off, the NorthStar credit card that was supposedly on file with our local vet never materialized, and each time we went for checkups or shots or the very expensive spaying procedure, we were literally left with the bill. NorthStars lack of attention and follow-through cost us thousands more on top of the initial $5,000 for the dog. In short, our carefully bred super autism dog was actually of unknown pedigree with no useable paperwork or records and a non-responsive partner in the venture. This was not helping our autistic son, but instead causing us to divert our attention away from him to deal with Patty. A few more annoyances and inconveniences: the first in-home trainer provided by Patty walked off the job with no warning after less than a months total training time. We had to pester Patty for weeks to get our dog signed up for good puppy classes, where we met another NorthStar family that had similar complaints. Patty at one point let slip that she bred the puppies herself, presumably in her garage. We repeatedly asked for breeder paperwork and have never received any.  The last straw was when our dog was diagnosed with hip dysplasia at six months old. She will require a special diet, medication and more frequent vet visits for the rest of her life, and even more care when her hips start going for good. Add the financial and time losses to the fact that the dog is supposed to help a child with autism. If youre reading this, you probably have a child with ASD, and are familiar with the research about the positive effects of dogs on autistic kids. Take it from a family that has suffered through months of aggravation, half-truths and broken promises at NorthStars hands: go to a reputable breeder and get a good dog. Get to know the puppy lemon laws in your state, and if they apply to breeders (CTs apply only to pet stores). In our opinion, NorthStar is fly-by-night at best, and outright fraudulent at worst. Patty Dobbs-Gross was paid $5,000 for a dog any reputable breeder wouldnt sell for $500, and we got none of the support or training we agreed to in her contract. That contract also clearly states that no refunds will be provided if the relationship between the family and NorthStar ends prematurely. Caveat emptor! Let this bad experience serve as a warning to anyone who flirts with this organization. Run as fast as you can from NorthStar and dont look back.

She has been so caring, thoughtful and helpful throughout the whole process.  She selected the most amazing yellow lab, Rudy for our son, John who has PDD-NOS.  Does Patty know how to pick those pups!!!  Rudy is an amazing boy.  He brings so much love and calmness to our family.  I truly can say that we are a happier family now.  Our son, John loves his dog so much.  They adore each other.  Rudy enjoys watching John play with his cars and trains and every now and them will try and join in the play!  Since Rudy's arrival, John is talking so much more and loves to tell everyone that this is his dog Rudy.  He wants to take Rudy everywhere with him.   John looks forward to having his buddy watch him get on the bus and greet him with lots of kisses when he returns home from school. I am always quick to tell people that North Star is a wonderful organization to work with.   The trainers and puppy raisers are so nice and great to work with.  I am proud to say that they were all very helpful in the training of our Rudy.  He just passed his CGC and I could not have done it without there help and support.
North Star Foundation	88885		/users/profile/100466	vickib	Volunteer	4	05/18/2011	As a long time raiser of service dogs, I am very familiar with the benefit that a dog can provide to a person with disabilities.  Several years ago, I came across North Star Foundation, an organization which provides service dogs to children with Autism.  I have trained 3 dogs for this organization and I am continually amazed at the impact that these dogs have on the children and families.  Each family has different needs and requirements but the dogs always adapt.   Children that normally run off stay with the dog because of the bond that has been created and a concern as to what would happen to the dog if they wandered off.  These well trained dogs not only assist in this manner but they improve the social skills of the child.  Many autistic children have problems verbalizing yet by learning the dog's commands and vocalizing these commands to the dog, the child becomes more confident in their communication skills.    This is a small organization but they have a huge impact on many lives not only in the United States but worldwide by serving the needs of group which are often overlooked by the larger service dog organizations.

North Star Foundation	88512		/users/profile/99714	Lisa M.	Volunteer	5	05/09/2011	I am a Certified Dog Trainer hired by the North Star Foundation. I had the privilege of working with a wonderful family and their son. It was my first hands on experience with autism so I was a little nervous. More of making the little boy afraid or uncomfortable. It was amazing how much information I was given between Patty Gross and the family I worked with. My job was easy compared to the struggles this family went through on different levels. Watching as the dog, Bach, took care of the mom was a huge impact on my training experience. Bach would pick up on her needs as well as the child's. There were two moments I specifically remember when working with Bach and his family. One was the first time the little boy made eye contact with me and hugged me. From what I gathered, it was rare and well, I appreciated being the rarity.The second moment was when we were trying to help with the little boy's bedtime schedule. I had recommended Bach do what the little boy do, including brushing his teeth! It was during this week that the mom had spoken with me and said, "---- slept in his room for the first time since he was born." The whole night. For me, I just was ecstatic to be a part of something so BIG. We as "normal" everyday people take so much for granted and through this experience as with others, my appreciation grows. I loved being part of the therapy with this family. I loved being educated on autism and it has really helped me personally since my nephew and niece have been diagnosed in the passed year with autism. There is a relief when I read success stories of clients matched with these dogs. The dogs are like new pair of legs or arms for physically disabled people. Meaning, it is freedom and independence. Not only for the child, but for the parents. Simple things that we take for granted are difficult for these parents and with just a simple addition of a puppy that is trained to assist... It is a huge difference. I have seen transformation in different ways and it is rewarding for me to be a part of that. The North Star Foundation is a gift to these families. I am so proud to be a part of it. To see lives change. Even mine.
North Star Foundation	88344		/users/profile/99333	jschall	Client Served	5	05/03/2011	Our incredible journey of working with North Star began almost 3 years ago when I read about North Star in the Council for Exceptional Children newsletter. If there was ever a life-changing moment, that was one. In my soul, I knew that our daughter could benefit from a deep and meaningful relationship with the kinds of dogs that were described in the article. What I didn't know, at that time, was the extent of thought, dedication, caring, wisdom, and commitment that Patty's brings to North Star s a foundation, the dogs, and the families with whom she works. I called her, she listened. And then she asked thoughtful and challenging questions. In fact, she talked with me on the phone and via email a number of times, getting to know us, getting to know our daughter Lily. We applied  for a North Star dog and on a day when it seemed that every member of "the village" that was helping to raise Lily had let us down, there was a message on our voicemail: "I am bringing Lily a puppy." Patty's care and involvement continued through the birth and puppy testing of Rosie's litter, to the puppies' socialization before she got to us, to the trip to our home in California, to the sensitive and excellent trainer we were assigned and throughout the two and a half years we have had our North Star dog, Popsicle. North Star, Patty, and Popsicle have never let us down but instead are a constant and invaluable gift. I believe our daughter has learned to experience love and empathy in meaningful, healthy, and rewarding ways. She has become more empathetic, solid and strong. She has a growing sense of her own self-worth amidst the tumultuous journey of a childhood confused by prenatal toxins and critically high stress. And a growing sense of competency as she helps groom, train, and take care of Popsicle. Patty and North Star are a part of our lives and our family. We could not ask for more.

She spoke so highly of the organization that we decided to look into the resource for ourselves. From the start Patty has been friendly, and consistently available to answer our questions, even when we ask them more than once. We wanted an emotional and social support for our 9-year old son and after speaking with Patty it became clear that a North Star dog would be perfect for our family. She helped us to find a hypo-allergenic breed and even took into account that we live in a small apartment when finding the perfect kind of dog for us.  Our dog Junior has recently come home and Patty has been invaluable as a resource and s support.  She is going to work with a trainer in our area to ensure that we have the best experience training Junior for our needs. We have been in weekly contact with her and are comfortable that although we have received our dog, Patty is still there for us. We are looking forward to all the gifts that Junior will bring to our family and can't thank Patty and North Star Dog Foundation enough.

Patty taught me a lot about autism and assistant dogs, and every week was a new lesson. I loved taking Angel back to the UConn campus and letting everyone see her. She was a wonderful dog. I walked dogs as a side job as well, but I looked more forward to walking Angel for free than I did walking a dog for money. Every Wednesday I would be so happy to finally go see Angel and the other pups, it literally made my week. This foundation is awesome in its objectives and in what it has accomplished. Patty is a great person who really cares and is passionate about North Star. I hope to keep ties with her for a long time to come. I know I have helped North Star by volunteering, but North Star has also helped me just the same. 
North Star Foundation	86145		/users/profile/96319	Eileen W.	Client Served	5	04/18/2011	In 2010 I contacted North Star to apply to receive a service dog for my autistic son. I was overwhelmed at the specific attention that was paid to our case, and the speed at which a dog was provided. Patty at North Star works harder on quality than quantity and selects her placements very carefully. In our case as we had need of a poodle due to allergies, we lucked out as many others ask for Goldens and Labs, but a poodle happened to be just born recently when we called.  I WISH EVERYONE'S PET COUDL BE A DOG FROM NORTH STAR. The training that Lily came with even at 10 months old was remarkable, I never knew a dog could be so well behaved and calm. The changes though in my son are priceless. My son who has never bear hugged me in his life, but rather, rigidly accepts hugs, plows into Lily each day for deep pressure hugs. He whispers concerns and love into her ears that shock me. I didn't honestly know that my son had it in him! Lily has opened up a window into my son. In public the opportunities that Lily provides to increase communication is almost 100 percent from what it use to be. She is in every sense a walking therapy tool for my son. In fact we use her often at our weekly horse therapy in place of the horses and work out OT and speech situations using her. This trains my husband and I as parents to then continue that therapy in our homes, eventually eliminating the need for that outside therapy and simply using Lily in scenarios to work with our son in OT and speech and pragmatic language.  There are plenty of service dog agencies that are terrific Im sure, but none so perfect and affordable as North Star. For a parent of autism who is already taxed in affording therapy and evaluation (I have 2 autistic sons) I consider this very important. I have run into so many people in the street who tell me they briefly looked into service animals but the 30 k cost drove them away. At a mere 5 k North Star surpasses what others can not grasp. The simplicity of letting the younger dog in the home to increase important bonding allows for this reduction of cost, as well as North Stars own diligence in fundraising much of the cost for their client. I believe that the bonding in puppy years is essential in regards children with autism and other special needs, and is not at all difficult. You dont get handed some unruly puppy, at 10 months old our Lily didnt dream of jumping up on a child; she sat patiently, knew how to calm down on command and understood all basic commands. If you were to offer me a 2 year old trained dog now from another agency at 30k, I wouldnt take it. I as a parent have also found it very enjoyable and I would say calming and therapeutic for myself to be given a practically finished masterpiece in which I can add my own final touches with the help of North Stars paid trainers that they hire locally to continue you through the process. I never thought I would enjoy the classes and training, which are not overly consuming of your time as the dog is already so well trained, but enough to give you as a parent a real understanding of how to control your dog.  Its given me personally a new interest as well, Lily has served and is serving our whole family and she is not even 2 yet.

He is a child with autism and had serious problems with stress, behavior, and health problems.  He had been out of school for over 2 years & had to return with an aide and full time help in our home.   Life is different now that he has his North Star dog.  He is off of his medications and rarely ill.  He is in a regular classroom without any extra help at school or at home.  He has learned to read and write.  His melt downs that once were tallied daily happen once or trice a month.  Most importantly he has made friends and is happy from the moment Hero wakes him up in the morning until they lay their heads down at night.  His quality of life has improved beyond words.  It has been a priceless experience.  It is very expensive to raise a child with autism the well bread and trained assistance dogs have so much to offer a child.

There is litttle doubt that it is a different journey, that takes a lot of patience, understanding and hard work to navigate.  I took it upon myself to find out about North Star as my wife had seen Patty on a talk show with a golden retriever that had been placed with an autistic boy.  Well we gave it a shot, and we have been very fortunate to have had Buddy come into our lives.  He had a great effect on John, as he fulfilled a role of companion that could not be filled by another child.  Buddy also became an part of our family, forging a relationship with each of us.  John has been living in a residential facility for autistic children for over a year.  My wife and I go up to visit him often and of course we take Buddy.  When John and Buddy see each other, there is a feeling that distance or time cannot overcome.  They are BFF and there is no need for John to vocalize with his limited speech what Buddy means to him.   You just have to look at his eyes.     There is no doubt that North Star helped us with its program.  There are no guarantees in life that a service dog will help a child with autism or other emotional problems.  There is however, always the chance that  some good will come.  That chance is always worth taking.

In just a few days the puppy has had a positive effect on our son, and we are very excited to see what the coming years will bring for them together. We haven't started the training yet, but are excited to get going so our boy can reap the full benefit from his furry partner. Thank you NorthStar and Patty!

North Star Foundation	85325		/users/profile/95155	Cathleen O.	Client Served	5	04/12/2011	North Star Foundation is a non profit organization that provides service dogs to children with special needs.  Autism, Downs Syndrome, and children facing emotional challenges are just a few of the special kids North Star helps. Our family has seven children from 1 year old to 13 years old.  Two of these children have Autism spectrum disorders and Epilepsy.  This dog is specifically to work with our younger daughter.  But by giving the older daughter a specific task (grooming), we are training her in a marketable job skill, allowing her to learn to train the dog, and giving her the opportunity to work with an animal that loves her unconditionally.  This is vital, as the stresses of the day build up and dogs help release that tension without having to be verbally communicated to! Many service dog organizations would not place a highly trained service dog with our family due to our large number of children and the degree of disabilities in our family.  The dogs most organizations place have been taught 40 or 50 skills, several of them would go to waste on our physically typical children with developmental disabilities.  North Star is unique in that they have worked with us to provide a dog that will be both a service dog to our 8 year old, but will also be tolerant of the other children.   The folks at North Star work long and hard to ensure that the special needs of each particular family are met.  They talked us through raising funds (which was MUCH easier than I had expected!) what to expect during the process, how to prepare for the arrival and training of the dog.  They provide a trainer to work with each family.  This is an integral part of the service North Star provides.  They take into consideration the specific needs of each child, place the right temperament puppy with the family and then train the dog towards those needs.  For example, our family has many small children.  The right dog for us needed to be extremely docile, but able to handle a lot of attention.  One of my child's special talents is throwing things, so they have made sure to provide us with a dog that likes to play fetch.  She is in need of a dog that will patiently weather the sometimes loud tantrums.  The trainer works with each family (and child) to see that the dog gets the specialized training that it needs. North Star Foundation understands children with special needs.  We are blessed that they understand the kinds of things that will help children with Autism as they struggle through the complexities of growing up with social and communication difficulties.  They train their dogs to be a sort of a 'golden bridge' to society.

He is now 16, and they are the best of friends.  Nomar has been the star of Jake's typed stories, a constant comfort when siblings separate from Jake, a bridge during play dates with other children, and a protector when Jake has been lost.  Now, our family has opened a school for children with autism, The I.N.S.P.I.R.E. School for Autism, and Nomar is beloved by all of the children there, where he serves as a transition tool new children, and a reward, comfort and playmate for all.
North Star Foundation	85273		/users/profile/95100	crkuffner	Client Served	5	04/12/2011	My son, Jack, was diagnosed with high functioning autism at the age of 3.  He was minimally verbal and had much difficulty with social interactions and activities.  We spent a great deal of time with speech therapy and occupational therapy to help him speak and function better independently.  Jack loves animals, so when we heard that there were organizations like North Star that provide autism service dogs, we were sold.  We started the application process in early 2007 and received our beautiful Sassy in March of 2008.  Patty Dobbs Gross was an amazing resource and great help to us.  Sassy is approaching her 4th birthday and year with us and we couldn't imagine life without her.  She serves primarly as Jack's companion as he does not have friends his own age like a 9 year old would.  She helps him calm down when he has tantrums and she also helps him with his sensory issues by sleeping with him at night.  She also has a wonderful relationship with our other 3 children, Vanessa (11), Josie (5) and Colette (3) and is amazingly sweet with them as well.  We are eternally thankful for everything Patty and North Star has done for Jack and our family.  They are an inspiration to the autism community.

Our son Miles is 5 yrs old and suffers from Dravet Syndrome. The Dravet Syndrome Foundation recently awarded Miles an Adaptive Stroller. This is something that our insurance had denied and we had not been able to afford ourselves. As Miles has gotten older and outgrown a regular stroller our entire family has suffered as we have not been able to enjoy anything that involved long walks, the outdoors etc... Miles tires easily and can have a seizure at any time. We used to enjoy museums, the local zoo, even walks around our neighborhood but now that Miles is 85 lbs I can no longer carry him long distances and this puts him in great danger if we were to get more than a block away from home and he were to have a seizure. With the award of this adaptive stroller we can now enjoy all of those things again :) I can now feel safe in taking him out and know that if he does have a seizure he is strapped in and I can get him home safely. Our entire family is forever grateful to The Dravet Syndrome Foundation... they have given us our freedom back :)

Our 4 yr old son Miles was awarded both a cooling vest and an IPad by the foundation. These are life changing expgifts that we would not have been able to obtain had it not been for THe Drravet Syndrome Foundation. On good days when Miles can go outside his cooling vest helps to keep his tempture regulated so that he can play for more that 5 mins at a time. On the bad days when he cannot go outside the IPad provides education and entertainment. Miles has SEVERE visual sensitivities to lights/patterns which make travel, doctors appointments, haircuts, shopping etc...extremley difficult. The IPad has given him something to focus on so that we can avoid additional visual and sensory triggered seizures. Slowly we are gaining some control in our life. We are eternally greatful for the help the DSF had provided. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!!

DSF has been devoted to raising funds for research that will help lead not only to better treatments but, someday, to a cure for Dravet Syndrome and related epilepsies.  DSF is incredibly responsible about how it spends its funds, and never takes its eye off of the needs of its community.  I am so proud to be a part of this wonderful organization.
Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	111247		/users/profile/151447	Abby7	Board Member	5	05/02/2012	I am so proud to be on the DSF board of directors.  When my daughter was first diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome, we were told by the geneticist that we should find other Dravet parents to band together, raise money and locate a doctor willing to do early stage research into a promising avenue of gene therapy.  This task seemed monumental, but two weeks later I met two members of the DSF board and learned that, in less than two years since they formed the DSF, they had already accomplished this, and the research was underway!  Since then, I have become more and more involved, and have learned that the DSF founders are not only hard-working, dedicated moms, they are also well-organized businesswomen who make sure that virtually 100% of every dollar raised goes to the most promising avenues of research, or to provide assistive devices and services to Dravet children who otherwise would be unable to afford these life-changing tools.  It makes me feel so good to know that we are making the lives of these children and their families a little bit better, and that someday, the research we fund may lead to a cure for my daughter and all of the other children and adults suffering from this catastrophic condition.

We live near the foundation headquarters, (tho their concern and reach are world-wide), so it has been fairly simple to volunteer in the many fund-raising events and activities. The young women who founded and run the organization serve as true inspirations for us all: their energy, intelligence, ingenuity, and commitment to their cause seem endless. They work so hard to raise funds to support research for a cure, as well as treatment options and improvements, for those suffering from Dravet Syndrome, whether or not the specific research will benefit their particular child. Despite all of their efforts, The Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc. is in desperate need of additional monies to fund some very promising new research. And, due to the nature of this de novo mutation and the proposed research, the findings would benefit other, more pervasive conditions as well. I will continue to join in the efforts to raise these funds and hope others of you will support us.

We live in Connecticut so it seemed logical, following this devastating diagnosis, to become involved with an organization based here. But the impact of the Dravet Syndrome Foundation is more than  local: Its support of patients and their families, information gathering, and funding of crucial research reaches literally around the world.  My experience working with the women who founded the organization, the men & women who serve as volunteers and the professional advisers has been amazing.  I have rarely encountered a more professional, intelligent, caring, creative, energetic group of people. These are people who are doing everything humanly possible to enhance the quality of life for those with, and to find a cure for, Dravet Syndrome. I am truly proud to work with them as a volunteer.

Bryant suffers from Dravet Syndrome and began having seizures when he was 3 months old.  At the age of 18 months Bryant experienced a status seizure that lasted 2 hours and 45 minutes.  After that seizure Bryant lost his ability to speak, walk and began to show intellectual delays.  At this time Bryant continues to be delayed globally.  Although his receptive speech is almost on target his expressive language  is that of a 2 yr old.  The IPAD that was funded by the DSF will be used as an Augumentive Communication Device utilzing the PROLOQU App. He has been using the device at school and his IEP team recommended one for home use.  Our private insurance denied this request.  We are truly excited to be given the opportunity of getting such a fantastic device and are delighted to watch as Bryant will now be able to express his wants and needs.  Thank you so much!!

Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	137917		/users/profile/183943	Kim_58	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I have been raising a child with Dravet syndrome for the past 8 years.  In my quest to find other parents like myself, I had the pleasure of meeting and becoming close friends with two of the people who ultimately started the Dravet Syndrome Foundation.  I have volunteered for the foundation whenever I could since its inception because I believe in what they are trying to accomplish.  It was very exciting to know that there was now an organization that was setting out to do research for our children.  Dravet syndrome is a catastrophic disease that ultimately changes every aspect of the afflicted child as well as their families' lives.  The Dravet Syndrome Foundation has not only set out to do research in hopes of finding a treatment, or a cure, to help us, but they also provide assistance for families in need of medical equipment or other devices that can help make their lives just a little bit easier.  In my case, my son has severe OCD as a symptom and cannot be left by himself unsupervised at any time.  This made it very difficult to get anything done around my home, such as clean, cook, or help my other son with his homework.  The Dravet Syndrome Foundation provided me with closed circuit cameras for my house and I cannot put into words the difference this made in my life.  Now I can function around my home without compromising my son's safety.  What the Dravet Syndrome Foundation has accomplished in such a short time definitely speaks for the hard work and dedication of its Board of Directors.  If a treatment is to be found for this horrific disease, I have no doubt the Dravet Syndrome Foundation will be involved somehow.

Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	132994		/users/profile/178690	SueGH	Volunteer	5	11/03/2012	I have been very active in the world of Dravet Syndrome for 6 years, working on committees and with various professionals. Two years ago, I wanted to step back as I felt that I had done "my bit" and wanted to spend more time with my family. However, I was so impressed by the drive, commitment and professionalism of the DSF, that I felt I just had to join them to support them. I had already worked with one of the co-founders of the DSF, in another organisation, and knew that she would take the organisation forward to achieve great things for Dravet families and research towards a cure. The DSF was also the only organisation committed to funding research for a cure. For me, that was (and still is) the most important objective. As a volunteer, especially already with huge stresses of everyday life, including having a child with Dravet Syndrome, it is so important to have faith in the organisation, to see efficient use of all of the resources and, perhaps most importantly, to see tangible results of your volunteer efforts. I have taken great pride in representing the DSF in various meetings with doctors. It is hugely satisfying to work together and to see ideas turn into concrete plans, which have then gone on to achieve results, such as the annual DSF research Roundtable, in which researchers and doctors share information and collaborate. The DSF continues to achieve amazing things. It supports families AND the researchers who are working so hard to find a cure. These researchers constantly need money but also encouragement, to keep them working and motivated, both of which the DSF provides, very successfully. Its professionalism and integrity continually attracts more and more supporters, from the people who fund raise, to researchers, to the clinicians who manage our childrens medical needs. Still more is needed, to get us to THE cure for this catastrophic disease.

Sadly, my son is one of the Dravet Angels, and passed away from Sudden Unexplained Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) back in June of 2008. He was 8 years old when he passed away. While SUDEP was my son's primary cause of death, Dravet Syndrome is listed on his death certificate as his secondary cause of death. Over the years, I have had the privilege of knowing the co-founders of the Dravet Syndrome Foundation (DSF) personally before they started the DSF, and after my son passed, I wanted to give back to the DSF by volunteering at their annual fundraiser.

Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	123293		/users/profile/167924	Akeia H.	Client Served	5	09/26/2012	I am a mother of a 3 year old little girl that has Dravet. In her three years of life we have experienced many lows and some highs. I came across the Dravet Syndrome Foundation, which was for in depth in the amount of information supplied. I was able to connect with other parents that understood what I was experiencing and read other stories of similar kids. I came across an application for grant that Dravet Syndrome Foundation had and decided to apply for our daughter because she lacks verbal communication. I was recently contacted by one of the director and I was informed that they would be providing our daughter with an Ipad. That was not the biggest surprise of all. I was able to speak with the directors son who also has Dravet and following that conversation with him I felt very hopeful of the possible future for our daughter. I am very grateful for the Dravet Syndrome Foundation and all of the assistance they have provided to us.

I requested an IPad a while back when the Dravet Syndrome Foundation  received a donation.  The IPad's went so quickly but I was told that I would be placed on a list in case more donations were available.  I am so happy that they came through in flying colors.  This device will change the quality of life for Matthew and our family.  We will be able to go out to restaurants, homes of friends, special events  and places that would usually cause him to get extremely restless after a short time.  What a great organization that does such heartfelt work for children and families of Dravet Syndrome. Thank you .... Matthew's Mom :~)
Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	111268		/users/profile/151490	Kamfisch	Volunteer	5	05/02/2012	  I am a volunteer for the Dravet Syndrome Foundation. Since the first time I read their website I wanted to volunteer. First because I was very impressed with how hard they work raising money for research. That gives us as parents with a child with Dravet Syndrome, hope that our kids will have better treatments. I am very impressed with how while raising the funds they also work very hard to support and help the Dravet comunity in a way only family would do it. They also help families by providing assistive devices and services to children who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. I felt very welcomed since my first e-mail contact with them. I am very proud to be a volunteer and I wished I had more time to be more involved with such a great Organization, very professionally ran and that makes sure that the funds go to the most promising research projects that one day may find a cure to this devastating disease.

As a rare syndrome while my son was having a prolonged seizure I was just reading which medications not to administer from the Dsf website.  I was desperate and Lori., the president called me back after I sent her an email, she gave me hope with her words and the warning of this horrible syndrome!  the foundation has been like a family through their support group.  They share my hopes, laughter and cries! The staff is working hard on research and just pray one day there is a cute for this.   DSF has just granted my son with a cooling vest and an IPad we use during his therapy.   I am extremely grateful to the foundation and staff for working hard on research and although they face the same problems all dravet parents do, they make theirselves available to lend a crying shoulder and give support!   I will always be thankful to DSF for all the work they do and trying so hard on finding a cure,

DSF has accomplished so much in the few years since it's establishment. They have helped create research grants & projects in such short time it blows my mind. Dravet Syndrome is devastating disease without much hope or understanding when you 1st get a diagnosis then you find a dedicated group like this & they show you yes if you work hard & fight you can make a difference.

Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	87114		/users/profile/97701	Megan H.	Volunteer	5	04/25/2011	The Dravet Syndrome Foundation has been incredibly valuable for my family.  It has afforded my husband and me hope for our son in the face of this devastating syndrome by funding research, and providing us with a social support system of other parents of Dravet kids.  Because Dravet Syndrome is rare, ongoing research for treatments and cures requires that the DSF be able to continue it's amazing work raising funds and educating caregivers, the medical community, and the public about Dravet Syndrome.  It has also raised money for patient assistance grants for those unable to afford certain pieces of equipment necessary for living a safer and more fulfilling life.

I utimately would like to volunteer more.The DSF is a powerhouse organization in the realm of fundraising. We observed this fact at Ciara's Butterfly Bash on March 26, 2011. All the proceeds go to research toward a cure. Lori O'Driscoll, one of the founders of the DSF, came down to our  son Liam's first Special Education meeting, and explained what Dravet Syndrome is, and how the syndrome effects every aspect of daily life.The response was heartfelt, and as a result, Liam has had a very sucessful year. Lori also got us the best medical care for Liam, and we are grateful .The DSF is an organization that is highly effective. Lori O'Driscoll, Amanda Renz, and Mary Anne Meskis are motivated to educate, raise funds, and support families that have to deal with the devastating effects of this catastrohic form of epilepsy.

Dravet Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	86873		/users/profile/97380	mameskis	Board Member	5	04/23/2011	The Dravet Syndrome Foundation was formed by parents who wanted to see aggressive research being done in the field of Dravet syndrome that would impact their loved ones and other afflicted with this disease.  Although science might not move as quickly as we as parents would like, we want to assure that lack of funding is not what is slowing it down. We have awarded more grants for research specific to Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies in the U.S. than any other non-profit organization.  In less than 2 years since our inception, we have awarded over $625,000 in research grants.  We are a volunteer-led organization with no paid employees and little overhead.  We pride ourselves on maintaining operating expenses at a minimum to ensure that the gift of every donor truly brings us one step closer to a cure.  We focus our efforts in 4 areas, per our mission:  Research Grants, International Ion Channel Epilepsy Patient Registry, International Patient Assistance Grants, and our Annual Research Roundtable for professionals with an interest in Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies. 
All Our Kin	179480		/users/profile/188001	Anika L.	Board Member	5	10/18/2013	AOK works at the intersection of providing effective early childhood education and guaranteeing economic security.  Their work accomplishes two incredibly important goals: (1) giving young children a strong start in life with high quality early childhood ed and (2) helping family day providers make a sustainable living.  The work AOK does is amazing and it serves the needs of both children and small-scale entrepreneurs.
All Our Kin	141631		/users/profile/188001	Anika L.	Board Member	5	11/20/2012	All Our Kin works for two goals that are important to me: economic security, particularly for low and moderate income women, and high quality early childhood education.  Their work is simple, in a way: help home day care providers become economically self-sufficient while also providing the children under their care the building blocks for successful primary education and beyond.  But in that simplicity, they accomplish so much, for children, for parents and for providers.  But the rewards are profound and have impacts from a child's well-being to a positive impact on economic development in Connecticut.  The staff is extraordinarily dedicated.  
All Our Kin	178779		/users/profile/235403	suzanne.kahn	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I was an undergraduate in New Haven. When I moved back to New Haven five years later, I knew I wanted to get involved in the community and All Our Kin was at the top of my list of organizations to reach out to. I knew they did amazing work empowering women and helping children. I didn't know how wonderful the staff would be about incorporating volunteers into their mission. So many organizations make it difficult to get involved, but All Our Kin found substantive and consistent ways for me to help immediately. Since I've started volunteering at All Our Kin, I've been able to see first hand how amazingly committed the staff is. They have an inspiring vision for how to improve the lives of so many people in our community and they work implement that vision every day. 
All Our Kin	178489		/users/profile/235120	KErinehart	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	I have watched All Our Kin evolve for over a decade.  While they have grown tremendously, there is much that has remained constant -- extraordinary commitment to the people they serve, hiring staff of only the highest quality, and taking an encompassing approach to service (serving the whole person and all their needs, not just one piece).  It is not so much that All Our Kin's services are groundbreaking in nature (though they are in some respects); it is that they perform them better than anyone else.  They are making a huge difference to the lives of providers and children in Connecticut.
All Our Kin	178488		/users/profile/26216	louise abate	Board Member	5	10/17/2013	I have been involved with All Our Kin as a provider and as a board member.  As a provider I have been able to futher my education, have visits  from AOK to help improve my home daycare and have been able to meet other providers to discuss our daycares and bounce ideas to each other.  As a board member I have been able to help make discissions that would benifit providers to operate a safe, loving and educational daycare.   All Our Kin is a community driven organization that is there for all, children, parents and providers.
All Our Kin	25250	5	/users/profile/26216	louise abate	Board Member	5	01/06/2010	I have been involved with AOK since day 1 of their existance.  I first was on the side of receiving services from them (education, counseling, supplies and being NAFCC Accredidated), now I am still a part of the network and I am also on the Board for AOK.  They are truly a family that helps others to begin their lives in child care but also they help you maintain and keep your families together.  Each and every member of AOK has superb knowledge in their own field and can share it with others.

All Our Kin	176740		/users/profile/233179	rln93	Volunteer	5	10/11/2013	I have spent over an hour staring at my computer screen, trying to think of how I could possibly do justice to everything that All Our Kin is. The word I to which I keep coming back is thoughtful. I've worked with many nonprofits, but I've never encountered an organization this deliberate in its operations: because every staff member loves their work and completely buys in to All Our Kin's vision, they think very, very hard about what they do, and this shines through in their results and in the immense respect the community has for All Our Kin. Thoughtful feedback at all levels is appreciated  even as a new volunteer, I was encouraged to share my thoughts with all staff, and what I said was taken seriously. It's clear that the staff trusts each other to do a good job, and that each member deserves that trust. The work All Our Kin does isn't sexy, but it's the kind of work that makes a real difference. I had the pleasure to attend the annual conference at Gateway Community College, and let me tell you that this organization means the world to the people it serves. I had countless providers come up to me and thank me for volunteering; everyone seemed over the moon and feeling empowered. It was a wonderful event. If you're in the New Haven area and are looking for an organization to work with, you really can't do any better than All Our Kin.
All Our Kin	174427		/users/profile/230702	paige_maclean	Board Member	5	10/06/2013	All Our Kin is a unique and inspiring organizations that supports and trains home child care providers.   These providers are (mostly) women who are the first teachers of some of our most vulnerable children and, with the support of All Our Kin, are able to able set the children in their care on a path to lifelong learning and to create businesses that support their own families.  Early childhood education is desperately needed in so many communities, and AOK has been one of the few sources of information, training and support to help the number of providers continue to grow in New Haven and now in other communities.
All Our Kin	172753		/users/profile/11084	skb	Board Member	5	10/01/2013	When I moved home to New Haven, I wanted to get involved with a non-profit affecting social change, and making a measurable impact in an efficient manner. In finding All Our Kin, I lucked out. This organization is a simple model  which specifically targets the economic and educational disparities existing in my hometown.  All Our Kin improves the quality of home based childcare for the youngest citizens, which  has noted effects: the CHILDREN are prepared for school in safe, nurturing environments; WOMEN (often under educated and under employed) receive quality training to operate home based businesses caring for these children; and, PARENTS with young children feel assured that their children are well cared for and re-enter the labor force themselves. There are not many organizations that improve the lives of so many people in a community. Much of this is only possible because of the clarity, focus and devotion of the staff at All Our Kin. 
All Our Kin	136317		/users/profile/11084	skb	Board Member	5	11/09/2012	As a board member, donor and citizen, I want to see a non-profit organization mindfully progress, providing needed services efficiently, constantly evaluating and improving their offerings. AOK blows me away and thankfully, they are receiving the deserved recognition for the huge impact their services make on children, women, families and communities. 
All Our Kin	9303	10	/users/profile/11084	skb	Volunteer	5	08/18/2009	A person would be hard-pressed to find an organization which provides such meaningful services positively affecting so many people. AOK helps low income individuals open quality, licensed home based child card programs. This improves the individual's confidence, income level and quality of life, while giving their children and the children of their neighbors the tools they need to be successful once in school, and freeing the parents of other children to also find work. It is an uplifting cycle rather than the vicious cycles so often seen in the communities AOK serves. The service AOK provides can change the fabric of a neighborhood.

This shared passion for the welfare of young children and their providers leads not only to the success of the organization but also to the strong sense of community among the staff.

Their vision 10 years ago, to support family childcare workers, improve the quality of instruction within family childcare setting and provide a meaningful network for family childcare workers, revolutionized the profession of home childcare workers.  After 10 years, All Our Kin has moved from a small, New Haven-based family childcare network to being a national model.  Well Done AOK!
All Our Kin	141736		/users/profile/188114	ElmCarm	Donor	5	11/20/2012	All Our Kin is an amazing non-profit organization in the realm of early childhood education and training.  On a meager budget, they've been able to increase the supply of quality child care in the community.  They allow parents to enter the workforce without worrying about the care of their children.  In addition, a recent economic analysis of the Tool Kit Licensing Project demonstrated that childcare providers have increased their income and well being of their families.  When thinking about how best to close the achievement gap that exists today, many concerned citizens and/or politicians are working to create opportunities/solutions for students in middle school, high school or applying to college.  I argue that we need to take a look at quality early childhood education and All Our Kin is having monumental success in this area.  Other communities throughout the country should take notice.  If I had a million dollars to give, it'd be to All Our Kin.
All Our Kin	141711		/users/profile/188089	LD3614	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/20/2012	From my experience working with non profits, AOK is one of only a ahnful that I can say "walks the talk" when it comes to respecting and empowering those who they work with to be economically viable and providers of quality services.  This organization, unlike any other, goes the extra mile to make sure that the family child care providers receive the training and support that is responsive to their cultural and language needs.  For example, when you go their annual conference of family child care providers you will see a room of over 200 hundred people and every presentation and workshop is simultaneously being translated.  Everything they do is top quality and strategic.  They are a inspiration to others throughout the city, the region and the state.  If only there were the resources to have this gem work with all the family care providers in the state ... then we could be sure that infants and toddlers were getting the best care they could and that thier parents would be geeting the support of a trined child care provider.

For over 10 years they have helped to increase the number licensed family day care providers in the city--an amazing feat when statewide there has been a rapid decline in licensed family child care homes.  Keeping homes open is about supporting the providers--offering information, consultation, community.  They do it.  They do it well.

It focuses particularly on family childcare providers, often the most vulnerable and underserved providers in the field.  I have been an early childhood director for forty years, a teacher, supervisor, trainer and college faculty member.  I am also a founding member of he All Our Kin board .

I am an individual donor and participate with others in reviews that result in monetary awards from philanthropic organizations. We consider the return on investment to be "priceless' Not only are day care providers educated, trained and financed (when needed),and assisted with licensing; the children for whom they are responsible are given the tools for success in school. A donation to this group is the paradigm for a "hand Up" rather than a "hand Out" They also provide their expertise in a bilingual forum. They encourage continuing education for their clients.

The staff's unwavering commitment to the families in the communities they serve is unparalleled in the greater New Haven area.  All Our Kin offers rigorously designed programs created to have the greatest impact in the communities they serve.  The organization's ability to serve two groups -- family childcare providers and the children in their care -- simultaneously and effectively is what makes All Our Kin so unique and highly revered, both locally and nationally.

The two Ivy League graduatesone trained as an educator, one as a lawyeropted-out of white collar career trajectories to create a program where families could move out of poverty and into the workforce.  The program trained inner-city mothers to become certified day-care workers while simultaneously providing child care for their children while they were in educational classes.Now, nearly a decade later, their grassroots non-profit, All Our Kin, has expanded its vision  to provide all children, regardless of socio-economic background, with all the advantages that our privileged society is capable of providing.  If All Our Kin had additional monetary resources they would be able to expand their efforts to reach additional communities in need.I have worked directly with a group of their Hispanic child-care providers when I offered a free yoga class aimed at teaching skills for stress reduction and mindfulness.   I found the providers to be dedicated and heartfelt individuals who have directly benefited their communities through their day care centers.

That way, readers of the text are exposed to careers that are outside of the usual trajectory (e.g. Psychology, Education, Nursing, Social Work, etc.), but very much benefit the development of children and adults. I also discuss All Our Kin with my university students every semester, and have some students that would like to volunteer. Many of my students are of modest means though, and work full-time in addition to taking courses full-time.Were All Our Kin to have increased financial support, I believe a greater number of students could become involved, even as part-time interns. Should that be the case, more of the community would be served by their fantastic organization.
All Our Kin	8884	12	/users/profile/10658	Diane	Volunteer	5	08/08/2009	All Our Kin was founded and is run by two passionate, dedicated, and creative young women who ten years ago recognized a need and moved to fill it.  The program has an impact on the people it serves and the broader community.  Home day care providers are given the tools and support to successfully create a safe, healthy, stimulating environment for an underserved population of children.  The providers are offered training, technical assistance and a network of like minded professionals so that they may move toward accreditation and beyond.  Enabling the providers, mostly women previously unemployed, to become small business owners has had a positive economic impact on their communities.

Donor	5	08/07/2009	All Our Kin represents the finest in proactive and forward thinking in the Greater New Haven Community, when it comes to programs that benefit our area's youth.  By providing support, training and access to grant subsidies for otherwise unskilled and unqualified (and, oftentimes, unemployed) individuals, AOK provides a mechanism for them to learn and perfect a highly marketable skill as a certified provider of home day care services.  This is a win-win for all involved.  The trainees become highly contributing members of the community; additional slots for quality day care are created, thereby addressing some of the historical shortages that exist in the communities that need this the most (enabling parents to pursue gainful employment; and, the children who participate in these day care programs have a leg up in the development of social and academic skills, the absence of which would otherwise predispose them to deficient outcomes in their school careers.  AOK makes possible these terrific results with a minimal budget, thanks to visionary leadership and a dedicated, mission-minded staff.  It's a wonderful organization, and is a model of creativity, ingenuity and success in our region.

Somnething that I dind't want to be on. I was always a hard working single mom. But there are times that you can't make it on your own and you need the help. I heard of the program threw my Social Worker from the state and he helped me get in the program. I was very very happy that he got me this opportunity to do this kind of work. All our kin help me get my self esteem back up. I was with All our Kin from 2002-2003; I met about 5 other girls in the same situation as me but some of them just went to All our Kin just to go becuase if they didn't go they will have there assitance taken away. The honest truth is that All our Kin has help me alot. It was like going to work every single morning. It thought us the responsiblity of getting up in the morning and going to work. "very cool" not alot of people like to get up and go to work. The staff what to say about them;they are the nicest staff that i have ever met. They are understandable, nice, fun, loving and caring. They were always there for you when you needed a helpiong hand. I also was exicited when All our Kin went to Washington DC "THE ALL AMERICAN CITY" and we won! I was very proud of all of us. Especialy for ALL OUR KIN. The services were be on expected they did what ever it took for you to be the best provider in the City. the results from this nonprofit is that you leave with a job in your hands after you graduate from the program or you end up opeinging your own Chid Care Center. This is what makes ALL OUR KIN AMASING. When I graduated from ALL OUR KIN I started to work at a family Chid Care Center. You will make it but you have to believe in yourself and always say to yourself that you can do it. I will alwyas thank ALL OUR KIN for what they did for me. For me I will recomend ALL OUR KIN to every single mom that wants to make it on there own. All our Kin is one of the best programs that I have been in. Keep the Good work up!

Their programs are data-driven and need-based, and their results very impressive.  While other communities in Connecticut have lost child care teachers in past 10 years, leaving few care options for low-income families, the number of family child care teachers in New Haven--and the quality of the care provided--has increased, thanks to All Our Kin.

These children with chronic illnesses get to experience a fun, safe, loving environment in rural Connecticut that lets them play like any other children.  Just like the kids, I look forward to my week each year at camp - it is inspiring and motivational!  In addition to volunteering my time, I am also a donor .  See you at Camp!  Dr Dave

Every year I hope I can get time off from work to go volunteer again.  Well structured, well organized, excellent staff training, and use of resources.  They do an excellent job of fullfilling their mission statement.  My own children were campers here, as well as volunteers and their experiences were life changing.  It is clear that the children's needs and happiness are put first. Hole in The Wall is a glimmer of hope and respite for families struggling with chronically ill children.   The only criticism I can give (since you asked for it) is integrating volunteers into the routine of camp.  This can be difficult because the full summer staff is such a tight knit group.  The effort is clearly there to bring everyone up to speed quickly  Frankly, I don't know how anyone could effectly do this, but you ask for a criticism, and if there is some way I'm sure Hole in the Wall will find it.

I was a very angry eight year-old when my mother brought me to camp for the first time.  She jokes that when she picked me up it was like picking up a different kid.  The Hole in the Wall is like no other camp on the planet.  It lets children who have all kinds of medical difficulties live, play, and celebrate just like normal kids.  At camp, each child has a different story but they are all in the same boat.  We laughed at doctor jokes, we climbed the rock tower, and we camped out despite our medical regimes.  There is so much love in one place, its almost impossible to stay angry.  That what makes the Hole in the Wall the most amazing place on earth.

It is one of the most magical places on the planet, an oasis in the middle of the Connecticut woods where kids and their families who are suffering from blood diseases and cancer can rediscover fun. Volunteering there is not easy, but it is GOOD work. And some of the most rewarding time I have spent on this earth.

Our family first went to HITWGC for a Family Weekend, and it was the first time we were able to spend time with people "who just get it".  Once my children attended camp we saw a huge weight lifted...they finally felt like they had a place to belong. The kids were so happy to spend time with people who cared and understood. My kids are addicted to HITWGC, they would live there if it was allowed. Thank you camp for giving my family a new start.

To witness the joy that camp brings to these children has been such a gift to me!  The days and nights  are filled with opportunities for children to experience activities that they might never have had the chance to try.  The staff is AMAZING and filled with boundless energy and enthusiasm for their campers.  There is such an atmosphere of love and respect spread throughout camp.  In just a short week, I have watched kids become so close within their "cabin" family, learning new things about themselves and their peers.  These life lessons are as important a part of camp as the fun that just comes with the whole experience.  If you are blessed enough to have the opportunity to come to camp, as a camper, a counselor, or as a volunteer, your life will never be the same!!

Ordinary summer camp experiences like catching a fish, building a birdhouse, riding a horse, climbing a rock wall, or going swimming may well be out of the question for many of our campers  - until they spend a week at The Hole In The Wall Gang Camp.  The Medical Staff, Summer Staff, and volunteers show remarkable resourcefulness so a camper can safely experience all the camp activities that he/she wants.  I now have a camper granddaughter who recently summed up her perspective on camp "Everybody here is my friend".

Needless to say, my love of camp runs both deep and broad.  Others have said many of the things that I might have said--about how camp changes kids' lives, about the excellent medical staff, about how well maintained the beautiful facility is and about how thoughtful and intentional the programming for children is.  All I can add is this.  I took my five year old to camp this weekend. It had been a bad day in kindergarten. She spent the weekend jumping out of her skin with joy.  On Monday morning, she told the parent of one of her classmates that she'd been at camp, and the parent asked her what kind of camp it was. Her answer, "the kind of camp where you're a rock star."  And that's the crux of what camp is: the kind of place where after just two days, you're a rock star!

The Hole In The Wall Gang Camp is unbelievable ! It is very hard to put in words all taht camp has done and given my son. It was a place where he didn't feel out of place . A place where no one stared or pointed . It was a place he could be a kid and do all the things his disease takes from him on a daily basis ! Camp is magical ! They transform kids. If they are shy they leave being outgoing  !  The staff is AMAZING ! They know how to ease a mom's fears . I have never let ANYONE manage his disease but camp made me feel comfortable. He made friends that will last a life time. Camp makes each child feel special and that they can conquer the world. It gave them acceptance . A place where they could just be kids not sick kids.  That is a priceless gift !  Camp is a a PRICELESS Gift not only to the children but to their families !

I find working at the camp very fulfilling and satisfying. The campers are very active. They love to dance at every meal. They develop great friendships with one another and with the staff. With all the adversity these children face in their daily lives, they really value their relationships. They are mature beyond their years because of what they are going through. They appreciate that life is more about relationships than things.

Now I am 5.000miles away from camp and it has been many years since my last summer there but every single memory is still with me every day of my life helping me in noumerous ways.

You see about the brightest of the brightest smiles all over on these children faces. You find that there are better things in life than just thinking about yourself or worrying about the smaller things in life. When really you could be helping millions of children who just want that normal life like any other kid/teen their age. You could give them that. By giving them that, you could give yourself peace and happiness. Love and Joy. It's changed my life volunteering there as an L.I.T. I was a camper as well.

It helps restore a sense of normalcy to families whose lives have been turned upside down by serious illness.  Quite simply, its a place where kids can come and be just that...kids.   The camp staff are among the most dedicated and caring individuals I have ever met and they always find a way to help the children to have a traditional camp experience.  At the end of the week the kids said things to me like "I live for this week" and "this was the best week of my life," but what the parents said was even more poignant..."I haven't seen my child smile like this in such a long time" and "you dont know how much this means to find a place that will take my child just the way they are."  
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	59084		/users/profile/63613	karen p	Volunteer	5	12/26/2010	I started volunteering as a Camp nurse in the summer of 2009. Since then I have been back for several family and camper reunion weekends. I work as a nurse in an outpt dept at CT Children's Medical Center and I have been able to help some of our "kids" apply to Camp and it has been rewarding to see them go and have fun and come back to tell the songs they have learned and the experiences they have had. I plan to volunteer again as a nurse for weekends in the upcoming year and for an entire week the summer of 2011. I LOVE Camp. It is hard to explain but it is such an incredible place. I have met amazing people ...campers, their families, medical staff, volunteers, paid staff , counselors. They are an incredibly giving , loving bunch who work tirelessly to give these kids a phenomenal camp experience. I never see anyone say no to these kids (unless it is a safety issue of course)j. They will do their best to be able to allow the kids to do what makes them happy. They are so encouraging. The kids feel safe in this Camp environment, they don't have to worry about being picked on or not being able to do something because of their medical issues. I love watching the "kids be kids" . They TALK to each other (no cell phones or computers), they experience "cabin chat" which for me was an awesome experience, they create things, they make things. They use their imaginations to perform and create projects. They love to fish...that is one of their favorites.From a medical perspective the staff nurses and the volunteer nurses  and the physicians are amazing. They never seem to get tired. I have seen a staff nurse work all  day, stay up all night with the older kids keeping them safe during a camp-out and then accompany a sick child to the emergency room the next day--in her pajamas--and never complain. It is such an uplifting place to be. You would think with all the medical issues and illness that this would be a depressing place to be but it is exactly the opposite. The kids are inspiring. It is so rewarding to see them making friends, helping each other and learning about themselves. They can't wait to come back. I always leave Camp with much more than I came with and I can't wait to go back. I feel very lucky to be a part of such an amazing team.

We have seen first-hand the destruction that a child's life-threatening disease can cause to the child and his or her family.The camp, which is free, doesn't cure the disease of course, but it does allow each child to just be a kid for a while without having to dwell too much on the illness itself, as well as to recognize that he or she is not alone.  At the same time, it also provides a respite to the families who tend to spend a lot of time with their sick children - sometimes to the detriment of their healthy children or the parents' relationship.My wife and I have met many remarkable people over the years - staff, other volunteers, parents and children, and have formed lasting friendships.  In many respects, these people have become extended family.  Paul Newman once told me that he got more out of the camp than he contributed.  I agree with that sentiment.  I can't think of another organization that is more worthy of a person's time and money.

As a camper I would live for the one week to go to the place where I could be my complete and total self without judgment. The counselors were not only my caretakers for the week but my friends who never showed lack of interest in me. It did not take me long to figure out that I wanted to be a staff member for camp. In my mind it was a no brainer decision to become one of the coolest people on the face of the planet. At least this was my view of all the counselors at camp. Making the transition from camper to counselor was everything I hoped for and more. I finally had the opportunity to bring the same joy which I experienced into hundreds of campers lives. I have also been able to develop amazing lifelong relationships with my fellow staff members. I feel so honored to be able to work with such loving, kind and selfless people summer after summer. One of my favorite things about being a counselor who was once a camper is having a deeper insight on some of the everyday struggles a young boy with Sickle Cell disease may have undergone.  Three years have passed since my first year as a counselor and I am still in awe of the mission we are able to accomplish every summer. I cant wait to complete my journey as a counselor this upcoming summer and hopefully make it nothing short of legendary for the campers of 2011.

Little did I know that I would be leaving with so much more than I arrived with.The enthusiasm, the courage, the spirit, the friendships, the fun, the creativity is greater than you could ever imagine. The genuine sense of caring, from the smiles and hugs , to carrying a child on your back or in your arms because they have used up all their energy at play and are blissfully tired. The encouragement to perform on stage , ride a horse , make a birdhouse or pass a swim test. The environment at Camp is perfect for making awesome things happen and that's why we keep coming back year after year to witness themAdrienne

In my formative years, I worked at summer camp for a couple of years which has a great reputation. My first time @ Hole in The Wall, I was speechless. It really is a special place. The staff get you pumped up and happy to be there from the time you enter the gates. It's very well organized, there's so much to do, and you feel at home:) Between the sessions for campers, siblings or family's, the camps enviroment and staff  make everyone who attends feel like a hundred bucks. The children & family's who attend, haven't been dealt the best hand in life. The HTWGC make them feel real, normal & together again. Our youngest son, who sometimes can be introverted and a hard shell to crack socially, is convinced Camp is the best place on earth. 
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	57340		/users/profile/60528	MichelleR	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/18/2010	The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp should claim the title, The Happiest Place on Earth! I have never heard, seen, and experienced more laughter, joy, and play in one summer. The campers and staff truly embody the Camp rules of Safety, Respect, and Love I was the Camping Specialist, currently volunteer for family/camper weekends, and will be back again next summer as full-time summer staff. The facilities are state of the art, the programs are incredible, but what makes Camp so magical are the people. During the year, I am a teacher and the staff and volunteers at The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp are the most dedicated, enthusiastic, and qualified group of professionals that I have ever worked with. They meet each individual camper at their level. Through creativity and the passion to make sure each child is included in every activity, our campers see themselves as children rather than being defined by their disease.  One of my favorite camp memories was when one of my campers, who is wheelchair bound, went up the high ropes tower via team fly (our cabin lifted her up to get to the top of the wall) and zipped down. Then, she turned to me and said, I cant walk, but after just two days at Camp, I can fly! The energy at camp is electrifying, everywhere one turns there are campers and staff singing, dancing, and applauding one another.  This spirit is exemplified during the Awards Ceremony where every camper is recognized and gets a standing ovation for their accomplishments that past week. After a week of Camp, our campers leave with a confidence and stronger spirit and sense of self. I wish I could do Camp justice in just a few paragraphs, but it is an indescribable place that has infinite benefits for anyone that experiences it. 
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	57237		/users/profile/60172	Lucinda	Volunteer	5	11/17/2010	After a week of the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, a  volunteer cabin counselor  understands a new world view, a new language and a code of conduct:There are only 3 principles to run your weeksafety, respect and love, and the kids really do believe in them.There are only 3 rules, No physical violence, no killer statements, and no unsupervised activities, and if they were followed in the world wed all live in Utopia.But there is a fourth rulehave fun. Its an impossible rule not to follow. You will never in your life ever see so many people putting so much energy and talent and creativity and hard work into hard playing. You usually dont notice the hard work part.You notice that when someone mentions what or how much they make, it doesnt refer to income but the volume of crafts and woodshop projects created.You realize  that the only colors that really matter in this world are  unit colors: purple and blue and red and green and yellow and if you mention one, a loud cheer with complicated rhythms executed in perfect synchrony might very well ensue.You wonder why clowns dont help out in our lives everyday. Things would work out so much better.You learn that you can get really tired and not much sleep and still just thrive! Each day of the week has a name but its not Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, but Fun Day, Stage Night Day, Party Night Day. Camp is  the only place other than a Broadway musical where singing and dancing can break out at any time.The most important meeting of the day is when everyone is in bed and a candle is burning and its time for cabin chat.Overnight transformations of places you were in only hours ago occur regularly. Where did that gorilla come from?  Was that totem pole there yesterday? People transform too.Random acts of kindness are performed by super secret agents.That there is true goodness in the world and it is possible to spread it around .Every risk you might take to be better, stronger, kinder, more artistic is not so scary with a lot of help from your friends.That homesickness is never as hard to deal with as sadness about leaving camp. Its a good world to understand.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	52004		/users/profile/52812	nyc-campvolunteer	Volunteer	5	09/08/2010	You can read other reviews about The Hole In The Wall Gang Camp that will be more eloquent and more detailed than anything Id ever be able to share (And, by the way, theyre all so terrifically written and so spot-on accurate!). So my short, simple story goes something like this: I first heard of Hole In The Wall Camp over 15 years ago, but didnt get the chance to jump into the mix until the Summer of 2009. Since then, Ive worked as a volunteer counselor at camp, worked at one-day outreach programs in the city, worked at fund-raising events, worked at the New Haven administrative offices  Id gladly, voluntarily work any time, any place for this organization because of what they stand for: Safety, Respect, Love. You feel it every minute youre around this place. Everyone you meet  from the staff, to the volunteers, to the kids themselves  has an energy and enthusiasm and passion for life thats hard to find in such abundance anywhere else. This is an organization with a singular, laser-like focus: helping seriously ill kids and their families have some serious fun! There arent too many things more rewarding than seeing a smile or hearing a laugh coming from the heart of a Hole In The Wall camper. If youre considering attending camp, volunteering at camp, or giving to camp, this is THE place to do it!
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	32313	2	/users/profile/33106	doris	Client Served	5	03/03/2010	My daughter Vanessa Gonzalez was a camper at The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp from 1999-2003.  This marvelous, miraculous camp changed her attitude about her illness completely.  It is a wonderful place, like no other on this earth.  From the 1st moment you arrive and are welcomed by the wonderful staff and counselors, to the last day when no one wants to go home, the children are treated like kings and queens. I, myself, spent a couple of weekends at the camp on parent retreats and also as a volunteer on work weekends.  Everyone is wonderful, the place is magical, it makes you feel like it's the closest place to heaven.  I cried with joy each time I was able to visit camp because I did not want to go back home.  I love how it changed my daughter and how she became more open about her disease and more willing to help other people in her situation by just telling them her experiences and helping them through theirs.  Everyone at camp is an angel and we miss you truly.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	28059	3	/users/profile/29132	bruce-ginsberg	Client Served	5	02/11/2010	I have been a volunteer cabin couselor at Hole In The Wall Gang Camp for 8 summers now, and have been consistently impressed and amazed by the quality of the program and the permanent staff.But the best part - the part that keeps me excited and coming back - is the impact this wonderful program and these wonderful people have on the Campers and their families. I've been priviledged to see firsthand the healing and restorative effect of being in a place where safety, respect and love are not just nice words but a real way of life. And playing a tiny part in that, year by year has made me a better person, enabled me to put aside my own problems, my own struggle with diabetes, multiple surgeries and personal tragedy and have a wonderful shared experience with these children who have helped me as much (or more) than I have ever helped them.Working up at Camp has become a high point of my year and something I look forward to all year long.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	28041	2	/users/profile/29115	Tennessee_Vol	Volunteer	4	02/11/2010	Overall it is an incredible organization.  Truly, it is about these critically ill children getting to be 'kids at camp'.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	27266	2	/users/profile/28315	John M	Former staff	5	02/07/2010	I believe there are few if any organizations with a mission as important as that of The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. Nothing is more unfair than a child having to deal with a serious illness rather than the usual joys of childhood, and Hole in the Wall combats this injustice by giving kids a week as a camper when they can soak up enough sun, laughter, dancing, and love to last them for the rest of the year. And because many families are already burdened by health care expenses, every camper attends Camp for free.Being a camper at the Hole in the Wall made me change my perspective on my own disease - it was no longer something that made me different from my friends but instead something that made me unique. When I was lucky enough to return for several summers as a cabin counselor, I realized that my passion is life is caring for others, and I switched career paths and entered medical school. What an effect this 300 acre camp, tucked away in the northeast woods of Connecticut, has had on my life! But the amazing part is that there are over a thousand stories created every summer just like mine, where campers living with cancer, HIV, sickle cell, hemophilia and other serious diseases have their lives altered forever. Please help The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp help those who deserve it most.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	23663	4	/users/profile/24783	BobTedeschi	Volunteer	5	12/10/2009	I arrived at The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in the summer of 1994 as a volunteer counselor. As with so many other people who came to know this camp, it changed my life entirely. The organization has given me far more than Ive been able to offer it in my years of work there. The Camp defies easy description. Volunteers return year after year because the place offers you the chance to work long, intense hours around an intelligent, funny, big-hearted staff, and children who are often far wiser than anyone around them. Volunteers and staff members pour their hearts into the task: giving campers a packed week of play and fellowship, free of the social and physical constraints they face back home. As cabin counselors, we would routinely stay up past midnight to plan the next days activities and strategize about how to maximize the experience; how to make this one day as great as it could possibly be for our campers. At daybreak wed lock arms with them and venture into those activities, building deep friendships in whispers as we waited for a fish to bite, or in songs shouted in the dining hall, or in silence around a candle at the close of the day. At the end of the week, those children are members of Camps family  a status that guarantees a lifetime of support from anyone affiliated with the place. The support extends to siblings and parents as well. They rely often on that support, and we are the better for it. For many whove stood in a joyful swarm of Hole in the Wall campers, we have been transformed into people who more fully understand what it means to love those around us, while serving a purpose that is far greater than whatever material goals we might have. Paul Newman somehow knew there would be magic in such a place. Its difficult to believe that even he knew just how much magic there would be.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	23523	12	/users/profile/24632	Jmurray123	Volunteer	5	12/08/2009	I came to Hole in the Wall for the first time 8 years ago.  I volunteer in the cabins and take care of the kids 24/7.  I think about how much trust parents would need to go against their protective instincts and leave their child who has a life-threatening diagnosis out of their sight and in our charge, in the woods and far from home.   The parents know how valuable it is.Ask the parents about the Hole in the Wall organization.  They trust this organization with their most valuable presence  their family.  Everything the Hole in the Wall does upholds that responsibility and trust.  The Hole in the Wall organization defines the standard that other non-profits aspire to.  They require the highest level of performance from staff, volunteers and from themselves, because the kids deserve it.  The organization does absolutely everything at the highest level of integrity, whether it is construction of a tree house, injury prevention, a BBQ, groundskeeping, facility maintenance, medical services or safety.  What Hole in the Wall values is children, who will never know how much diligence it takes to do things right, and they shouldnt.  They are, after all, kids. The parents decision to send their child is met by the staff with diligence and focus on the well-being and happiness of the camper.  Parents benefit from a week of relief.  Siblings benefit from getting the undivided attention of their parents, and may even be lucky enough to attend as a sibling camper during the last session, strengthening bonds between brothers and sisters. These children supported by the work of the Hole the Wall organization were dealt an absolutely terrible hand of cards and face things that no child should have to face.  The camp gives them the opportunity to be kids again, which medicine can sometimes forget to stress.  At camp, the devastating effects of disease can cease to exist because children are not identified by their diagnosis, but by their name instead.  The staff sees the child and not the disease.  So simple.  The love and support of parents is supplemented by a network of counselors and staff who constantly stress the Hole in the Wall message of Yes, you can!  Campers blossom in a week, often in a day, and when they see this happen in other campers, they realize they arent alone in their battle against disease.   Each summer, I find a way to get back to CT and spend two weeks in the presence of their greatness.  This organization isnt about illness, it isnt about doctors visits or status symbols or celebrity.  It is about the children, that they may see and be seen, be acknowledged and celebrated.  This principle is in everything- in the food, at the archery range, at the fishing dock, in every single thing.  Hole in the Wall celebrates the glory and life of the children.Newmans kindness is everywhere on camp- in the dining hall, in the rafters of the theatre, at the campfire.  The kids and staff understand that presence.  Each week I am there, I leave exhausted, in the best way possible.  I give all I can to them, and they deserve that. This place always helps me to re-focus and know again what is important in this life.  For that, I thank Hole in the Wall not for what they do not for the children, but for what they do for me.  The only bad thing about this camp is that as a camper, you have to have a life-threatening illness to go there.There are no ordinary days at Hole in the Wall- never have been, never will be.  Every day is cherished.  If I had my way, I would never leave there.  I would stay and do work with this level of meaning forever.  I will be back this summer, and will keep coming back until they dont need me to wait for the thousands of children that arent able to attend due to the overwhelming need.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	23196	9	/users/profile/24274	Jarrett	Former staff	5	12/02/2009	I was a full summer counselor at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for six summers. I had a front row seat to the lives of so many wonderful kids who were dealt such unimaginable plights. The campers at Hole in the Wall Gang Camp lived their lives to return to camp for weekend reunions and summer sessions. It gave them a bright source of hope in their most difficult of times. And the power that had on the child resonated throughout their families. A fact that is only magnified by the fact that Hole in the Wall extends programming to siblings and parents.The way the camp trains their staff is superb. Beyond the obvious medical concerns to look out for, we were given the tools needed to treat everything from home sickness to unruly behavior in such a way that was at the utmost respect to the camper. If I had to sum up my camp experience with one story, it would be the following. I was sitting on the ball field with campers on break from some goofy Sports and Rec activity that involved safety cones, hula hoops, and most certainly water guns. One of my 14 year old campers looked at me and said, "You know why I love it here? Because when you talk to me, I don't feel like Greg with cancer, I just feel like Greg."
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	22921	10	/users/profile/23949	mjbaral	Client Served	5	11/21/2009	Im a mom.  Not a soccer mom.  Not a hockey mom. Im a cancer mom.  The day our son, Aaron, was diagnosed; we entered world of chemotherapy, surgeries, radiation, seemingly endless doctors visits and hospital stays.  Most of that first year was spent in the hospital, sharing a 9x9 room with Mom and Dad.  For a kid who had just started high school, it was difficult to lose his hard fought independence.  His body took a hit, but his spirit took a hit too.  When his docs recommended The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, we had to think it through.  They wanted us to send our bald, fragile, vulnerable son out to the woods - for a week - alone.  But, he was not alone.  Surrounded by loving, giving counselors, other kids going through the same kind of rough times and a full medical staff, camp gave him a chance to heal his spirit.  He enjoyed woodshop, movies and swimming.  He was too weak to climb the rock wall tower, but The Hole in the Wall Gang had the answer:  cabin lift.  His cabin-mates grabbed a hold of the rope and lifted Aaron up to the top.  From that perch, he looked down and saw that he was not alone.  He would never be alone.  As part of The Hole in the Wall Gang, he has friends who understand what it is like to fight for your life.  The Hole in the Wall Gang brings together people who know how to appreciate little things - like a well-made smore round the campfire.This summer, he was back at camp.  At the rock wall tower, he was the one helping pull others to the top.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	22795	8	/users/profile/23790	mzatyrka	Client Served	5	11/17/2009	I attended The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp as a camper and later as a volunteer counselor.  I have zero hesitation stating that camp changed my life and made me who I am today.  I was born with a severe bleeding disorder, hemophilia.  My body also developed an inhibitor, which means my body rejected the only medicine available to treat this disease.  As a result, I quickly developed crippling joints with constant bleeding into my joints causing severe chronic pain.  On top of this, at the age of 12, I also learned that I contracted AIDS and Hepatitis C from my medication to treat my hemophilia.  I was told I had about 1 year to live.  All of this led to depression and low self-worth.  It was the next summer that I learned of the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.  For years I kept to myself and became extremely shy.    Not only did I feel I wasnt worth much, but I was scared to death to let anyone into my life in fear they would discover my HIV status.  So it took me about a day at camp to really come out of my shell, but when I did, it was like discovering a whole new world!Before camp I always heard about how awful people were (usually in reference to the treatment of people with AIDS).  It wasnt until I was at camp when realizedthere are good people in this world, and more importantly, it was ok to be myself.  For that one week at camp, I didnt have to pretend I was someone I wasnt.  I didnt have hid from people in fear of them getting to know me.  I could be me100% ME!While the activities were great, it really is the people, campers and counselors, which make this the best organization in the world.  I went from feeling like a misfit to feeling like I belong somewhere.  I remember sitting up all night with my whole cabin cracking jokes, sharing stories about friends that weve lost, to making farting noises, to crying, to sharing tips on the best ways to take that gross tasting medicinethere isnt anywhere else that this happens.For the first time, I found myself.  It was no longer poor me, it was wouldnt it be cool if I didnt let my diseases define me or I now know I can do amazing things DESPITE my diseases.  Camp gave me the strength and confidence to get out of my room and actually live my life, graduate high school, be the first in my family to graduate college, intern for MTV, live on my own in L.A. and N.Y.C., backpack Europe, and now have a career, married to the woman of my dreams and actually consider starting our own family.  All thanks to the life that camp encouraged me to have!
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	10378	8	/users/profile/12258	koconnor	Former staff	5	09/15/2009	I have had the honor and pleasure to serve The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp as both a former full time staff member and a camp volunteer. The mission of Camp resonated with me from the very beginning and I considered myself lucky to serve our families. By being apart of the development team in the Camps fundraising office in New Haven, I was able to not only work closely with our dedicated donors but I also worked with our campers, their families and our volunteers. Everyone involved; donors, campers, parents and volunteers alike, all worked towards keeping Mr. Newmans vision alive, letting sick children raise a little hell and find some comfort with one another. And Camp does just that. From the second a camper and their family enter the Camp grounds, with clowns, bubbles, music and cheering counselors to welcome themto the intimate camp fires and cabin chatsto the unique opportunity to take hot air balloon rides, the experience is unlike any other. The feeling of excitement and the power of healing are infections and felt by all who enter the front gate. My job as the Director of Special Events was to translate this feeling to our donors in the hope that they would help support our mission. Meeting donors, young and old, and introducing them to Camp was an honor! Its widely known that once you experience the power of Camp you are in the family for life. I personally saw many donors make this connection and continue to not only give to Camp, but to give the gift of Camp to their entire extended family by keeping everyone involved.As a volunteer I was able to spend time with campers and their families and see first hand how far a little love and silliness can go.  Helping children forget their worries and remind them that they are just kids was the most fun Id had in years and I look forward to going back every summer. I will always cherish my work with Camp and feel very blessed to be apart of their family!
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	10022	4	/users/profile/11880	sburke	Client Served	5	09/08/2009	Our son is a former camper who first attended The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in 1989 at age 9 under active treatment for leukemia.  After several years as a camper, he became a counselor and worked at Camp into his college years.  He continues to visit Camp and volunteer for special events.   As an indebted parent, I began my volunteer service to the Camp almost 20 years ago.  I will always remain obligated to the Camp for what it has provided to our son, our family, and now so many dear friends. Paul Newmans extraordinary and perhaps impossible vision sprang to life in the summer of 1988.  The brilliance of the design resulted in its immediate success.  It has made an extraordinary impact on all those it has touched.  The Camp was conceived from a deep commitment to serve a special population of very seriously ill children in a unique environment backed by a commitment to offer the experience of a life time to kids with no other possible options for a camp experience  and at no cost to their families.  Since 1988, the commitment of the talented staff has taken the concept to new and higher dimensions and has delivered life-changing experiences to thousands of children.It is not possible to fully describe what the Camp has and continues to offer to these kids, but it is certainly magic.  When your child is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, your world as a parent changes.  Perhaps the most striking change is that you witness a sudden loss of your sons or daughters childhood.  Explaining the impact of camp on these kids and families requires an appreciation for this loss.  Camp, through its total commitment to these kids, has found a way to do nothing less than consistently restore the childhood so often lost to their disease.  Fears are consoled, talents are celebrated, friendships are fostered, confidences are engendered, choices are constantly offered, respect and love are offered non-stop, and the fun simply flows through a deep, safe and totally natural vein that is, in fact, the essence of the Camp.  I have never witnessed anything that even remotely resembles this phenomenon.The success of the Camp is immeasurable.  It has provided unique experiences to thousands of kids from all backgrounds, bound together as members of the Hole in the Wall Gang.  Every child, family and caregiver is enabled to new and higher levels of understanding of their situation and refreshed in their ability to manage their challenges.  It is a testament to the founders that the life lessons earned at Camp by all who spend even the shortest time there are touched by a life-altering experience that can and should be applied everywhere.From a personal perspective, as well as an understanding of my fellow parents, the Camp experience has allowed us to reach a new understanding of our children, the real values in life, and provided new perspectives and appreciation for the courage and generosity of others of all ages.  Our sons experience has and continues to have an indelible influence on him in his life and work as a medical doctor. The continued preservation and expansion of the Camp spirit is of such importance that I cannot overstate it.  One of my sons best Camp buddies once said:  Why cant the whole world be like Camp?
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	3282	17	/users/profile/5024	stacytruta@yahoo.com	Client Served	5	04/07/2009	I first arrived at The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in 1992 at age 12, when I was deep into treatment for osteosarcoma bone cancer.  I arrived bald, on crutches, and very apprehensive.  I had been in and out of the hospital for the prior 9 months and had barely been out of my parents sight since my diagnosis.  We nearly missed the unmarked and hidden driveway tucked into the beautiful woods.  As we drove between two large boulders, up a long driveway, and past a sparkling pond, I became more and more nervous.  Suddenly, a man in a 4-foot tall cowboy hat and a woman dressed as a clown came into view.  They were waving wildly and welcoming us into the parking lot.  As soon as we opened the doors and they learned my name, they acted as though they had been specifically waiting just for me.  There was cheering, and hugging, and singing, and dancing.  I felt incredibly special and incredibly normal at the same time.  This feeling is one of the most remarkable gifts that camp provides.  I spent four years as a camper at The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, and one year as a Leader in Training (junior counselor).  Since then I have worked there for three summers and have volunteered as a counselor and in the infirmary.  Over these years of privileged involvement Ive tried to figure out how Camp creates the magical environment of love and acceptance that makes it so unique.  Its still hard for me to describe to people who have not been fortunate enough to visit.  The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp is more than just a summer camp for children with cancer and blood diseases.  Camp finds people at the most vulnerable points of their lives- children undergoing invasive and isolating therapy for devastating illnesses, parents facing the most terrifying possibilities imaginable, siblings trying to keep the family stable throughout the struggle- and provides a respite.  It is a place where you dont have to explain your fears and mixed emotions. Where scars are battle wounds to be worn proudly.  Where bald heads, crutches, Port-a-Caths, and pillboxes are common accessories.  Where tree houses have wheelchair ramps and IV pumps run unnoticed next to bunk beds.  By normalizing all of these things, Camp allows children and families in crisis to focus on the simple joys of summer camp. The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp provides an exceptional camp experience to children with special needs.  Then they go beyond this mission and actually show campers and staff how to make the world a better place.  There is a conscious culture of kindness that permeates the environment.  The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp subtly teaches important lessons about unconditional acceptance, listening, and reserving judgment.  And they encourage people to take theses lessons and share them with the outside world after they leave. I for one am a better person for having been involved in The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp and I firmly believe that the world is a better place due to its work.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	3122	1	/users/profile/4809	camper and volunteer	Client Served	5	03/24/2009	I can still recall vividly arriving for the first time to the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.  Counselor were cheering.  The sun was shining.  Everyone was smiling.  And little did I realize that my life was about to be changed forever.  I have been involved with the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for the past twenty years.  I was a camper.  I have volunteered as a counselor.  Ive played a role in fundraising.  And I can say that the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp is truly a magical place.  There is a large population of children out there who can neither go to traditional summer camps nor simply spend the summer playing.  For those children, the Hole in the Wall Gang camp offers a unique respite.  As a camper, I fished; I canoed; I made beads; I put on plays; I climbed a rock wall; I wrote poetry; and I did all of that in a supportive, safe, respectful, and loving environment.  These experiences were, of course, great fun.  But they were also so much more.  They offered a sense of normalcy.  I too have ridden horses.  I too know how to canoe.  I too have a drawer full of arts and crafts projects.  While, perhaps for some children, these are just summer distractions, they gave, to me, a sense of being normal.  As a child, I spent much of my time around doctors or hospitals.  And during much of my remaining time, I was around those who had never had such experiences, a constant reminder that I was different.  But for a short time each Summer, I enjoyed what everyone else seemed to take for granted.  My time at camp was special for yet another reason as well: the many wonderful people that I met there.  I had a chance to meet other kids with similar life experiences and see that I was not alone.  I also met a series of mentors, young people who had left their colleges or medical schools or jobs to come offer their time to the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.  I look back upon my time as a camper and realize that I simply cannot imagine what life would have been like without camp.  Can you imagine what your life would be like if you had grown up in a different country or been born to different parents?  Consider that for a moment.  There are some counterfactuals that just cant be imagined.  For me, that is life without the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.  And my experience as a camper was not unique.  Thousands of children go through the rustic wood gate at the front of the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp and are forever changed for having done so.   Perhaps even more amazing (and almost as transformative) as my time as a camper has been my time as a volunteer.  Each time I step foot on camp or help at a camp event, I am struck by the dedication and energy of those who pour their hearts into running the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.  Try to imagine what is required in taking care of a single child with an illness or disability.  Now imagine what is involved in caring for thousands of them, while giving them a normal summer camp experience, and doing it in such a way that never feels intrusive but is always carefully supervised.  Each and every time I meet other counselors, Im always amazed by how much they can pour into that endeavor.  Passion, professionalism, and skill are a rare combination, but one that I have consistently observed in the camp staff andadministration.       A camp counselor once remarked to me that everyone gets more out of the Hole in the Wall Gang camp than they put in.  In my seven-year-old wisdom, I questioned how such a feat was possible: where did it all come from?  Twenty years later, I still do not know the answer to that question.  But I do know that it is the miracle of the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.
Hole in the Wall Gang Fund, Inc.	2963	23	/users/profile/4625	camperparent	Board Member	5	03/05/2009	In 1995, my family entered into the incredible world of Paul Newman's The Hole In The Wall Gang Camp. My 13 year old son had just completed a year of treatment for bone cancer and although he had survived the horrors of his illness, he was utterly demoralized and debilitated. The Camp gave him back his childhood and gave me and my family courage, optimism, playfulness,hope,extraordinary friendships, and a context from which we could understand how our lives had been changed and how to proceed to fashion his and our recovery.  At age almost 27, he is in good health and "on top of the world". A microcosm of total strangers inspired by Paul Newman's vision gave us this extraordinary gift and have become our lifelong friends and second family.  The Camp which is in Ashford, CT, has done this for over 17,000 children and enters its 22nd summer season in 2009. Over 1000 children will attend, all free of charge. Cancer, sickle cell anemia, HIV/AIDS and hemophilia are the major medical conditions affecting these children 7-15 yrs of age, but campers with rare disorders who could not attend camp elsewhere are also included.There is a full range of activities including, swimming, boating, fishing, horseback riding, theater, making movies, songwriting and making CD recordings, photography, arts and crafts, woodshop, archery, hot air ballooning,camping out overnight, a climbing wall with a 300 foot zip line, and many more activities. Despite the complexity and severity of their illnesses, the children are able to just have fun and many describe their week at Camp as the best week of the entire year, the time of their life, and better than Disneyland. Although one might expect a somber emotional tone, it is a place of incredible happiness, playfulness, positivity, love, respect,trust, and safety. They can't wait for the next summer's camp experience. Top tier medical care is provided by a large staff of outstanding pediatric specialist doctors and nurses. 2 Big Apple Circus clowns are resident all summer long.We have a full time music director and entertainment director and the dining hall is filled with laughter, music, song, and dancing. The Camp provides year round programming in Ashford and offsite with a special summer session for healthy sibling campers, family weekends at Camp, weekend parent retreats, off-season camper reunions, and website communication. There is also extensive programming for aged out campers. A hospital outreach program staffed by young artists who are former counselors provides thousands of visits to sick children throughout New York and New England.  The counselors who are largely college and graduate school age, 1/4 of whom are former campers, are among the most talented, intelligent, intuitive, and compassionate young folks I have ever meet. The senior administrative staff is second to none and it seems that no situation has not been anticipated and fully planned for. The Camp operates a 300+ acre facility with a 40 acre lake and is gorgeous.  The architecture is a Wild West motif with fantastic design.My entire family has served as volunteer counselors and my wife and I will return this summer for our 13th consecutive year.My fellow Board of Director members are among the most thoughtful, innovative, capable, and generous people I have ever met with several having served since the inception of Camp. They are a diverse and high-profile group of national leaders and my family and I have been the beneficiaries of their kindness and brilliance.  Paul Newman provided unique leadership and vision for  all of us and his legacy grows ever larger.  Camp has a deeply spiritual dimension as well and is a land of "the ultimate right stuff" where people perform selflessly and at their highest capacity in the name of the children.  It is a truly magical kingdom and as a parent, volunteer counselor, and 7 year member of the Board of Directors, it is a great privilege to be associated with this organization.

Beech Brook Farm	290551	1	/users/profile/380911	efroehlich	Donor	5	05/22/2016	Beech Brook Farm goes above and beyond in their effort to save and re-home horses. They have a responsible fiscal policy in place to support the horses in their care. The Board of Directors is well staffed and professional in the way they operate the organization. They have saved many equines; horses, ponies, minis, donkeys and mules. There is so much day to day work in keeping numerous horses. Beech Brook has always met the challenges to keep up with that demand. Heat, cold, deep snow; the horses are cared for. They have saved more than 130 equines from neglect or the slaughter pipeline. Fundraising becomes a way of life when there are so many mouths to feed and sometimes challenging health problems to be taken care of. I am proud to back their efforts as much as I can. 
Beech Brook Farm	289100		/users/profile/350155	Writer	Donor	5	05/08/2016	This is an effective and professional rescue that has saved more than 130 equines and placed most of those in safe, well-vetted homes. There is a solid group of volunteers and board members who have worked together for years. I am very happy to work with and support Beech Brook with my time and money.
Beech Brook Farm	261543	1	/users/profile/350155	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/04/2015	This is a reliable and effective non-profit that makes a concrete difference in the world of neglected horses and donkeys. It is a place where horses and donkeys, and even some alpacas, pigs, chickens, and sheep, are respected, well cared for, and rehabilitated to go to secure and loving homes. I am close to this organization - I am a volunteer and on the Board of Directors. I would not remain involved, however, if I doubted the integrity and capability of all the other board members and volunteers. The farm is clean and well organized. Animals are adopted to homes that are painstakingly reviewed and vetted to ensure safety and permanence. Anyone who invests their donations and time into Beech Brook Farm will see results. 
Beech Brook Farm	288998	1	/users/profile/379200	Amanda222	Volunteer	5	05/07/2016	This is an amazing rescue!! I love volunteering here. We are like a family. We all work so hard and are very passionate. Snowstorms, rainstorms, and late nights we all truck through and take care of the animals. This place is my place to go to destress and laugh. I wish we could do more but we are making a difference one animal at a time. We go to local events and explain to people not only our rescue, but how animals are being slaughtered and abused.  I would be extremely sad if I ever had to stop volunteering here!!
Beech Brook Farm	288950	1	/users/profile/379155	Doraine V.	Donor	5	05/06/2016	Beech Brook Farm consistently makes itself available for local owner surrenders, in crisis, neglected and seized horses, burros, mini's.  They have rescued over 100 horses since it opened in 2007.  They make sure the rescues are rehabbed and healthy before going to an approved new home.  The volunteers and the management are well versed in horse care and always do their best to make those needy animals feel safe and contented while they are in recovery.  I highly recommend this nonprofit rescue!!  I've attached a photo of the beautiful Tennessee Walker mare that I adopted from Beech Brook.  She would have been just another poor statistic walking on to a slaughter truck until Beech Brook stepped in to save her from a horrible fate.

George has been with me for 3 years and Ariel for almost two months.  They have a knack for always making you feel very special and loved.People say that they are very lucky to have me, when in fact I am the lucky one.  They have given me more than I could ever give them.  They have such unconditional love, and I wake up every morning looking forward to my time with them.  They have put a hoof print on my heart.

Because of this, they are one of my top charities.

Beech Brook Farm	158110	1	/users/profile/209719	PATH-Instructor	Donor	5	05/17/2013	Beech Brook Farm Equine Rescue is a wonderful rescue in South Eastern Connecticut that saves horses, and donkeys and perhaps a few other things.  I know that save the heart and souls of the animals that they save and the time and energy that is put out by the founder, Ms. Deborah Finco is amazing.  The volunteers work endless hours to fill the void of love that many of these animals have not had.   The location is in scenic and  beautiful Mystic, Connecticut on property that perfect for the farm.  Times are tough for everyone, but especially non-profit organizations such as this.  If you love animals this is the place to make a tax-deductible donation so they can continue to do the great work in having animals from abuse and neglect.

They took wonderful care of these 2 yearlings and had them gelded.  As a result, I am blessed to have these equine friends to greet me with little brays each and every morning.  The adoption process was thorough but straight-forward and the adoption fee was very reasonable.  Please consider adopting before buying, and check out the horses and donkeys available at BBF :-)

Beech Brook Farm	144137	1	/users/profile/190645	Gina24	Client Served	5	11/29/2012	My husband and I adopted our wonderful little Merlin  in August of 2011.   We were so impressed with Deborah and her professional manor yet caring ways of taking care of all the animals.  When I first visited with a friend,  Deborah took us on a tour and introduced us to all of the animals at the farm.  She told us their names and stories.......some quite sad.   Really felt she knew these animals and their needs even  if some were fairly new to her.   What she does for these animals is truly amazing!  I admire her HARD work and dedication!     Merlin is happy, healthy, and fluffy!  He spends his days keeping up with the big boys  at home or out on the trails.   He brightens the days of nursing home resident on special trips.  Sometimes residents will come her to visit him.   He makes the children smile when he swims in the lake and goes under the water and comes up like a rhino spewing water out his nostrils.  He is the best friend to our rescue dog crazy  Karma.  But most endearing he has made a horse lover out of my husband!

I have been involved with non-profits in the past, but none that takes such pride in what they do for animals that have been mistreated, not properly cared for, or at auction ready to go to slaughter...I'm glad you are here....and even more glad that I can help!
Beech Brook Farm	142966		/users/profile/66810	kristin	Client Served	5	11/26/2012	I adopted beautiful Bella from Beech Brook Farm in April of 2010.  I had been looking at several rescue barns for several months before finding Beech Brook Farm.  What struck me about Beech Brook was the amazing and tireless commitment of  Deb Finco (the owner) and the volunteers.  The farm was clean and the horses extremely well cared for in every way.  Debs love for each horse was amazing.  She knew each ones medical background, personality, riding abilities and ground manners!  Deb was up front about the good and the bad.  Bella was one of the lucky ones.  Unless more people get  involved in either volunteering, sponsoring, fostering or adopting Deb will be limited in the amount of horses she can save.  Over 90,000 horses are shipped out of the United States to be slaughtered.  Bella is perfect in every way and it  stuns me that she was hours away from being shipped to her death.  During the past months since I adopted Bella, I continually hear from people Bella is so lucky that you found her.  I always smile because I am the lucky one.  She has made my life more fulfilled and meaningful.  I would strongly recommend visiting the farm, getting to know the wonderful horses and meeting an inspirational woman.  Most of us talk about making a difference in the world Deb Finco does it every day- with a smile on her face.   Kristen Song, CT

Training is top notch, safety a priority, and interaction with the horses encouraged!  They have a volunteer page on FB where we can all chat and share great pics, and figure out new ways to contribute.  Deborah is thoroughly involved and loves to share what she knows to anyone who asks.  Money is always tight with rescues, so anyone with time, talent or money to give would find this a worthwhile cause!  Love BBF!
Beech Brook Farm	138497		/users/profile/38679	lucy2	Donor	5	11/13/2012	I have been donating to Beech Brook Farm Equine Rescue for about 3 years. I am very careful about checking out 501(c)3's and BBFER passed muster with flying colors. I have contributed several thousand dollars annually, always in response to a real need and not merely a regular request which is so common with some charities. Deborah Finco has a solid business plan (not all that common for animal rescues, unfortunately) and while she also works a full-time job, she devotes a huge amount of personal time to helping the animals she rescues to rehabilitate and rehome them. I am not in a position to adopt a horse, but BBFER gives me a lot of satisfaction that I'm providing a level of help to horses that will be rehomed once they have been given a second chance by Deborah. Frankly, I consider it money very well spent.
Beech Brook Farm	138493		/users/profile/184561	Sandra W.	Donor	5	11/13/2012	Beech Brook Farm in Mystic is an outstanding equine rescue organization!  They not only specialize in gaited horse breeds and crosses but they also have a special place in their hearts for mini horses, mini donkeys and the full-sized donkeys, too.  Beech Brook Farm has provided second chances to many horses over the years as well as providing a safe place to foal to mares and jennies, ensuring their youngsters get a great start out in life.  The hardest decision any human ever has to make is to euthanize a suffering, beloved animal when the time has come.  Sadly, sometimes there can be no other outcome.  These folks handle that awful task, too, with compassion and strength.  Lucky the horse or donkey in need of a second chance that finds itself at Beech Brook Farm.
Beech Brook Farm	115656		/users/profile/157497	jmartin82002	Volunteer	5	06/18/2012	I started volunteering at Beech Brook in Dec 2011. Right away I saw it as a safe, welcoming place for both horses and humans. The horses have a strong sense of self esteem and confidence, and  I know most did not arrive that way. Even the older horses have spirit and life, and are interested in what goes on around them. The life they show is in response to the care and love they are given. Deb Finco, Kathleen, Kathy, trainers, and volunteers all have built a kind and constructive farm where good horses can be found, and where people are given friendliness and useful equine education. I hope the place goes on forever.
Beech Brook Farm	115537		/users/profile/157325	Elaine F.	Volunteer	5	06/16/2012	I recently started volunteering at Beech Brook Farm and it has been a great experience. Deb Finco knows each and every horse, mule and donkey in great detail. The effort of the farm is clearly to help the animals become good candidates for adoption. And their dedication doesn't stop there. Recently several horses and mules that had been adopted came back for one reason or another. I don't know how an organization can be financially prepared for such unpredictable events. Meanwhile, the organization is growing and working through all the same kinds of problems that any growing business goes through. Their ability to roll with the punches and come back ready for more is a testament to their dedication.

We live in the state of Massachussets and had quite a few rescues to look at......but Beech Brook Farm ( Deborah Finco ) was quick to respond to our questions and immediately we felt connected. There is a deep passion for Rescue when you talk to Deborah and she shows it in her knowledge and care for her animals!...I have met her volunteers and they could not be kinder people! We adopted a miniature paint horse named "Pickles" and we are so ever grateful! She brings laughter and joy everyday and reminds us how fragile life can be for ALL of us. It is not easy to have a rescue .....it is hard work and dedication. Beech Brook farm is also well connected with other reputable rescues therefore I always send anyone I know looking to rescue/adopt in Deborah Finco's direction because I know they will find what they are looking for. My plan for the future is to use Pickles as a therapy miniature (she is 4yrs. old and is learning quickly) and to bring awareness and hopefully raise money for Beech Brook Farm! I hope if you are someone interested in a gaited horse, miniature or a donkey please look at Beech Brook Farm you will be connected to a wonderful woman with a great Rescue.

Dedication and education is what sets this rescue apart from all the others.  Careful consideration is given to all who wish to adopt.  Deb goes above and beyond most and it shows. She is a leader with strong conviction for what she does.  I have been very impressed by her and her operation.  Blessed are the animals that find their way to her farm.

I had followed them for awhile on FB and wanted to help them out. I offered to foster Ember and do her quarantine at my place.Deb Finco was very attentive and never once forgot about Ember. Many other rescues will bail a horse and place it and forget it. Not true with Beech Brook farm. They always do follow ups whether it is an adoption or foster home.I give Deb Finco a lot of credit as not only does she run this rescue but she also holds a full time job. Neither suffer from the other.She makes sure that things still run smoothly.Even if a crisis arises Deb keeps her cool like nothing out of the ordinary is going on.We sure need more rescues like her for sure. Bette Bouthillette

I admire their dedication of rescuing equines from going to slaughter. I think because slaughtering is illegal in United States we don't realize that many many equines are sold at auctions, put on a trailer and driven into Canada and Mexico. There is where they are slaughtered. Thanks to Beech Brook Farm that they give these equines a second chances of life in a happy loving home.

They provide these animals with a second chance of life with hope of placement into a loving home. While I am blessed that I am able to provide them with a home there are many other ways to help. I started volunteering at a rescue almost four years ago and thought I would do it for a while and here I am. The joy I receive is truly immeasurable.
Beech Brook Farm	26453	1	/users/profile/27485	BostonCowgirl12	Donor	5	01/28/2010	I think Beech Brook is doing an amazing job saving gaited horses & donkeys from the kill buyers. They are one of the only rescues in the country specifically taking in the gaited horses, and bringing them back to health and giving them wonderful new homes with people who love them!
buildOn	206731	2	/users/profile/269194	Mary268	Volunteer	5	07/20/2014	Build on does a fantastic job of blending local and global philanthropy!    Local after school programs help inner city kids find meaningful volunteer work contributing to their community AND global outreach to build schools in developing countries - often with the same kids!  Education, community, family and giving back are universal values that buildOn exemplifies!
buildOn	188141		/users/profile/245409	pam_56	Volunteer	5	11/08/2013	I have done several service projects locally with students from East Palo Alto schools, including visits to a veterans' home and hosting a holiday party for seniors.  The best part for me is working side by side with the teens and talking with them about what motivates them to give up a Saturday for service work.  They all talk about the community and connectedness they feel when they help someone else.  BuildOn's success is rooted in the way it empowers teens to change themselves and their world through service. I also raised money for a school in Senegal this year and traveled there with my 16 year old daughter to live in the isolated village and break ground on the school.  What an experience!  We will never be the same.  We gave a building, and saw how education does change lives.  But I would argue that we received more than we gave - this was an opportunity to connect with a culture and people and begin to understand their dreams and needs.  For more information, read "Walk in Their Shoes" by Jim Ziolkowski, and be inspired by the story of how buildOn is changing lives!
buildOn	187928		/users/profile/245098	annekelly79	Volunteer	5	11/06/2013	I love working with the buildOn group to fundraise in support of building schools ineternationally and I love participating in service events alongside the Boston Public School students.  This organization is well developed for success on both efforts.
buildOn	187709		/users/profile/198774	rvatsa14	Volunteer	5	11/03/2013	When I came across the efforts of buildOn, I was deeply inspired. Through buildOn, I have learned that we can make a difference, and we can break the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations around the world through service and education. As president and founder of a high school buildOn chapter for the past three years, I have been thrilled to see how far this organization has come since its inception. Over the past few school years, we raised over $35,000 and sent a team of students to rural villages in Nicaragua and Malawi for two weeks to build schools. Both journeys were truly life-changing experiences and ones that each of us will cherish for the rest of our lives. Through buildOn, we have also been able to have a tangible impact in our local community, which is a very beautiful thing! Go buildOn!!!
buildOn	149201		/users/profile/198774	rvatsa14	Volunteer	5	02/10/2013	My experiences as a High School Chapter President and Volunteer for buildOn have been among the most powerful and formative of my life. At is core, buildOn is a nonprofit organization with the goal of empowering youth in America to make a positive difference in their communities while helping citizens of developing countries increase their self-reliance through education. Spread out among more than 100 high schools, buildOn students have contributed over one million hours of service in their communities and touched the lives of more than 1,428,615 people in the U.S. itself. Furthermore, since 1991, youth chapters have helped rural communities in various developing countries build more than 500 schools, providing more than 60,000 children and adults with a better access to daily education. When I came across the efforts of buildOn, I was deeply moved and inspired. So far, my most memorable experience with the organization came in July 2012, when my chapter raised $30,000 and traveled to Bramadero, Nicaragua for two weeks to help build a school. It was a life-changing experience and one that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Through the buildOn family, I have learned that international service is possible. If we work together, we can grow as a global family and break the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations around the world. Ultimately, my experiences with buildOn have inspired me to continue serving until the day that all children around the world have access to a primary school education. 
buildOn	187589		/users/profile/244612	Katrina12	General Member of the Public	5	11/02/2013	The message of buildOn and the impact this program has both within our own country and in other countries is invaluable. To actually work at breaking the cycle of poverty and highlight the importance of education on multi levels is an impressive accomplishment. To have the actual statistics to back the efforts .... One of a kind. 
buildOn	187183		/users/profile/244180	mauramanzo	Donor	5	10/31/2013	For the past 2 years, I have helped raise funds for BuildOn to build schools in Nepal and Nicaragua. Upon completion of raising these funds (over $150k to date), our group has trekked to these countries to be part of the ground breaking. As a yoga teacher, I try to teach my students the importance of community and service, but there is only so much you can "teach" about -- the rest has to come from hands-on experience. These treks, as well as the opportunity to work with BuildOn in various capacities here in Philadelphia, have been life-changing no just for myself and the adult students who travel with us, but also to our communities here at home that have helped us raise the necessary funds. When people collaborate together towards a common goal, the sense of community becomes stronger. Through our projects here at home, we have helped connect a local community to a global community, as we have worked together to create the opportunity for education for all. The support team at BuildOn is stellar. The international trek team (both BuildOn and in-country staff) are also superb.  Upon arrival home from our international treks, many of our students have either continued to raise funds for BuildOn because of their belief in the movement or have continued to volunteer in some capacity here in Philadelphia. I am beyond impressed with this organization and will continue to work with them as long as I can.
buildOn	186334		/users/profile/243334	alannahmoorea	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	buildOn is not simply a charity, it is a movement. Not only are they breaking the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low-expectations through service and education, but buildOn is also creating a stronger community domestically and internationally. 94% of their students in programs in the United States are graduating high school AND going off to college, when before buildOn they were merely a statistic destined for failure. I owe my life to buildOn for everything that have done to positively impact my life. This organization has provided me with the tools to successfully live the life that will follow my dreams and aspirations. I believe in buildOn and love every aspect about this organization down to its Staff members. Everyone treats you like family, and helps you find a great sense of purpose in life. It is the ignition to many great minds and is leading the way to bring equal opportunity to all.
buildOn	186279		/users/profile/243272	useramyma	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	It's been four years since I first entered the door to the buildOn club at my high school and I've gain priceless experience to what life have to offer. What we; as humans can do.  One thing that will forever be in my soul is that  accept flaws, mistakes, accidents, accept negativity with a smile, because that means you are smiling with life. The change starts here and I am part of that change. 
buildOn	186250		/users/profile/243248	angelahhla	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I was introduced to buildOn through a very good friend of mine during my freshman year, and I cannot thank her enough for it. Through buildOn, I was able to grow as a person, understand the difficulties and struggles others go through in 3rd world countries, and to simply be more aware of my surroundings.  It has taught me how to work with others, how to build leadership skills, and how to get involved.  I cannot thank them enough for the experiences I received and the wonderful people I met. I love love love buildOn!
buildOn	186124		/users/profile/243104	Shane W.	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	buildOn has changed my life. I started buildOn as a freshman after realizing that i needed to become a better person. BuildOn has taught me to throw away those ignorances I had and im proud to say that in April I will be going on my first trek.
buildOn	185976	1	/users/profile/242949	LT22	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I have volunteered with buildOn since my freshmen year in high school. It is a non profit that not only accomplishes great things, but accomplishes these great things while changing the lives of everyone involved. The relationships that i have formed through buildOn i cannot even summarize with words. The knowledge and empathy ive gained are again, unworthy of words. They have helped me develop into a young man who cares about the world. A young man who has been inspired to create a change. I am truly blessed to have been fortunate enough to experience buildOn, from trek to all the other service projects we do. I could write a book on why buildOn deserves to be noted as the great non profit, they truly deserve any award they can receive. It is changing the lives of students from america to Haiti to Nepal to Malawi. Can one person change the world? Surely they can with buildOn by their side.
buildOn	185842		/users/profile/242813	aneamoore	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	buildOn is truly a life-changing organization. Its a chance for ordinary people to do extraordinary things. It turns teens into not only people who care about their community but also into great leaders who care about communities all around the world as well as the issues they face each day. Without buildOn I wouldn't be the person I am today. I remember when I used to sit around the house everyday Saturday and do absolutely nothing. buildOn has managed to turn a lazy couch potato into a young lady who is excited about getting up bright and early every Saturday so she can help her community. I used to be scared of adventure and new horizons, but now I'm a person who has faced her fears, traveled a long ways away from the embrace of my family, and lived in a rural Haitian community for two weeks while helping to build a school. And it wasn't scary at all! In fact, it was the most eye-opening experience of my life and probably the most wonderful too. 
buildOn	185799	1	/users/profile/242767	Molly27	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I'm currently fundraising with a group of people from my school to build a school in Haiti.

buildOn	185402		/users/profile/242367	megangoins	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	I joined BuildOn (then Building with Books) as a freshman at Renaissance High School in Detroit.I could not believe the size and scope of the impact of this organization globally and locally then. I was so inspired by their 'lunchroom, school-wide presentation, that I joined immediately. It was my first real experience performing service that I knew changed the lives of peopleoutside of my city. What I appreciated most from the organization is that it gave me real experience in the real global society, hard-hat leadership skills, and my first experience abroad. Honored and delighted to be a part of this tradition...
buildOn	149618		/users/profile/199470	Coline G.	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/19/2013	I interned with buildOn in the summer of 2011, after having been introduced to the organization through friends who were both alumni of buildOn's programs in high-school and members of buildOn University Chapters. I were also lucky to meet their head of International Programs in Nepal in 2010 while he was visiting some of their programs in the country. The organization is a dynamic one, that focus on the impact of education on youth but also on adults. Their focus on at-risk youth in the US, supporting them in their education and helping them to serve their community, fosters a sense of activism and responsibility that I believe is essential for everyone and for the greater good. Connecting this work to their actions abroad through treks for teenagers is a wonderful way to expose them to the world and ensure that they keep an open and curious mind for the rest of their lives.  These teenagers then become young adults that keep engaging with the issues of inequalities, extreme poverty, the protection of the environment, etc. in their studies and beyond. 
buildOn	149277		/users/profile/198904	Nelvia B.	Board Member	5	02/12/2013	buildOn is such a great organization that really focuses on making a huge impact in the education sector. Often times education is forgotten or neglected in less fortunate communities and poverty stricken nations, but buildOn makes it a priority to keep education a top priority for all. As buildOn provides support to aid after school programs and international school funding and building they are helping break this cycle.  Serving on the young professionals board I'm able to increase awareness, help raise money, and be the change. It feels great to serve and I could not have aligned myself with a better organization that helps make a difference.
buildOn	149267		/users/profile/198889	lindakechan	Volunteer	4	02/12/2013	buildOn is an incredible organization that empowers youth nationally through  the value of community service. it also emphasizes the importance of not only thinking locally, but globally through its school construction programs in rural parts of developing countries.
buildOn	149260		/users/profile/198879	angelalizer	Donor	5	02/12/2013	My experience was as both a Donor and a Volunteer with buildOn.  In January 2013 I was part of the Groupon trek to Nepal.  I can easily say it was the greatest experience of my life.  It was absolutely amazing to be part of something that will make a difference and make an improvement in the lives of so many others.  To say I have been humbled by the experience would be an understatement.  One of the greatest parts of the trek was living with the villagers and learning about their culture and way of life.  They were so excited that we were there and took great pride in showing us their village.  We had some hilarious moments sitting around the fire with our host families trying to communicate!  This trip helped me realize that a few things are universal no matter what language you speak or what country you live in: every parent wants their child to have a good education and a smile is always contagious.  I hope to be able to do another buildOn trek soon!
buildOn	149229		/users/profile/198822	John146	Advisor	5	02/11/2013	I've been working with buildOn since 2001 and I have been able to see the change it has helped create in both the local schools and communities across the world.  I became involved when they had built less than 50 schools and that number has now reached over 500!  I currently help raise funds and awareness in the Philadelphia community for this organization and I'm a proud sponsor of their annual fund raising campaigns. 
buildOn	149123		/users/profile/198679	caw2166	Volunteer	5	02/08/2013	Not many organizations have the ability and the introspection to give so much power and voice to those they are trying to help. buildOn is incredible, and I'm so excited for all the amazing work they've done, and all that they will continue to do!
buildOn	149119		/users/profile/198676	amm4ac	Volunteer	5	02/08/2013	buildOn is an incredible organization from the staff to the students they serve. Everyone is completely dedicated to the mission and it's amazing to see students so excited about service. Talking to students, it is immediately evident how much they love buildOn programing and how effective the organization is at achieving it's goals. I feel honored to get to be part of such a great group working to make my community and world a better place.
buildOn	149104		/users/profile/198653	Nelson Hill	Client Served	5	02/08/2013	Choosing the right partner for any project is essential for success. Our choice of buildOn let us participate in building a school in Nicaragua which allowed us to match the core values of our company, Listen Up Espanol, with the needs of this community.  Our partnership with buildOn created progress and happiness for the village of Nicaragua and a thorough satisfaction for employees of our company. We will build a school in Haiti in 2013.
buildOn	149101		/users/profile/198650	Raymond5	Volunteer	5	02/08/2013	I was in high school where i found this club.

buildOn	149099		/users/profile/198648	Allison30	Volunteer	5	02/08/2013	BuildOn is an inspiring organization from the students, to the volunteers to the management team. I feel blessed to be a part of its mission. The message they deliver rings true to so many young students that now have opportunities they never would have realized. 
buildOn	149096		/users/profile/198645	Omari R.	General Member of the Public	5	02/07/2013	As an Alumni of the BuildOn program they have served as a great example of community service and sustainability. My Trek experience was a major motivator and source of a purpose for me. Education is essential and a great outreach program for third world controls. BuildOn also serves as an outlet to local and international to other great organizations
buildOn	149095		/users/profile/198644	Patty22	Donor	5	02/07/2013	I've donated money to buildOn.org, but more important than the money, I got to donate my time and energy to helping build a school in the Far West part of Nepal this past January. I knew from the quality of people I interacted with before going to Nepal that this was a good organization. But after seeing for myself the dedication, heart, and attention they give to a project and seeing the incredible impact buildOn is having in the communities they serve, I can't say enough good things about them. Give them your funds, your time, and your attention and join them in making a REAL and lasting difference in people's lives. 
buildOn	149092		/users/profile/198640	ryan.math	Volunteer	5	02/07/2013	I've traveled with buildOn to Malawi four times and Nepal once to build schools. buildOn schools really have a positive impact in these communities. All my trips have been amazing life changing experiences. I've also volunteered with their domestic programs--their students are fantastic! I strongly recommend buildOn to all.
buildOn	149091		/users/profile/198639	adam.raudsep	Volunteer	5	02/07/2013	I have had the oppertunity to volunteer working with both the students domestically and trek abroad for school construction.  I can say first hand that BuildOn is changing the world.  Every aspect of the organization is well run, from the program faciliators working with the students, our trek leader, and the folks in the back office.  I am excited to be working with everyone again and planning our next trek to campaign and build two schools this November for a deserving African village.  
buildOn	149088		/users/profile/198635	Mike69	Volunteer	5	02/07/2013	I have been a volunteer with buildOn for about a year and a half now. I can honestly say that this program has changed my life, for the good. I have become a part of a family that is caring and trustworthy. buildOn is an amazing community service program that allows youth to give back in a way that they may not have experienced ever before. My buildOn family has been there for me when no one else was. This tremendous program breaks barriers and I don't know where I'd be without it.

I went to Nepal with a group of my co-workers through Build-On and found the entire process to be very well thought-out and planned. The trip itself was fantastic and trully a life-altering experience. I look forward to going on another trip with BuildOn in the coming year or 2. 
buildOn	149081		/users/profile/198625	Mike68	Volunteer	5	02/07/2013	I actively volunteered with buildOn from 2005 until 2010, contributing over 400 hours in community service. Their work made me look at the world in a whole new way and contributed to my decision to study international development in college. The staff I met were incredibly nice and engaged. I couldn't imagine going through high school without buildOn! I've seen so many people's lives improved by buildOn, both those volunteering and those who we work with.
buildOn	149079		/users/profile/198622	rebecca phillips	Volunteer	5	02/07/2013	I have been volunteering with buildOn for about four years.

buildOn	149073		/users/profile/198615	Duc L.	Volunteer	5	02/07/2013	Oh man, what is buildOn to me?? Well there's really is no words to describe it but family. Family is having people that you trust, that you love, that whenever you need help they're there with you every step of the way, that's buildOn. To make a differences in somebody's life is the greatest feeling ever. To leave after you have helped so hard and see similes on somebody's face because you took the time to be there when they needed is awarding on it's on. Like to say, wow, i just helped raise food for people who don't even have a home? or I've just taught kids something so valuable that with it they now have a future? BuildOn when you join will be a life changing experience. Trust me, It has changed me :)

Over the last four years I learn a lot from buildOn from what is buildOn to how to manage buildOn as a club. It has taught a lot of people to care for the community and help out in anyway possible to make it a better place to live. I hope buildOn will continue to grow in size and keep on "Breaking the cycle of poverty, illiteracy, and low expectations through service and education"

buildOn	143797		/users/profile/190282	Rios	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I must agree with cynsan's review!!  buildOn is an amazing organization that offers students more than a volunteer experience every weekend.  It gives students an opportunity to do amazing work with others that makes the volunteers feel good.  The Trek for Knowledge experience is life changing.  Even at 40 years old when I experienced my Trek to Mali with my amazing students from The Bronx Center for Science & Mathematics I felt it was the most amazing experience I ever had.  The students walked away with a sense of accomplishment and the satisfaction that their school will make a difference in the great village of Bla.  I encourage you to donate to this incredible organization that changes lives on a global level.
buildOn	119821		/users/profile/162885	cynsan	Volunteer	5	08/01/2012	buildOn is an absolutely amazing organization. I am a volunteer with buildOn: New York, and I'm also the kind of teenager that rarely ever did any good. I mean, it was all a bit foreign, you know? How would you go about it? Where would you go? Why do you have to be 18 for so many organizations?! Luckily, with buildOn, there's no blatant age requirement. I finally joined up  at the start of my junior year, and I'll never forget my first meeting. It was with Mai-Len and Umair, Mai-Len being one of the bubbliest people I've ever met, and Umair being one of the most supportive people I've ever met. In just that one meeting, they managed to genuinely make me feel like I was already part of the buildOn team. They also encouraged me to apply for trek. Trek is a fortnightly trip to a developing nation in order to help build the foundation of a school. As far as I know, buildOn is the only organization available to High School students that allows for such an incredible opportunity, free of charge. My time in Nepal was absolutely, immensely life-changing. I may only be 16, but I am old enough to grasp the immensity of the world, and both the good and bad in it. buildOn is good. A 'good' that's beyond definition, a good that's broadenedtenfoldthe horizons of many young adults and has helped thousands across the globe. When I got back from trek I did hit a deep depression, it was so hard to be the happiest you've ever been, only to get tossed back into your regular life. I became disgusted with the first world, with myself, and so many others. How could I just sit all day in a desk when I know that there are young girls being sold into sex trafficking, children that are kidnapped to work insane hours in farms, people dying of disease, unhealthy drinking water, and so many other horrors? Luckily a board member of a  philanthropy camp that's built on leadership and ethics helped me ease my frustrations. Emily Woods, a member of the 30/30 of Grab The Torch (camp), said she too felt frustrated with being unable to help after her international volunteer work; but that the best way to help was through education. The better you educate yourself, the better equipped you are to help the villagers of Dhurjanna. I want to be a diplomat working in the public sector, closely with nonprofits. I can't change the world, but I know I can better the lives of a few. On account of buildOn, trek to Nepal, I am determined to. There is nothing I've ever wanted more. Please, donate to this phenomenal, life changing organization. We're not a charity, we're a movement. One that currently works to better the nations of Nepal, Mali, Haiti, Malawi, Senegal, and Nicaragua... but we can't do it without your help, every penny, rupee, peso, CFA franc, (and so on) counts :)
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	318687		/users/profile/409943	Jennifer613	Volunteer	5	11/10/2016	I have been working on and off with The Haitian Health Foundation since their inception. I started as a student volunteer and have had the privilege of volunteering as a dentist since 1991.  I met my husband through volunteering in Haiti and we now have 4 teenage daughters that have all gone with us.  It is a wonderful organization. We feel honored to be able to help because it has nourished our family in so many ways to have the opportunity to help our close neighbors that have so much need.  This organization makes volunteering seamless and safe.  We look forward to many more productive years involved with them. The dental services that they provide rival those in the United States.  The facility is modern and a pleasure to work in.  I would encourage you to look into volunteering at this modern, clean and friendly organization.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	316886	1	/users/profile/408080	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/30/2016	The Haitian Health Foundation is a beacon of hope for the poorest of the poor in Jeremie and the surrounding rural area. I was given the honor of being able to travel with the HHF to Jeremie, Haiti and I witnessed firsthand how well equipped the HHF is to handle a variety of urgent needs such as neonatal and maternal care, dentistry, education, sanitation, housing, proper nutrition, and so much more. Just about every dollar donated goes directly to the people of Haiti and I cannot think of a more deserving non-profit organization to donate my time and money to. The experience that I have had, and continue to do so, far exceeds any expectation which is why I continue to volunteer for 5 years and counting! 
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	316617		/users/profile/407843	Writer	Donor	5	10/29/2016	I can think of no other organization that I would rather send my money to.  It goes right to the people who need it the most.  The people of Jeremie had nothing and now since the hurricane they have less than nothing.  HHF shows compassion to the people they serve.  They have high quality volunteers, who are dependable, attentive to detail and pro active at ways to save dollars.  I have personally experienced the working of this wonderful organization both here as well as in Haiti.  My husband believes in their mission so much that he volunteers every day and is blessed to be able to serve the poorest of the poor in Jeremie with HHF.They are truly making a difference one life at a time.  
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	314370		/users/profile/405732	EmilyEmily333	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	I cannot express how devoted, dedicated, and unwavering HHF, their staff and administration (both in the USA and abroad) is to the people of Jeremie, Haiti.  My father has been involved with this organization and boasting of their work for years and more recently I have been blessed/privileged to see their work first-hand while volunteering at their clinic in Haiti.  It is nothing short of many miracles to see what affect their passion has had on these people. I've never had such a transparent experience with any other non-profit organizations, when it comes to knowing how my donations dollars are spent, which makes it that much easier to give.   I cannot praise this organization enough.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	314340		/users/profile/405701	MCMeadows	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	I have been impressed and moved by the unwavering belief, compassion and support that the Haitian Health Foundation has for the people of Haiti. I volunteered for a field work week in 2004 with this charity, helping HHF provide dental and medical relief and programs to the people of southwest Haiti. I witnessed firsthand how donations to the Haitian Health Foundation are utilized to bring healing and hope to the people they serve and how HHF is training key people in these communities to be their own health advocates alongside the staff of HHF. Because of the solid infastructure of the Haitian Health Foundation clinic in Jremie, Haiti, the resources of HHF are tapped, as in the event of the earthquake of 2010 and now Hurricane Mathew, beyond the daily needs of the immediate region that the charity serves. I cannot recommend a more purposeful , accountable and effective charity, an organization that gives hope to a population often forgotten.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	314287		/users/profile/405652	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/25/2016	The Haitian Health Foundation is the real deal.  Extremely low overhead coupled with superior skill, care, and dedication make THIS the organization to whom  your charitable givi g should be directed.  I have personally volunteered with HHF in Haiti each year for the past 19 years and can vouch for the integrity and effectiveness of this wonderful charity.  The Haitian Health Foundation employs almost 200 Haitians in the most hurricane damaged area of Haiti and truly is THE beacon of hope in the Jeremie area.  The clinics of HHF survived the Hurricane very well but are about the only buildings that did.  Please give money today to HHF.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	314277		/users/profile/405643	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2016	Having been associated with this organization for the past five years, I am continually inspired by their benevolence and compassion for the people of rural Haiti.  The commitment that Dr. Jeremiah Lowney and his family made in the 80s to serve Haiti's poor is just as strong today, as HHF will soon begin its 35th year in Jrmie.  The hard-working staff in Haiti is now dealing with the horrific aftermath of Hurricane Matthew, which destroyed the Jrmie area.   The people living there are in need of help now more than ever.  Haitian Health Foundation is rated 4 stars by Charity Navigator.  You can be assured that this non-profit operates with integrity and transparency, and they are absolutely worthy of your trust.        
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	314145		/users/profile/405509	Nancy276	Donor	5	10/25/2016	Words cannot describe the incredible family behind this foundation. Through a series of coincidences, I crossed paths with the Lowney family around 2006. We hosted many a Christmas fundraiser for Haiti in our home for the Haitian Health Foundation after that. In 2010 I opened Petite Chef...a place where kids come to bake their own party desserts. A donation of $10 is set aside for each birthday child so after 15 parties we purchase a goat for a family in Jrmie, Haiti. The kids love it and get to name the goat too! Marilyn Lowney is so kind..she always makes sure I get a photo of the goat being presented to the family so that I can show all the kids! We have had many children who know about this program and ask their friends to not bring them gifts, but to bring a donation so that they can buy a goat in honor of the birthday child. As of Oct. 2016 we are now raising funds for our 54th goat. The "Kids for Kids for Kids" (our kids, kids in Haiti, kid goats) has been a huge success. The work of this foundation is second to none. Deserving of many more than 5 Stars! Why not start a new tradition in your home this Christmas? Involve your kids! It's so important for our children to learn to give. 
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	313428		/users/profile/404798	annie-mac	Volunteer	5	10/22/2016	I  served as a  staff person in  the  Jeremie Clinic of  Haitian Health Foundation in the  late  nineties  and  returned as a  volunteer  recently. The  compassionate  outreach in  so  many  areas of  need  is  amazing.  The  ministry encompasses  service to patients  in  the  Clinic, but  also  assists local people  and  those  who  live  in surrounding  villages with health  care, housing, clean  water, education of children,  donated animals as  a  means  for  livelihood,and  education of parents in  childcare just  to  name  some. I have witnessed  and  rejoiced  in seeing  the  growth of  this compassionate  ministry  grow  from a clinic in Jeremie  to  serve thousands  of  people  in  surrounding areas  where  poverty is so  evident.Dr Lowney  and his  staff are to  be  commended  for  their wonderful  ministry.  
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	313309		/users/profile/404682	Writer	Board Member	5	10/22/2016	The Haitian Health Foundation is extraordinary. It does what it says it will, and I know that because I serve on the Board, and more importantly have been going to the place where it works-Jeremie, Haiti-, as a volunteer physician for 27 years.  The Administration under President Dr Jeremiah Lowney, CEO Marilyn Lowney, and In-Country Administrator Nadesha Mijoba  are peerless in their dedication and effective hard work.   The hurricane Matthew has devastated this precise area of Haiti. The peoples' losses are very great. HHF has been there for the residents of town and mountain for 30 years. They are trusted and depended upon, and indeed are leading recovery efforts right now.  Whatever we can donate will , assuredly, be properly and efficaciously used.  
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	312917	1	/users/profile/404288	Bones58	Volunteer	5	10/21/2016	I learned of the Haitian Health Foundation back in 1997.  Dr. Jerry Lowney, President of the HHF was a good friend of my dad's.  My father had poor health and was never able to make the trip to Haiti to volunteer.  He asked if I would consider going in his place as he knew of the great things that were being done by the HHF.  My wife and I made the trip and were astonished at the need for assistance the poor in Jeremie needed, but were equally astonished how the HHF met the needs and how efficient and organized this organization was carrying out the work.   Since that first visit I have been back to volunteer many times and have seen how things have improved in Jeremie and the surrounding areas through the HHF efforts.  In a place where usually well intentioned organizations try to accomplish things, many times nothing results.  Not the case with HHF.  In addition to the healthcare the HHF provides, this organization runs so many projects such as feeding and nutrition programs, housing, livestock and education.  These projects are done and done right.  The HHF's overhead is low and I have seen first hand that every dollar donated directly benefits the poorest of the poor.  Over the years I have watched new programs and projects evolve and become successful.  Programs that help teach recipients to help themselves and in the long run show them a life with dignity and purpose.  We all love winners and the Haitian Health Foundation is a winner.  I never dreamed back in 1997 what a great gift my dad gave me by sending me down to the HHF in Haiti.  Hurricane Matthew was certainly a set back, however the HHF will rebuild what damage they incurred and are already helping the people of Jeremie and surrounding areas rebuild their lives as well.  I can't ever see myself not supporting the Haitian Health Foundation.   
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	312796	1	/users/profile/187616	Christine62	Donor	5	10/20/2016	Fourteen years ago I had the priveledge of finding out about the Haitian Health Foundation's work and after calling them and "interviewing" them they passed my test.  That means most of every dollar you donate goes directly to the poor folks suffering from third world country issues.  I have been supporting the same family in the Save a Family program for 14years, bought a few Happy House for special people a latrine and a bunch of goats.  I dont waste my money on gifts that land in the landfill....I like to get and give real GIFTS....those that  help people with their health, women with their babies,  smart nutrition programs and more.  I have toured the humble  home base and these folks are all dedicated to the mission of helping the people inJeremie.  I am their biggest cheerleader and if I could give them 10 stars, I would give them 11.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141325	1	/users/profile/187616	Christine62	Donor	5	11/19/2012	I began giving to this charity after my father died and left  me a little pot of money.  I wanted a portion of  it to go to a legitimate charity so I began my search which ended in prayer.  I asked God to show me what charity was doing good work and not wasting money.  Then I put the tv on and there was a spot on EWTN that showed what the Lowneys do in Jeremie.  I loved the humble beginings but I was still not convinced so I wrote down all my questions/concerns and sent an e-mail to Marilyn and she answered everything.  Thus began a love affair with the Haitian Health Foundation and the Haitian people....that continues to this day.  It is the real deal for sure and it's good for your heart.  Even your cholesterol will improve!   LOL.  just kidding. 
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	312714	1	/users/profile/404087	Writer	Donor	5	10/20/2016	HHF is one charity that my husband and I make sure to give to every year. I have seen their maternal care facility in Haiti and they are really saving lives. These women would be left to deliver their babies in the most rural areas and in high-risk medical situations.When we donate and ask for a Happy House to be built, we know it gets built. That is life-changing for a family. I feel certain that HHF does good with every penny, which is why I encourage my friends and family to give also.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	312700	1	/users/profile/404073	dcddmd80	Volunteer	5	10/20/2016	I love this charity.  I have been on dental missions with HHF the last 4 years and I am scheduled  to go again in 2017.  The staff couldn't be nicer and the vast majority of the donations get to where it needs to be, the poor people of Jeremie.  My wife and I sponsor a family and buy goats for poor families in lieu of Christmas presents for each other.  I have no reservations recommending this charity to my friends and relatives.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	312478		/users/profile/403851	jjkids33	Board Member	5	10/20/2016	Amazing staff in Haiti and USA! So amazed at the work they do!!
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	294330	1	/users/profile/385072	smecca	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/30/2016	HHF has been helping to meet basic human needs in Jeremie, Haiti for decades.  While I cannot speak for the early years, I can say that HHF runs a lean - focused program under the capable direction of it's Center Director, Nadesha Mijoba, who understands international development and works to insure that appropriate successful models are in place in the clinical facilities and programs she directs.  The Happy House, an effort to provide basic housing to families in need, balancing donor contributions with recipient inputs (harvested materials and labor), has already provided 3000 homes.   Going forward, HHF will be adding the GSAP Microflush toilet to the Happy House and low cost WASH elements plus an inexpensive (~$50) solar system to provide lighting and phone charging.  Donations to HHF have a lasting impact on the people and community they serve.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	143965		/users/profile/190463	Barb17	Donor	5	11/28/2012	We have been very happy with the results of our donations to HHF. We also supported our daughter to travel to Haiti to volunteer with HHF and she was personally very deeply affected by the attention and care that accompanies all the efforts on the ground in Haiti, by especially employing so many Haitian nationals in the work.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	143835		/users/profile/190322	Susie11	Donor	5	11/28/2012	HHF does great work.   Glad to be a small part in what they do!  
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	143106		/users/profile/189535	ETWhe	Donor	5	11/27/2012	The efforts of the Haitian Health Foundation are remarkable. Their work in Haiti and there mobilization of community resources in Southeastern Connecticut have made a significant difference in the lives of Haitians and those here who support them. So much is done with grace and quiet commitment. The staff are careful stewards of the funds donated, and the Foundation's publication indicate what has been done with donations in a personal way. We  are in their debt.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	142981		/users/profile/189407	Ed__11	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	My family have had the privaledge of serving our underserved neighbors in Haiti through the Haitian Health Foundation by being volunteers and donors. Having gone on a mission trip myself with HHF, I was able to experience first hand how well this charity is run in distributing donations to those in such great need. I had the pleasure of meeting in one of the villages served, one of the families who received a Happy House in place of their previous hovel. The gratitude is real and the step up in quality of life is, undeniably for some, a factor in survival. There is follow up when a donation is made for a specific need, such as a Happy House, or a goat, etc comes in the form of an actual picture of the family helped at their new dwelling or with their newly given livestock, so one knows that the money has gone perfectly as directed in their gift (I have heard of some folks going on a mission trip and having the opportunity to meet the family in person!).  Attending a container packing event closer to home, one sees how a variety of needs is met by the diversity of food, clothing, building materials, etc. going into the sea-going containers. The work is never-ending, and the dedication of the staff in Haiti and in the states is unwavering and with the large effort of many volunteers added is a beautiful sight to behold.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	142879		/users/profile/189311	MissEHakk11	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I volunteered from time to time for this organization while I lived in CT. I have rarely seen such dedicated and honest people who cared so deeply for the cause they worked for. I know my time & donations that I gave to HHF directly benefited the people of Haiti and that I helped a wonderful organization and as small as my gifts were, that they were appreciated.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	142828		/users/profile/100548	C. L. Fisher	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	You will not find a nonprofit run by more dedicated people anywhere. HHF's volunteers and staff in the US and Haiti are absolutely dedicated to easing suffering and giving people a much needed hand up in the poorest country in our hemisphere. The range of programs is staggering, from health care to home building to goat gifts. And all done on a relatively small budget with very low overhead.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	88898		/users/profile/100548	C. L. Fisher	Donor	5	05/19/2011	HHF is a family-run non-profit and I have known the family for over twenty years. They are completely dedicated to Haiti and the cause of bringing excellent health care to a part of Haiti that has almost no other health facilities or trained medical personnel.  The main clinic in Jeremie, Haiti is the center of the foundation's programs but over the years the work has expanded to address other vital needs like housing, health and nutrition classes, and specialized care for expectant mothers.  Programs like the goat program help Haitian families generate their own income.  The health agent program trains (and employs) Haitians to treat basic medical needs and offer preventative medicine in villages far from Jeremie.  From the beginning, HHF has had nuns running the administrative aspects of the clinic in Haiti -- although religion has nothing to do with the services they offer in Haiti.  So the nuns live in the clinic in Haiti, are part of the local community, and are known for being completely honest in financial dealings.  The entire HHF operation in Connecticut is no-frills and you can see in one visit that they run things frugally and put every penny of donated funds to work in Haiti.  Dozens of volunteers from the US (including both trained doctors and nurses and non-medical people) visit the clinic each year for a week at a time to help out -- so you can go see their amazing work on the ground in Haiti for yourself,  You may have to wait though -- they are often booked for several trips in advance.  Imagine a charity where people will wait eagerly for months or years to volunteer!
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	142813		/users/profile/189248	Linda162	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	HHF is the best.  Unbelievalbe work; always puts people first.  Best value for your donation.  I have seen first hand the effects of donations.  HHF is making a huge difference in Jermie Haiti and surrounding areas, one life at a time.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	142811		/users/profile/189247	Susan171	Donor	5	11/26/2012	Haitian Health Foundation is a beautiful gift to the people of Haiti run by angels on earth! 
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141825		/users/profile/188218	acoq14	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	This organization is great!  I do a good amount of volunteer work in a vast number of fields from Habitat to Healthcare.  This organization I can say by far is the one I have most enjoyed.  Unfortunately the headquarters are very far from me here in New Orleans so fundraising efforts have been left to my own organization.  I have been working with the fine people in this organization for the past 6 years and have to say that this is a perfect example of a non-profit with a focused mission,  it gets messy out there with other non-profits when you don't know what your money or efforts are really going towards.  My group will be hosting benefit concerts for the holiday season in  Portsmouth NH starting on the 23rd and every Sunday Jan 6th.  If you are in the area please join us!  We are also planning a mission trip for the summer of 2013. For more information on the NH chapter contact me at:  boukmancoq@gmail.com  We will also be doing supplies runs to Connecticut December 31st. 
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141816		/users/profile/188208	willnria	Volunteer	5	11/21/2012	As a volunteer, who helped with many of the fund raisers in the past, it was good to see exactly where and how the money raised  was used in taking the trips with the group that I did. I journeyed to Jeremie 3 times and each time was very inspirational and memorable. Sister Mary Ann Berard, who is the administrator of the medical clinic in Jeremie, is a prime example of Christ's love for all the people of the world. When I personally go there and see Sr. Mary Ann's hard work and dedication to the Lord, to HHF and to the many Haitians that she encounters each day,  greatly inspires me. God Bless Sr. Mary Ann and all the many staff and volunteers that make the Haitian Health   Foundation work so well.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141530		/users/profile/187880	willbakerman60	Donor	5	11/20/2012	HHF represents everything a non-profit organization should be. It has a clearly focused mission, uses resources effectively, and provides feedback to donors more thorough than any other organization I have been involved with. Most importantly, HHF is focused upon achieving results on an achievable scale. What I also really enjoy about HHF's policy is their apolitical stance and focus upon avoiding dependency. In summary, donating money here is an excellent choice that ensures people who are in need are given help and the opportunity to take care of themselves in the future. 
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141413		/users/profile/187715	Carolyn40	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	Haitiian Health Foundation has been in my heart since my first trip to their clinic in Jeremie Haiti in 1999.  A small group of us continue to work to help HHF with their mission for the poor of Jeremie.  We personally see what a difference they make and the progress that has occured in Jeremie Haiti because of their presence there.  Any money that goes to HHF is used for the good of the poor.  They are committed to the people they serve and you too can help by supporting their Foundation.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141355		/users/profile/187653	Kevin45	Donor	5	11/19/2012	There are special charities in the world.  I have the pleasure of knowing a classmate of many moons ago who travels to Haiti every year... across the mountains to provide dental care...since Sandy, things have gotten a bit dicey. ... time to give what we can...
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141302		/users/profile/187590	ProfessorBeach	Donor	5	11/19/2012	The Haitian Health Foundation is the "Real Deal".  I've personally visited their USA home office and visited and stayed at their Jeremie Haiti facility.  The work Dr. & Mrs Lowney and Marilyn do is the real thing.  They hosted our group in Jeremie and showed us the homes, schools and medical facilities they had built and operate for many many years.  Any donation of time or money to the Haitian Health Foundation will be well invested.  I recommend to all my friends and family to consider donating to HHF
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141272		/users/profile/187548	Stephanie72	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	This organization is incredible! I had the honor of traveling to Jeremie with Dr. Lowney, Marilyn and a few other wonderful people.  They have given their lives to better the people of Haiti and their enthusiasm, knowledge, dedication and level of care are truly unparalleled. I recently started sponsoring a family of five for $25/month. Every single penny, (YES!!) goes to the family. The village votes on the family most in need of the sponsorship. There are a few families nominated, based on their size, illness, need, etc and then their peers choose the family they think is best to receive the aid. I can't think of a better way to run such a program! I've had the chance to see first hand the effect this organization has had on over 200,000 lives in Jeremie and surround villages.. it's heart-warming, incredible and inspirational.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	141257		/users/profile/187530	Michelle118	Donor	5	11/19/2012	I know that my donations to HHF are making a difference.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	116274		/users/profile/158302	Phil10	Volunteer	5	06/23/2012	This charity is the REAL DEAL.  This is where you can be SURE that your donations will be well spent.  Hardly any overhead, almost all of the money you donate goes directly to helping the poor of Jeremie, Haiti.  I have traveled to Jeremie about 12 times and have seen firsthand the good that is done through the Haitian Health Foundation.  It is by far the largest employer of Haitians for the surrounding 75 miles and has improved the lives of hundreds of thousands through education, healthcare, construction, effort, and love.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	92429		/users/profile/106055	J. Strutt	Volunteer	5	06/27/2011	I've been involved with the Haitian Health Foundation since 1996.   I started sponsoring a $25/month Save-a-Family and then began to learn more about this outreach to the people of the Jeremie, Haiti area.  The more i learned, the more impressed i became.  They have an overhead of around 8 percent (the Save-a-Family program has zero overhead because it is run by volunteers here and in Haiti).  HHF keeps receiving the highest designation (4 stars) from a charity watchdog, Charity Navigator.   They invite sincere people to accompany them on their quarterly visits to Haiti and I was able to go in 2006 and actually meet the family that I had been sponsoring for ten years at that point.  They were the same people that had been in the picture given to me when I first signed up.  It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life!  I now volunteer about 3 days a week to help maintain their database.   I know firsthand that my donations are prudently used.   
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	92297		/users/profile/105888	Jj D.	Donor	5	06/27/2011	The people at HHF are some of the most caring and knowledgeable that I've spoken to, in relation to the plight of Haitians today.  The work they do is incredibly important and they manage to continue to bring food, medicine and basic needs to some of the world's poorest and neediest people, despite the deepest recession in modern times.  The goals of HHF are so important, and the drive of its entire staff is so strong that I've felt an urge to contribute whatever I can.  This is not a charity that puts a great percentage of donation money or energy into advertising itself or pushing an agenda, so outside recognition, too, is crucial.  
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	92273		/users/profile/105773	Kevin B.	Donor	5	06/27/2011	I have supported the HHF Save A Family program for a few years, and have played in the Annual golf tournament.  The work they are doing in Haiti is amazing.  They are not only giving these excrutiatingly poor people food and medicine, they are giving them programs that will eventually allow the Haitians to "Fish" for themselves.I have personally traveled to a different Third World country and built a day care center.  It was life changing for me...but nothing compared to what Dr. Lowney and his family are doing.  Your donations are well used indeed!
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	92270		/users/profile/105768	Charlie	Volunteer	5	06/27/2011	I've helped to load their quarterly containers with food, medicine and building supplies for Haiti for many years and I am so impressed with the staff at the Haitian Health Foundation in Norwich, CT.   Their care and  concern for the poor of Haiti is genuine and what they have accomplished in 25 years in Haiti is amazing.  Their facilities in Jeremie, Haiti employ 170 people, mostly Haitians, and they see hundreds of people a day both in the clinic and in the villages that they visit because they are a distance away.  Their progress record in treating illnesses is very impressive -- all documented.  I am privileged to be able to help in a small way.                                                        
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	92262		/users/profile/105752	Melissa B.	Donor	5	06/27/2011	I donated to help build a house and a  latrine and purchase a goat for a family in Haiti.  Haitian Health Foundation was very quick to build this house and give it to a family in need.  I was very pleased the pictures of the house and the goats.  
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	91244		/users/profile/104303	Tammy P.	Donor	5	06/17/2011	I am a regular donor to the Haitian Health Foundation. I Have met and talked with many of the family that runs this charity and many of the volunteers who have traveled to Haiti with them. I trust that they use my donations in the best way possible for the people they serve.
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	91217		/users/profile/104263	BeckC	Volunteer	5	06/17/2011	I volunteer for the Haitian Health Foundation in the headquarters in Norwich.  HHF is an amazing organization.  In Feburary of 2011 I had the opportunity to go to Haiti and see HHF in action first hand.  I was amazed by just how much HHF really does.  It seemed that HHF was everywhere I looked, and all of the local people had many praises for HHF and "Doctor Jerry".
Haitian Health Foundation, Inc.	88868		/users/profile/100431	L Thieme	Volunteer	5	05/18/2011	For the holidays this year, we decided to get a goat, through the HHF in honor of all the kids in our family.   Every year we try to do something to both honor the kids & to help them realize that there are so many people out there who are less fortunate than they are who are in need of more than toys & candy & cakes for the holidays.  HHF sent us a picture of the goat that we donated, along with the family who received it.  That message really hit home for the kids- more so than years past when we donated to larger organizations where the money was, I'm sure appreciated, but its use was never clearly defined.  My children & their cousins still talk about that goat & that family & the Haitian Health Foundation & if they can do more to help.  My kids personally have given me small contributions for this year's "holiday goat" as they are calling it now they want to help too.  It's a lovely thing to see your children understand charity & to make a connection with a world that is bigger than they are.  HHF really helps bridge the gap between the help they are providing and where your donations dollars are going.  For my children to see the smile on a face and know that they were able to help someone,  forces them to look at the global community and not just at the houses down the street.   I do also volunteer with the HHF- helping with some of their social media- but it's nice to see

Raynauds Association Inc	308389		/users/profile/399774	Bostonmom10	Client Served	5	10/06/2016	I first experienced Raynaud's about 12 years ago and had no idea what it was. I went to my doctor, he didn't know what it was... I lived that way just "dealing with it" until I conducted some research, took that info to another doctor, and was officially diagnosed with Raynaud's. I was the only person I knew with this condition. Since that time, I have discovered the Raynaud's Association and am a huge fan of their site. They continue to keep me and several others up to date with the newest research, potential methods to help reduce the frequency of a Raynaud's flare up, as well as new gadgets that can help! It is definitely my "go to" for the latest and greatest for trust worthy information. It also helps to be able to hear the stories from others that experience this and to know that I'm not alone. I highly recommend this site!!!

They are always sharing the latest medical information, information about products and tips to help Raynaud's sufferers.  So many people have Raynaud's but are undiagnosed because of the lack of awareness for this condition.  The Raynaud's Association are working very hard at providing that awareness.

Raynauds Association Inc	152437	1	/users/profile/203432	Joe Evans	Volunteer	5	04/05/2013	I have" suffered" with severe Raynauds for as long as I can remember...... (Walking to primary school at 5yrs old and hiding my hands when I got there because other children would say, "ERRh, what`s wrong with your fingers?")At Middle school, out-door PE lessons were extremely painful and difficult but I always thought everyone else had the same thing. They would say their hands were numb etc so I didn`t know what I had for many years. I often went to lessons with my tie covering buttons which I had been unable to fasten after cross country. I would drag one dead foot around school for an hour after PE too walking as if I had had a stroke. When I was at High school, I was diagnosed with Raynauds. I was relieved in a way to know  that I was not as pathetic as I thought I had been.......... struggling with outdoor activities. (There was a reason).I am 45 now and have still not learnt to live with it.  I can have an attack indoors - by touching something metal like the hoover.  I can also have an attack walking to the car or back.  Shopping is a nightmare...... the freezer/fridge isles in shops kill me. I usually struggle to the car and have to sit inside with my hands over the heater vents, often in tears until my hands `come back` and then I can pack my trolley into the car. (Someone will run off with my shopping one day!)I get vibration-white-finger from the lawn mower too. It is not just a winter thing either. There are different KINDS of cold that can get your small blood vessels contracting. Only someone with Raynauds would understand that statement! You don`t even have to `feel` cold yourself to have completely dead hands and feet.I have tried everything......Ginger etc, running on the spot to get my circulation going before I go outside, lifestyle changes.......nothing helps. I was prescribed a pill from the doctor once, but the side effects worried me as it would dilate blood vessels in my heart and brain too so I never took it.When people talk about cold places or skiing holidays they dont understand that I CANNOT "GET USED TO THE COLD" toughen-up !!!!!! It is a reaction to the cold that causes blood vessels to spasm...... not a case of hardening up!I have tried to play in the snow with my children in the past and actually had such a prolonged attack that my nose and tongue have gone numb too and I have felt close to fainting.I have been known to have a couple of dead fingers on a beach in Spain due to a change in breeze direction!This awful winter of 2012-2013 I have SUFFERED!!!!  I can only describe the attacks as a numbing of multiple fingers and toes. This is debilitating and embarrassing leading to fingers feeling like they have been stamped on (broken) then wrapped in lead tubed so you have no actual feeling but pain. When you can actually access warmth, you get the navy blue "Grazy-Paveing" effect before the excruciating pain of the dark red pins and needles which last approximately 30 mins.NOBODY KNOWS WHAT WE GO THROUGH.

I have learned quite a bit (I didn't know there was Primary and Secondary Raynaud's, for example), I have found a lot of helpful suggestions, like what types of gloves other people have found helpful, what supplements people have used that seemed to help them, etc.  My healthcare provider has not been very helpful at all, (when I took one medication he prescribed it had AWFUL side effects for me and I thought I was going to die!) and every winter I seem to struggle more and more with the cold.  Since this is not a very well understood problem in the medical community, and the cause is not understood, it is wonderful to be able to bounce ideas around online with others who understand the problems.
Raynauds Association Inc	98641		/users/profile/117177	Yes I Can	General Member of the Public	5	09/29/2011	Raynaud's Syndrome is, at least for me, a debilitating condition and the general public does not know about the disease or how painful and frustrating it can be. In other words, it is nearly impossible to get sympathy or empathy! Raynaud's Association was a godsend for me when I found it - I finally had a support group and no longer felt so isolated. The newsletter includes medical research developments, advice from members, suggestions for helpful heating products, etc. There is also a forum where members can support and advise each other, and that is so helpful and comforting in a world where most of the public have never seen the word Raynaud's before, let alone pronounce it. The Association fills a true need and certainly makes me feel much less isolated. I also appreciate the advice and just the reminder that I am not the only one with problems. I highly recommend joining and/or supporting the group.
Raynauds Association Inc	89424		/users/profile/101634	Paula	Client Served	5	06/02/2011	I found the Raynaud's Association about a year ago, when I was diagnosed with Secondary Raynaud's.  I have found the site to be a great source of education, information, and support.  I learn more from people that are going through similar situations, than the medical field that seem to not have a keen understanding of the symptoms, and how drastically it can effect someone's lifestyle and functioning.  Having the insight of other's that experience the same condition is extemely helpful and beneficial.  I have usued many of their idea's and suggestions, as I struggle with the changes that have affected my body.  I purchased a pair of battery operated gloves, that were suggested on the Raynaud's Page, specifically because of the recommendations that I read on the site.  Those gloves got me through the winter, and allowed me to enjoy the activities in my life that I do.  I refer to the site often and regularly.

At 16 years old Nate has NEVER been able to ride a bike - even during therapy sessions. She assured us this bike would be different. How right she was!When Nate saw the bike something clicked, he couldn't wait to get on. He felt secure with the extra stabilizing around his torso. The handlebars were easy to grip and his feet couldn't slide off the pedals... within minutes he was making his way down the hospital corridor! When we peddled by the office door a woman asked if he would like one of his own.. she gave us a printed page for Save-the-Kid and told us to call.When you are the parent of a child with special needs you get used to red tape, insurance denials and long waiting lists. I was expecting to submit our name, provide documentation dating back 3 generations and produce DNA samples for everyone in the household... instead I spoke with a real  live person, a very friendly man named Frank Matovic who assured me there was no need to sign over our firstborn so that Nathan could have a bike of his own. Instead, he asked about Nathan's specific needs and explained how to measure him to make sure the bike he received was exactly what he needed! At this point in the conversation he also asked about our daughter Anna who also has special needs.. HE TOOK HER MEASUREMENTS AND PROMISED ANNA A BIKE TOO!!!Well tonight, just about 2 weeks later - BOTH children have beautiful new bikes and even the helmets to go with them! These bikes are going to make 2 children happy for many years. When they had to come in the house this evening the bikes came in too.. they even wore their helmets in the living room while they sat on them watching a movie. I'm surprised we were able to get them off to go to bed!We cannot thank Save the Kid enough for the kindness they showed to Nathan & Anna. Thank you for providing bikes that will support their therapy goals, that will encourage them to learn new skills and will help them fit in and interact with their peers.Thank you for helping our kids simply be KIDS!

It warms my heart to see how much joy it brings him, to be able to move and be independent.  I have also experienced the joy of Team members who have received bikes from Save The Kid and Students from our special needs schools.  These men and women are kind, compassionate and generous.  Above all they understand what a difference a bike can make to a child or adult with disability's. They think of every little detail when they deliver their bikes and the children's lives are changed forever!  Great group doing great things!

When he outgrew his trike this past year I was at a loss as to how I was going to afford a new bike and how long it would take for me to acquire the funds for a new one.  At the same time, I was in the process of organizing a bike day event for the Special Needs Students at our school and surrounding communities.  A friend steered me toward the president of STK and before long my biggest worries were over.  I have been blessed by knowing the members of STK.  This group does amazing things for kids in need.  In our case it was a new adapted AmTryke bike for my son and one by one, all the children on the wish list that attended our bike day event last summer.  Most of these children have never had the joy of riding a bike and now they are not only having fun but are getting much needed therapy as well.  I can't say enough good things or thank them enough for all they have done for us.  Truly, amazing people doing great things for kids in need!

We were told at 3 months old that due to the stroke we should prepair for him to never walk, talk, and would have almost no fine motor skills. That was not a diagnosis we were willing to settle for, so from the age of 3 months through his teen years he spent week after week in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. He spent many hours working with the school and therapists and 18 years later our son is attending high school and has a wall of accomplishments ranging from pee wee football to bowling to tractor pulling and now high school lacrosse. He refuses to say he can't but rather says He can, just give him time to figure it out. The one activity our family has never been able to attempt is a simple bike ride. A custom bike for our son was always out of our reach. We were never able to give him the custom bike he would need to accomplish this dream. A few days ago that dream came true for our son Woodie with the help and generosity of Save the Kid Fund. Now our family is planning another great adventure. Woodie is extremely excited and eager to see where he will be able to go now. Our deepest thanks to all the heroes at Save the Kid Fund. This gift will be treasured for years to come by our entire family. Tracey and Matt Tedone

I learned of Save The Kid Fund and though at the time I thought it was a long shot, I reached out.  Immediately Frank and the team assured me that this little girl with struggles would soon be riding her very own Adaptive Trike.  She's had "Thunder" for about a year now and I will never, for as long as I live forget the look of PURE JOY on her face when she finally went whizzing down the road - finally able to keep up with her brother.

We had no idea how we were going to pay the hospital bills, house bills, and be able to provide gas and food while going to and from Yale New Haven Hospital. That is when Save The Kid Fund stepped in and saved us. They helped us with our heating bills, hospital bills, fuel costs to and from the hospital, and helped us with meals while in the hospital. Jasmine has been battling her cancer for over a year now and Save The Kid Fund has been there through it all. Not only have they helped us financially, but they have helped us emotionally. They have always been there to lend an ear or a shoulder to cry on. We are truly blessed to have Save The Kid Fund come into our lives. Thank you for all your thoughts, prayers and blessings.

My 8 yr old son was diagnosed with brain cancer last year at this time, and at that point, I had to leave 3 jobs to care for him. Now, a year later, with my son thankfully in remission, I'm struggling to get back to work and pay my way. Save the Kid Fund has been incredibly generous in helping us with travel expenses for my son's appointments. In addition, we have been so very fortunate to have assistance with groceries as well. I am forever grateful to these amazing folks who lend their time and devotion to those who have fallen on hard times. Their actions have allowed me to focus more on my kids, and reduced my daily worries greatly. We are lucky to know such wonderful people, who have come into our lives and will forever be in our hearts.

My niece explained to me the expense of the bikes and that they would have never been able to afford one.  "Grampy's" made that happen and making it even better - that is the name all of the grandchildren in our family called my Dad.

This bike served him well - providing an opportunity to exercise in the fresh air and just be a kid - for many years, until finally he outgrew it. Save The Kid Fund recognized immediately the valuable impact this equipment had on the quality of Bryon's life, and came forward once again to provide him with a larger bike, better suited to Bryon's deteriorating core strength and flexibility. They also were able to find a new home for his beloved first bike, where another little kid will doubtless find much pleasure in it.This group offers families like ours the opportunity to offer our children special recreational equipment that insurance does not consider necessary, and which is often prohibitively priced beyond the practical means of a family struggling with healthcare and hospital transportation costs. They enrich the lives of children with their kind generosity and foresight and we are so grateful for their hard work and dedication.Thank you, Bryon's Mom

Luke has had difficulties with balance and riding a bike.  The low-rider was the perfect fit for him to enjoy a bike ride without stress.  It was so amazing to see him ride!   I was introduced to SavetheKid in our company's cafeteria during a United Way campaign.  The members of SavetheKid were friendly and very open to hearing the story of my nephew.  Initially I was inquiring about whether or not SavetheKid would modify his bike with adult sized training wheels, but they took a step further...a HUGE step further.  Luke received his bike in April 2015, which is also Autism Awareness Month.  We are so very grateful to SavetheKid and Frank Matovic for selecting Luke and giving him the freedom to ride a bike!!

Our experience with Save the Kid and Frank Matovic in particular was wonderful.   Trisha has been participating in Special Olympics for the past 4 years.  During cycling we had to borrow a trike from another participant as we could not afford to purchase a tricycle for Trisha.  The one she borrowed was difficult for her to maneuver and too big for her.   Although the owner of the borrowed trike was kind enough to offer to let us take it home, we could not.  It did not come apart so did not fit in either of our cars. Last year Trisha was invited to participate in the AmTrak bike day that took place in July.  Attending the bike day event was very beneficial to Trisha.  She was put on an AmBucs wish list and we were trying to raise the funds when we received a call letting us know that Save the Kid wanted to purchase a trike for her.  When I called Frank, he set up a time within a couple of weeks to deliver the trike.  Not only did he deliver it, he assembled it and spent time showing us how to adjust it for Trisha's size and how to take it apart for transporting it.    Frank was also kind enough to show Trisha how to operate the trike.   Frank is a very kind hearted man and made it possible for Trisha to experience riding outside of Special Olympics and school.  Words can not express our gratitude for this wonderful gift.   Warmest Regards, Dave and Karen Paradis
Save the Kid Fund Inc	239597		/users/profile/325464	ViolaWaldo	Client Served	5	03/22/2015	My grandson Kyle has faced many challenges in his life, many more than most of us will ever encounter.  He has a developmental delay that prevents him from participating in most sporting activities typical peers enjoy.   A few years ago he became involved with Oxford Special Olympics and joined their cycling team. Kyle has very poor balance and upper body strength and this has prohibited him from riding a scooter or two wheel bike and skating for fear of him being injured in a fall.  He also has a bleeding disorder so a fall or internal injury of any kind can be very significant.  He rode a tricycle in competition.   Although he loved to race he was worried about driving too fast on bumpy or uneven pavement or taking corners because his trike would tend to tip to one side.  Last year in competition he took a nasty fall rounding a curve near the end of his race.  According to the rules, he could not be assisted unless he was badly injured so we watched him sitting on the track trying to compose himself and finish the race.  After what seemed a long time, he stood up and limped to his trike.  He mounted the seat and finished the race slowly because his handlebars had been twisted in the fall.   Kyle surely represented the Olympic Oath, "Let me win, but if I cannot win let me be brave in the attempt"  He had bruises on his knee, elbow and hip but luckily there was not much bleeding.  As he limped off of the track he said to me "Grammy can we fix my bike so I can race again!"  Fortunately his races were over but he was so disappointed that he did not finish the race in time to win a medal. Last summer the Parent Association at ACES Village School held an AM Tryke bike fair.  Frank Matovic and his partner in Save the Kid visited the fair and committed to find funding to purchases bikes for some of the children. One of he bikes on display was a recumbent recreation cycle.  The low to the ground frame and joystick steering was exactly what Kyle needed to provide stability and support his upper body and arms when steering.  When he tested the bike he said " Grammy, I'm not afraid I'm gonna fall of this bike!" Kyle was placed on the AM Tryke wish list and we were so grateful to hear that Frank's organization had taken Kyle off of the wish list.  Words cannot describe the joy and happiness Kyle displayed when Frank pulled up in front of the house with his new bike!   Cycling practice begins in just a few weeks and Kyle is so anxious to begin using his new bike this year.  He has been enjoying learning to feel comfortable on his bike and practicing steering and slowing down in anticipation of his competition in June. Thanks to the generosity of Save the Kid, 15 children who participated in the bike fair have received bikes or tricycles.  We are so grateful for Frank's support.  His love for the children and for the work that he does is so obvious!  I told him he was like Santa Claus to all of us who were lucky enough to be blessed with being a recipient. I hope I have been able to express what an impact Save the Kid has had on my grandson and our family.

I worked as a Project Co-ordinator of the Youth Assembly that took place in August 2011. Around 1000 youth from 40 different countries of the world participated in the Youth Assembly. A leadership role put me in touch with real-time organizational ability and helped me touch base with  many youth from around the world - the important thing being these bonds still carried further no matter where we ended up living in the globe. I place my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Patrick S, Ms. Yin-Chu, Victor and Yanyu and the team of youth, including Mr. Ahmed Alhendawi  (first ever envoy of Youth at the UN) who participated whole-heartedly in the Youth Assembly.

This establishment has paved way for hundreds of youth to actualize their dream at the GA hall, where a conglomeration of world leaders are set to address the YA. This experience is priceless to many, and many have gone ahead to sit in panels to talk to the young budding youngsters that come in for the YA in future years.

I happened to meet Mr. Patrick Sciarratta, he during our discussions told me about Friendship Ambassadors Foundation activities. I was impressed and amazed with the activities that they undertake. Given the instability and war around us, I believe the need of day is to support and participate with FAF to bring together youth from different parts of the world. This program would help develop friendship and understanding of different culture and issues of various countries. This Youth armed with cultural understanding of different region and countries will help them take responsible decision  as leaders of their individual countries.  Ashok Krish, President - Kaizen Technologies Inc, NJ USA.

For 40 years, FAF has cultivated sustainable youth development: the youth who took part in FAFs intercultural programs became well-known and highly influential actors in the international arena: Former Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, Senator John Rockefeller, Indian Minister of State Sashi Tharoor, H. E. Ambassador Simona Miculescu of Romania, UN Secretary Generals Envoy on Youth Ahmad Alhendawi, etc. They all help - through their work  the young generations that succeed them.

Obviously, I strongly believe in the foundation's ability to harness the power of music , the arts, and cultural interchange specifically to promote mutual understanding and global cooperation.  With the addition of the Annual Youth Assembly at the United Nations, now twice annually!, and the Service Volunteer network worldwide, I think my life's work in the field of development, especially among youth, has been well given and served.

Center of Hope Haiti Inc	187009		/users/profile/244012	AlexanderB55	Donor	5	10/31/2013	As a long time donor of large organizations such as Childrens Miracle Network and the Huntsman Cancer Institute, I have been dedicating volunteer hours and raising funds for nonprofits for almost 10 years. Over the past few years I have grown closer to a smaller organization, Center of Hope, Haiti, established by warm hearted individuals to alter Haiti for the better, one change at a time. Wanting to continue to volunteer and contribute donations, my philanthropic focus has been on helping create awareness for this nonprofit making it clearer of my personal impact. Center of Hope, Haiti has changed the lives of many to this point but we hope the lives its impacted will soon help spread more awareness that there will always be opportunities to improve the future of Haiti. Several years after the horrific earthquake in Haiti in 2010 that changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, much of the public spotlight has come to a halt. Almost four years later, there are still improvements that need to be made, roads to be repaired, houses to be rebuilt, and children to be schooled. It is with my pleasure that I hope to continue to raise awareness and continue to help make a difference through this great organization. Not only have I impacted the lives of the people of Haiti but my own life has been impacted for the better as well. Wont you join in our fight for a brighter future in Haiti?

Center of Hope Haiti Inc	177288	1	/users/profile/157376	mbsktb	Board Member	5	10/13/2013	So very much has been accomplished in Hiati thru the works of Center of Hope (Haiti), and so very much yet needs to be accomplished. This non-profit has employed local people to construct a beautiful orphanage complex in central Haiti, and is in its third year of educating children in its primary school. The orphanage has opened its doors to orphaned children this Fall, an achievement that the board has worked hard to organize and fund. The teachers and caregivers are carefully selected and provide the children a great place to learn and live.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	115568		/users/profile/157376	mbsktb	Board Member	5	06/17/2012	I have been deeply awakened by my experiences in Haiti and seeing the terrible poverty, hunger, unemployment and need for help on such a large scale. The mission and people of Center of Hope (Haiti) have taught me very much in caring, sharing and working hard to help others in Haiti. My dream is to see the children we serve to grow up to be good leaders and servants of a new and wonderful Haiti.

Center of Hope Haiti Inc	176387		/users/profile/232785	One Legend	Advisor	5	10/10/2013	"How long? Not long" is an oft quoted phrase of Dr. Martin Luther King. It is appropriate for the work of Center of Hope (Haiti), Inc. Beginning with a "dream" of a better future for the children of Haiti, COHH, over a 10-year period, has brought a dream into reality in Hinche and now sits on the precipice of changing the lives of over 40 children and the surrounding community. Jobs have been created from suppliers to teachers to caregivers to cooks. Children in grades 1-3 are in school and some are living in the orphanage. Most importantly is that all of this has been accomplished in the right way in a country where corruption is widespread. Yet, COHH struggles to find donors and its resources are dwindling. How long will they have to wait for the world to recognize the work of COHH in Haiti? I hope and pray that the answer will be "not long." 
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	176354		/users/profile/232759	Darryl P.	Volunteer	5	10/10/2013	My first exposure to Center of Hope Haiti (COHH) was back in April 2010 when I wanted to show great appreciation and do something impactful for one its leading members who has taken time out of their busy schedule to mentor and assist me with developing professionally. My gift of appreciation was volunteering a week of my time in Haiti at the Center of Hope, preparing the site for its grand opening. The time spent in this country was so life changing that I continue to fund the efforts financially, assist in spreading the word, and make trips down there when I can. The vision and success of this organization is so important, as it serves the underserved, and not only educates its residents, but also exposes them to new opportunities to create economical change and sustainability within their country from the inside out. The government may overlook the people in Hinche, especially the displaced orphans, but with the encouragement and vision that the Center of Hope delivers to the local people holistically, they will be inspired to create change for themselves without handouts. I have been blessed and privileged to be a part of this movement and have dedicated myself to creating change in the Haitian community through organizations like the COHH. I have been inspired to build homes in Haiti, and look forward to doing much more in this country because of the opportunities Ive been exposed to while volunteering with the Center of Hope Haiti.

Center of Hope Haiti Inc	176052		/users/profile/232441	HNB1	Advisor	5	10/09/2013	Center of Hope Haiti (COHH) is a small organization looking to change the world by helping the neediest among us.  COHH operates a well-run, clean and, most importantly, safe school for orphans in Hinche, Haiti.  For most, if not all, of these children COHH is their only chance to obtain an education and escape deplorable, unimaginable conditions.  Additionally, COHH's administration, board and advisors are all dedicated, thoughtful, honest individuals with huge hearts.  I am honored to play a small part in assisting this wonderful organization and wish them nothing but continued success in the future.

I have seen it emerge from an idea, into a truly amazing and LIFE-ALTERING initiative.    The benefit that the children receive from COHH is extraordinary, and will set them on a positive course for the rest of their lives.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	174613		/users/profile/230907	sunshinebaptiste	Donor	4	10/07/2013	I have volunteered at several fundraising events for COHH. I believe in its mission and dedication to the youth of Haiti ensuring they have an opportunity to develop their potential.  It brought me joy to see the excitement and joy on the children's face when they received their uniforms knowing they would have a place to learn and receive a healthy meal. I was excited to see pictures of the developments COHH has made thus far.  These children have a fighting chance at life!
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	173590		/users/profile/229736	Beckyd	Volunteer	5	10/04/2013	I have been doing volunteer work in Haiti for 10 years.  When I connected with Center of Hope approximately 4 years ago and started visiting the organization it was a huge encouragement to see an organization operating that is financially responsible and providing excellent services.  I had the opportunity to travel with my 17 year old daughter to Hinche, Haiti in April 2013 and spent some time networking with  the school and actively participating with the kids in the classroom setting.  It was a life changing event for my daughter and she has made post high school education decisions based on her experience at COH.  The facilities are second to none and I am so grateful for COH being on the ground in my favorite city in Haiti. They are truly an asset to the community.  They have also been generous in the past and allowed me to stay on campus when I was in Hinche doing volunteer medical work, which gave me a safe place to stay and equipped me to concentrate on bringing supplies instead of using financial resources at the hotel.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	173560		/users/profile/154918	Steven Kirkpatrick	Donor	5	10/04/2013	I traveled to Haiti and visited COHH in the Spring of 2013.  As expected, everything is well run and the kids are thriving.  I will continue to be a loyal contributor.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	113851		/users/profile/154918	Steven Kirkpatrick	Donor	5	06/05/2012	I helped COHH as a lawyer while the center was being built and aquiring the required approvals to operate, visited the facilities and have made various monetary donations.  The efficient management of operations has consistently been impressive.  The center is well run and I have always been comfortable that my donations will be used in a manner to provide the maximum beneficial impact upon the children being served in Hinche, Haiti.  COHH is a great organization that I will continue to support in the future.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	173533		/users/profile/154913	ALL - Donate	Donor	5	10/04/2013	Every time I see an update from COHH it is about a positive step they are taking in these children's lives. Sometimes there are hurdles, but I know my money helps overcome them. It brought tears to my eyes to know there are children now who can have an education and dinner at a place they call home. 
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	113841		/users/profile/154913	ALL - Donate	Donor	5	06/05/2012	I have seen COHH develop from the beginning and extremely impressed on how far its come.  Starting from a dream to help others, to an empty lot to now teaching children.  I donate to COHH because I can see where my money is being spent.  For example, at the annual galas, COHH demonstrates its progress through pictures and video.  Also, throughout the year I can view updates on its website and through the Facebook page.  It is clear to me that COHH is near and dear to the hearts of those involved.  While some years I was not able to donate as much, I know every dollar I was able to spare was appreciated.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	173444		/users/profile/155015	Nancy51	Board Member	5	10/04/2013	I am proud and humbled to be a part of an organization that, in just a few short years, has brought so much hope and promise to children in Hinche, Haiti, and also to adults in the community.   The school provides the children with educational opportunities that are rarely available in Haiti.  The classrooms are bright and inviting.  Our teachers are highly motivated to provide the children with a western style education.  Now we have orphans on the site, and already they know they are loved.   COHH employs many local citizens, thereby providing them with an income that they might not otherwise have.  COHH truly makes a difference.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	113920		/users/profile/155015	Nancy51	Board Member	5	06/06/2012	Center of Hope (Haiti), Inc. is truly a center of hope for children in HInche, Haiti.  For years, I had volunteered here at home doing administrative tasks to further the mission of COHH.   Finally I went to Haiti.  As we traveled on the poorly maintained roads, we passed thousands of adults, children, and animals walking along the way.  I have no idea where they were going.  There didn't seem to be anything at all worth visiting.  Dirt was on everything and everyone.   We passed murky rivers in which people were bathing or washing clothes.  Women carried jugs of water and other supplies on their heads.  After several hours, the journey ended and we drove up to COHH.   It was like a blessed oasis, and I immediately realized it for what it truly is -- a center of hope.  The buildings were clean and beautiful.  The lights, which were the first I'd seen since nightfall, were on, and the staff was welcoming.  This is exactly what the children at our school are now experiencing.  Every school day, 15 children make their way up the road to our school for a day of loving care and instruction.  They enter clean, well maintained buildings where they are welcomed by our exceptional teacher.  She has been trained to teach an American style curriculum, and she and the children have a longer school day than the average Haitian school.   The children receive a nourishing snack and a healthy lunch that is often their only meal of the day.  They have clean water and proper bathroom facilities.  We have been and continue to be highly selective as to the caliber of adults who will be caregivers for our children, and that is one reason that progress is slow.  We are hopeful that we will soon have a full time administrator on site who can provide 24 hour care for orphans.  We want to educate and house these children and prepare them to be the leaders of their community.  I am confident we will succeed and am grateful for all who have and continue to support our efforts.  I am proud to be associated with outstanding people who will settle for nothing but the best for others, especially for children in HInche.

Hope is being given to those who are involved with the nonprofit. Hope is made possible by those running the program and those who support it with donations of all sizes.  This organization MUST keep going. How many times does one have the chance to change the course of an entire country? This nonprofit has the chance to do so. Every little bit helps!
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	114192		/users/profile/155374	manzano_roger	Donor	5	06/07/2012	The Center of Hope, Haiti takes charity to a level that sets the standard for making a true difference in the world. With about five years of dedication, hard work, and genuine care, COHH has achieved its first of many milestones. Children of Haiti who would otherwise be among the many who will have a predetermined fate have now been directed into one with many doors that these same children never even knew existed. The best way to picture the work being done in a country left behind in the dust that lies extremely close to our own country is by imagining a calm lake with a drop of water being this charity hitting the unchanging surface with the ripple taking shape after the impact of this charity. The next five years will be as exciting, if not more exiting, than the previous five and my money will continue to support one of the most noble causes that I am connected to.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	115613		/users/profile/157442	alan robin	Advisor	5	06/18/2012	I have been associated with this organization for more than 5 years and serve on the Advisory Board.It is a unique organization with a unique mission--to build and operate an  orphanage and school in Haiti.  It began its work before the earthquake and continued it after the earthquake, undeterred in spirit and enthusiasm. It is not easy doing this in Haita and in spite of all obstacles, the school was opened last year.  At this time the organization is at a mission critical stage.  The school is open but the final push to complete the orphanage is on. Every contribution helps and the life of every student who is taught there is immediately changed forever  from the moment they walk into the classroom.
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	115243		/users/profile/156990	Lmstenson	Donor	5	06/14/2012	We have made donations to Center of Hope-Haiti for several years.

We remember the ground breaking, and now the organization has completed a full year operating it's school!  We are thrilled that the children are learning and nourished in a safe environment, especially after the earthquake 2 years ago, which effect reverberated throughout the country.  COHH is critical to offer the children a basic education so that they have a chance to succeed as adults.  COHH has created a model setting and structured program where the children thrive and blossom.  Please join us in supporting COHH, to make a meaningful  difference in the lives of innocent, promising children in Haiti.

COHH is small organization with a big mission. The board members, staff and donors are an exceptional group of people highly motivated to give Haitian children an opportunity for a better life.

Center of Hope Haiti Inc	114854		/users/profile/156484	Lydia N.	Board Member	5	06/12/2012	Center of Hope Haiti is not a charity that one can donate to and then just walk away.  When you look into the faces of the children of Hinche you realize that you are not just tending to their immediate needs and education, but you are shaping the new face of Haiti and its future.  The orphanage and school in Hinche strives to build the future leaders of Haiti, who in turn will improve the Haitian quality of life.  Take a moment to get to know Center of Hope Haiti.  I did and know I will never be able to walk away.

It accomplishes this mission through a combination of fundraising and volunteer work (both inside Haiti and outside Haiti).  Given the charity's oversight of the Haiti-based projects, donations are smartly allocated with a high level of accountability.  Great charity!

The staff is selfless and wholly dedicated to helping orphaned children in Haiti.  Because of the efforts of the board members, the staff and the numerous volunteers, COHH has been able to overcome many of the significant challenges facing American organizations seeking to establish themselves in Haiti and has, in a short period of time, been able to build and start operating its school in Hinche, Haiti.  I applaud their tireless efforts and look forward to working with COHH in the future.

Center of Hope Haiti Inc	113826		/users/profile/154899	Advisory Board Chair	Board Member	5	06/05/2012	As chair of the Advisory Board, I am may be viewed as biased. However, I feel compelled to tell you about the work of COHH in Haiti. We have spent over 10 years nurturing a dream into reality - an orphanage and a school for the poorest of the poor and orphans in Hinche, Haiti. We believe that the children of Haiti are its future and the only real chance for meaningful advancement of the livelihood of the people of Haiti. COHH is seeking to improve the education, health and nutrition of the children to grow them into productive members of a new haitian society. I can personally say that the 10 years that I have spent in Haiti on this project have been the most difficult years of my life and the few successes have been some of the most rewarding. 
Center of Hope Haiti Inc	113825		/users/profile/154896	cgalda	Board Member	5	06/05/2012	Haiti has such a painful history of suffering, which takes an inordinate toll on children.  If we can rescue orphans, educate them, and bring them into loving relationships that prepare them for the future, we may be part of the story of turning Haiti around, which could impact millions of people.

They have been hand selected by the Executive Director for the unique backgrounds, experiences, and skills that each offers to the team. They are a passionate, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and caring group of people. Every single staff member dedicates themselves completely to every family that walks through the doors. I cannot say enough of the staff. They go above and beyond to serve all the 'r kids families. It is certainly a unique organization in the world of child protection and child welfare. As for my experience as an intern, I have been so blessed to have the supervision of the brilliant 'r kids Clinical Director this year.

The 'r kids team made my time with them a truly incredible learning experience. I loved learning from every member of the organization; they are such a committed, caring, and welcoming group of people, and it shows through with clients, families, and in the organization's energy. 'r kids does an astonishing amount of work, especially for a small organization; it is the cornerstone of a community of families that have come to them for support and stability, and 'r kids stays connected with those families as long as it takes to guarantee successful reunification or adoption, and even longer, which wouldn't be possible without the energy and care they bring to every case. 'r kids is constantly coming up with new and creative ways to strengthen the different communities it helps - the families it serves and the local New Haven community, as well as a wide-ranging community tied together by its powerful experiences with foster care and adoption. I am so grateful for the opportunity to have worked at 'r kids, and hope 'r kids will be able to reach even more people in the years to come.

The past few months here have taught me so much and I owe it to the truly dedicated and caring staff members who help make things possible. Although the center may be small, it is a small space that pushes for big dreams. I have been given the chance to see how truly caring and beneficial the Rkids family really is.

I remember my first day and I was greeted by worker Anushka Saadat. She was eager to explain to me her role as a social worker and the different types of service programs that r Kids provided to children and families. Furthermore, sharing an office with workers; Melanie Vitelli and Steve Ingram was an inspiration. They were always there for me, whenever I felt inadequate in my learning. Melanie would always say, Your doing fine Court!  Steve stated, Youre our hardest working intern yet!  Then having worker, Enna Garcia next door to us was a treat! She exposed me into learning  how to work with children with multiple mental diagnoses and the importance of active listening.  However, as a student and wanting to; embrace my passion in working with children and families, I felt that prominent supervision was to the key and I received just that!! So, I bow and commend Anne Steers for her; instruction, leadership, and having a listening ear when I needed, despite her busy schedule. Also, for entrusting me with some of the most challenging cases.  As a student and juggling a lot: when I entered the Center, Cindy Fernandez would always put a smile on my face; by greeting with such warmth and compassion.

Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	307897	3	/users/profile/399266	GiovannidiTuttiCappeli	Board Member	5	10/04/2016	About a dozen years ago, I was hired as the chorale's first Administrative Director and working in that post for a number of years to streamline chorale activities and to assist with the chorale's first Strategic Plan.  As time went on, I also began to  sing with the chorale and still later my wife joined to sing, as well.  We have both remarked that our experience singing with the chorale has greatly enriched our lives in so many ways.  One of the tasks I took on was to organize the chorale's two European trips; the first to Vienna, Salzburg and Prague and the second to Italy where we sang in Rome, Florence and Venice.  Both trips were truly awesome and we were greeted with warm applause in all venues and, in retrospect, I feel that both the audiences and the chorale experienced some magical musical moments which many of us will never forget.  In order to feel those magical moments both here and abroad,  the expert leadership of our Artistic Director, Joseph D'Eugenio has taught us so well and inspired us to new and different heights and fostered  many adventures.  The rigorous rehearsals and fine-tuning we are treated to assure that our audiences receive the highest quality of sound and interpretation of the many masterworks and newly commissioned compositions require.  Being part of this wonderfully diverse group has evolved into a "family" of sorts, one we truly love and enjoy.  Tuesday night rehearsals are in a word, exhilarating!  As a 'senior citizen', I can attest to the fact that being involved in great choral singing is life-giving and renewing! 
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	307487	2	/users/profile/398826	Evangelista	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/01/2016	I first discovered the GMChorale (Greater Middletown Chorale, Inc.) last November as an audience member.  I was so impressed with their vocal quality, program selections and orchestral accompaniment and I thought they must all be professional singers.  When I read the program book after the concert I realized they were all volunteer singers from the community-at-large.  I was astounded!Having a background in arts management I found myself compelled to help this group in anyway I could to reach more audience members, so they could experience what I did.  I approached the organization and, after many conversations, I joined them as Operations Coordinator in February.  In August I accepted the position of Managing Director and I am excited to share that the GMChorale is growing by leaps and bounds - this season offering the addition of the GMChorale Chamber Singers and GMChorale Clarion Choir.  A joint performance of the GMChorale's commissioned work, "Letter From Italy, 1944", will combine the voices of the GMChorale and Hartford Chorale along with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra at The Bushnell in Hartford on May 4, 2017.  Other season highlights include Durufle's Requiem and Four Motets and Handel's Messiah.  The GMChorale's Artistic Director, Joseph D'Eugenio, is an amazing talent and brings out the best in this talented group of community singers.If you haven't already had the privilege of being an audience member for a GMChorale concert, I suggest you do so very soon.  www.gmchorale.orgJoe Evangelista

I like to hear new music, and this group makes a point of commissioning new works.   The premier of a new dramatic oratorio gave us the rareexperience of seeing how the act of creating and collaborating is a transformative experience - for the performers and the audience alike.(Check out:    Letter from Italy, 1944)Under the masterful and delightful direction of Artistic Director, Joseph D'Eugenio, this is a group that makes fabulous music and has a good time doing it!

They have that super combination of dedicated members, volunteers and paid professionals, working together for excellence in musicianship, programming and performance.

Not only does this oratorio recognize my fathers life before, during and after WW11, but it also reaches out to the current widespread veteran community that is suffering from the devastating impact of PTSD either during embattlement or upon returning home.The chorale has become one of the leading choruses in Connecticut under the brilliant leadership of Joseph DEugenio, who is able and willing to engage whatever choral technique to suit the music at hand, though I most love the chorales signature robust sound.I spoke to the Concert Mistress of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra after the performance of the Mozart Requiem in 2015.  She noted that in her five years of collaboration with the chorale, she felt that the group had strengthened exponentially in both vocal technique and expression. She found this particular choral performance superb. I absolutely agree. The programming is always novel and engaging.  Most recently, the coupling of Chichester Psalms by Bernstein with Lord Nelson Mass by Haydn was somehow perfect, as was the compelling performance of two works so different in character and the timing in musical history during which they were written   Finally, beyond the music, what I love most about this group is the joy that is evident in all that they do. --Sarah Meneely-Kyder--

Along with many others in this group I drive a considerable distance to sing because of the level of excellence I have found there.  The music is varied, often challenging, and the director is talented and ambitious on our behalf.  We work hard but we also laugh a lot. It's a friendly and supportive bunch, and difficult personalities are few and far between (not always my experience in other choirs!)  There is also a seemingly endless supply of volunteers to help run just about every aspect of this group, and we have wonderful support from friends, family, and music lovers in our area.  My life is much fuller because of my experiences with the GMC.
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	233253	2	/users/profile/296973	bobbi.tlc	Volunteer	5	11/09/2014	The Greater Middletown Chorale is the first and only choir in which I've sung.  When a friend invited me to join 12 years ago, I shyly attended a Tuesday rehearsal and met with the musical director, Joe d'Eugenio.  He asked if I was a soprano or alto, and I didn't even know!  His kindness and gentleness immediately put me at ease, he suggested I try singing soprano, and in no time Tuesday evenings became the highlight of my week.  In those early years I was a bit daunted by the level of musicianship around me, and simultaneously felt deeply honored to be a part of such a talented group.  Today, though I have learned how to sight read new music without panicking, and can scribble all those musical notations that Joe shoots out at rehearsals without looking over my neighbor's shoulder, I continue to be humbled by the talent around me, to be grateful for the devotion of the membership, and to be inspired by Joe's magical combination of serious expectations and gentle support.  The Greater Middletown Chorale brings out the best in me, and Tuesday nights are still a highlight of my week.

I started singing with them in high school, and I was so inspired by the musicianship of the choir and the ridiculous amount of talent in the conductor that I decided to pursue music more seriously.  I recently graduated from college after studying singing and am with the GMC again and I am still astounded by the choir's skills and sounds and by the conductor's vast knowledge, talent, and heart.  And more than all of that, the people are all some of the most warm and welcoming you could hope to meet. 
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	226850	2	/users/profile/290586	pzmessina	Volunteer	5	10/26/2014	I have been singing with the GMChorale for about 12 years. In that time I have seen the repertoire grow from mainly classic works by the great composers Bach, Mozart,Haydn and the like to living American composers. We have performed New works,premiered some and have also commissioned others. Our most recent achievements have been to perform the Northeast premier of the  Mollicone Beatitude Mass for the Homeless.We were privileged to have the composer present a talk prior to the event. He  was tremendously moved by our performance. In addition we commissioned and performed a nee and moving oratorio, Letter from Italy, 1944, soon to be released. As you can see, under the reins of our acclaimed artistic director,  Joseph D'Eugenio,  we have  become one of the premier chorales attracting young and accomplished singers. I urge everyone to come to hear us or join us in song 
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	226755	1	/users/profile/290486	StefanoGMC	Volunteer	5	10/25/2014	I am a nine year amateur member of the Greater Middletown Chorale and sing in the tenor section.  I have been on the board and have proudly served as president.  I,  along with some 60 other members donate an amazing amount of time, money and our heartfelt passion for singing choral music each year to the chorale.  Why do I do it? Because I get the privilege of singing some of the best music every created and my singing ability improves with each new performance.  And I get the opportunity to share it with my friends, family and the community at large.   I am pleased to be a part of  a family of welcoming singers who collaborate to sing beautiful music.  They are now  my dear friends in music.  (And the food at the after concert receptions is fantastic!)
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	224135	1	/users/profile/287891	carolany	Volunteer	5	10/18/2014	I joined this choir a short time ago seeking three things: an inspiring and demanding director, a high level of musicianship from the singers, and compelling repertoire.  It is a rare community choir that combines all three of these elements.  This is one of the rare gems, and I am overjoyed to have found it.  Under Joe D'Eugenio, every rehearsal is also a voice lesson.  He does a superb job of instilling in the singers a professional attitude and pride in quality music-making--by bringing in professional singers, by collaborating with professional orchestras, and most of all by holding volunteer singers to the same standard as the professionals we collaborate with.  This group enriches the entire community--volunteers, professionals, and audiences.  
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	224084	1	/users/profile/287838	Suzenn	General Member of the Public	5	10/18/2014	I have sung with the Chorale on and off for over 20 years.  I'm not a professional musician, but have sung in several choral groups as an amateur lover of choral music.  Some conductors are good with folks who need to learn a lot, but they can't produce  high quality concerts.  Some conductors can  conduct the super-good singers and produce a wonderful concert, but leave the learners in the dust.  Somehow  Joe D'Eugenio manages to teach the whole range of singers in the Chorale, helping those of us who need to learn more, and still challenging the excellent performers among us.  He is always looking for strategies to bring out the best in everyone.  As a result, the morale and friendliness is sky-high, the learning is intense, and the concerts are excellent.  The fact that more and more semi-professional singers have gravitated to the chorale over the years attests to the quality of musicianship of the conductor and the chorale, the choice of music, and the  excellence of our performances.   As a professional  in my community, I'm proud to be a part of this organization.
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	140795	1	/users/profile/187012	Matt McCaffrey	Board Member	5	11/17/2012	I was trained as a choral conductor but have pursued another profession for the past 25 years. I joined the Greater Middletown Chorale in 2006 and immediately knew I was "home." It is a large and diverse group that employs vocal coaches to help our singers develop their vocal technique and musical versatility. Our artistic director Joe D'Eugenio brings professional passion, vision, and overriding care for the personal experience of each singer. In six short years, I have had the opportunity to tour Europe twice; be part of two oratorios that were of the highest musical quality and achieved overall excellence; and as current President have overseen the upcoming world premiere of a dramatic contemporary oratorio, "Letter from Italy, 1944", that is already promoting healed lives among military veterans and their families. "Chorale" is too narrow a label for the good this organization accomplishes.
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	137865	2	/users/profile/183883	mjcoe3	General Member of the Public	5	11/13/2012	We have been faithful followers of the Greater Middletown Chorale since it was initially formed in 1997. Since then, it has become a wonderful chorale resource in  Connecticut and beyond. It provides an outstanding musical resource for the general public. It also encourages the development of vocalists, musicians and new composers in an era of considerable financial challenge. The current project "Letter from Italy, 1944" provides an opportunity to use all of these resources to join with personal history in presenting a reminder of the effects of any war on the individuals and families involved. We heartily recommend the GMC as a worthy recipient of Grant monies for their support and certainly consider it to be one of our "Favorite Nonprofits".

This is, by far, the best and most professional organization in which I have had the pleasure to participate.  This is largely due to the excellent musicianship of the artistic director.  Joseph D'Eugenio,  and also to the professional singers that he manages to attract to our organization.  His credentials are superior,  his musical taste impeccable, and his passion for his art contagious.   Concert  works include traditional masterworks and also new and exciting music,  often comissioned and presented as premiers,  always performed with consistently high quality musicianship.  I feel privileged to belong to such an outstanding organization.
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	137329	1	/users/profile/183301	Hway	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Singing with this group has been an extraordinary experience.  The director, Joe d'Eugenio is enthusiastic, a great musician as well as a fine person.  He brings enormous creativity to rehearsals, performances, and planning.  Next Spring's inaugural production of Letters from Italy promises to surpass even the great productions of the past.   This group deserves all the support it has received and will receive.
Greater Middletown Chorale Inc	137311	1	/users/profile/183280	NanMeneely	Volunteer	5	11/12/2012	Except for on special occasions, my relationship with The Greater Middletown Chorale is not as a singer. At their request, I've written lyrics for songs composed by my sister, Sarah, most recently the libretto for the oratorio the Chorale will perform next spring. Sarah and I were drawn to the GMC the first time we heard them, not only for the beauty of their sound but also for the quality of their relationship with their music and with the audiences for whom they sing. Under Joe D'Eugenio's direction, they are a group which sings with heart, with a deep understanding of both words and music and the ability to deliver both so as to make what, in my experience, is a completely unique relationship with hearers. They have thrown themselves into our shared undertaking, Letter from Italy: 1944, wholeheartedly, connecting generously and constantly with community veterans in a way that makes them more than just musical benefactors--and that's saying a lot.

Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/11/2012	Artistic director, Joseph D'Eugenio, has now shaped this ensemble for fifteen years.  Mr. D'Eugenio elicits the very best out of the singers, and under his direction the group breathes life into both lasting and new choral works.  The chorale is currently refining, among others, Benjamin Britten's "Ceremony of Carols" and contemporary arrangements of "I'll Be Home For Christmas" and "It's The Most Wonderful Time of The Year."  This year the ensemble shall present a holiday concert in early December.  In January the chorale will embark on rehearsals for a commissioned work, a dramatic oratorio entitled:  "Letter From Italy, 1944."  Bringing a newly commissioned piece into the light is a major undertaking, but this group sees real value in the effort.  It is a wonderful musical ensemble that takes on both old and new pieces with such musicality and open-mindedness.
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	107508	1	/users/profile/73937	anniee23	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/03/2012	The Gesell Institute has given me the courage to continue to teach my children in my classroom what is developmentally appropriate for their age group.  This is very hard as the new Kindergarten is the old first grade.  Children have little or no time to play and socialize because academics and testing have become so important.  Each day the children have time to play, socialize and work in small groups with hands on  materials.  They are able to practice concretely the skills they are learning and master these skills in their own time.  They are so much happier.

Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	86207	1	/users/profile/96408	John C.	Board Member	5	04/18/2011	I have two small children 5 & 6. Now that they are in school, there is such a large focus on homework and grading I feel like they are not keeping up. The institute teaches us that each child develops at their own pace through certain stages and to think all children will master reading, writing and math at the same time if it is pushed on them is not accurate. This gives me a sense of ease about how my children are developing and I trust the institute's findings that they will develop at their own pace. 
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	85693	1	/users/profile/95671	Gesell Institute of Child Development	Client Served	5	04/14/2011	I recently attended a Gesell Institute GDO-R Workshop for the first time.  It was a great 3-day experience. My instructor, who spoke from life experience, being a mother herself and a elementary school principal, was very knowledgeable presenter. I took this info back to my classroom and now even look at my students with a whole new understanding. I feel that I can now be a better teacher becuase of the Gesell Developmental Observation-Resvised. Gesell Institute has been educating adults about the ages & stages of child development since the 50s, and Gesell assessments have been successfully used for the past 85 years! Many more schools across the country should know of their expertise.
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	80483	1	/users/profile/87854	Carol	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/28/2011	As an administrator and former teacher of an Independent School, we have been using the Gesell Developmental Observation for 30 years.  Our school curriculum and programs are developmentally appropriate.  We don't have a specific cut off date, rather we recommend placement based on each individual child.  This practice has been very successful and it ensures children are within a class grouping where they can experience success.  My school participated in the renorming study this past year and it was certainly reassuring to learn that while the language portions show some variation, the motor portions (fine/gross/grapho) have not changed from Dr. Gesell's early work 60 years ago.  The LEAD Conference was a celebration of his, and many others in the field of child development, work.....and the need to redirect some of the current practices of pushing young children to do tasks that are not developmentally appropriate.  We must continue to educate teachers, administrators, and parents for the benefit of the children.
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	80451	1	/users/profile/87820	Julie P. Culhane Ph.D.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	Forty years ago, before anyone knew much about kindergarten, I was hired to start a class, in a rural public-school district in Western Massachusetts. I'd had excellent preparation to be a teacher, yet I lacked experience, or any practical method of building community confidence and support. Luckily for me (and my community) I came across an invitation to attend a Gesell Institute workshop. That's when I met Jacqueline (Jackie) Haines!The value of what I learned at the workshop informed my practice for many years. The most often borrowed books from my family resource shelf were those that explained each chronological age in DEVELOPMENTAL terms, such as "Your Two Year Old".The Gesell Institute is once again a part of my professional life. Why? Because good things (like some fashions) return approximately every 35 years.Because Marcy Guddemi, who earned my trust through the work she did prior to coming to Gesell, warmly invited me to revisit the mission of the Institute and attend the LEAD conference in October 2010.Because by attending the conference, I once again experienced the quality, devotion, and energy that fuels the mission of The Gesell Institute. The "icing on the cake" was speaking with Jackie Haines, and recalling the influence she had on my early career --- one that lasted 35 years! That she, and other respected leaders in the field, such as Drs. Brazelton and Sparrow, attended the LEAD Conference, (and undoubtedly influenced new teachers), makes this organization worthy of the 2011 award. 
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	80420		/users/profile/87786	Linda	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	I took my first Gesell workshop in the early 80s.  I learned so much and I felt that my own understanding of development was verified by the work of Arnold Gesell.  This workshop was a turning point in my career as a teacher and director in preschools that offered half-day classes for 2- to 5- year old children.  The knowledge that children move through stages of development led to an understanding of what kind of curricula are appropriate for young children.  I attended the LEAD conference in October, 2010.  It was fabulous.  If you did not attend, you should welcome the Proceedings that will be available.    
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	80292		/users/profile/87657	Barbara	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/28/2011	As an early childhood professional, I understood the great responsibility I had in helping parents determine if their child was truly ready to move on to the next level in their education plan.  The criteria at that time, and still remains, is chronological age at the time of entry into a program.  It was particularly concerning when the cutoff date for entry where I was employed was December first.  While attending a National Association for the Education of Young Children Conference, I went to a presentation by the Gesell Institute of Human Development on, "The Gift of Time.  Five Is Not Enough."  This was the beginning of a wonderful journey.  The Gesell Institute gave me the tools I needed to assess the  uniqueness of each child's development.  Using this information, in partnership with the parents, together we could make a decision to provide every opportunity for their child to succeed. One-size does not fit all.  Each age and stage of development is unique.   The trainings and materials provided by the Gesell Institute became the cornerstone for planning the curriculum and addressing the areas of strength and areas needing more reinforcement for the children.The children were not the only recipients of all we learned from the Gesell Institute.  The teachers, the staff, the parents, the school, and ultimately the community benefitted from what I had learned as I began my journey.

This organization has been most constructive in the lives of thousands of students and parents.  For that I am most grateful and give the Gesell Institute a five-star rating.        More than any other institution, the Gesell Institute for Human Development is the most deserving one for the $5,000 Grand prize of the GuideStar - KIMBIA Winter 2011 Nonprofit Giveaway.

The speakers were inspirational.  They shared information about child development, as well as how to support children in today's high-pressured world.  I enjoyed the opportunity to meet others involved in the field of early childhood development.  I was specially interested in the focus on advocacy promoted at the conference.  Follow-up messages from the Institute with advice as to how to advocate for children have also been helpful.  This is a group with a strong history of support for children, their parents and teachers.  I hope they continue their important work.

These developmental stages of growth could be a benchmark for schools to help them develop age appropriate expectations.  School systems are expecting young children to do tasks they are not developmentally ready to do successfully.     The Gesell Institute has just completed an updated developmental observation assessment  with 1400 subjects and the results of this study put The Gesell Institute on the cutting edge of research in the field of child development.

The steller group of presenters were extremely knowledgeable and their presentations were clearly an example of why they are such respected leaders in the field of education. The conference also provided the opportunity for people in the field to gether together to renew acquaintances, to be exposed to current developments and be rejuvenated in their chosen field to work with children. What I personally experienced from the messages given by the presenters was encouragement that the respect and nurturing for childen that was the basis for Dr. Gesell's work continues to be the goal of these highly respected people. There is no question that participants left the conference filled with validation of the importance of appropriate experiences for children bu renewed commitment to provide these.

I know, first hand, how important it is to understand the significance of child development when determining a child's curriculum at school or a child's leisure time at home. Today's children are pressured to grow up quickly with social and academic information. The Gesell Institute is a LEADER in educating administrators, teachers and parents in developmentally appropriate practices for young children. It is imperative for the future of our children to educate adults who work with children. The impact of this knowledge can change a nation.  I have used many of Gesell's materials while working with parents,  and in workshops for Early Childhood teachers. The GOD-R assessment tool is exceptional.  It is wonderful to have The Gesell Institute as a resource in research based information to share with parents and teachers.

It continues to spread the need for developmentally appropriate practice for young children. We know how stressed young children are by being forced to grow up too soon and have academics forced on them when they should be enjoying their childhood and learning through play. The Gesell Institute has taken a leadership role in promoting healthy practices for young children and those of us who are professionals in the field of early childhood education support fully the Institute's work.

The interns who came to our school were nothing less than professional .  The children loved doing the assessment and the feedback was very positive.     I have always admired the Gesell Institute and their work with young children, not only as a teacher, but as a parent.  In so many schools  where Kindergarten has become the new first grade, the Gesell Institute has refused to hop on the bandwagon and respects the developmental age of the child.  My hope is that more educators will see the great work the Gesell Institute has done and  change policies so all children can succeed i school at their own rate and time.

The GDO-R is an assessment tool that determines the child's developmental age.  Knowing the child's developmental age allows educators to provide developmentally appropriate learning experiences for that child. I have seen the work of Gesell greatly benefit families, teachers, and administrators as they strive to provide exceptional learning experiences. I have been able to help my college students understand development and the impact that developmental age has on the child's ability to have success in school by using the research and information provided by Gesell Institute.
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	67569		/users/profile/73851	sfrancis	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/13/2011	Our elementary school has served as a host site for The Gesell Institute of Human Development since 1980 to promote the alignment of appropriate instructional practices with the developmental ages and stages of children in our classrooms.  Our school philosophy is deeply rooted in providing a challenging academic curriculum that is developmentally sensitive to the needs of the whole child.  The assessment tools developed by Gesell serve as communication tools between teachers and parents and provide educational road maps for appropriate instructional practices and decisions for every child.  Delivering instruction according to a child's maturation ensures instructional practices that will not jeopardize the well-being of any child.

The research done by this Institute is a wonderful tool in helping understand the young child.  This understanding allows professionals in the classroom to provide appropriate learning opportunities for each student, based not on the child's chronological age, but on the potential of the child!After my retirement, I contacted the Gesell Institute to thank them for helping to make my classroom career a successful one.  They were so gracious as to extend to me an opportunity to assist them in gathering data for their newest observation tool.  Once again, I was able to sit with young children and delight in their sincere responses to my queries and, at the same time, gather information that will help innumerable children as they progress through their formal education.  It is a pleasure interact with the dedicated staff of the Gesell Institute whose sole purpose is to help children succeed.
Gesell Institute of Child Development Inc	64811		/users/profile/70855	Kathleen	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/08/2011	The single most rewarding professional work of my lifetime has been my work as an Education Specialist Certified to administer the Gesell Developmental Observation. I invite the parent(s) to sit with me and their child during the Observation. They are amazed and gratified to be able to observe and learn things about their child, that otherwise, would have been unknown to them. The GDO yields very precise, reliable and statistically significant results. I am able to give parents solid information and advice as a result. In the post observation session, I allow as much time as the parents need to discuss results as well as concerns. Since I am a private practitioner, I am able to do so. This allows me to be fully present to parents, and the discussions are profoundly interesting and immensely helpful. We are able to work together so parents can make critical decisions about school and grade placement. The GDO gives the parents information which empowers and reassures them. They really understand the critically important Gesell concept of Developmental Age after this experience.From my viewpoint, the Gesell Institute of Human Development has given me training and professional support and materials unlike any other. They and the Gesell Developmental Observation are, in my opinion, the platinum standard. Everyone who parents, grandparents, educates or takes care of children and families should know about The Gesell Institute of Human Development and the Gesell Developmental Observation. Kathleen Kendrick, M.ed., C.A.G.S., Boston & Weston, MA,

I support what they are trying to provide to the public for the children pre-school to 8 yrs of age.  I see this as so veyr important, especially when so many parents do not realize what a rold they play in their child's emotional and educational life. I feel g'parents can also play a role in helping their children know more about how to help the g'children.

It has helped tens of thousands of children in the United States and all over the world through its research, publications, conferences, seminars, teacher training, and expertise in assessing young children. It remains of the foremost nonprofit organizations in the United States dedicated to serving the needs of children and the educational community that services them. I give them five stars for their work!

Service for Peace Inc	119346		/users/profile/162260	Estaahh	Volunteer	5	07/26/2012	In Service for Peace (Dominican Republic), we worked on building a two room schoolhouse in Yamasa, DR. With the help of the whole community and the volunteer team we were able to complete the project within the allotted two weeks. SFP was planning to go back and build a second school house next summer. However, that didn't happen because the government itself, seeing the work that had been done, stepped in and funded the building of the second school house itself. It was a great thing to hear and I believe that this is what SFP aims for. For me, this is what is great about Service for Peace (Dominican Republic); it is an organization that KEEPS giving back and is able to spark a chain of changes. Many of the people who were in my group were from nearby or returning for a second or third time...and that says something.  I will continued to be involved in SFP because I believe that organization really works through the communities, is effective, and is full of dedicated leaders (such as Janna Gullery and Joan Mateo who lead our group). I certainly will return. The experience led me towards my current studies---I hope to work for a company such as Service for Peace.
Service for Peace Inc	117735		/users/profile/160072	Marea P.	Volunteer	5	07/05/2012	Service for Peace changed my life. I was a pretty depressing teenager with no actual goals in life. My first project with them was a week of service in the summer. Helping my community, learning to work in a team, seeing that I could have an affect on the world, it gave me hope. I came back the next year and to my surprise and delight they not only remembered me but also encouraged me to become a team leader. The people in this organization are absolutely amazing. They stood by me, encouraged me, challenged me and helped me find the confidence I needed to make a difference not only in my own community but also in other communities around the globe. I never imagined at 14 that I would ever have the courage or opportunity to renovate a school in the mountains of Nicaragua. I never even dreamed of being able to lead the group there but I did, just a few short years later. SFP got me there and seeing the faces of the kids we were helping in that little mountain village and the others like it in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Honduras made the journey worth it.
Service for Peace Inc	117461		/users/profile/159699	ChasTPhillips	Board Member	5	06/30/2012	Holding a position on the SFP Board of Directors and serving as the CEO of the organization has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. Most international service programs are transformative for volunteers. The program design of SFP international service programs make it more likely that local volunteers and the community will be part of this transformative experience.  It has been a source of pride to observe our US based volunteers as well as local volunteers continue to grow both their intercultural competencies and their skills in community development over the years.  Most of country office directors began as volunteers and then assumed greater levels of responsibility for the management of volunteers in community driven programs. Other volunteers have applied the experiences of serving in vulnerable communities in other countries and continued to advocate for policies that ensure more just and equitable communities around the world. Our volunteers gain an experience of other cultures and people that allows them to build a more global perspective of the world.  This is what we call the transformative model of peacemaking.

No other non-profit I know gives you a chance to serve alongside with members of the community. I had the pleasure of joining SFP Global PeaceMaker projects in Ivory Coast, Nicaragua and Honduras and it has been life changing to say the least. I am definitely joining many more projects!
Service for Peace Inc	116604		/users/profile/158730	Theresanona	Volunteer	1	06/26/2012	I did not have a good experience in Services for  Peace.  However, Since I was there in 2009 til next month I have sent probably 25,000 dollars worth of goods.  Two weeks as requested by Phil Seka, I sent hospital goods.  He was quite precise and I have more goods to be shipped to him and a President of a major organization is going there and probably will bring even more books at my request.  The program is piloted by extremely young people.  I went there when I was 63 and treated very badly by these people.  To the point my daughter wrote NY after I contacted her because these young people threatened my life.  I went to town to buy shoes, pantees for the children and a 19 years older told me I did not have his permission and he was going to kick me in my a......   I was old enough to be his grandmother.  Phil made him give me a public apology.  If you want people to go there you must separate the kids from the seasoned adults.  I did not go there to socialize.  From the first day, I was treated badly.
Service for Peace Inc	116518		/users/profile/158619	Philbert	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/26/2012	Its truly a pleasure and honor for me to meet the road of Service For Peace. My love for community service started in 2004 when I established Service For Peace in Cote dIvoire. That is the beginning of my commitment to become an Agent of change, a Peacemaker to make a difference in peoples life in Africa. In 2007, we opened offices in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Gambia. Travelling up and down in communities in Africa, I understood that the major problem of that beautiful part of the world is EDUCATION. Children (the future of a country) in rural communities have no access to good education lack of facilities, school supplies and resources. Our actions in communities where we worked, provided to children not only what they need to attend school in good conditions but gave them hope to dream big. For example in Cote dIvoire, we renovated 2 kindergartens and 6 primary schools and donated school supplies to the kids. Every year, those facilities open its doors for the happiness of 1,500 students. I experienced cultural exchange by welcoming people as volunteers to our projects from diverse culture of all over the world.We acted as well in conflict resolution. In 2007, with Service For Peace, we opened a PeaceMaking training center in Bouake, Cote dIvoire (the HQ of the ex rebels), which trained up to now, more than 500 PeaceMakers and Changemakers. Those agents were trained in Culture of Peace, conflict resolutions and Community development. Today, Im more than grateful to serve people in such a wonderful organization. The way is still long since a lot need to be done but I can say that I also worked the path of those who make a DIFFERENCE. Philbert SekaRegional Director West AfricaService For Peace
Service for Peace Inc	116421		/users/profile/158490	apcubanap	Volunteer	5	06/25/2012	My experience with this organization was life changing. From the staff to the community of peace, each individual played a significant role in shaping the person I am today--a globally focused young professional! Each day when we woke up during our service project in Honduras, I was ready for the new challenges, the arduous work and the impact I could have in the community at-large. My first time picking up a shovel and making cement blocks from scratch left an enduring impact in the way I see the world today--one brick at a time, we can build schools, increase security world wide, and help families unite! Service for Peace, and the values expressed by this service organization inspires me everyday to look for solutions and bring change to a world in need of hope!

Service for Peace Inc	116362		/users/profile/158421	ssommer	Volunteer	5	06/24/2012	During my experiences in the Dominican Republic with Service For Peace, I witnessed complete strangers who do not share their language, culture, or beliefs, grow to appreciate each others' differences and work together to make positive change. How often do you hear of things like this happening in our world? It is a remarkable thing to be a part of. I would recommend this experience to any volunteer who wants to be a part of sustainable community driven development, genuinely experience a new culture, gain a family of volunteers, find oneself in a community thousands of miles from one's own, and grow as a global citizen and a human being.
Service for Peace Inc	116358		/users/profile/158412	Nicolas M.	Volunteer	5	06/24/2012	At a time in my life where I experienced significant growth I was fortunate for the opportunity to participate in Service for Peace's wonderful Dominican Republic trip.  While I was there I learned the value of many lessons in life -- one of these was the sustainability of teamwork in accomplishing the goals of the trip.  These relationships were strengthened by the group team-building activities we did every night.  It was quite the experience.  We were able to work with the community in the construction of two schools (I went twice) on a mutually reliant level.  As i went twice, i noticed that the program efficiency and execution got better he second time around, indicating strong improvement.  I have not participated in a few years, but based on the trends i observed, Service for Peace is heading in the right direction as one of the best organizations out there.

Service for Peace Inc	116272		/users/profile/158299	Soon-Jung F.	Volunteer	4	06/23/2012	I have volunteered with this organization for three years and have always had a meaningful experience. This organization is great because not only do you do physical work for the community but there are also activities to help you reflect and team build. You really build a bond with the people you meet and hear all kinds of incredible stories of where people have been and what they have done. On top of that you get to really experience the culture and the country you are in. You get to know the community, partake in their cultural activities as well as sight see. With Service for Peace you really get the whole package and come away as a more thoughtful and globally conscious person.
Service for Peace Inc	116153		/users/profile/158147	Yenisel	Volunteer	4	06/22/2012	I'm proud to have been part of the first wave working to establish the FSP model of service and community building in South Florida during the "Summer of Service" in 2003. Culturally diverse college and high school students worked together completing service projects in multicultural, multireligious communities. It was inspiring to see how barriers immediately came down, and relationships were forged. Through these service projects, Service For Peace reminds us what is at the core of human progress and understanding.
Service for Peace Inc	116152		/users/profile/158149	volunteermiche	Volunteer	5	06/22/2012	Volunteering with Service For Peace, was a life changing experience for me.

Service for Peace Inc	116141	1	/users/profile/158137	Phil9	Volunteer	4	06/22/2012	I served with Service For Peace (SFP) in different locations. Being an IT guy, most of the work I did was online. However, in Jan 2012 I had a chance of physically participating in one a Global PeaceMaker program which is led and facilitated by SFP. This took place in a small community in the Dominican Republic and the goal was to build levees to protect the community from the flooding that had destroyed their homes the previous year. During this time, I saw the true meaning of Community Driven Development. I saw the true and honest dedication that the SFP team puts in development work. This was by far, one my best experiences in life and I urge anyone to take part in this program as it was very mind opening & life changing for me.
Service for Peace Inc	116019	2	/users/profile/157970	Becky Gitonga	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/21/2012	I had often heard about volunteer programs.  And in 2009, I served with Service For Peace and had the opportunity to learn about their volunteer programs starting with the Martin Luther King program that runs across the US and their international Global PeaceMaker program advanced in Africa, Latin America/Carribean, Europe and Asia. Through Service For Peace I was able to really understood the transformation that a volunteer program can have in driving development and impacting individuals, families and their community.   The model that Service For Peace advances is broken down in a manner that is practical and applicable, and one that can be a force in building ownership and generating resource from within the communities. 
Service for Peace Inc	115996		/users/profile/157933	pbariya	Professional with expertise in this field	4	06/21/2012	I visited few project sites  of SFPN in Sarlahi, Nepal as a new member of GP Connect Nepal Team. I found that SFP Nepal has done a lot of work in different areas such as orphanage home, mobile libraries, mini libraries, women literacy classes etc. Most of these projects are targeted for children and women of the village. These projects have really helped children and women in the village to be literate and continue their studying habit. I could see the hard work of SFPN staffs in implementing these projects and also ensuring that they are running in a proper way all the time. However there needs to be a regular monitoring to all the project sites so that we know the problem they are facing and act quickly to solve it. 
Service for Peace Inc	115992		/users/profile/157934	Janna G.	Volunteer	5	06/21/2012	My first experience volunteering with Service For Peace was in Washington, DC in 2002. I did a month of service there and was greatly impacted by the passion behind the movement driving service and engagement--not just service for the sake of doing/feeling good. It was about creating a movement of change. I brought this home to NY and continued to grow as a leader for SFP and local service for years, until 2005, when I participated in my first Global PeaceMakers project in Frasquito Gomez, Dominican Republic. This experienced 100% transformed me and is so clearly responsible for who I am today so many ways. The idea of bringing together foreign volunteers and local volunteers to participate equally in a program was so simple but so unique; we formed a family despite language, cultural, religious differences and more. We were empowered through service and the communities where we served were empowered by our humility, our friendship, and our passion. Since then I have participated in many GPM programs around the world and am continuously impressed by the ingenuity and passion of the Communities of Peace where we work and the immense power created by breaking down barriers through shared voluntary service. I will always be an active advocate for SFP, the communities who are empowered through it, the volunteers who are changed because of it, and the mission of global peace through volunteerism and sustainable development.
Service for Peace Inc	115991		/users/profile/157932	Peter14	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/21/2012	I had the great fortune to attend a Global Peacemaker program in Israel and Palestine in 2010 which was really awesome! We had participants from the US, Austria and Turkey along with Israel and Palestinian volunteers which made it very enlightening.    I have also worked with Service For Peace in Louisville Kentucky for 9 years and we host many community service projects and work to reduce crime and violence through conflict resolution.                                                                    
Service for Peace Inc	115949		/users/profile/157879	mmeganm	Volunteer	5	06/20/2012	I went on the SFP 2 week trip to La Guamita, Dominican. Our mission there was to build a school classroom for the community and, more importantly, build relationships with the people of La Guamita. This trip was unique because the volunteers were made up of approximately half American and half Domincan volunteers. This was such an amazing experience to get to know Dominican volunteers as well as Dominican community memebers. Although there was a bit of a language barrier, I felt I build strong bonds with all of the volunteers. Service for Peace really works in conjunction with communities in order to understand their needs and really make an impact with projects. The work itself was very physical but we were often building along side of community volunteers so I know that the project was meaningful and helpful to the community. Service for Peace is so unique that it assesses the community's needs and is in close contact with communities before, during, and after projects have been completed. I would absolutely recommend this experience for anyone who is eager to help those less fortunate and want to be really involved in the community that they are helping!
Service for Peace Inc	115764		/users/profile/67697	haseternity	Volunteer	5	06/19/2012	My experience with Service For Peace  in August 2005, was in the Global PeaceMakers Program in Dominican Republic. It was one of the most amazing, life-impacting experiences I had. I was able to have better understanding of a culture new to me, but also was able to see the important role, I had as a volunteer, in impacting the lives of the community members, but also the domestic volunteers that came from the community and surrounding communities.  The relationships that were cultivated have been kept, and continues to amaze and inspire me the great dedication that all stakeholders have to foster positive change, progressive development, and leadership cultivation. 
Service for Peace Inc	61946		/users/profile/67697	haseternity	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/31/2011	A great organization to work directly with communities in need. I have experience working with Communities of Peace in Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala. Most of the projects focus in primary education, however there are other opportunities in health, and environment. The international service programs are called Global Peacemaker, which bring together volunteers from the developed world and developing nations to serve a community in need. I learn much about culture but also the problems that developing communities face. I had a great experience in working together with others and creating long-term friendships across borders.

Service for Peace Inc	115600		/users/profile/157421	nboncoeur	Volunteer	5	06/18/2012	When I think back about life changing events that I have encountered, participating in the Service For Peace Global Peace Makers program in 2009 is on the top of my list. I had the opportunity to help remodel a much needed canteen for an elementary school in the Ivory Coast. While in the Ivory Coast, I met and was inspired by the leadership within the organization and by the willingness of the community to improve their surroundings. The program encouraged self-sufficiency and sustainability past our short time volunteering in the village. I believe this was one of the most beneficial aspects of the Global Peace Makers program. Essentially, we were teaching the community how to fish and not just providing the food. I would recommend working with Service for Peace to anyone. It truly altered the course of my life and for that I am forever indebted to Service for Peace.

Service for Peace Inc	114206	1	/users/profile/155413	CHoulihan	Board Member	5	06/07/2012	I was introduced to Service for Peace during an MLK Day of Service Planning Committee meeting in 2007.  After I participated in the 2008 MLK Day of Service event, I was instantly hooked; the Service for Peace staff are the most passionate community service professionals I've ever met (they all LIVE lives of service!) and the mission of cross-cultural service and community engagement is inspiring.   After I participated in the more-than-affordable 2009 Global PeaceMaker project in West Africa, my admiration for Service for Peace turned into undeniable passion!  Through the Global PeaceMaker program, Service for Peace volunteers get the opportunity to travel to a foreign country, and live with/serve alongside community members, all the while being educated on comunity-driven development.  The Global PeaceMaker program allows people from all walks of life to come together and work towards a common goal -- to build communities of peace.  There's no greater organization that spreads the mission of peace through community-driven, cross-cultural, service-centered action.  To anyone interested in giving back, whether in your own city or overseas, I recommend getting involved someway and somehow with Service for Peace--participate in a Service for Peace sponsored MLK Day of Service event or attend a GlobalPeacemaker project...If you do, I promise you, your involvement with Service for Peace will enlighten you and make you feel so incredibly ALIVE!

We all can do so much more than we believe we can, and CAG supports the maximizing of human potential in young people. I'm a very busy person, yet I give time to being a CAG Board member, because this is an organization of warm, dedicated people with vision. CAG works with the legislature, with parents, with children, with educators. It operates on all possible fronts to promote talent development and end underachievement. As a math teacher for 33 years, I wish I had learned of CAG sooner. It would have helped me boost my students to higher achievement. If I were a parent right now, I'd find out when all the Minds In Motion events are scheduled around the state, and drive them to every single one that I could.

The dedicated staff provide professional development opportunities for educators in creative thinking, problem solving and how to work with the gifted student.  CAG has been proactive by including the CCSS in all presentations; this has been beneficial for teachers.  The Mind in Motion program and other workshops for students are outstanding.  Students are challenged and encouraged to take risks and stretch their learning.  Parents are also supported in the organization and are able to get helpful information which allows them to be educated about the gifted child and in turn helps them to advocate for them.

The relief on the faces of students and in the voices of parents is wonderful to see.  As a current educator, watching fellow teachers learn simple things to reach all of their students is solid progress. 
Connecticut Association for the Gifted Inc	223646		/users/profile/287395	kaugustyn	Volunteer	5	10/16/2014	CAG is helping to dispel the myth that gifted and talented children can "make it on their own" without any support or assistance, especially from their schools.

There are limited places for parents to turn and limited support for these children who are overlooked and presumed will be successful on their own without guidance and support.  In fact, without the guidance and support of  parents, teachers, and administrators, these children are bound to get lost in the educational system and not reach their full potential.   This results in a loss to the Connecticut workforce.  let's all aid the work  CAG does.

Long before my child was ever identified by the school system as gifted, I knew that I had a child that would be hard to keep up with.  Once I discovered CAG, the world opened up.  I found other people who became invaluable resources.  The Minds in Motion events that they hold provided my child with opportunities to explore and learn in an environment with other high-achievers and gifted students; and I had the opportunity to learn about a variety of social and academic issues that affect not only gifted students, but all children and how they learn.  When I have reached out to their leadership, they have been extremely supportive.  Their Facebook outreach keeps me up to date on topics and events.

It has served to help us understand the gifted world and the many resources available that has helped our daughter. CAG provides seminars that go far beyond the weekend workshops for your child.  The people running the programs truly wish only the best for you and your child. In doing so they have assembled a frame work of support that provides parents with resources such as organizations, businesses, products, literature and people all focused on keeping your child stimulated and engaged.  CAGs weekend events bring together likeminded children and engage them in stimulating activities that schools are not doing for their age groups. This wonderful organization offers insightful lectures for to better understand and nurture your childs insatiable mind.  Each session has a Keynote speaker featuring leaders in the field of gifted and talented education which bring out issues and strategies to help parents understand the special needs their children may have. If you have a talented or gifted child, it would be parental negligence not to check out this organization and see what they have to offer.

As a parent of a gifted child, I had no idea how to advocate for my child's special needs as this is new for me and I had no one to turn to. I sent an email on their website and I immediately received a response answering my questions and was given additional information on research, what to say in school, testing etc. I ended up deciding on having my child have formal testing which lead to a meeting in the school (which does not have a sifted program) to talk about my child's needs. Again, I reached out to CAG and they called me right away to help prepare me for the meeting. Their minds in motion workshops in the summer is wonderful too.

Mary's Place, Inc.	310390		/users/profile/401745	Writer	Client Served	5	10/13/2016	Mary's Place has been an excellent resource for my daughter after the death of her father.  They offer a wide variety of age-specific groups ranging from 3-years-old up through high school.  Mary's Place provides a safe environment for children to share their emotions with others their age who understand what they are experiencing.  Through a wide variety of activities, sharing, play, family events, and song, children work through their grief surrounded by fellow peers and caring adults.  I find it to be particularly helpful for young children because as they grow through the years, they will experience new forms of grief and Mary's Place is equipped to help them through the various milestones. Mary's Place also offer an extensive library for children and caregivers alike to help navigate the daunting waters of a personal loss.  There is a widow/widowers group that also meets bi-weekly.  During the children's sessions, parents can share with each other their own experiences that so few others in their daily lives might actually understand.  As a child or a parent/caregiver, you never feel alone or misunderstood at Mary's Place. The volunteers genuinely care about all the kids and build lasting friendships with each child.  Many of the high school/college aged volunteers spent a number of years attending Mary's Place as children and now give back their time to help other children suffering from the loss of a close family member/friend.   This is a place I hope I never have to recommend to anyone else.  But if you find yourself in the midst of a personal loss and a part of this very unfair group, Mary's Place is the best place to be!   Thank you for all you have done!

I have been volunteering for about 2 years and this experience has inspired me to want to continue to help those who are grieving. Bereavement centers are not common in the sense that people do not know they are an option. A place like Mary's Place is one of kind because it allows kids to express themselves pertaining to their loss in a variety of ways such as games, journals, and arts and crafts. More places like Mary's Place need to be created because Mary's Place truly helps people.

He told me Mary's Place had a support group specifically for young widows and widowers.  Although I had lots of support from family and friends, I figured it couldn't hurt to find out more about this center.  Next thing I new I was sitting in comfortable room on a comfy sofa with a dozen other persons my age who had lost a spouse.  From that moment I knew Mary's Place was going to play a major role in my grieving process and help me on my road to a joyful life. That was almost fifteen years ago.

Because of how Marys Place has impacted my family, I now serve on the board.

Being a widowed father with a 3 year old son seemed overwhelming.  A work colleague told me about a support group especially for young widows and widower.   I wasnt sure what to expect but I thought it was at least worth a try.  Two weeks after my wife died I found myself sitting in a very comfortable room with other widows/widowers.  Going to Marys Place was one of the best decisions of my life.  The support group was exactly what I needed to grieve constructively and work towards healing.  Life eventually became joyful and precious again.  There is no doubt in my mind that Marys Place played a major role in mine and many other peoples lives.

The people in that group gave me the hope and courage I needed to move forward with my life. They also helped me focus on my kids, and their issues as well. The Children's Group was excellent!! Both of my children got to associate with other children that had gone through similar tragedies. They also had received the hope and courage they needed to get back to a "normal" childhood. They still attend, and have shared a lot of their thoughts with the facilitators. The facilitators have been just great!! They volunteer their time, and are very caring and understanding!

Halle was only 1.5 and her mom was 33; life certainly did not seem fair.  Though there is/was always hope, as physicians we realized her situation was terminal 11 months later.  Not knowing how much time we had left, we began to prepare for the inevitable.  Halle's mom was a psychiatrist, and we began to investigate support groups and therapists to be there for us when she passed. We decided Mary's Place was the right fit for us, and we could not have been more right.  One year later, Halle's mom died on a Monday, a little before Halle's 4th birthday, and there we were at Mary's Place that Sunday.  As a four year old, Halle would say she was "embarrassed" at school as the only child without a mother.  She felt "alone" and "no one else is like this".  Mary's Place let Halle know she is not alone, that there are other kids going through what she goes through, and while no situations are good, some are worse than others.  While Halle was at her group every other Sunday, caregivers provided each other with support informally in a comfortable waiting/living room.  In addition, I took advantage of the young widow/widowers support group which meets evenings twice a month.  As life changes, so does our interests, worries, etc but I made life-long friends at Mary's Place that I know I can call at a moment's notice and trust they know the same.

Mary's Place, Inc.	86679	1	/users/profile/97117	Dana H.	Client Served	5	04/21/2011	When my husband died in 2009, our 16-year-old daughter struggled terribly. Her close friends did what they could, but they really couldn't understand what she was going through. When Helen's high school guidance counselor recommended Mary's Place, she was reluctant at first, not wanting to share her personal feelings with strangers. But after her first visit, she couldn't wait to go back. She'd finally found a place where she could deal with her feelings of loss -- because all the other kids were experiencing the same thing. Some nights they would talk a lot about the person in their lives who had died, some nights they'd just talk about teenage things and laugh. Going to Mary's Place every other Tuesday night has become a regular and important part of her schedule for the last year and a half. And not only did Helen find solace herself, she learned how to talk with other people who are hurting too, a gift she will be able to share with others in her life ahead. Mary's Place has been a huge part of her healing process and we are so lucky we have such a wonderful resource in our area!

I knew that I wanted to volunteer, but was not sure where, so I consulted a good friend who has always been active with many organizations. She ran through her list of suggestions, and when she came to Mary's Place, I knew that was the right fit for me. I had raised 6 children, so I felt confident that this would be something I could do. Attending the training program was awesome: very enlightening on many levels, and I met some great new friends. I couldn't wait to get started.  I was immediately impressed  with the program and orginazational skills of the staff. They are professional and are completely focused on the families' welfare. There is a lot of support for the facilataors, so if a situation arises that you are not completely comfortable with, there is professional advice immediately available. Nothing can prepare you  totally for the first time a child looks you in the eye and tells you,"My daddy died", but with the love, guidance and trainning Mary's Place offers, we are prepared to deal effectively and intelligently. The families are so greatful and responsive; they truly rely on and need the support Mary's Place offers to them.

Like they said the first day we went, it's sad we have to go, but they're glad we came.   I couldn't be happier to have found Mary's Place at this time in our lives! 
Mary's Place, Inc.	85552		/users/profile/95501	rena	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	In January I decided that It was a good time for me to start volunteering somewhere...but where? I knew that I wanted to work with children...but how? Then it occured to me...Mary's Place!! In the past I had donated my services and attended the Spring Galla but, I knew very little about what Mary's Place was all about. After some intense training and only a few sessions with the "big kids" group I am proud to say that I am now a volunteer facilitator at Mary's Place and am starting to understand how important this kind of support is to the grieving children and their families. It is a "safe" place for kids to express their ideas and feelings about death and grief. It is also a place to share memories and to understand that they are not alone. So Far this experience, for me, has been excactly what I was looking for...so glad I opened that door!!
Mary's Place, Inc.	85443		/users/profile/95331	joangb	Board Member	5	04/13/2011	My experience has been so enriching to see how families coming to Mary's Place are handled with sensitivity and compassion.  The board regularly hears from parents who share their personal story and subsequent experiences about how Mary's Place helped their children and themselves adjust to the death of a spouse, parent, sibling or grandparent through adult groups as well as children's groups from tots to teens.  My observation is not one of overwhelming sadness but love, courage, laughter, sharing and individual growth as the children learn that they are not alone and can honestly express themselves while being understood by those in similar circumstances.   
Women of Power Network, Inc	225090		/users/profile/288863	Rose28	Board Member	5	10/22/2014	Women of Power Network is an organization, in my opinion, that EVERY woman & girl should join. WOPN is changing lives & has a little bit of something for everyone. Our mentoring program is phenomenal: pairing high school girls with a college mentor and a professional mentor to get the best of both worlds - prep for higher education & their career. On top of that professional women and other women in our communities from all walks of life have a place to get together & discuss issues affecting our wellbeing on every level and finding solutions through everyone lending their social capital.  It is really an organization for women & girls to unite & affect the change they want to see in the world! A place to create, develop & truly transform as our tag line says. That's exciting!!

This program gave me a college mentor who I look to as a big sister and also gave me a professional mentor who is ms lekeesha herself . Being a part of this wonderful program made me look at things a lot different . I ended up changing my mind on what I wanted to do when I got to college ; I now want to be a child psychologist and open my own practice . This is all because of ms lekeesha and ms rose . Looking at these two strong woman made me want to be my own boss . When I got to college I got the sweet taste of freedom and I sprinted with it , my first semester I didn't do good at all . Them I started thinking about my mom , ms lekeesha , ms rose and all those other ladies apart of WOPN who would be very disappointed in what I was doing here at college . WOPN makes me look ahead in life and makes me take my mistakes and learn from them . I am so happy to still be apart of this program because it has helped build me . I have also gained life long friendships with a few people and a life long mentor who will always be there for me no matter where I go or what I do .

Both the collegiate mentors and their high school mentees have bonded with one another and are excited about the opportunities that WOPN has given them to learn about themselves, their future careers and their community.

Women of Power Network, Inc	62566		/users/profile/68392	kmedi1	Volunteer	5	02/02/2011	I went to a high-school where less than half of the students had the goal of going to college. However, they had mentors that were willing to help the few of us accomplish that goal. Right away I knew that I did not have to end up like the other half of the students in my school and that college was not just for the rich kids. My mentor, Jessica, who I still communicate with today, stuck with me since my Junior year to my Senior year and I believe that if she would have not helped me with every step, I probably would have ended up working as a cashier. What I am trying to get at, is that having a mentor helped me get to college. However, I believe that if I would have had a mentor since my sophomore year, which was my most difficult year, and for more than just college apps, my high-school years would have been smoother. I am currently a mentor at WoPN and I know that Lekeesha Miller-Jackson, along with the other women who helped create WoPN have done their research and know that the percent of high-school drop outs is at its highest during sophomore year. Taking this into consideration they created a non-profit organization that I am proud to be a part of because there is no better feeling than knowing that I am helping a child through their most difficult years of their lives, their high-school years.  WoPN has helped me realized the strong effect that I can have on younger kids. Also, how I can lead them in the positive direction.

I lived in New Haven for over 50 years and have never witnessed grassroots efforts like what I have seen here. I have been a volunteer with this dynamic organization since its inception in 2009. I witnessed the vision of WOPN come to fruition before my very eyes. From one discussion on Facebook  empowering women to stop complaining and be the change they seek. That power seed grew a harvest of leaders who later became board  directors. Their passion and vision drew me in; I had to be a part of it.  I remember board meetings at the founder's home, IKIA, resturants and public libraries throughout New Haven County.  No matter where they met to plan the future of WOPN they were able to execute their plans to drive them closer to their mission.  I volunteered at practically all of their women awarness/ empowerment and recruiting events last year and can't wait to see what's on their agenda for this year!  Today I am proud to say that my support along with the relentless effort of their amazing board members, their legacy building mentoring program Developing Leaders Mentoring Platform (DLMP) is moving in the right direction!

Strays & Others Inc	234530	1	/users/profile/300077	Stacy58	General Member of the Public	5	11/26/2014	I have known Claudia, the founder of Strays and Others, since before it's inception. I have never met someone more dedicated, caring and full of passion for what she does, for the animals she saves, and ultimately fosters and gets adopted into their forever homes.  I have volunteered on occasion for Strays and Others in various fundraisers over the years, feeding and caring for animals, gone on rescue runs, and helped by adopting many of my own pets from Strays and Others. I applaud Claudia, and Strays and Others vollunteers for their continued dedication, commitment, and perseverance over the last 30 + years in trying to rescue and find homes for hundreds of lost, abandoned, abused and neglected animals.  Running an adoption agency is not easy, especially when a recession in the economy hits. Everyone wants to cut back, no one wants to take responsibility, thinking animals are a disposable or easy item to "find new homes for",  and get dumped off to shelters and rescue organizations like Strays and Others. During a recession, donations dwindle to little to nothing. Feeding a single animal is an expense, imagine the cost of feeding 35 animals, out of your own pocket if donations of food and money cease to be collected.  Strays and Others, and founder Claudia Weber, deeply cares about each and every animal they adopt out into their new forever home. Applicants are carefully screened, helped with questions as the pet and family become acclimated and adjusted to each other, and follow up visits are scheduled for continued care. I highly recommend Strays and Others to anyone who is considering a new pet. I also encourage anyone to make a donation, helping fund the continued care which has been and still is, so needed in the New Canaan community with rescuing and homing lost, abused or neglected animals into the forever homes and families they so deserve.

Today, it is larger, but its true mission has not changed.   For three decades, I believe they have helped thousands of homeless animals and the people who have called asking for help with a dog or cat  and sometimes other kinds of animals, including wildlife.  Strays And Others is well-run and worthy of significant support.  I wish they could find land to build a permanent home.  With that, they could do so much more.

Strays & Others Inc	186745	2	/users/profile/243750	mackey6	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I have been a volunteer of Strays and Others from the beginning. Strays and Others was born out of a tragic fire in our town. An elderly couple who were animal lovers were killed along with many of the stray cats they took care of on their fixed income. I don't think many were aware of the number they tried to help until this event occurred. In the aftermath, a childhood friend of mine asked for my help with the rescue of the survivors of this group of cats. I agreed thinking I could help out for a while. Well I've been helping out 25+ years. I have been in charge of our small shelter for years, sometimes going every day, at times, multiple times a day giving medication, going on Holidays, going when I'm sick, going in the middle of the night when I wake up thinking "did I forget to put out water?" Am I crazy?(maybe!) But I do know it is so rewarding knowing you have found a new home for an animal or a safe haven for an elderly cat who is now "invisible" and not even a consideration for adoption by others. One of my best gifts was on Christmas Eve when I heard the first purr from a feral cat I had worked with for months. It is gifts like this that make volunteering with Strays and Others all worth it.

Strays was one of half a dozen groups that took dozens of injured and at-risk cats and kittens I removed from city streets.I was especially impressed with Strays adoption process, which involves intensive screening to make the best possible match, and their policy requiring those who adopt an animal to sign a form agreeing to return it to the organization if they no longer can care for it.I became a Strays & Others donor in 1998, when I moved out of the area.   Over the years, my admiration has grown for Claudia Weber, who founded the non-profit in 1985 and has won a slew of awards for her animal rescue work, including the American Red Cross of Lower Fairfield Countys first Hero award. Claudia and her volunteers often go to extraordinary lengths for cats, dogs and other critters in need of help. Several years ago, for example, Claudia chartered a small plane to transport half a dozen dogs to Connecticut from a southern state, where they were to be euthanized. With more financial support they could do even better. 
Strays & Others Inc	182546	1	/users/profile/239369	Betsy21	Volunteer	5	10/25/2013	Many years ago, my father-in-law had a friendly cat show up at his house. He cared for Sonny the best he could, but he knew that he couldn't provide for him as well as he wanted. He contacted Strays and Others and they were able to find a permanent home for Sonny where he would be given the best care and all the love he deserved. Several years later, after my mother-in-law passed away, I was taking care of my father-in-law's accounts and saw that he donated to Strays and Others' annual appeal. At this point of my life I had retired and was looking to volunteer and contacted them. Nearly 6 years later, I spend several hours a week serving the homeless cats and dogs under their care. It is a labor of love, but there is nothing more rewarding than seeing one of 'our' kitties or dogs adopted by a loving and caring family and being given a second (or third) chance to enrich someone's life. I wear the hat of an adopter, too, for within 4 short months of volunteering at the shelter, my husband and I welcomed Tessie into our family and are so happy to have her curl up with us every night.In addition to the relationships I've made with the animals, I am pleased that I have met some wonderful people and know that many of them will be life-long friends as well as fellow volunteers.Strays and Others is completely volunteer run and depends on donations from generous supporters to allow them to fulfill their goals. Veterinarian care is expensive, as is feeding and housing the cats and dogs that come into our care. We are always seeking more volunteers and gratefully welcome any donations!
Strays & Others Inc	181945	2	/users/profile/238699	vhay	Donor	5	10/24/2013	I have been a business owner in New Canaan for over 20 years, and have been a donor and occasional volunteer for this amazing non-profit for nearly the same number of years.  Additionally, both myself and my mom have adopted cats from the organization.   Strays and Others is a small organization full of generous, open-hearted and professional people who work tirelessly to rescue animals and give them the care and compassion they so badly need and deserve while at the same time working enthusiastically to help them find their forever homes. Over these many years, I have seen every aspect of Strays and Others, and cannot say enough kind words about them.  I also now that nearly 100% of every dollar goes directly to the care of the animals... it doesn't get any better then that!
Strays & Others Inc	181925	2	/users/profile/238681	MaryJaneB	Client Served	5	10/24/2013	The little four-legged love of my life came to me thanks to Strays and Others.  But the process was not easy!  I was interviewed, my home was visited on more than one occasion, references were provided to be sure I'd be a good "mom" and, after the actual adoption, there was great follow-up and support for the many questions I had about my new "babe"!  Strays and Others is administered by a truly dedicated woman (Claudia Weber) and her dedicated staff.  I was impressed by my experience with them and continue to be so as I follow S&O's work throughout the community.  This organization is a MODEL for others which want to place pets in the right homes!!!
Strays & Others Inc	172228	1	/users/profile/227955	ldkark	Client Served	5	09/27/2013	Its never easy to replace the unconditional love youve gotten from your 4 legged family member whos been in your life for 14 years and passes on.  After taking the time to mend my broken heart I was ready to adopt another kitty.  I found Strays and Others and decided to look into what they had to offer.  Not only did I find kittens, older cats and dogs in need of a loving home but I learned that the organization is completely run by volunteers and all donations raised are used to support and care for their animals or to assist pet owners who may be struggling financially to cover medical expenses for their cat or dog.   Although it was a very hard decision to choose from all of the wonderful and loving animal needing a forever home,  I was immediately drawn to Bella an older long haired black cat with beautiful big green eyes.  He has a great personality and I am so grateful to Strays and Others for fostering him until I found him.  I can tell he was well cared for and loved by the volunteers that visited him every day because there was no adjustment period.  He came into my home and quickly settled in as if he had been there for years. An organization like Strays and Other, Inc. is deserving of all the financial support available so they can continue on with their loving and caring efforts for another 30 years! Thank you Strays and Others for taking such good care of Bella and all of the other animals in your care. Laurie, New Canaan   
Strays & Others Inc	171688	1	/users/profile/227334	CynD	Client Served	5	09/25/2013	I was introduced to Strays and Others, Inc. eight years ago and have never looked back.  It all started when a very dirty, matted and friendly kitty showed up at my home exhausted, hungry and very tired.  It was obvious she belonged to a family but had lost her way and needed help finding them.  I began contacting all the local animal organizations asking if anyone had reported losing their kitty fitting my new found friends description.  All of the organizations were quick to answer me by saying no and offering me no further advice on how to find the lost kittys owner.  When I spoke with the Strays and Others volunteer  she offered to come by my house to see the lost kitty and talk about our options.  This caring and concerned Strays and Others volunteer was determined to find the owner and after a week of making inquiries  we had success  the owner and lost kitty were reunited. This experience left me with a positive lasting impression and opened my heart to Strays and Others and their cause.  Eight years later, I continue to support them financial several times a year  I have adopted two of their beautiful and loving kitties  and also volunteer my time to assist in their annual fundraising events. My devotion and support to Strays and Others grows stronger every time I find myself surrounded by their volunteers who give their time and money to helping abandoned, homeless and loving cats, kittens and dogs.   Cynthia, New Canaan
Strays & Others Inc	171465	2	/users/profile/227047	CindyNC	Client Served	5	09/24/2013	The volunteers at Strays and Others work tirelessly to save the lives of animals who can not save themselves.  They reach out to homeless cats and dogs and find families who can give them a second chance in life.  Our family was one of the lucky ones, adopting a dog two years ago through Strays and Others.  The organization, run by Claudia Weber, put much care and attention into training the dog prior to our adoption.  He came with impeccable manners and they performed a thorough analysis to ensure that it was the right fit for our family and also for Cody, our handsome big black Labrador Retriever.  He is a gentle giant who fit right into our family life and brings great happiness to all of us.  Claudia has followed his progress in support of the adoption and is always available for support and advice. Their high success rate in placements is a reflection of this attention to detail.  It is a very well-run, dedicated and ethical organization that impacts the lives of many animals and people in a positive way.         
Strays & Others Inc	90591	2	/users/profile/103375	Marnie	Client Served	5	06/13/2011	Stays and Others is a wonderful organization run by a dedicated woman - Claudia Weber. My husband and I adopted a wonderful dog from them a number of years ago. Claudia was very through in making sure our home was a suitable place for Hitch. Hitch was a valuable and beloved member of our family until circumstances made it so he could not remain with us. It was with a heavy heart that we gave Hitch back to Strays and Others with the promise that they would find him another loving home. Claudia has made good on that promise and Hitch is now living with a wonderful family that loves him as much as we did. In fact I have been in touch with the new owners who allowed me to reunite with Hitch this past spring. Claudia and the volunteers work very hard to place abandoned animals in loving homes. They clearly love animals and it shows!
Madonna Place, Inc.	273257	1	/users/profile/362462	Kristi25	Client Served	5	11/30/2015	Love this place, when I was in high school I volunteered here as part of my Early Childhood Development program. The staff was super friendly and I learned a lot about what they offer to help people. Little did I know that a few years later they would be helping me and my family with diapers and formula when times were tough. They also have a clothing closet, kitchen you can cook in packed with food, and many classes to help families with the struggles of everyday life.
Madonna Place, Inc.	262470	1	/users/profile/351133	Amy_241	Client Served	3	10/08/2015	Lovely program. Have gone there for help with meals or diapers since 04.  Also since moved back to Norwich have gotten help with Xmas gifts, back to school bags, and winter coats. I just wish they offered more personal touches as the program has changed so much and everyone is very busy. If you feeling very sad and go in there is no one who can sit with you. The phone ringrings off the hook and staff can hardy keep up with the phones. Lots of "other" outside programs offered through here but if you don't daytime hours available because of work or kids in school nothing is available it seems for regular working joes and Jane's. I know piles of folks take advantage of programs all the time but no one likes new way of things being done there.
Madonna Place, Inc.	233059	4	/users/profile/296725	CEEChellas	Client Served	5	11/06/2014	I'll never forget being in the hospital, recovering from my C-section feeling completely overwhelmed about being a new mom in a new place.  In walks this young lady, who listed off all the services that Madonna Place offers and asks if I was interested.  It sounded wonderful and exactly what I need, but my mom chimed in and asked the cost, (good point, mom, life is about to get a lot more expensive)...FREE!   Fast forward to my first meeting, in my house (I didn't have to go anywhere!).  I immediately felt that I had someone to listen to my concerns, worries, fears, ACCOMPLISHMENTS.  Since then, my weekly visit is something that baby girl and I truly look forward to.   The program has given me guidance and reassurance that I am doing the right thing and my, now, toddler is on the right track. And every week my family ask what did you learn this week, what did your home visitor have to say about our girl?  It also serves as a catalyst for discussion on how to best raise our child. I sincerely believe that the services Madonna Place offer are extremely valuable.  It helps new moms become aware of developmental milestones, find approaches to deal with those difficult times that come with raising a child, offers pointers for good nutrition, safety and so much more.  It educates families and in doing so can help PREVENT issues such as neglect, abuse, obesity and accidents.  
Madonna Place, Inc.	232659	2	/users/profile/296213	SusanC.	Volunteer	5	11/02/2014	I have worked with Madonna Place for many years as a colleague in another non-profit working with children and families.  In this past year I have been given the opportunity to volunteer at Madonna Place and see the Mission of the organization in action.  The things the Madonna Place's skilled employees are able to do to support and strengthen families in SECT are critical, including the Fatherhood Initiative.  I could not more highly recommend this agency to the community.  I consider myself very lucky to have the chance to volunteer there.
Madonna Place, Inc.	229691	2	/users/profile/293340	wyagarich	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/29/2014	I have worked at Madonna Place for 6 years.  I love watching children increase their positive attachment with their parents.  Staff are able to share various child development tools to support parents and their children.  Supporting a family who may be struggling with a lot of stress and helping them utilize tools to strengthen their parenting skills is a beautiful sight.
Madonna Place, Inc.	229422	2	/users/profile/293076	FredCaserta	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2014	We first became acquainted with Madonna Place in 2004.  Over these 10 years we have come to witness the critical role that they play in the community.  We have seen how they help to prevent child abuse and neglect through educating parents with their Family School Connection and the Families First - Nurturing Families Program.  They also have a Family Support Center where parents can come and prepare a meal and obtain basic supplies if needed.  Madonna Place is a vital organization serving the community to help ensure proper child development.  It's a privilege and honor to partner with them.
Madonna Place, Inc.	228606	2	/users/profile/292292	mvalentin	Board Member	5	10/28/2014	I have been associated with Madonna Place, Inc. for the past two years and continue to be impressed with the critical services the agency provides at risk children and families in eastern CT. The staff are highly committed to the mission of preventing child abuse and neglect and are able to provide a full range of direct services to 2600 caregivers and children (2013 to 2014) on limited and diminishing funding. Staff commit their personal time and money to support essential programs such as; The Family School Connection, The Fatherhood Initiative,  Families First, Great Beginnings, A Family Support Center, and the Triple P Parenting Program. As a board member I can testify that this is funding well invested. These services enable parents to successfully parent and children the opportunity to thrive, creating stronger families and communities.  I highly endorse Madonna Place!
Madonna Place, Inc.	228504	2	/users/profile/292195	SGualti	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	Great Organization!  I have worked with Madonna Place for over 15years.  Every person coming through their doors is treated with respect and dignity.  The organization is staffed with dedicated and compassionate people who truly care about the success of families in our area.  I work with nonprofit as an external auditor and I am always amazed with how much Madonna Place can accomplish with so little.  
Madonna Place, Inc.	228501	3	/users/profile/292192	david.hevey	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	As a Madonna Place staff member, I've been fortunate to have a direct role in fulfilling the agency's mission of strengthening families and preventing child abuse.  I've been involved with many community agencies in the past, but Madonna Place is unique in how it welcomes families with respect and dignity.  From the moment a family walks threw the door they are made to feel welcome with a smile and prompt attention to their questions.  Staff actively listen to the family's concerns and provide individualized support to address their unique needs.  It's location in the heart of downtown Norwich provides easy accessibility to families that utilize our services on a weekly basis.  I'm proud to be part of an organization that values families and actually stays true to it's mission of strengthening families in a non-bureaucratic and family-friendly manner.  There's no secret to our success.  We are people helping people.

The management and staff of the agency are exceptional people who deliver much needed services to southeastern Connecticut. The agency's mission to provide services which strengthen families, promote health and help to prevent child abuse and neglect have directly impacted thousands of individuals over many years. As a board member, I know first hand that Madonna Place has been an excellent steward of the resources available to them. I would recommend to anyone to learn more about this agency and become passionate about their mission!
Madonna Place, Inc.	216890	2	/users/profile/280412	hpdales	Board Member	5	09/24/2014	I have been a part of Madonna Place for close to one year now and I am so thankful to have learned about their mission and to be able to participate. This organization offers many avenues for families, mothers, fathers, children, grandparents and friends to help find their way to a positive future. There is always a helpful hand at the other end of the phone line or at the desk when you walk in. The special programs they have provide support of fathers, mothers and children  who may need a little extra asisstance through home visits, education, food, drop-in center, diapers, clothing, community resources and general family oriented assistance. All programs are aimed at providing a better world for our children.  I encourage anyone to look into Madonna Place and call for assistance or donate to help out this valuable resource for south eastern CT.
Madonna Place, Inc.	215532	2	/users/profile/278971	dhurt	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/18/2014	I recently became involved with Madonna Place. The home visiting model is unique and offers a variety of options to strengthen families. There is also a drop in family support center with a variety of programs and services. There is a culture that respects families and helps them to be healthy and prevents child abuse. It is a very nurturing, supportive environment to help families to improve their lives.
Madonna Place, Inc.	209047	3	/users/profile/271810	DiegoG	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/07/2014	Non-Profit....  It means that there isnt a huge surplus of money coming into an organization.  However the real "Profit" of Madonna Place, is Human evolution.  For mothers and fathers who are struggling with life, this organization provides; Help, Relief, Support, Nurturing, Kindness, Love and most of all....  Hope.  Some agencies just do "what is required" by their grants and funding sources.  Madonna Place goes far and beyond the scope of their contracts to sincerely bring much needed help and crucial life assistance to (voiceless) people who desperately need it.  Madonna Place is constantly looking to improve their own surrounding community as well as reach out to most of Connecticut.  I am pleasantly surprised and filled with tremendous joy every day I work here with the magnificently important labor that they do.  I have been in the social work field for over 12 years now and I have only come across a handful of agencies that truly care for and appreciate their clients and the people in their community as much as they do.  It has only been a few months since Ive been here, but I have worked with Madonna Place over the years and it has always been an extraordinarily productive delight.  Some social help is given out of contracts and agreements.  The truly miraculous help that Madonna Place provides is out of compassion, desire and Love.  I hope that this organization continues to thrive and do the amazing work they have been doing from the moment they opened their doors.  Social work is not about getting junkies off the street or hiding homeless people away in some dark, lonely shelter.  Its about giving people the hope and desire to improve their lives, thereby improving all of society.  The real social work is done out of kindness and love for our fellow Human Beings.  Cheers to Madonna Place  Cheers indeed.

Prior to working here, I have always admired Madonna Place and what the agency stood for. Now that I am a part of the Madonna Place team, I couldn't be happier.

I can truly say that the staff here go above and beyond the call of duty to be there and support the people within our community.

Madonna Place, Inc.	82149	2	/users/profile/90183	RPearson	Board Member	5	03/14/2011	My association with Madonna Place began as a donor in 2004 and grew as I became a board member in 2005, where I still serve today.  Through these several years, I have seen a passionate and dedicated management team and staff consistently delivering on the agency mission to strengthen families, promote health and to prevent child abuse and neglect in our community. Successful Madonna Place programs include the Fatherhood Initiative dedicated to helping fathers become more involved in their childrens lives, not only financially, but also emotionally and Families First, focused on parent education for first time parents to provide skills to avoid abusive or neglectful situations.These and other Madonna Place offerings have provided outcome value for our community since 1987 and should continue into the future as long as there is a need.
Madonna Place, Inc.	82026	2	/users/profile/90001	Flruss	Board Member	5	03/12/2011	Madonna Place provides the community with a much needed service.  Their various programs and services work together to support and strengthen the family unit.  The Fatherhood program provides much needed support and development of key skills to be a good dad.  The nurturing family connections provides a support mechanism for first time parents.  As a volunteer of the program above I got to experience how this service helped to provide a support line to parents of various social and economic demographics.  In addition this organization helps fill some basic needs such as diapers and formula to families in need.

The Fatherhood Initiative has assisted countless dads become engaged & strengthen their parenting skills; Families First assists first time parents through the challenging times while fostering the vital bond between parent and child; and the Drop in Center provides a safe place to socialize, obtain information and provide respite care for children, just to name a few of the important programs.  I would highly recommend this Agency to any family in need of their services.
Madonna Place, Inc.	81865	2	/users/profile/89777	Hupernikow	Board Member	5	03/10/2011	I became a board member at Madonna Place, in January of 2010, after learning about the difference this organization makes in the lives of children, and parents in our community. As a Champion of children, an educator, and an individual who believes in making a difference in my community, I am impressed with the impact this organization has on the lives of real people. I have had the privilage of volunteering and bringing Mad Science programs to some of the children's programs here at Madoona Place. As a board member I have had the opportunity to see that the people working for this organization are not just showing up for work, but are driven by a passion, and a purpose. I am honored to be a part of this organization, and believe that it is organizations like this that are the foundation of change in our society.
Madonna Place, Inc.	81453	3	/users/profile/89171	redsoxmom2	Client Served	4	03/08/2011	I joined Madonnas Place three years ago when i had my first son.  I had recently moved to CT and had no family in the area.  The program not only helped me learn about parenting but helped me in a critical time of my life.  It was difficult for me to be a new mom without the support of my family around me.  Now that i have been a mom for a few years now there are always more challenges and questions ahead.  This program has helped me greatly.  They also have wonderful activies for the kids to do all the time.  Both of my children love interaction with thier peers. Since they are too young for school and are not enrolled in day care they really dont get out to much to see other kids thier age.  Having said that i have met a few moms in the process as well.  Overall i love this program and i recommend it to ANY new mom.  
Madonna Place, Inc.	81367	2	/users/profile/89060	RCarpe1009	General Member of the Public	5	03/07/2011	I learned about the Madonna Place and how it helps the community a few years ago. I thought it was a great place for children and families to grow together. I actually benefited from the agency when I became a 1st time mom 19 months ago. Its pretty scary to bring a child up in this world and I had someone call me once a week to check up in me through one of the programs run through Madonna Place. She was a mother herself and she gave me tips and insight based on her own life with children that I used to help me get through my first couple of months as a new mom. The other program that I am extremely happy with is the Fatherhood Initiative Program. Having never been part of the program I know what it stands for and how many fathers it has helped. I wish there were more programs out there who give so much hope to the community as Madonna Place does.

I started as a Board member and when my time ended on the board I became involved with their fundraising efforts.  My passion for and belief in this organization is strong.  When there was another opening on the Board, I became a member again.  Over the years I have seen growth and success in Madonna Place.  I have met  Jacquie, who came to Madonna Place drug addicted.  She since has raised 2 well educated daughters and is an Alderman on the town council.  I have met some of the Dads who because of Madonna Place,  took responsibility for child support payments  and were able to have  fruitful relationships with their children.  This organization makes a difference in our community.  Area children and parents would suffer without them. 
Tara Farm Rescue	293677	1	/users/profile/384309	E.Dale	Client Served	4	06/22/2016	I have been to visit Tara Farm Rescue several times and am impressed with the work they do.  I had my first riding lesson this week (have been wanting to do this for 55 years) and loved it!  The young lady (volunteer) who instructed me was wonderful.  She explained things about horses, about riding them, and how to communicate with them.  She showed me how to brush the horse & clean his hooves, saddle & bridle him and lead him to the ring.  We worked in the ring for half an hour.  I learned to go & stop & back up, to keep him on the perimeter of the ring, and I worked him through some obstacles.  Then she had me undress him (I am sure there is a term for this but I'll be darned if I can remember), brush him and check his hooves again and lead him back to his stall.  She was very professional, relaxed and friendly (even if she wasn't middle aged).  I feel I got a lot for my money (which goes to the  rescue farm, not to her) and signed up for my next class with her next week!
Tara Farm Rescue	280854	3	/users/profile/370835	momofone84	General Member of the Public	2	02/25/2016	I am appalled at the professionalism of the so called "instructor" of the farm.  Recently I had contacted them for riding lessons for my daughter and had things set up, she not only was late to the lesson, but she showed no professionalism and made no attempt to contact me or reschedule the lesson.  I was under the impression that Bonnie was teaching the lessons.  I also caught view of the "instructor" advertising that the facility does therapeutic riding.  There is no way that they can offer that from a kid instructor.  This is a huge liability and I hope no one gets hurt from her teachings.  I know very little of the sport myself and while watching her direct others clearly shows she needs to have lessons herself.  I hope they find someone who knows what they are doing or Bonnie goes back to teaching.  
Tara Farm Rescue	240913	1	/users/profile/327286	overolove96	Volunteer	5	04/10/2015	With all the rumors and untrue things going around about my second home right now, I'd like to take a minute to set the record STRAIGHT. Tara Farm Rescue in Coventry CT is a place I've spent almost all of my past time the last 9 years of my life. Bonnie Jeanne Gorden, the owner and manager, taught me how to ride when i was 8 years old, taught me everything about horses and how to care for them. This barn is one of the only ones in Connecticut that has a "work to ride" program, where you can muck stalls in return for FREE riding. This is an opportunity that is very hard to come by, and inexpensive way for kids to get all kinds of experience without having to pay a fortune. So that's what I did, for 9 years of my life, working my way up and earning people respect there as a rider. I worked my butt off, shoveled lots of poop volunteering there in my free time. and slowly, over the years, taking lessons and being taught by Bonnie Jeanne and the other volunteers there, my riding became the most important part of my life. Now, keep in mind, this is a RESCUE farm. We take in animals that no one else wants, that no one else can handel, and they become our responsibility. Our only income is through our lesson program, grants, and donations. So no, we may not have a huge indoor arena to ride in, or the prettiest barns, or most expensive tack. But we DO have a group of people with huge hearts, that do everything to put the animals first, and that's exactly what we do. I've gone to auctions with Bonnie Jeanne and bought horses there for dirt cheap that were destined for slaughter. Weve saved animals frozen to the ground left there to die. Weve had horses come in that are so unsocialized theyve never been touched by a human before. We then rehabilitate them, feed them, get them back into shape, get them the vetrinary care they need, and adopt them out. we have saved HUNDREDS of horses, dogs, cats, pigs, chickens, llamas, etc. Tara Farm brought me together with my own person horse Cherokee, who was destined for the slaughter auction if Bonnie Jeanne had not personally saved her. Ive seen the rescue turn cases around that were deemed "unsavable", into happy, healthy horses. I am the president of the 4H group held at our farm, and we are all proud to say that we are from Tara Farm Rescue. So please, I'm asking you NOT to believe the rumors going around about the farm from people who have never even stepped foot on the property, or who are set out to shut us down because of personal problems going on. Take it from me, a volunteer and rider of ten years, who knows every single detail about this place and all of the animals in it, and who knows that this rescue is an amazing operation that has saved thousands of animals lives-and you cant argue with that.
Tara Farm Rescue	240900	3	/users/profile/327268	redmonkey0728	Client Served	1	04/09/2015	!!SCAM ALERT!!  Tara Farm Rescue routinely "adopts" horses to unsuspecting, well intentioned people who pay for boarding, veterinary bills, transportation, etc. to Tara Farm.  If the "adopter" wants to board the horse at another facility, a "problem" is found with the paperwork and the adoption is deemed to be null and void by the owner of the rescue.  The scam is then perpetrated on another unsuspecting person.  STAY AWAY!!
Tara Farm Rescue	99132	5	/users/profile/118578	Whitney B.	General Member of the Public	2	10/09/2011	I used to go with my mom to help her clean the horse's stall that she adopted from Tara Farm because she has fibromyalgia and sometimes cannot do so on her own (also another reason she rides horses is because it it therapeutic) . The stalls were poorly built and several times my mom's horse was cut from slipping in the mud (that always seemed to be there regardless of the weather) on the ramps and she had to treat him for thrush because of the moist conditions. She had moved him once to another boarding facility and after my mom had given Bonnie Jeanne notice she left my mom's horse out in an open area, at night, un-blanketed while it poured freezing rain, there was even snow on the ground at the time. Once we got to the new boarding facility our horses were first placed in stalls with concrete floors, which she was told was not going to be permanent and that they would be moved shortly but about a month or so went by and they continued to be left in the stalls with concrete floors and on more than one occasion we noticed that they had been skimping on their food (which we provided for them) and had given some of our hay to other horses being boarded and weren't being let out to exercise with all the other horses daily so we decided to go back to Tara Farm since it was the only other place at the time that my mom knew of that was affordable. One winter my mom was on Craigslist and found a woman looking to give away a horse in NY so we contacted the lady about the horse and drove out to look at him and she told us that the woman who had boarded him there had just abandoned him and that she did not have the extra money to continue taking care of him and her own horses. We ended up adopting him. When we went to ask Bonnie Jeanne if we could also board this horse (that was going to be my horse) along with my mom's horse she yelled at me "how dare you not adopt a horse" without even knowing the details about how we came to own this horse, I assume what she was so angry about was that I had not adopted a horse from her. I have also seen Bonnie Jeanne slap and punch her horses in their face when they misbehave. My mom is the one who had her horse stolen back when she decided to leave Tara Farm a second time. She won the court case against Bonnie Jeanne for Bonnie Jeanne breaching her own contract. My mother did not abuse her horse and if that was true why did Bonnie Jeanne allow her to keep her horse the entire time we were boarding him there? She did not say one word to my mom about mistreating her horse until she tried to leave again. You would think if she really was doing something wrong that she would not sit by and allow it for months and that the horse would have been taken from my mother before hand. Most of you who are talking about my mother on here have no first hand experience with my mom or her situation and it is all hearsay and none of your business to say anything about. My mom loved that horse and was very emotionally distraught after losing him, my younger sister was even jealous of this horse at one time because my mom treated him so good and spent so much time on/with him. There is definitely room for improvement to be made in the way this place is run and the general attitude of workers towards the public. 
Tara Farm Rescue	97456	1	/users/profile/114407	ilovetarafarm	Volunteer	5	09/14/2011	I currently work at Tara Farm Rescue, and I have to move, and I am sad to say goodbye. That place has become, my family. I have read some of the other reviews that people have written, and I would like to say, the animals are treated really good. Yes, they get scolded when they do somthing they are not suppose to do, but thats how the horses learn. And currently Tara Farm is trying to raise money to tear down one of the buildings and re-build it. I have a feeling that people who visit this farm, just glance at it, and think so horrible of this place. It is amazing. Yes, it is dirty there, but Farm isn't? I mean really? We clean the stalls everyday, and give equal attention to each animal. This is an amazing person to volunteer at. And obviously the people who had written bad reviews about this place, have some looking to do in the mirror at themselves. Bonnie Jean, I have known her for maybe 4 momths now, and yes, she does come off a little intimadating, but she really isn't at all. She is very nice and kind hearted. And don't say anything about her brother. That is a shame, that person, would throw that in this farms face, about what happened to him. That person doesn't know what really happened, so they should not say anything about what happened to him. Yes animals die, but Tara Farm Rescue does everything that they can do to prevent it. But sometimes you just can't help things like that from happening. 
Tara Farm Rescue	95198	1	/users/profile/110377	Amy R.	Client Served	5	08/07/2011	I learned to ride at Tara Farm.  My daughter now rides at Tara farm.  My husband and I are signing up today to volunteer at the farm.  This place does amazing things and those of you who think Bonnie Jean is a horrible person think again.  Some of my fondest memories of childhood come from that farm.  Yes we worked our butts off and my daughter does now but it tought me a good work ethic, and BJ is now helping to instill that in my child.  she loves those animals more than she loves most humans.  She is not neglectful in anyway.  Those of you who claim she took her horse back, I am willing to bet you did something to that horse that she did not agree with.  If you did not like the contract than you should not have signed it.  Tara Farm is amazing.
Tara Farm Rescue	81300	3	/users/profile/88954	Madison72	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/06/2011	This place is absolutely disgusting.  I had taken i visit out to Tara farm rescue to possibly adopt a horse and was mortified at what i saw. This seems to be more of a case of animal hoarding then animal rescue. I don't think this organization has the means, money, or workers to take care of the amount  of animals they have and it really shows.  Horses are standing in layers and layers of feces and filthy bedding. Not to mention the barns leak like you wouldn't believe and the horses are getting rained on even inside, and the stalls are filled with inches of water. What a shame. I wish i could get every one of those horses out of there. Someone aught to call the people for that "animal hoarders" show. I know that a lot of  "animal hoarders" will call their operations "animal rescue" in order to receive donations and things. I hope this isn't whats going on here. 
Tara Farm Rescue	57521		/users/profile/60818	Kathrynscharity	General Member of the Public	3	11/21/2010	I have to say that I came to this site trying to find truthful information on this farm. I mean after all this is a review site. They are meant to be used to try to spread an honest inside word on organizations. All I can say is that I don't know what to believe and that I have really wasted my time. Can we please stop fighting and lying! All we should care about is the horses and spreading the truth about the organization. If you are lying about the farm, weather you are saying it is great or awful, I feel sorry that you are such a lame person to be wasting your time by doing that. I have a friend who works there and she says it is great yet she is not afraid to admit that "yes, it does have it's faults just like any organization" I was thinking about volunteering for lessons but now I am not so sure. I mean if this is how you all you act ,by fighting, why would i want to be in that type of environment? Oh, also Don't you think you should spend a day at the farm volunteering instead of judging it at all. I am sorry for being so harsh but we all want to help the animals so why don't we start doing it.    
Tara Farm Rescue	53639		/users/profile/54782	kathie2	Client Served	5	09/28/2010	I have known Bonnie Jeanne for 27 years. I started 4-H with her when I was 12 and grew up riding at Tara Farm. I gained my "horsey education" there learning about all aspects of horse care, training and rehabilitation of abused, injured and neglected horses. I boarded there as an adult. If there is one thing I can say about this rescue it's that the animals come FIRST. You will find few rescues that put the time and resources into a horse like this place does. Dental, chiropractic, massage, medications, supplements, corrective trimming and shoeing...you name it, if they need it, they get it. Because so much time, love and effort is put into each rescue, her contract is tight...she want's to make sure the horse never has to suffer abuse or neglect again. Bottom line is...if you adopt a horse from Tara Farm and you take proper care of the horse...it's your's for life, but make no mistake, Bonnie Jeanne will not let one of her babies go through abuse or neglect again if she can help it. Once a horse is part of the Tara Farm "family", there is a group of caring individuals that want the best for the horse for the rest of it's life. The many wonderful adopters know this too...and they are also part of the Tara Farm family.
Tara Farm Rescue	52963		/users/profile/53999	ponyriderdaughter	General Member of the Public	5	09/21/2010	Thank you so much! My daughter loved the pony ride and she had such an amazing time! I really appreciate it she won't stop talking about it! When I stopped by I loved how things were run the girls and their horses look really happy.
Tara Farm Rescue	51523	5	/users/profile/52233	jumpitall	Client Served	5	09/02/2010	Tara Farm is an amazing place. And none of this crap would be going on if not for one unforgiving lady and her family. So for those of you looking at the reviews and seeing all the rumors and "bad things" going on let me fill you in. Please. A boarder came and adopted a horse from the rescue, well turns out she never mucked OR really cared for her horses like a normal person would. But bonniejean was understanding and HELPED her out with board and all. Well came time for the ANNUAL huntrpace and This boarder decided to enter, as many did. Minimum time was 1hr 20min. Her horse came back in 33 minutes with blood in his nose, and he was heaving, the poor horse looked like someone took a hose to him. Then worst of all she tossed the reins aside like the horse was nothing and trotted up to "collect" her prize. But was she disapointed when she heard DQ! Then when it came time for the Christmas party she snuck her horses into a trailer {while we were all away} and hid them. We had no idea WHERE she was at all. Turns out she was a some barn in hiding, well about a week later she was KICKED out of that one and bonniejean got L.L (the adopted horse) back. He was so thin. Now she is upset about having her "horse" taken from her. But she treated him like dirt. Truthfully she is unworthy of her personal Horse. So she is spreading rumors on facebook,myspace,youtube..etc. she even got her daughter involved! HOW LOW can you go?! So if you think this is a terrible farm look at all the people defending it. Look and see, do you think all these people would do this if they didn't like Tara? And the whole thing about children being worked hard is crap. WE VOLUNTEER which means we choose, we aren't forced to do anything we dont want to. And yes BJG may be strict but its for our safety. So please don't judge this place because of rumors. Come see it yourself and meet BJG. I love it here and wouldnt change anything about it.
Tara Farm Rescue	34093	1	/users/profile/34917	eyelight	General Member of the Public	1	03/28/2010	I think the drama here is rediculous, this is a place to write reviews. Everyone should be able to voice their opinions without having to be bullied by the farm's workers and volunteers...if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all, this isn't a site to verbally abuse people. I have visited this farm a few times and did not really agree with the way the animals were dealt with. I do not believe in hitting animals, but a number of times excessive smacking and yelling at the horses was encouraged. I don't think this is a proper way of dealing with horses who have come from abusive situations...or in general, but especially in this case. Also I witnessed use of spurs-which I believe is something the contract says NOT to use:http://www.tarafarmrescue.org/(under Adoption Contract)   I am not going to go as far as to say that the horses here are being abused or neglected-the horses DID in fact appear to be healthy. I just did not agree with the handling of abused, neglected, and abandoned horses.
Tara Farm Rescue	28269	5	/users/profile/28187	luckylove	Client Served	5	02/13/2010	Tara Farm is an amazing place! I love it so much. Bonniejean gives us so many oppurtunities we wouldn't have anywhere else! The horses are healthy and Boniejean helps all sorts of animals! I go there for 4-H and board my 2 horses there they are very happy too! And most of all, all the girls there are devoted! they are always there though rain,or snow! And when there not riding they are muckin,grooming,...etc... I love it and I dont care if its a 500,000$ facility, I wouldnt change anything about that wonderful place!Bonniejean- YOU INSPIRE ME! Your an amazing woman who has opened your heart and home to unwanted,badly treated, and abused animals. Now thats a HERO in my book. :D
Tara Farm Rescue	26560	13	/users/profile/27579	commonsense	Volunteer	1	01/29/2010	After reading all of these posts i've figured out a few things.  First off honestone is hypocritcal and unbeliveable he/she points out how one shouldn't be commenting about this issue on a personal level but comes and does the same attacking the people on the same level.  It just shows how childish you are and immature.  second if more then one person has had a problem with this farm then it's not a concidence and something very wrong is going on here.  It's really easy to many posts using diffrent names but all done by the same people probably.  When it comes down to it a i think a full investigation should be done on the claims here and if nothing is going on then the people who run this farm shouldn't have anything to hide or worry about.  On a final note doing a 7 1/2 mile course wouldn't make a horses nose bleed and the horse would have to be in extremly great condition.  My Best friend has had horse there whole life and competes in compations and has explained this to me.  Think twice before putting up comments.
Tara Farm Rescue	26544	6	/users/profile/27567	Liza	Volunteer	5	01/29/2010	I have been at Tara farm for 14 years. I was a co-4-H leader and now I am a boarder. I have learned so much from BonnieJeanne and continue to learn. She has a big heart and takes very good care of her animals. I want to Thank her for everything she has done for me, and my daughter. We are very fortunate and blessed to be able to have a place like Tara Farms to go too, for our children and for the adults who love the animals and care for them. The farm is a place I can escape to, they are my family. BonnieJeanne has dedicated her life and love in taking care of these animals in need. I give her lot's of credit for what she is doing. It's a lot of work to do what she is doing. I Commend her on her work in Rescuing these animals. Thank You BonnieJeanne, Love from a friend.
Tara Farm Rescue	26525	7	/users/profile/27551	Sarah	Volunteer	5	01/29/2010	I am a current boarder at Tara Farm. I have been there for 14 years and have never once witnessed  bonniejeanne treating any of her animals badly. She rehabilitates animals that other people just give up on and adopts them out to loving homes. Not all homes are so loving tho, the women who hunterjumper is talking about only saw the horse as an object. She didn't take care of him properly. For example, she hired one of the VOLUNTEERS at the rescue to muck her stall. That volunteer got 17 wheelbarrows out of her horses stall. And she's trying to say Bonniejeanne treats her animals badly? The farm has come a long way since I've been there. She's doing something most people don't have the strength and will power to do. So for people to trash talk the farm when they have never been there or listening to this childish bitter woman, think twice. Put your feet in her shoes. She IS doing a WONDERFUL thing. Ignorant people just need to realize that.
Tara Farm Rescue	26512	9	/users/profile/27540	horselover15	Volunteer	5	01/29/2010	I have been volunteering at Tara Farm Rescue for the past 4 years. I have seen so many animals walk through our gates for the first time with a look of sadness and defeat in their eyes. But soon they transform into a complete different animal who understands that they have a second chance at life. That is what I love the most about the farm. It is a chance for animals to learn to be animals again and to realize that not all people are bad. Some people can be so heartless towards animals but not BonnieJeanne. BonnieJeanne has a way with all animals and they can feel it. She gives them the very best vet treatment and thinks only about the care of her animals. Yes i agree the barn may not be the most beautiful because it is a rescue and all the money goes right into the vet, farrier, dentistry bills, etc. and the animals are in the best health. It breaks my heart to hear people talk such crap about the farm when all BonnieJeanne does is devote her life to rescuing animals and rehabilitating them. I would also like to add, that as a college student, I may be one of these "children" mentioned in previous comments. I VOLUNTEER my time to these animals as do the other girls. I CHOOSE to muck stalls and exercise horses because I enjoy it and I chose to be a part of this organization, rather than any other riding stable, because I believe that Tara Farm Rescue is an amazing place that truly puts only the animals first.
Tara Farm Rescue	26471	15	/users/profile/27504	hunterjumper	Professional with expertise in this field	4	01/28/2010	This honestly sickens me.  This is one person and her family mouthing off about an experience that they have shared with the rescue.  Let me fill everyone in.  I have been with Tara Farm Resuce for the last 4 wonderful years.  I myself have adopted a magnificant horse from the rescue and continue to board at the rescue.  I was there the day that this woman took the horse off the property.  She read and understood the contract and signed a contract stating that Tara Farm Rescue is to visit the place the horse is to be moved to.  Instead she shows up, FINALLY cleans her horses' stalls (rough board situation) after a week of not cleaning them and tries to take the horse.  Our contract is for the safety of the animal.  IF for any reason the person is unable to provide the care or fails to pay board at the boarding facility, the horse is to be brought back to the rescue.  BonnieJeanne takes a lot of time (and so have I and any of the volunteers) in working with the animals and healing their wounds of neglect.  The man who removed the horse off the farm was someone known for neglect, especially since the rescue had received horses from him in the past.  The woman that had the horse swore up and down that she loved the horse but everyone saw the true side of her when she galloped the horse down a wet trail over pavement and the poor animal fell on his side and had horrible wounds and rode him back.  She proceded to contact me and ask me for wound care products to use and then left him overnight with no protection on the wounds from the flies.  And let me not forget about the time that Tara Farm Rescue held its annual hunter pace.  A 7 1/2 mile trail course that had a time of 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete it in.  She finished it in 33 minutes with blood coming out of the horse's nose!  So it was only a matter of time that the horse would have been taken back.  Like I said before, Bonnie Jeanne and her professionals along with the volunteers pour a lot of time into the healing process of these animals.  I wish I could look at this woman today and tell her to grow up. It was your stupidity that got your horse taken away from you.  And for anyone else who would like to see what our contract is about, please visit the farm's website and you can see for yourself.
Tara Farm Rescue	26434	8	/users/profile/27457	honest_one	Volunteer	4	01/28/2010	Tara Farm Rescue is a wonderful place.  The previous negative comments are based solely on the experiences of one individual and should be weighted on that fact alone.  It is not an objective opinion.  This rescue struggles constantly with the need of the many against the the little resources available.  Bonniejeanne works with many well recognized professionals and does more for these animals than most would.  If the facility had fancy painted barns and manucured gardens then you would know where your donations are going.  Instead,  show up on a Monday when three professionals are working (dentist, vet, farrier) on the rescue horses.  If you look around the horses all have shelter,  hay in front of them (or pasture) and are all in good weight.  Definitely worth checking out.
Tara Farm Rescue	26423	14	/users/profile/27454	prue33p	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/28/2010	i have been resueing horses for 15 yrs and i have been in contact with tara farm and bonnie jean for over 4 yrs and i have to say that this is a woman that has been wearing the same shoes she was wearing when i met her, she has given so much to these animals and taken nothing for herself as a rescue myself  i could only dream of being as generous and loving toward everything living as this rescue has been the animals dont have the prettiest barn or the fanciest tack, but the animals get top of the line vet care any suppliment they need chiropractic care,warm cozy beds and all the good feed they could ask for.the attention and one on one tlc is priceless.
Tara Farm Rescue	25972	3	/users/profile/26987	creekwrangler	General Member of the Public	1	01/21/2010	The owner was rude and the place was a mess with children doing all the work. I pray the state will go in and take all animals and lock her and her freeloading family up. Both neg reviews below are a regular accurance at this farm. I try my best to spread the word to not have anything to do with this so called rescue.I pray people will stop giving her animals!
Tara Farm Rescue	25893	3	/users/profile/26897	antiscammer	Donor	1	01/20/2010	CAUTION!! I would not recommend Tara Farm Rescue to anyone looking to adopt a horse. The rescue claims to "Adopt" out rehabilitated horses but the fact of the matter is they actually "Lease" out horses for a fee and can take back ownership at any given time.  Do not waste your time, money or efforts supporting this sham of a "rescue" in any way. Unfortunately much of what the previous reviewer has stated is 100% accurate.
Tara Farm Rescue	25547	2	/users/profile/26555	Ivebeenscammed	Donor	1	01/14/2010	BEWARE!!!!This woman made thousands of dollars off of me then when I found another facility to board the horse I had adopted from her she and her minions snuck over to the stables while no one was around and stole my beloved pet! She claimed breach of contract which was absolutely untrue! She knew how much I LOVED this horse and only took him out of retaliation for me leaving and her losing hundreds of dollars a month from me boarding two horses at her facility. I had often seen horses that were "adopted out" come back to the farm mysteriously and wondered why all these people adopted horses (for a FEE)yet gave them back. Now I understand. I also have met someone else who adopted a horse from her and brought it to his farm. Bonnie Jeanne and (again) her minions would stop by his house so often as to constitute harassment that he gave the horse back. She is basically a horse brothel-adopt the horse out and get it back until its too old or decrepid to make her a buck. She, her husband and brother live at the farm and DO NOT WORK-they live off donations which are meant for the animals on the farm. She also has partial projects around the farm so she can appear cash-needy when someone comes out. She always has some sob story ready for the unsuspecting potential financier. I also know a woman who adopted two horses from Bonnie Jeanne and had to sneak them off the farm because she wouldn't let her leave with them. Why would she when she's making all that money to finance her and her family not having to work for a living? Now I have to hire a lawyer to get my horse back! I had this horse for a year and a half and was bonded with him and she, in her self-serving greed, snatches him from me. She was arrested recently due to criminal trespass. Her brother is a convicted felon who also lives off of donations.

It can be literally overwhelming to deal with a serious chronic illness, but it shouldn't be a fight on top of it to receive just a little bit of help. Advocacy for Patients supplies a wealth of information to help people like my son and I navigate the health care, insurance and medical community, which is critical when someone is seriously ill. I just don't know what we would have done without the guidance we received from this organization.
Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness, Inc.	118071	1	/users/profile/160581	Renee456	Client Served	5	07/11/2012	In fall of 2011 I began I PhD program for which I had a full fellowship.  Due to reasons relating to my chronic illness, I took a leave of absence from school.  I was wanting to know more about my legal rights if I could press the school to give me a half time fellowship and stipend.  Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness researched my situation and gave me the scoop - basically there is not legal precedent and the the terms of the fellowship dictate full time status is required.  Additionally APCI provided me information relating to health insurance since I lost my benefits when I withdrew from school and got denied from a regular independent plan.  Also, in the midst of search for employment for myself I realized I was giving out too much information to potential employers and APCI gave me invaluable information about presenting myself, and not my chronic illness on job applications and interviews.  Overall in 2012 this organization has had a substantial impact on my life during some difficult times for myself.  It is a blessing to find a such a wealth of information relating to the legal ins and outs of living with chronic illness!
Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness, Inc.	118003	2	/users/profile/160506	Christina24	Client Served	5	07/10/2012	This organization not only makes sure I am in the loop when issues pertinent to my illness through social media but every person who has an issue is treated like a person rather than a problem. I have had occasion to call the office and I was treated with respect and kindness. Even though my issue was a simple reference I have watched this organization long enough to say with confidence, lives have been saved that would have otherwise been lost all because of them and their tireless work for justice for people who are so often without a voice or whose voice is otherwise ignored.
Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness, Inc.	117983	1	/users/profile/160463	Kristin K.	Client Served	5	07/10/2012	Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness helped me to live a normal life. Before receiving their assistance my life had become a shell of what it formerly was. My constant, excruciating head pain had removed me from my job, my social life, my family and even much of my marriage. Each day was a struggle made worse by my health insurance company's denials of the only promising treatment I had available to me. During his search for answers, my husband reached out to Jennifer Jaff, the Executive Director of Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness.  She and her staff collected records and presented an appeal with me against my insurance company. When it was again denied, they did not stop working for me. The communication between them and my husband ,who worked as my representative, was incredible considering we were several states apart. They continued to push for my case and in the end it went to a third party reviewer who ruled in my favor. I had surgery in December of 2010 to have a nerve stimulator placed in my head and my head pain has been reduced 85-90%. I am able to enjoy my life again in a way I never imagined was possible just a few years ago.  Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness does important work. I feel very blessed that we found them. I am amazed with how much they are able to do for so many with so few resources. Their efforts to provide free services to chronically ill people nationwide should be both applauded and supported.

Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness has helped us understand his rights as a patient not only with a pre-existing condition but also as a working chronicly ill patient. We are better prepared for the changes that are coming in our situation. We have been given literature on our rights, how to file disability when the time comes, and local, state, and federal resources. We also have Advocacy for Patients to turn to if something goes wrong. Where else could we have gotten all of that? We also have the opportunity to ask questions of talented and knowledgable professionals in the medical law field. All of this has been provided free of charge.

They denied me and then denied the appeal from my  rheumatolotist.  I was just too sick at this point to fight them myself.  Jennifer and Nicole took my case and forced the insurance company to cover the medicine that was necessary.   It is a horrible state of affairs in my mind that the insurance company can not be trusted to be responsible, but on the other hand, thank God that there are people and a few intitutions like the Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness who can and are willing to be helpful.

He is in junior high school in the New York City public school system, and it became clear to us that he needed accommodations in school.  He was not doing well with his health, and was often absent.  We requested a 504 plan, which is a plan to develop accommodations for students through the Americans with Disabilities Act.  The school administration told us that they could not accommodate for him, and kept putting barriers to us getting a plan in place.  I saw Jennifer Jaff's name as the author of the 504 template we were using, contacted her for help.  She responded within 20 minutes to my email with such thoughtful advice.  Every step of the way, Jeniffer has helped us deal with the school.  She really understands the issues people with chronic illnesses are dealing with.  She is intellegent, and a very good lawyer.  I like that she helped us deal with the school effectively, while helping us avoid an uncomfortable confrontation with the administration.  We absolutely love Jeniffer Jaff and her organization.

I bought the Know Your Rights Handbook and found it to be very helpful. It is comforting to know that there is a person, a group, really looking out for those with IBD. My son has Crohn's disease and I know that I can count on them to help me when I run into trouble getting help with whatever he might need. I am a member of CCFA and they are awesome, but Ms. Jaff takes it to a more personal level when helping you. Thanks to Ms. Jaff and her staff for being such a great source of help and support.

Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness, Inc.	54889		/users/profile/56831	TheOutsider	Donor	5	10/20/2010	I donated very little but I've watched and witnessed what an amazing woman Jennifer Jaff is with her organization, fighting for people who can't fight for themselves. Jennifer, herself who has this painful disease, knows what it feels to be discriminated, ignored, etc while battling this disease and not getting support from people they loved because they don't understand the disease that overtakes this person's life. She listens, consults, advices, and supports...more importantly, readily to fight for them. She cares about every person she comes in contact with and treats them like any human being should be treated - unconditional love with no strings attached. She makes the person feel a person, not a disabled person.

Donor	5	10/19/2010	Jennifer Jaff is an attorney and helps thousands of chronically ill folks to resolve issues with their health insurers each year.  She enables many, many people to receive life-saving treatments and prescriptions that have been denied.  She does it all at no cost to the people she helps.  My wife and I have donated to Advocacy for Patient with Chronic Illness and will continue to do that.   As a person who has several chronic illnesses and who became unexpected disabled after working for thirty years as a science and medical librarian, I know what type of expertise this takes. Jennifer manages this organization out of her home with one other staff member and herself.  I can't think of any other organization that does so much good with so little staffing. Any donation will be well used and benefit those who need it most.

It wasn't just that. Jennifer Jaff made me feel like I wasn't a freak. Previously I'd worked for the IRS for nearly a decade. During that time I was a damned good employee, winning service awards, being relied upon by my managers to coach new employees, acting for my managers...I was a "golden child" until I got sick. Once I got sick, I was yesterday's trash.It hurt to be tossed aside. But Jennifer made me feel valuable. She made me feel like I deserved my disability retirement. She worked with me in writing the appeal. She made me feel human. I couldn't even begin to tell you how much that means to me. Winning the appeal was important; but feeling like I deserved it...Jennifer is an amazing person and her organization does amazing things!
Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness, Inc.	54631		/users/profile/56263	jmargoli4yahoocom	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/07/2010	As a medical social worker at a large institution working with pediatric chronic illness, I regularly refer patients and families here for guidance and advocacy support on issues ranging from educational equity access to necessary medications for well-being, employment discrimination issues, and entitlement and legal rights. I have seen, first hand, the way that the organizations dedication,  investment  wisdom and compassion have directly led to successful outcomes that allow  children to have access to their educational curriculums,  obtain life-saving treatments  that insurances initially deny, and permit parents to not have to choose between threats of losing a job and being with their child during scary hospitalizations.  I have seen families lies be enhanced, health be improved and most critically, perhaps, hope be restored, all because of the tireless work and expertise offered by this organization. As a professional collaborator, the services are prompt, relevant and exhaustive.  I have seen the extraordinary impact the organization and Ms. Jaff have on public policy awareness and education the community about evolving laws impacting patients rights, and the reach she has in various illness-focused professional organizations to be a consultant to health care providers on the front lines, so that their own care delivery can be enhanced with the right strategies for patient advocacy. The organization and its commitment to equality helps teach me how to be a better clinician. It gives a 5-year-old with a lifelong chronic illness, a chance to be a 5 year old.

Upon finding Advocacy For Patients With Chronic Illnesses we were in an extremely desperate position.  My husband is diagnosed with Crohns Disease, Pyoderma Gangrenosum, Osteoporosis, Vascular Disease, he has a Fistula and a torn Meniscus.  Five Specialist in 2 different states have said that he would lose his leg if he should return to work.  The nurse from our private disability company, who has never seen my husband, decided all of the specialist were wrong and denied his coverage.We had been fighting this company for over 2 years.  We sold  a car and put our house on the market not being able to afford these 'luxuries' because of not knowing when the coverage was going to be denied yet again.  We currently are living in my inlaws basement.I phoned AFPWCI.  They were willing to help.  Not only did they help, they did it in a timely manner.  They took a personal approach and cared about the outcome of the case.  The denial was overturned.  For now we breath a bit easier, and live with less stress.  I cannot thank them enough for the help they have given us.

After being denied by my insurer two times for a nerve stimulator, the only available treatment for my condition, my husband and I were devastated. One day he found Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness, Inc. and Jennifer Jaff and suddenly she gave us hope. She took my insurance company to task. They received an appeal several inches thick that had been extensively researched. Although we are several states apart, I could not have felt more attended to. When I went in front of the appeal board, Ms. Jaff briefed me thoroughly the night before by phone and then was my council at the appeal by speakerphone.  We were both much better prepared than the appeal board. Unfortunately, we were denied again, so she turned to my employer for a third party review. She called and e-mailed them often to let them know we were still waiting for a decision. After starting medical leave from work due to the pain, I received a call that the third party reviewer overturned the insurance companys decision. Just recently, I was able to call my surgeon to start scheduling surgery. I have not had a day in over three years without constant stabbing head pain. What this organization did will change my life and they asked for nothing in return. I cannot speak highly enough of them.

This is not only due to the increased emotional, financial, and physical costs of having an illness but also because you have to be your own advocate whether you feel up to it or not.Advocacy for Patients with Chronic Illness is a much needed organization and offers vital support in this regard.  I visit the website and subscribe to the e-mail newsletter, which helps me to stay informed about my rights and offers other helpful tips for patients with chronic illnesses.  I've also contacted Jennifer personally with legal questions through e-mail.  She has always responded promptly, even though I know she must be busy.  Her compassion and dedication are evident and inspiring.  Just knowing this organization exists helps me as I deal with the implications of my illness and advocate for myself and others.

Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	214215	5	/users/profile/277465	CaseyTatum	Client Served	1	09/09/2014	A counter-point on these generally positive reviews.  This issue is referenced in the few negative reviews you can find in various places, but I wanted to expound on them a bit and share some personal experiences.  I think the people at Paws mean well.  I think they genuinely care for their animals, and I don't want to suggest otherwise.  I must say, however, that the entire organization is woefully deficient with communication skills and basic human interaction.  Be prepared for the following going forward with any potential adoption:    Expect no feedback once you submit an application.  Expect no communication once it's received - even for over a week.  If you are pro-active (like simply showing up after receiving no acknowledgement ), you will likely be able to get someone to visit with you and perhaps locate your already-submitted application.  You may be able to meet some dogs.  I would budget at least 2 hours at the facility for that to happen.    I would also caution anyone to get attached to any of the animals you may meet.  Go ahead and remain skeptical about being able to adopt any specific one, as it may be scooped up by "previous adopters" before the animal is even formally "eligible for adoption," a status that is apparently common among those kept there.  Also, if you do go the facility and meet with the staff, remain cautious about expecting progress from there.  Do not expect that your references will be called over the next few days or even weeks.  Do not expect any feedback from your initial visit.  Do not expect any further communication as to the next steps in the process, even if you are told that you should "go home, sleep on it, decide if you want [specific animal] and just let us know."  After you have let them know of your interest in a dog, be prepared to sit blindly in some clouded administrative state, for perhaps weeks.  If, again, you remain diligent and send, let's just pick a number, ten emails and make several phone calls over the course of those weeks spent in limbo, you may be able to reach someone who will initiate the process of actually calling your references.  Once again, however, do not assume that having "excellent references" or a "fantastic application" will bring you any closer to adoption.    A very serious caution if you have children - be wary of Paws staff arranging a play meeting between your kids and the dog you have chosen to adopt (weeks ago, by now).  Be very skeptical of positive feedback you have received about your application.  Do not listen to words like "green light" and do not become confident when told that the "final step is ensuring that your children and the dog get along."  Even if told that told your application is excellent, that your references were flawless, and that the you shouldn't worry because the dog you chose to adopt weeks ago "isn't going anywhere," do not be so naive as to think that the final meeting with your children is actually the last step.  In fact, after 30 minutes of watching your kids happily play with the dog you chose, be prepared to be informed that "as I told you on the phone, there is another family with a great application who also wants [specific animal]."  Do not be surprised if, in fact, no one ever told you prior to this "final step" that you were in a heated, down-to-the-wire competition with other adopters.  Please prepare your children for the fact that competitors can rise up against you at apparently any moment in the process.  Do not expect any degree of caution or sympathy from the staff as to your childrens' impressions of this play visit, even if you have explained to them multiple times that just a couple months before, the kids had lost their dog of 10 years (another rescue, by the way).  The competition amongst potential adopters is certainly more important than your kids' emotions.  Do not be surprised when told that home visits among the two now warring families will be scheduled in the next week.  Do not be surprised when there is no follow-up concerning those visits.  Do not be surprised if a week later you receive an email that simply says "we are sorry to inform you that [specific animal] is going to be adopted by [your apparent rivals] but you have an excellent application and we will find another dog for you."  Do not be surprised when emails and phone calls asking for more feedback about the decision go unanswered.  In short, do not be surprised to be at ground zero after a month of effort and never, ever assume you will be adopting until walking out with an animal.  I expect a certain amount of rancor from this review - so I should simply say we are lifetime dog owners and firm believers in adoption.  We are experienced with the process.  This was, let's say, just a bit frustrating.

The dedication of the volunteers and staff at PAWS speaks volumes for the strong commitment to the guiding principles of the organization.  PAWS truly cares about the welfare of all pets, and makes a huge positive impact on Norwalk and its surrounding communities. I've been a volunteer at PAWS for about 15 years, and also a very happy and satisfied customer.

PAWS is an organization of dedicated staff and volunteers that devote their time, energy and love to homeless animals.

Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	142517	1	/users/profile/188995	NotaSocialPerson	Volunteer	4	11/26/2012	I've been a volunteer at PAWS for around eight years.  I assist in fundraising and in caring for and socializing cats.  I find it rewarding to see the changes that caring people can effect in animals that come in for adoption.  The cats may be scared or confused by their new situations, but through the interaction of our small staff and our many dedicated volunteers, they often overcome these problems and are then much more likely to be adopted.  Assisting in fundraisers provides a two-fold benefit to me.  Not only do we raise money or collect donations to help support our population of dogs and cats, but it's a personal pleasure to connect with people in the area who appreciate our efforts.  Some of them tell us that they adopted a pet from PAWS and are happy to lend us a hand.  Others have never heard of PAWS, but when we explain what we do, they generously open their wallets or come out from the grocery store to hand us needed supplies.  They remind me that people are often unexpectedly generous for a good cause.

At PAWS the animals come first,and the humans work very hard to ensure that they are as comfortable as possible. I have been working with the cats and have discovered, among many other things, that cats respond really well to clicker training...which makes the more adoptable and, more importantly, gives them the mental stimulation they all need. The people at PAWS are willing to try anything that will make life better for the animals they care for.

While I could work at a shelter that is literally a five minute walk from my door, I choose to drive the 30 minutes to PAWS because I am so proud of the work they do there. While the shelter in my neighborhood hand-picks pets, mostly from the South, that they deem "adoptable" in this community, PAWS works very hard to take in all area animals in need. They take the strays, the abandoned, the abused. I work with staff members and other volunteers who are dedicated to helping these animals trust in humans again so that they may be placed into forever homes. It is work that is endless, tiring, and sometimes emotionally difficult, but ultimately it is beautiful work that is done there, and I am proud to be a part of it.

When I first started volunteering I, as most of the general population, was leary of pit bulls.  This is mainly due to the negative press they get.  I soon learned that this is so untrue.  They are a wonderful, loving, very smart breed that just want to be your lap dog.  We have our second pit rescue and my husband who was guoted as saying "I'll never have a Pit Bull in my home" has also done a 360 and I know our current pit/bull terrior mix Allie won't be our last.  In addition to being educated there are so many resuce and surrendered dogs that PAWS helps find their forever home.  It's amazing how the dogs seem to know that they are getting a second (and sometimes third, etc) chance and are also looking for their forever homes.  I've also had the opportunity to take some of the dogs to obiedience class and work with them to be more adoptable.  It's amazing how many dogs and cats are mistreated or ignored, it's really sad.  I've also had the pleasure of helping place two cats with my friends/co-workers.  It's truly so rewarding when you see a dog/cat come in "broken" and then get placed into a loving home.  It's one of the best things I've every experienced and done.  PAWS is truly remarkable and not only help those that come in but also other less fortunate animals not only in our community but surrounding as well as SATO (Puerto Rico).
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	141546		/users/profile/187899	luckycheeky	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	PAWS is vital to the community!  They care for hundreds of unwanted, abandoned, neglected and 'throw-away' animals on a daily basis and find them loving fur-ever homes of their own so that they may have a new 'leash' on life that they all so deserve!  They give these sweet animals -- who are victims of whatever situation they came out of -- the love & attention they need and often have never had, INCLUDING medical attention.  They tirelessly raise money to cover their costs, regularly host events and partner with neighboring businesses to increase awareness of PAWS & of the need to adopt from shelters. appear on local cable shows to let the public see the sweet animals in their care, etc.  They do anything & everything they can to help Fairfield County one day have 'no more homess pets' and they do it with so much love, care, and compassion for our 4 (and sometimes less-than-4) legged friends!  
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	141536		/users/profile/187887	jrmcgarry	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	PAWS is an extremeley caring no-kill shelter for dogs and cats looking for their forever homes.  PAWS evaluates their medical and behavior needs and provides the care and training needed, for as long as needed, until their new homes are found.  I have volunteered with the dogs since 2001 and will continue to do so.
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	141507		/users/profile/187845	NinaDi	Client Served	5	11/20/2012	Nine years ago, I visited paws to adopt 2 kittens.  We had recently lost our 17 year old cat and 11 year old bunny.  The house was just too quiet with a 10 year old cat and 8 year old dog.  After meeting the available kittens, the decision came down to a litter of 4 new arrivals.  They all had different coloring's, a black & white tuxedo, an orange tabby, a grey and tan and a white, grey and tan tabby.  I have had cats all my life, but I had never had any of these color kitties.  The decision of which ones to adopt was very difficult.  It was getting close to closing time yet the staff at PAWS did not push me into making a hurried decision.  They let me linger and play with the kittens while they went about preparing to close for the day.  After much deliberation and the wonderful staff at PAWS, I decided to take all 4 kittens!  I just couldn't split them up.  Nine years later they are now the only pets in the house and still give us so much joy!  I have been back to PAWS several times with friends looking to adopt pets.  They are such wonderful people and do a great public service for our community and four legged friends.
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	141497		/users/profile/187832	Lauren40	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	I always thought I couldn't volunteer at a shelter because it would be too depressing. It has been almost a year since I started volunteering at PAWS and I don't know why I waited so long!! This organization is filled with people who truly love each and every animal as if they were our own. So many people work tirelessly to make sure these animals are as happy and healthy as they can be until they find their forever home. There is nothing more rewarding than to see a wonderful animal being adopted and PAWS truly makes a difference in so many lives. I am proud to be a part of this organization and look forward to volunteering for many years to come.
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	141492		/users/profile/187825	nadr75	Volunteer	5	11/20/2012	I'm truly honored to be a part of Paws. I love volunteering there. The staff is amazing and so dedicated to their cats and dogs. The animals are receiving the best care  and I always look forward spending my time there and to help. I just LOVE it!!!!!!!
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	141383		/users/profile/187683	DaleR	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	PAWS is a bare-bones, no-kill organization filled with truly dedicated people (mostly volunteers) who care deeply about the dogs and cats that they rescue and find forever homes for. I volunteered for PAWS about 3 years ago and try to help with special events when I can. I also found my best friend there (a min-pin/chihuahua mix named Brian).  They make every penny count and it's a place that I will continue to support.
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	141368		/users/profile/187668	aemadden148	Volunteer	5	11/19/2012	I have been with Paws since 2005. It is a true haven for the animals that are blessed to walk through the doors. Utmost care,love and attention is given to every animal that enters. All animals are given the best medical care and are spayed/neutered before leaving. Animals are exercise and have daily interaction with multiple people. Every animal is safe until they are adopted. 
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	130706		/users/profile/176199	alexis.heydt	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	I have been a volunteer and Board member for more than 10 years and have seen the organization grow from working out of a small space in a local vet hospital to one that now owns it's own building and helps almost 500 animals a year. The animals are well cared for and treated with compassion and respect. Everyone from the Board of Directors to the staff and the many volunteers has a passion for helping pets that makes me proud to be a part of this group. I have also adopted several pets from PAWS and each of those pets has made my life better!
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	130533		/users/profile/176005	Maria52	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	I had been a monetary support of PAWS for many years, but was afraid to volunteer because I thought it would be too sad (I am a crazy animal lover!)  However, almost three years ago I overcame my misgivings and became a volunteer, working at the front desk on weekends and volunteering with the kitties during the week.  What I found out is that PAWS is not a sad place at all!  From every member of the paid staff to every volunteer, there is nothing but love, care and concern for each and every animal.  PAWS is a true no-kill shelter, which means that no animal is ever put down unless it is suffering and beyond medical help.  I am so proud to be a member of the volunteer corps at PAWS, and encourage anyone in our geographic area to check us out.  Adopting an animal shows a special kind of love, and by adopting from PAWS you not only give a shelter animal a home, but you also allow us to take in another animal.  Remember:   DON'T SHOP, ADOPT!!
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	130426		/users/profile/175903	Ilona B.	Board Member	5	10/28/2012	I have been with Paws for 16 years as a volunteer and on the Board of Directors for many of those as well.  I have always known I had a love of animals and when I was introduced to Paws I was so impressed with their commitment to the pets in their care.  Paws does its very best to find the best new home for each and every animal that comes our way.  I have volunteered in many aspects of shelter life to educate myself about the needs of animal welfare.  As an adoption counselor, dog walker and cat socializer I get all the warm and fuzzies spending time with animals and with people who would like to adopt.  In volunteering at our front desk, helping with medical care, fundraising, trapping feral cats, visiting animal control and dealing with day-to-day issues I got to see the harder parts of shelter life where one struggles with ensuring there are enough funds to care for the animals. listen to countless people give reasons they need to relinquish their pets, staff and volunteer issues and people asking why we cannot always help.  It has been a very rewarding experience volunteering with Paws and I hope to always remain involved in some way as the act of volunteerism gives me so much and, I hope, in some way helps others.
Pet Animal Welfare Society of Connecticut (PAWS)	130374		/users/profile/175847	pibble	Volunteer	5	10/28/2012	I started volunteering at PAWS over 8 years ago, walking dogs and doing adoption counseling. I've been hooked ever since.  PAWS is a true no-kill shelter and will never euthanize an animal to make space for new ones. They care for an animal until it finds a loving home - even if it takes years. They also take in cases that other shelters will turn away - that means a lot to me. These poor animals need somewhere to go when they're ill, neglected, abused - PAWS is often that place where they can begin a new life.  I'm also so impressed by the staff and volunteers who work with and train every dog who comes through the doors. And, when a dog (or cat) is adopted, PAWS is still there as an on-going resource. Their care doesn't stop once the adoption papers are signed. Whether you need training tips, advice with litterbox issues, information on a new diet, if you call, they will help! This is the kind of shelter I want to be associated with!
Erectile Dysfunction Foundation	159810	2	/users/profile/211992	Steven1111	Client Served	5	06/06/2013	As Gay man I had certain trepidations about FrankTalk when i first encountered it. But that fear was completely eased by the generous nature of the men who post the most intimate details of their struggles with ED and related issues. Guys are willing to be totally honest about things that they normally wouldn't ever talk about with other men and it's very refreshing as well as very informative. i found it about 3 months ago after years of struggling with Prostate Cancer and subsequent ED and now have gotten my implant and am very happy with how it's healing up. I credit FT with giving me the support and information I needed to go thru with this operation. It's a great organization and i encourage all men with ED to check it out, whether you're straight or gay, it doesn't matter when you have ED. We're all the same in many ways and FT encourages this interaction. A wonderful place to learn and share and just be a part of it all. Thanks to Paul and the rest of the gang who make this possible. 5 stars!!
Erectile Dysfunction Foundation	152923	3	/users/profile/203800	david.g.edson	Client Served	5	04/06/2013	I suffered with e d for many years, since my teens.  Finally arrived at the decision point to go for a surgical solution that has a very high success rate and some risks, or stay with other methods that were not working all that well for me.  That is where this site came to the rescue, literally.  My doctor had all the medical information, but none of the practical stuff.  Will I lose length?  Will I lose sensitivity?  Is it going to bother me or my wife if my glans no longer swell?  I had so many questions and fears.  2 guys in particular who had recently received implants had the patience to calm me down and reassure me it was going to be fine.  I can never thank Keith and Scot enough for their support.  Now it's my turn.  I want to help as many guys as I can in this journey, just not to the implant, but along the many paths I am familiar with, the shots, the pills, the pumps, all things I have experienced.  When a guy joins here, he joins a fraternity of guys who will always have his back and support him in any way possible.  True friends, my FrankTalk buddies.

Having dealt with erectile dysfunction due to prostate cancer i can only say that it has helped me so much.

Erectile Dysfunction Foundation	144107	2	/users/profile/190606	Ohohia Kane	Volunteer	5	11/29/2012	In December, 2008 at age 70, I had emergency surgery for AAA (Abdominal AorticAneurysm) which left me quite weak, and took many months to recover. Eventually I gotback to being reasonably normal, except for urological problems. Testicle became infected(likely due to catheterization) and was successfully treated with anti-biotics after a coupleweeks.  Then blood in the ejaculate, and finally retrograde ejaculation. My urologist did acystoscopy to try to determine these causes. He could not definetely attribute theseailments to anything except the surgery. All this added up to a more extreme erectiledysfunction (I was taking cialis prior to the surgery).  I felt miserable. Urologist suggested that perhaps a vacuum erection device may help mysituation, and failing that, injections of trimix, and even if that failed, then penile implantsmau be the only other option if I wanted a sex life. OF COURSE I WANTED A SEXLIFE !!!  I also wanted to to talk it over with someone... someone who had traveled thesame road I was on... but who ?  I didnt know if any of my friends or relatives had E.D.problems and I sure wasnt going to inquire. I needed to hear from men... honest men whocould at least help me know what my future would be like.  I do not ever remember how I found Frank Talk, but probably searched Google for someanswers. Paul, the founder and administrator of Frank Talk welcomed me warmly, lettingme know I was in a friendly place.  Finally I was able to talk openly, with noembarassment and partake of discussions that really meant something to my own case.This was group therapy but anonymous participation... all of my questions were addressedby guys who had been there .  Honest, straight forward discussions that were impossiblefor me to have anywhere else. Two years later, I am happy to say that my sex life has returned using Trimix injections,and now it is me who offers suggestions, encouragement and well wishes to those whoseek the comfort of sincere, helpfull conversations with men who can understand whatE.D. is really like. Bill

Erectile Dysfunction Foundation	127468	1	/users/profile/172526	hogbody	Client Served	5	10/20/2012	The world of men with Erectile Dysfunction is a silent one.  As hesitant as men may be about discussing medical problems in general, dicussing one's man-parts can be extraordinarily difficlut.  Finding the ED Foundation sponsored website and "meeting" men from all over the country who are dealing with the same challenges has been an amazingly uplifting (no pun intended) experience.  Knowing you are not alone--that there are plenty of guys out there dealing with the same physical problems and the same emotional ramifications of of those problems is reassuring on so many levels.  Beyond that, the wealth of information available from such a peer group has proven to be invaluable.  Even my doctor has been impressed with what an informed patient I have become.  I have also availed myself of the opportunity to meet some of the guys in person and have developed seme incredible new friends in the process.  What a great work this foundation is doing!

Erectile Dysfunction Foundation	124822	1	/users/profile/169867	Richard35	General Member of the Public	5	10/08/2012	FRANK TALK removes the barrier many men feel about certain personal medical matters. The barrier is invisible and yet intense and is known as denial. However, once someone is willing to listen in a non-judgmental manner barriers fall down and men often for the first time in their lives begin to share about themselves including ED, various treatments and medication, successes and disappointments. Men learn  to express how they feel and sometimes unlearn information acquired in childhood. In short men through Frank Talk receive support and give support...very much a win/win situation.

US Painfoundation	189885	1	/users/profile/247925	totalresultsinc	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/04/2013	Having put several alcohol and drug programs together it is not unusual for the underlying issue to be  their pain specialist not treating pain, especially chronic intractable pain, as the physicians should. By the time I see and assess the person they often have legal charges related to their being "forced to by pain medication off the street". This is something that we already have an answer to and the US Pain Foundation promotes that daily.  The US Pain Foundation helps more people than many realize. I fully support their fundraising and non-profit status. S

I personally know several people with chronic pain and know of their struggles and battles with this horrible condition. Their suffering and depression can be unbearable. The USPainFoundation brings not only awareness to these silent warriors but a sense of hope and  community to those suffering with pain. They realize they are not the only ones with these conditions and they are able to learn and relate through others' stories and also learn of alternative coping and healing mechanisms. This organization can be very powerful and needs more recognition and exposure.

My pain experiences started during my early teen years.  I was looking for a way to give back to the community and be able to help others with their pain experience as well as meet others going through similar experiences.  I have gained so much from the organization.  The materials they have to help us in the pain community are very valuable.  When I contacted htm I didn't expect much other then a referral to disease specific groups that I already was dealing with but the generalized referrals and materials helped me more then I thought they ever would.

US Painfoundation	188391	1	/users/profile/245806	jgsvch	Volunteer	5	11/12/2013	My pain ride started 31 years ago when I was still residing in the England, it all began with an innocuous injury to my right ring finger when playing water Polo. After some 16 surgeries as well as many other painful attempts to reduce the pain I was told that I had RSD/CRPS and would have to live the rest of my life in pain. As a result of the cold damp weather in England my family and I emigrated to the United States in 1991. Having lived in Florida for the first 14 years in the US we then moved to Pennsylvania for a job that was promised to be just a desk job for myself as we had already established that operating machinery of any kind aggravated my RSD. Unfortunately, the promise that we were made did not materialize and I was effectively forced to operate machinery which resulted in aggravating the RSD.I became aware of US pain foundation after reading the exceptional book by Nicole Hemmenway titled "No it is not in my head". After my initial contact with Paul Gileno my wife and I were invited to the launch of the invisible project where we met Nicole and after visiting other support groups I was at last impressed by the candor and integrity of both Paul and Nicole. Instead of the usual moaning and groaning the US pain foundation was a breath of fresh air because they embraced the notion that pain was invisible and that we must work together to bring in to the public domain the fact that pain and people suffering from it is very real.I cannot stress sufficiently how impressed I have been with the US pain foundation and with Nicole and Paul's vision of bringing pain from obscurity into the public domain. They understand that those of us who suffer in silence must work with each other not for sympathy but for empathy and that we must become very real so as to increase the ability of researchers to find cures.Finally, there is an organization run by people who suffer and understand the very realities of living with pain but are working to help those of us who also live with pain 24/7 as well as mobilizing the pain community to help ourselves by becoming lobbyists both at state and federal levels.The US pain foundation has breathed a new life into me and I believe they do so for many other pain sufferers. I hope that I am able to assist others as well as the foundation and particularly Paul and Nicole who are extraordinary people. They have developed a charitable organization from absolutely nothing into an amazing organization and have hired others in pain who are also extremely helpful and well organized individuals and I appreciate every single person associated with the organization.

I saw what this project meant to me and to those who saw the finished project and was amazed. I love that the Foundation was started and is run by people who have chronic pain themselves. It makes them so compassionate and understanding of everything that those of us with chronic pain suffer with. Seeing what US Pain is capable of is truly amazing and I've seen it most prominently through their events is truly amazing. Their willingness to reach out to individuals in need is unparalleled and unmatched by any other Foundation I have seen, they are one of a kind and I am proud to be a part of it. Paul Gileno, the founder and president, is a very honest, kind, and hard-working man.

I am a long time chronic pain sufferer and this has helped me to get the word out and educate fellow sufferers and educate others to the work this organization is doing.  I have been taking baby steps with them, mostly because of my ongoing pain, but I look forward to getting the word out more on this worthwhile non-profit  organization .  Thank you.
US Painfoundation	188279	1	/users/profile/245610	debbiekanner	Volunteer	5	11/10/2013	As someone who has spent the past seven years dealing with the myriad implications that come with CRPS/RSD, as well as 25+ years of severe, chronic back problems, I have only recently begun to draw on the amazing resources that U.S. Pain Foundation provides. I've felt so inspired by all they do, that I've become a Pain Ambassador.  It feels wonderful to know that there is a community of people out there who understand what I am going through on a daily basis, especially being a mother of two young children. I also find the information that is available with respect to medical and professional resources, to be invaluable. I am excited to become more involved, and to give back to an organization that is so worthwhile, and that is so desperately needed in these times!
US Painfoundation	188224	1	/users/profile/245537	Lynn67	Volunteer	5	11/09/2013	I am a chronic pain patient, so I struggle with physical issues, which can lead to depression.  One of the most helpful things I've found is group support, and the US Pain Foundation provides that community.  Here is an entire group of people who understand what I go through, every day, just to function.  I became an "ambassador" for them, because I want to let everyone struggling with pain know that they are NEVER ALONE.
US Painfoundation	188142	1	/users/profile/245410	Nanny04	Volunteer	5	11/08/2013	I have been volunteering for US Pain for many years. It all started when I had a life changing accident and began experiencing severe, chronic pain on a daily basis. I fell down a flight of stairs and ruptured several disks in my back, tore my rotator cuff, and broke my wrist and elbow. I went through three spine surgeries, rotator cuff surgery, and a couple of other surgeries. My injuries were healed, but my severe pain did not go away. I developed something called Complex Regional pain syndrome. It causes severe, burning pain 24 hours a day. I also have Fibromyalgia and Lupus. I was no longer able to work or participate in many of the activities that I loved so much. There were no local support groups in my area, so I began looking online for some support. I joined a yahoo chat group which was very popular at the time. Paul Gileno was also participating in the yahoo group. Paul was in the process of transitioning his state wide support group into a national support group. I was excited to jump on board and do whatever I could do to help. US Pain Foundation is a national support group for people in Chronic Pain. The Volunteers for US Pain are people that are suffering with Chronic pain themselves. US pain works hard to do whatever they can do to make life better for everyone suffering from Chronic Pain. I don't know what I would have done without this group. I was able to meet people that understood what I was going through and helped walk me through it. Thank you US Pain for all you do to help those in Chronic pain.
US Painfoundation	188126	1	/users/profile/245389	Terri34	Volunteer	5	11/08/2013	I am a new Ambassador for the US Pain Foundation and a long-time chronic pain sufferer.This foundation is an amazing resource for those of us in chronic pain and I am so excited to raise awareness of chronic pain, be an advocate and be associated with this group!They have a wealth of information I can use to help others personally and by working with our policy makers to effect change in favor of chronic pain patients.
US Painfoundation	188119	2	/users/profile/245382	Equinlan	General Member of the Public	5	11/08/2013	I am consistently impressed by US Pain Foundation. Although I do not personally suffer from chronic pain, I am personally affected by very close friends who do. US Pain Foundation is a resource of knowledge, a safe haven to relate to others suffering too, and that extra boost of love, care and support to help you get through the toughest times. Words cannot accurately describe or justify how grateful I am for US Pain Foundation. 
US Painfoundation	188113	1	/users/profile/245369	Aimee7	Client Served	5	11/08/2013	The US Pain Foundation is an amazing non profit group.  I was diagnosed with 2 different neurological conditions , one in 1995 after being stopped at a red light and being rear ended by a drunk driver who drove right through my trunk.  All my life I had been a professional actress/ dancer/ singer and wound up with a hideously painful condition called RSD or CRPS.  The other is Dystonia which causes severe uncontrollable muscle spasm.  The US pain Foundation has been AS IMPORTANT to me as any other part of my treatment for these conditions that have no known cause nor cure at this point.  I would no sooner stop going to their website than I would stop seeing my doctors or seeing my therapist.  The support from other members in the same condition I am in, who KNOW... Really know what I am going though is more important than I can ever say!  I cried when I first spoke to someone with RSD that said I know how you feel!  I didn't have to explain all the terribly hard things an RSD patient  goes through silently and most of the time invisibly ( to the rest of the world ) every single day.  The trying times with our families, the painful treatments that we will go through... And the Pain foundation is there to oversee everything and help us all!  Like I said, AS important to me as my doctor !  Sometimes maybe even more !

Their dedication to effecting change through multimedia, public policy, and community events is a model that every patient-focused non-profit should follow.  
US Painfoundation	188025	2	/users/profile/245261	Joselynn B.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2013	The US Pain Foundation is here to help the nearly 100 million Anericanas who live with and suffer from chronic pain of all forms, whether from an accident or illness. The Foundation offers hope and helps to empower the person who's suffering from chronic pain. Being a volunteer, I've been able to help from my home. Just a simple phone call has made a difference in the lives of not only the sufferer, but also the family. After I talked with, in both instances the caregiver, I felt like I not only helped each fAmily, but I felt as if I helped myself. The US Pain Foundation, offers support for both the individual and their family. They have a lot of resource material available, including many websites. After I joined the Foundation, I became an Ambassador for them. I can go out into the community, to health fairs or simply set up a table at a hospital or clinic and have pamphlets, brochures and other material available. I also share my story of what it's like living with chronic pain. Even though I am an Ambassador for the US Pain foundation, many times the foundation and other US Pain Foundation Ambassador have helped me. The US Pain Foundation is a wonderful volunteer organization. I'm proud and honored to be a part of this foundation.
US Painfoundation	188024	2	/users/profile/245259	colleenpasha	Client Served	5	11/07/2013	I have had RSD/CRPS, the most painful condition known to medicine, for over 4 years.  There is no cure for this syndrome and there are very few effective treatments. The US Pain Foundation has been a source of extremely important information and support to me in my struggle to deal with this condition. They offer important scientific and regulatory information daily via Facebook, help us understand the changes in regulations that affect our care, and they provide us with a voice in speaking out for patients who cannot always effectively protect their own interests. Since many pain patients have "invisible" symptoms, they have the additional problem of not always being believed. The US Pain Foundation understands all of the problems that are unique to pain patients and they are an invaluable source of support in understanding and addressing the difficulties we face. Recently, I've been depending on them even more with the potential changes in legislation regarding some of the few medications that make my life worth living. I cannot express how important this organization is for me, knowing that they will do whatever is necessary to try to protect my interests, and those of all the people like me, who have a fragile existence that can be shattered by lawmakers, lawyers and even doctors who do not believe in our symptoms or in the importance of pallative care.  Thank you, Paul Gileno, for the work that you have done for all of us. Thank you for supporting our heroes, like our dearest Kaitlyn Pintor and Nicole Hemmenway! Great job, please know we appreciate all that you do!
US Painfoundation	188023	3	/users/profile/245258	ddwilliams	Donor	5	11/07/2013	The U.S. Pain Foundation brings understanding and hope to the nearly 100 million Americans who deal with pain.  My husband and I recently attended an event to launch the INvisible project, which honors and acknowledges though living with pain everyday through photos and stories.  We were so touched by the experience and learned so much in one evening.  I encourage those who have an opportunity to see the exhibit and support this organization. The Director of the INvisible Project Nicole Hemmenway stated in her opening remarks that "pain is an invisible disease." I believe that that the U.S. Pain Foundation and the  INvisible project educates those who might not be aware of this disease and makes its VISIBLE!  
US Painfoundation	188020	2	/users/profile/245249	adreyer	General Member of the Public	5	11/07/2013	US Pain is a tremendous organization and my experience with both their founder (Paul) and their director (Nicole) have been compelling and educational.  The time, care and energy they both put forth into this important cause is awesome.  I have also been fortunate enough to meet with members of the community that they advocate for and attend their educational events.  The people and families that chronic pain impacts are much greater in number and severity than I ever realized.  US Pain gives this group a voice and works tirelessly on their behalf.
US Painfoundation	188011	2	/users/profile/245233	Shaina927	Board Member	5	11/07/2013	The inception of this non-profit organization started with a few, simple goals in mind: to be one of the leading sources of information pertaining to pain, empowering, educating and raising awareness and changing existing policies within the United States for the betterment of the over 100 million Americans who suffer chronic pain.  I found US Pain Foundation after the birth of my now 3 1/2-year-old son. I felt alone, isolated and without hope that a diagnoses would be found. Coming from a family where high blood pressure is common and overall pain of the entire body is not, compassion and understanding was difficult to come by. Not that my family did not love me, but the general concept of what I dealt and deal with on a daily basis was difficult for many to grasp. My mother-in-law had introduced me to the organization, and within one month I was a Pain Ambassador for Connecticut. I immediately saw US Pain Foundation as a support network, an outlet and a resource for me to use prior to, during and following doctor's appointments. Having a purpose to make the rest of my community aware of the alarming number of those who live silently with invisible or visible pain is indescribable. I was lucky to have been asked if I would be interested in taking on a new role with US Pain as its Director of Ambassadors. We have so many active volunteers who have a genuine interest in educating and empowering residents across the nation. This program allows individuals the chance I had, which is to feel like a contributing member once again. We advocate, reach out to those in need, orchestrate pain awareness events, research support groups and support one another in a variety of ways. Although we believe pain awareness should be recognized every day of the year, September is Pain Awareness Month. Our Ambassadors, members and volunteers participated in a 30-day challenge, an activity that kept everyone motivated while bringing to light the stigmas associated with pain. It was a fun way for all to raise awareness. I often wonder where I would be without a close-knit organization like US Pain. Its immediate support was beneficial during the onset of my chronic pain and has been a resourceful tool during my pain journey. I encourage anyone who has chronic pain to visit the US Pain Foundation's website, reach out to one of our many programs available, consider advocating or joining our Ambassador Program and sharing your pain story with us today! 
US Painfoundation	188008	4	/users/profile/245226	Nicole83	Board Member	5	11/07/2013	U.S. Pain Foundation is a national non-profit dedicated to serving the 100 million Americans living with pain and chronic medical conditions. Created by people with pain for people with pain, the organization exists to help individuals find resources and inspiration. While advocating for patient rights and access to proper care, it is the goal of U.S. Pain to make sure those living with pain become proactive and feel validated.  I serve as the director for one of U.S. Pain Foundations programs, the INvisible Project. This national campaign uses photography and story to illustrate the struggles of those living with pain and chronic medical conditions.  The INvisible Project makes the challenges that are oftentimes hidden, ignored or misunderstood become tangible and real ... while additionally highlighting the personal strength, character and courage of the entire pain community. It shows the depths of physical and emotional angst as it magnifies perseverance, hope and resilience.  Since its inception in the fall of 2010, the project has been viewed hundreds of times in over twenty states at various medical conferences, state capitals and U.S. Pain-sponsored events. In January 2012, we even had the opportunity to address the California State Assembly. This campaign is shifting perceptions regarding pain disorders. It is now being used as an educational tool for legislatures to change laws, for doctors to better treat patients, for patients to connect with others and gain validation. In essence, the INvisible Project has become the positive dialogue which society needed to understand pain.  I feel privileged to share stories of adversity, suffering, perseverance and hope with the world. Christopher Reeve once said, A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles. Well, I believe the INvisible Project highlights the heroes among us  it is showing the world what it truly means to live day-in and day-out with unrelenting pain. Every participant has faced obstacles, and yet, refuses to let pain define their lives. That is undeniably powerful and commendable.  Furthermore, I applaud U.S. Pain Foundation for making sure the patient voice, our voice, is heard and recognized.

CentsofRelief	44981	7	/users/profile/45885	jpatel181	Volunteer	5	06/22/2010	Cents of Relief is a wonderful organization which aims to help women and children who are trafficked or at risk of trafficking.  I enjoy working with Cents of Relief as I know they are dedicated to the cause to help change lives and end trafficking.  Cents of Relief is very open to suggestions from volunteers and this is what I love about the organization.  They listen to what their volunteers think can make a change and help get these ideas implemented.  I recently assisted them in proofing the hindi version of the Burn Comic's first edition.  I have also participated in raising funds as well as awareness.
CentsofRelief	44083	6	/users/profile/45003	amena81	Volunteer	5	06/16/2010	Cents of Relief is a great non profit organization that provides tremendous relief to woman who have been subjected to prostitution and trafficking.  Assistance is available through prevention programs, healthcare and education.  The growing numbers in human trafficking is appalling, thus, the programs offered by COR are vital.  I have had the honor to assist COR by creating their new websites relaunch cards.  The organization does a significant job in keeping the public informed through their website and other social media networks about critical information related to human trafficking.  They provide individuals with the opportunity to make a difference through various outlets.  Lack of education and proper healthcare is the downfall of vast populations in third world countries, and Cents of Relief does a great part in helping alleviate this critical issue.

CentsofRelief	43682	6	/users/profile/44573	favad	Volunteer	5	06/11/2010	I am so glad to have cross paths with Cents of Relief. Cents of Relief provides a communication channel that allows for such easy access of information and updates. From tackling social media, to arranging energetic fundraisers, they have done a wonderful job of reminding us of our social responsibilities while involving us hands on.
CentsofRelief	43681	9	/users/profile/44572	thaakat-foundation	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2010	I came across Cents of Relief via a friend who knew Rina. Over the last few months, I have been following the cause and it warms my heart to see all of the progress the team is making on so many levels of relief. From assisting burn victims, to distributing safety comics and launching innovative fundraising programs- I feel this is a charity that I can relate to as someone with the youthful energy to make a difference.Helping Cents of Relief goes beyond just the piece of mind of helping charity, it helps you make a real impact.
CentsofRelief	43615	6	/users/profile/44487	anjali1	Volunteer	5	06/10/2010	Although I have been affiliated with COR since 2004, last summer, I collaborated with COR to create an educational comic book (about Burn safety) for kids in the red light areas of India as well as for kids right here in the US. Through the concerted effort of many people, the comic book was a wild success! I LOVE volunteering with COR and I plan to get even more involved with this organization in the very near future.
CentsofRelief	43512	8	/users/profile/44381	madisonatyale	Volunteer	5	06/10/2010	Through Cents of Relief, I have been working in Kalighat, Kolkata (Calcutta) at a center that provides health, education and vocational training for women and children in Kalighat (the oldest red light district in Kolkata). Cents of Relief provides funds and support that provide a tremendous amount of support and compassion for women in prostitution. Despite the large number of women and children in need in the area, there are very few resources to assist them or help them find a path out of sex work and extreme poverty. Cents of Relief's staff and volunteers (and the programs they run) truly provide necessary services where there are few or none.
CentsofRelief	43257	6	/users/profile/44068	indranil	Volunteer	5	06/08/2010	It has been a pleasure to work with Rina and Anup.  Cents of Relief has expanded it's scope to include  healthcare to burn victims in South Asia.  With Cents of Relief and Operation Smile backing, we were able to perform approximately 50 reconstructive operations on burn victims.  Ultimately, it may be possible to extend this coverage to other developing nations.  Lastly, preventative health measures, such as introducing a comic book to teach children about safety, has been implemented with great success.  Cents of Relief has come very far in a short period of time.
CentsofRelief	43186	10	/users/profile/43987	nishant1	Donor	5	06/07/2010	I have been involved with Cents of Relief since 2003 when Anup and Rina started with small fundraisers to support their projects.  I am aware of the organizations true dedication to improving the health and lives of women and children in the red-light areas of india.  Most recently, Cents of Relief created a Burn Comic book to help teach children in India about burn prevention.  This comic was distributed in Mumbai schools with great success!  The story of Lalit playing with fireworks is such a great way to help children understand how to keep themselves safe!
CentsofRelief	39801	6	/users/profile/40761	ang15	Former Volunteer	5	05/21/2010	My goal for the health and hygiene program developed in the winter of 2006 was to enhance the quality of life for the red-light and slum children of Kolkata, India.  These communities are at a high risk of HIV/AIDS and other hygiene related diseases.  Since the basic hygiene knowledge is lacking, the eight-week program was designed to improve the overall health and well-being of the children. The program focused on educating the children about proper personal hygienic care and incorporating physical fitness into their everyday lives. The progress of the hygiene aspect of the class was gauged by visual improvements, both of the childrens overall cleanliness and progress charts regarding hand washing and dental care.  The childrens better health was apparent since the children suffered less colds and runny noses towards weeks four through eight of the program.  I assessed their physical fitness progress by using segments of the United States Presidential Physical Fitness Award criteria.
CentsofRelief	39683	9	/users/profile/40648	bijal	Volunteer	5	05/20/2010	I have helped with this organization since it's inception in 2003 and they have an amazing cause that is just starting to get media attention - sex slaves and the children affected by the trafficking. Personally, this cause demands so much attention, it is just hard to conceive this happens in 2010. But it does, and people like Cents of Relief are out there to help educate the women, children, and even men who use these services of the health-related issues and psycho-socio damage caused to the people trapped within this horrific cycle.
CentsofRelief	39218	6	/users/profile/40175	anupcor	General Member of the Public	5	05/17/2010	I have met with the people involved in trying to make a difference with this organization and it is very clear that they all have a high level of passion to make a difference.  They do fundraisers and try to raise awareness in such a personalized way.  I hope they can gain the support they need to expand.
CentsofRelief	38774	7	/users/profile/39672	cg	Board Member	5	05/13/2010	My experience with Cents of Relief has been AMAZING!  Rina and Anup are highly committed to the cause, and take care to ensure that all programs greatly benefit the women and children.  I can say with confidence that Cents of Relief has made a lifelong impact on many women and children in need!!  They have gained an identity and self confidence - while learning basic hygiene skills, computer and English language training - many things that children in the U.S. wouldn't have to think twice about.  The new burn victim program has great partners and is a very promising endeavor.
CentsofRelief	38663	5	/users/profile/39552	apd8	Volunteer	5	05/12/2010	Cents of Relief is dedicated to the women and children who are trapped in the red light districts of India.  Not only do they see potential in these women and children who have been victimized, trafficked and abused, but they work hard to link them with appropriate resources, support, and opportunities. Cents of Relief is working on creative initiatives that will have a positive, meaningful impact for many women:~Anup is linking burn victims with plastic surgeons in the hopes that they will be able to regain a sense of normalcy in their daily lives after surgery (for example, simply putting on their own sari).  ~Rina is spearheading a new program where women are given work outside the red light district, sewing ties out of old sari fabric.  These beautiful ties will then be sold in shops and boutiques.  ~you can always look at their website of facebook page for more accurate & timely info
CentsofRelief	38622	5	/users/profile/39505	elhutchison	Board Member	5	05/11/2010	What makes Cents of Relief such an incredible non-profit organization is its unrelenting commitment to a women's issue that typically does not receive the mainstream media attention it truly warrants.  Furthermore, the programs and services it provides serve as invaluable stepping stones towards creating more productive and impactful lives for the women and children caught within the vicious web of human trafficking.  Finally, this organization is a shining example of the incredible and lasting impact that seemingly ordinary people can have when they are truly dedicated to their cause.
CentsofRelief	38621	3	/users/profile/39504	nupur1	General Member of the Public	5	05/11/2010	Went to a fundraising event in the spring and saw that everyone involved is really trying to make a difference and is genuinely interested in halping the children in India.

The Board and volunteers are the most amazing people you have ever met - they have worked tirelessly since 2003 to provide education, access to health care, and lifesaving information on health awareness.
CentsofRelief	38604	6	/users/profile/39487	uzma82	Donor	5	05/11/2010	I have donated to this cause for over 6 years and witnessed it develop into an incredible organization aimed at women and children who are sold into sex trafficking/human slavery. Cents of Relief has made a tremendous impact on women and their children by constantly providing assistance programs in India. I have seen this organization's work firsthand as they provide constant updates about their ongoing projects. The project that heavily impressed me this year was the work they did for burn awareness. Cents of Relief created a burn comic that they distributed to individuals in the red-light areas. The clear illustrations and language has helped so many children cater to the burn wounds appropriately. I look forward to translating the burn comic into Urdu so that it can distributed more widely. This organization will continue to have my support as it helps so many women that cannot help themselves.
CentsofRelief	38602	5	/users/profile/39485	shelleylrodgers	Volunteer	5	05/11/2010	Cents of Relief is a wonderful organization which focuses on providing educational opportunities, improving healthcare and preventing human trafficking of women and children in the red light districts of India. In my personal experience as an e-mentor with Cents of Relief, the programs are very successful and effective. I enjoyed receiving my weekly emails from my buddy as well as sending her stories of my life. Cents of Relief is an amazing organization!
CentsofRelief	38598	6	/users/profile/39474	centsofrelief	Board Member	5	05/11/2010	I co-founded Cents of Relief in June 2003 while at the University of Florida.  Anup Patel, a friend at the time, was in India working with children infected by HIV/AIDS for the summer.  We exchanged emails about his experiences and were wondering what more we could do.  Together we created programs that Anup could deliver to the children during the summer.  Upon his return we wanted to do more and began to do fundraisers.  We used the money we raised to work with other non-profits in delivering the health awareness workshops we created and decided to form Cents of Relief to help on a larger scale.  Anup and I are dedicated to Cents of Relief for life to help ensure that all women and children of the world can be safe from human trafficking and slavery!
Coram Deo Inc	318854		/users/profile/410137	JessAmenta89	Client Served	5	11/14/2016	My name is Jessica Amenta, I am an alcoholic and an addict. I have been battling this disease for the past 11 years. The longest time I have had sober was 14 months back in 2010, while I was in Coram Deo for the first time. The staff was so welcoming and friendly. It was the first time I have truly fit in. I felt like I finally belonged somewhere. All of the staff, especially Jody and Theresa, treated me with respect, didn't judge me, and were always there to help me. They gave us transportation to meetings, church, the food pantry, and to appointments. I spent Christmas there and they threw an amazing Christmas party for us. I ended up relapsing but only after I left Coram Deo when I should have stayed. Now it is November 2016 and I have returned to Coram Deo. I have 114 days sober and hope to be sober for the rest of my life. Jody welcomed me back with open arms. She texts me everyday to see how I am doing and if I need anything. She is also my Case Manager and motivates me to achieve my goals. I would recommend Coram Deo to family, friends, and anyone else that needs a sober and safe place to live. The houses are nice and so are the girls who live here. Coram Deo put a roof over my head and saved my life. I am forever grateful to this organization.

I have been at Coram Deo twice before and had significant clean time as a result. The reason i return is because it is a safe sober place to be. The staff genuinely care about me and how I am doing. Even when I am not here they contact me regularly to check on me and stay in touch.  I am a recovering alcoholic and have been in and out of programs and detoxes for the past 20 years.  I currently have 1 year clean and sober and it is the longest I have ever been clean from drugs and alcohol.  I have a strong belief in God and feel confident that I can stay strong with the help of Coram Deo.  I am very impressed with the program and am very glad I chose to come back here.  I really recommend this program to any woman who needs help with recovery and getting on their feet.  The basic needs that they offer and other programs like food share and faith base meetings I think will be very helpful to me.  I am very excited to be here and am confident that with the help of Coram Deo I can stay sober and learn how to live life in recovery.
Coram Deo Inc	307566		/users/profile/398909	Jody_Davis	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/02/2016	My name is Jody Davis, and I am the founder and the Executive Director of this organization. It can be difficult for me to read the negative reviews - but I do understand that each person has a perspective on things and I also understand that we are not a perfect organization - that yes, we have made mistakes, and we have learned from them. The first thing I want to say is that our doors are always open. Anyone is more than welcome to come and see first hand the work that we do. We try to operate out of as much transparency as we can. My email is jody@coramdeorecovery.org - feel free to contact me. I also wanted to address a few of the things mentioned in some of the reviews. The siding on one of our homes was damaged when a client started a fire by throwing a hot ashtray into a cardboard box. The insurance claim did not cover all of the damage - and, they would only cover re-siding one side of the home. Because I insist on excellence within our homes and programming, I searched diligently for money to not only re-side the entire home, but to install new windows as well. 2 months ago we were granted money from the City for this project and have been taking the appropriate steps to see this become a reality. I believe we will have this sided with new windows in the next 4-6 weeks! The reviewer also contends that multiple complaints were submitted regarding broken appliances or leaks in faucets. While this may be accurate, what it doesn't reflect is the nature of the complaint or how long it took to resolve the issue at hand. All complaints are assessed for priority - is it an emergency - does it need to be handled immediately, or, if the faucet leaks another few days - will everyone still be okay? Many people do not understand that not every complaint needs to be addressed within the first 2 hours of being submitted. We currently have 2 Case Managers on Staff - their information is on our website. While someone might not be happy with their case manager - that does not mean we don't provide this service. In addition - we have staff on call with an emergency number, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Do we monitor everyone's coming and going? No. Do we provide punitive punishment for those that choose not to be serious about their recovery? No. Do we ask someone to leave due to missing meetings? No. What we do, however, is provide a platform for good choices in recovery. We counsel women on what works and what doesn't based on our collective experiences - 4 of my 5 staff, myself included have their own history of addiction and recovery. 3 out of 4 of my staff are former residents themselves and can testify to what it means to have been a part of Coram Deo. At Coram Deo our hope is that you would learn to make good decisions. We provide transportation to many meetings, but we don't force you to go - you have to pick up the phone and call for a ride and walk out to the van when it arrives. Sadly, that is not enough for some people. Some still choose to stay home and do nothing. Lastly, let me clarify our fees - which will also soon be posted on our website: First of all, no one has paid $150 to come back in after a relapse in over 2 years. That was a previous policy of ours that we have not enforced for some time, due to many reasons. We have three distinct fees: We require a Security / Sober Deposit of $400. This is refundable provided you do not relapse, provided you give us 30 days notice and provided you leave your room in basically the same condition it was when you arrived. In addition to this we charge a weekly service fee: Single Room - $150.00, Double Room $140.00. This includes all utilities and cable. We are soon going to be charging additionally for wifi. Lastly, at two of our homes we provide community house supplies - and everyone contributes $20 monthly for toilet paper, paper towels, sponges and cleaning supplies. We have found that this creates a more peaceful environment where no one argues over whose toilet paper it is and you don't run out. So, with all of that, I will say this: At 10 years old, we are the largest and leading provider of Transitional Sober Housing for Women in the State of CT. We have been contracted with the state for the past 9 years. We have an annual audit of our files, and a review of our financials. (Our financials are available online)  I gave us 4 stars, because there are definitely areas we can work on and do better at. We recently instituted a Resident Assistant Position to better serve the women coming in and to host weekly house meetings. House meetings have been something that has been difficult to manage over the years, but we keep trying new ways to make it work. We are always happy to take suggestions and we are always looking for ways to improve. We do what we do because we love women and we want to provide a safe, structured, sober environment upon which they can begin to rebuild their lives. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and feel free to contact me with any questions. Sincerely,Jody M. Davis
Coram Deo Inc	295036		/users/profile/385839	lizwats333	Client Served	5	07/10/2016	My name is Elizabeth W. and I was a resident of Coram Deo for approx two years. I have been clean now for 3.5 years and I owe a lot of my success to Coram Deo. The owner, Jodi Davis, has been very supportive of all my accomplishments, as she is with all the other women as well. She is an inspiration to me with all the love she gives to these women. She put a roof over my head, a bed to sleep in, food from the pantry every week, and even been there for my counseling needs and helped me get my priorities straight. I would have never made it this far if it wasn't for her and her organization helping me get on my feet. Because i stayed there for two years, I was able to save some money and move out into my own apartment which I now reside in today. She also allowed me to have a dog at the step up house and he is my whole world. He took me out of my depression and gave me purpose. I am now in school and I'm on my way to giving back to women in the same fashion that she does. I HIGHLY recommend Coram Deo to any woman who is looking to be saved from the hell of addiction and needs support in accomplishing goals and making a better life for herself. I could go on and on with the things this organization has done for me, but no words will ever do any justice to just how much this place and this woman has helped me create this successful life I have today. I owe my Li to Coram Deo. If you're looking for a sober house....start here with Coram Deo!!!!
Coram Deo Inc	292571	1	/users/profile/383109	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	1	06/09/2016	I wish that I was able to give this place a zero star review. The organization is completely fake, with only one thing on its mind: How can they financially benefit the most from clients suffering from addiction. Jody D, the CEO rarely shows her face, and when she does it is to allow a client with a dirty urine back into the house after their family has shelled out enough cash. She is feared by most clients. Multiple complaints were submitted regarding broken appliances or leaks or the fact that one of the houses is MISSING SIDING because of  a FIRE, and she does nothing. She has said out loud before that she has had millions of dollars pass through her hands, but she can't keep up with general house maintenance? There is NO case manager services being offered, They had one case manager who was awesome, but she left. Now clients run free, they couldnt care if you attend any programming or meets. If you are looking for a place to sleep at night, and go out and use during the day with no repercussions, this is the place for you! If you are trying to be serious about your recovery, and want to see a life worth living outside of substance abuse, DO NOT GO HERE. I wish I could save every woman who calls for a bed at this hell-hole. 
Coram Deo Inc	291412	1	/users/profile/381819	recovery4u	Client Served	1	05/30/2016	This is not what it appears. This is supposed to be a recovery program.  If you relapse pay one hundred fifty dollars and you can home back! The furniture and most of items are donated. Brand new items are never issued. When something breaks it is not fixed.This is used as christian based in order to avoid taxes and the owner is down right greedy. The clients are asked to pay $600.00 a month and if you want ac thats another thirty dollars. Common areas do not have ac and cable in your room add another thirty.Imagine cooking in the summer to save money you would be miserable. Anyone who has stayed at Coram Deo knows that the owner and staff wil have air conditioning in the office for comfort as well as apperances for donors. I  am sure they will have ac at home too! This is all a smoking mirror and the truth needs to be told. I highly suspect that positive feedback is put there by friends and staff.  Not clients who have actually lived there. Try working on early recovery when you are miserable from the heat. New prospective clients beware there are no house meeting and they could care less if you attend N/A,  A/ A meetings.They are in it for the mony and the money only.  Do not be deceived.  Treatment providers find out before you send clients there. Basic needs have clients do survey so the truth comes out.
Coram Deo Inc	279744	2	/users/profile/369707	Writer	Board Member	4	02/10/2016	I have been a volunteer, a donor and also serve on the board of Coram Deo.  I have never personally ever had an addiction problem, but have seen a close family member struggle for years with alcohol and drugs.  I believe strongly,  that in order for people, especially women, to  recover from the effects of addiction and the wake of consequences it leaves behind, they need to be around and supported by people who have understand addiction, and have walked in their shoes.  Jody Davis, the Executive Director of Coram Deo has, and is the visionary behind starting this organization.  It is the only sober living option available for women in Connecticut, and although some people might not agree with clients having to pay for rent, it is a strong reason why Coram Deo is successful and can maintain it's services.  It's accountability.  The women in the program are actively contributing financially to their own success and recovery.  Many of us have seen or experienced the effects of addiction.   These are our sisters, daughters, nieces, aunts, mothers, and even wives.  We ALL know someone, and we need to be honest, we are all a blink of an eye, one bad decision by a loved one away from being hit directly.   I truly believe Coram Deo is positioned to transform the way we care for women in recovery here in Connecticut.   I believe in the mission, and I believe in the women we are helping.  
Coram Deo Inc	279529	3	/users/profile/369555	EMLR	Advisor	5	02/09/2016	Every day, Coram Deo rolls up its sleeves and digs in to a community need, serving women who are actively working toward recovery, and giving them the tools they need to foster healthy, productive lives.   As a consultant to the organization Im fortunate to be up close and personal with the day to day work Coram Deo undertakes.  In addition to serving in a professional administrative capacity for a cause that has tremendous value, I get to interact with the women we serve.  I see the benefits of what Coram Deo gives to its clients  a sense of feeling cared for, trusted, respected and challenged, the space to heal, find ones voice, learn, and be supported through the struggle of recovery.  Coram Deo holds space in the best possible way for women to transform their lives.
Coram Deo Inc	279495	2	/users/profile/369547	InHisGrip	Donor	5	02/09/2016	I have been supported Coram Deo for  9 years and I am most impressed with the relational approach to recovery and support that they maintain.  Our rental property has been blessed to have housed many women from Coram Deo.  It has been a privledge to witness  lives being transformed and families restored as Coram Deo walks out recovery with the women in their care.  
Coram Deo Inc	279473	3	/users/profile/369521	smcarthur01	General Member of the Public	5	02/09/2016	I've been involved with Coram Deo for 8 years now and have seen them grow from one house where my daughter was one of the first to stay to where they are today.  Sarah's house will always hold a special place in my heart.  They are sincere and compassionate people with one thing in mind - to help those with addictions to find recovery and support the family and friends who are involved with the illness as well.  It is an organization well worth supporting. 
Coram Deo Inc	279327	2	/users/profile/369411	Oconnellk	Board Member	5	02/08/2016	Coram Deo is truly dedicated to helping women recover from substance abuse and become contributing members of society. They approach each initiative with excellence and thoughtfulness. We are lucky to have this kind of organization in our community and I am proud to serve on the board. 
Coram Deo Inc	278248	3	/users/profile/368170	Anonymous2081	Volunteer	4	01/28/2016	Coram Deo Recovery serves a meaningful purpose by providing hope and purpose to the community by way of battling addiction and supporting matriarchal empowerment. The organization has achieved a number of goals over the last 12 months; the organization continues to rebuild, enrich and enhance lives, not just directly through the woman they serve but also through the families and communities that wants each woman to succeed!

When I came to Coram Deo I was lost. I had nothing  I didn't think my life could be what it is now. Not only do I have a great support system and wonderful sober friends but I'm going to college starting Jan 21st. Which is something I always wanted to do and never thought I would. It' was my dream since I was a little girl. Coram Deo has helped me to make my dreams come true. I am so thankful and will always be grateful to Coram Deo for this opportunity to turn my life around. Without Coram Deo none of this would be possible.
Coram Deo Inc	276252	3	/users/profile/365970	itsnotcheap	Donor	4	01/11/2016	Coram Deo is filling a need in the lives of women in the New Britain area.  What some clients don't see with their $150 a week payment is the furniture, appliances, utilities, insurance expenses, property upkeep,  etc.  being paid on their behalf.  The expenses are significant.  And yes, the employees are entitled to being paid, "the laborer is worthy their wages".     As for executives of non-profs, their pay must fall within guidelines, based on the size of the organization, or they are subject to additional scrutiny from the IRS, which can revoke the non profit status.  Keep up the good work Coram Deo!
Coram Deo Inc	275920	3	/users/profile/365595	beingfaithful	Volunteer	5	01/07/2016	Coram Deo has brought life back to me.  I have purpose in my life again.  I have struggled for many years with addiction and i am so grateful to our Lord for having such a program available to me.  My relationship with our Lord has increased my belief that there are great people in this world willing to help others.  I was raised with being taught to have pride. Don't ask and do for yourself.  Had I known that pride was not what was taught to me.   Had I asked for help in many areas of my life, I probably would not have struggled as hard as I did.  Thank you Coram deo for being such a positive piece of my life!!!

Coram Deo has become a stellar nonprofit organization in the greater New Britain region that has gained the respect and support of charitable foundations, businesses, houses of worship, and individuals.  The organization's business model allows the women in recovery to invest in their own success through direct participation in programming, financial responsibility (self-pay), while simultaneously receiving an array of comprehensive services included in that investment.

I have been volunteering with this agency for over a year and a half and I have learned so much! I thank god the opportunity to have a hand in blessing these residents and help them down the path of recovery. Many of the residents call Coram Deo home and never want to leave and that is a wonderful thing!! The staff does a great job encouraging these women to strive for more! I definitely would recommend this program to everyone. 
Coram Deo Inc	274831	3	/users/profile/364336	Writer	Client Served	1	12/22/2015	This is certainly not a non profit. And the least sober place i have ever lived. I was at "Sarah's house". Probably the smallest home Coram deo owns, or rents. We had up to 11 women living there at a time.Each woman paid $150-to $160 per week. In addition, we were required to pay $100 each per month for "supplies" this consisted of 3 rolls of paper towels, 2 sponges, bleach, and toilet paper.It is a two apartment building. Rent for an apartment in that section of New Britain would be about $900 per month. Yet, with 11 tenants, coram deo's intake was $8,225. 
Coram Deo Inc	274721	2	/users/profile/364189	Mediumpete	Donor	5	12/20/2015	We have watched Coram Deo grow over the years and have heard testimonies from some of the woman whose lives have been impacted by this program.  There is an ever increasing need for programs such as this, and we are proud to contribute via donations to help the cause. I am especially touched by mothers who are trying to escape the effects of addiction, for the betterment of their children. Thank you to Jody Davis and her staff for all they do.

Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation	317349	2	/users/profile/408518	BrennaOrtner	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2016	Something that is so absent in the school systems, yet such a huge part of social learning, how to choose a loving thought over a negative thought, or a hateful thought. It is so simple and yet so powerful. You can change your day, your week, your life, by just choosing loving thoughts. This is something that is SO important that our children learn how to do. I would be honored to have this program in my child's school and hope this foundation gets the support it deserves to do so. 
Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation	316482	3	/users/profile/365590	kelleyoshiro	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2016	Choosing Love, simple enough I thought. And so I started espousing the idea to everyone I could through social media and within my daily life. And then I realized I had to walk the talk, and that's when my world changed profoundly, for I always believed in love, but to choose it every day, consciously in every choice! The response from others, it opens up an unexpected world of vulnerability and kindness and forgiveness and gratitude and courage from places within yourself and from others that is truly life altering.  I now work directly with the non-profit, implementing their SEL program in schools in Hawaii and talking and sharing the Choose Love Movement whenever and wherever I can because I believe it can change the world and build peace for our future generations...this is the power of choosing love.  Simple enough.

The foundation's emphasis on social and emotional learning as an antidote to blame and demonization is the tonic our society and schools need to move to a better place. The organization deserves considerable recognition and support.

Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation	275879	4	/users/profile/365550	Amy_256	General Member of the Public	5	01/07/2016	The foundation and motivation behind the Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation, is love, healing and forgiveness. Working within the community and especially within the school system, Scarlett has worked to create a way for educators to incorporate this into their daily teaching. Helping children, and adults, form a different attitude towards one another that is grounded in love, hope, healing and forgiveness. She and JT have created change all over this country and around the world  and have been an example of how to reach out to others who are hurting and offer them love, hope and forgiveness even when they themselves were hurting. They create workshops within communities and have reached as far as Africa with their message of choosing love and forgiveness.  To choose love is indeed the greatest thing any of us can do on a daily basis. Because love never ends as Scarlett will tell you and I firmly agree. It just goes on and on. It is healing. Scarlett's book, Nurturing Healing Love, changed me. It moved my soul into a different place and really allowed me to believe that love is the remedy. I know Jesse. I think of him often and smile at the things I know about him just from reading her book. He inspires me. Jesse will forever remind me to have a lot of fun! If you are hoping and wishing for a change in your school or community where love and healing is incorporated into your daily life, Scarlett, Jesse and JT will guide you and show you ways to do it. They will move you to love. You'll be kept up to date on the website about changes within the government and policies concerning  things such as gun control. You will see examples of how schools and communities are choosing love and ways you can do the same in your own community. Jesse Lewis Choose Love Foundation is a resource and reminder for me every day to.....choose love. Thanks Jesse!

I first met Daniel when he was a student at Bassick High School where I taught at the time. I was so inspired by the young man who was courageous enough to share his tragic yet hopeful story with me. Even as a high school student Daniel wanted to pour out and share his hope with others. In the fall of 2007 as a high school senior himself, Daniel was invited to share his story with a group of students at Jonathan Law High School and that event launched what has become a personal passion for Dan.  Daniel is now a college graduate and professional speaker. Years later I continue to stand in awe of Daniel and all that he has accomplished and still aspires to do.  He has truly turned the ashes of his circumstances into beauty and he aims to inspire everyone he encounters to do the same. He selflessly gives to others with the goal of improving their circumstances and has literally altered the course of individuals lives'.   I am so proud to stand in his company and look forward to what Daniel will accomplish through his organization's endeavors.

He is an incredible person inside and out but most of all an inspirational person filled with passion. The Daniel Trust Foundation is a way to give back and acknowledge. I couldn't be more proud of the person Dan is but most of all a great friend I've gained in college and for a lifetime. I'm one who had volunteered for the foundation as it is an accomplishment for myself to have been part of. We awarded the Kathy Silver Award which was Dan's High School teacher who always pushed him to exceed beyond ! The whole night was a fun, filled, and learning environment where people of all kinds and beliefs got together to celebrate! I look forward to many more events and times to give back! Keep up the great work :)

One of the best parts abut the scholarship is that Daniel and the organization stay with the scholars during our journeys at college and try their best to help us, thereby keeping us connected with the organization. Daniel is truly one of the most sincere people I have ever met and to see his foundation grow in such a short time is truly astounding to me. As a young adult who advocates for the LGBTQ+ community, I can confidently say that this organization does a great job of recognizing young people who are fighting for the future of our world. It also promotes the sharing of stories; it helps kickstart a dialogue among people in the LGBTQ+ community and I think that that is the most rewarding aspect of the scholarship and foundation. I'm excited to see what the future has to offer for Daniel and the foundation and I will be forever grateful for the scholarship, support, and most importantly, mentorship that I have received from Daniel during the past 2 years.

He told me about his foundation and I became a sponsor in a small way. I wish I had millions to donate because I am positive that Daniel is going to change the world for the better. He is so passionate about his foundation and helping others and he does all of this with a HUGE smile. He and his amazing foundation continue to impress me with their hard work and determination.

As a recipient of this scholarship, I was extremely thankful and appreciative of the immense love, friendship and motivation that I received from Daniel Trust. Learning about Daniel's compelling and inspiring story paves the way for me to strive to do my best. I used to believe that whatever I did wasn't good enough and I didn't have a purpose, but getting to know Daniel made me realize that he believed in me, and if others can believe in me, then I can believe in myself. The scholarship I received has been a huge help paying for books and other miscellaneous things.
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	222347		/users/profile/286052	fraquish	General Member of the Public	5	10/13/2014	The Daniel Trust Foundation is a great non-profit!  Daniel is dedicated to helping youth 'Achieve More while Giving Back'.  I have worked with him on a few occasions - he has spoken to the students at my school and inspired both students and the faculty to become more involved in their communities.  
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	222181		/users/profile/285876	Eric_Z	Client Served	5	10/13/2014	"What I love about Daniel Trust and The Daniel Trust Foundation is that unlike other scholarship organizations, that just give you a pay check or a "pat-on-the-back," the organization and Daniel, go above and beyond for the scholars, supporters and the local community. Not only does he support his scholars monetarily, but he provides mentorship, guidance and opportunity.   After spending a month in terning with the organization in Connecticut, I can confidently say that my words are absolutely true. I have never seen someone put in so much heart, time and commitment into what they believe in and stand for. It seemed like Daniel was up, dawn past midnight almost every single day, working on something new for the foundation. I completely agree and believe for what this organization stands for. And I highly recommend any and all people become supporters and friends of Daniel and The Daniel Trust Foundation.  Also Daniel is an excellent speaker, who has one of the most inspiring existing stories to share. If you don't invite him to speak at your work, school or club, you will be losing a lot! Overall, I am looking forward to following Daniel and the organization in watching them make a serious dent in the world."

The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	222133		/users/profile/285818	Devin E.	Volunteer	5	10/12/2014	Although i just learned of the Daniel Trust Foundation this year in that short amount of time i've gotten to know Daniel as well as the foundation itself. The work this foundation does is a light at the end of the tunnel for many students who are not fortunate enough to be able to afford the ever rising costs of college. Not only does the foundation give scholarships and grants to deserving teachers and high school seniors, the foundation is much like a family that keeps in touch and involved in their honorees lives. Not many non-profits are willing to go that extra mile to not only give back but becoming a mentor to help with future self-growth. These honorees as well as Daniel himself inspire me to not only want to be a better person but to give back to my community as well. 
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	222028		/users/profile/285719	onthepath	Donor	5	10/12/2014	Just seeing Daniel Trust's radiant face online drew me to reading about him. He is model and inspiration and has a purity of heart that defines the kind of enlightened greatness that makes one know the world is better and safer with him here. His wish and determination to support young scholars who are also following a call to serve this world is moving and precious. It was something I felt immediately and without reservation that I wanted to say, with my few dollars to his BIG purpose, "Go, Daniel. Thank you for what you do..... and don't stop!".
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	221934		/users/profile/285629	bcrandall	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/11/2014	For over twenty years I've worked in urban schools as an educator, researcher, and advocate. My academic work has been with the literacy of relocated refugee youth in an out of American schools but, as the Director of a Connecticut Writing Project site (part of the highly celebrated National Writing Project network), I've also spent a large part of my time leading professional development for educational leaders. I pride myself on having opportunities to work with passionate individuals and organizations -- the ones who put youth before inane educational policies. They are the people who fight for student empowerment over the oppressive curriculum that often fails to recognize diversity in American schools. It was serendipitous to meet Daniel Trust and his foundation this past year. A mutual friend of ours - a stellar teacher who mentored Daniel when he was in high school and college - introduced me to his story and work. Because I've mentored and advised relocated refugees from Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Vietnam, and Bhutan, I have always been drawn to those stories that demonstrate resilience and hope.   Last spring, Fairfield University (Jesuit University Humanitarian Network) and I brought Daniel Trust to visit the campus. He provided an evening of advocacy and impacted all in attendance. As a result, I also asked Daniel to tell his story during a summer institute for teachers. I wanted them to benefit from his modeling of how he acts locally with global realities on his mind. In both forums, Daniel's presentation was personal, emotional, intimate, and promising. He has a natural way to move his audiences into action. Daniel Trust is a mover and a shaker. Last year, he offered multiple scholarships to young people  who fight to make a difference in their world. One of my students, a young Pakistani woman in a dual enrollment program between Trust's alma mater and Fairfield University, was a recipient of a cash award.  I attended the Trust Scholarship dinner and knew he was an individual to support. The pride imbued upon his scholarship recipients is one of the greatest highlights of my four-year Connecticut experience. Daniel Trust is dedicated to young people who deserve an amazing opportunity. He stands behind youth and uses his own story to help them build their own. He is a friend to education and an activist for the heterogeneity of American society. His foundation is definitely worth being named one of the nation's BEST non-profits.
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	221586		/users/profile/285274	ksbhsi51	Board Member	5	10/10/2014	I saw Daniel in 2013 when he spoke at the True Colors Conference at the University of Connecticut.  I knew right away that this was a young man of courage and conviction who was capable of doing great things.  The Foundation he created awards grants and scholarships to students who are making their communities better, and teachers who are encouraging their students to do the same.  This is important and heroic work that rarely is acknowledged, but when the Foundation awards a grant or a scholarship, all of that changes.  Daniel is also an inspirational speaker with a message of hope and optimism, with a tremendous story of how he made the transition from Rwandan Genocide survivor to LGBT and community activist.  This is a unique, powerful, and extremely important foundation!
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	221496		/users/profile/285187	Tiffanyrj5	Volunteer	5	10/09/2014	I knew of Daniel Trust back in 2007 when his organization was at its beginning roots while attending Southern Connecticut State University. I watched Daniel grow after I began to notice the D-Trust T-shirts he sold outside my then campus job at the bookstore. The story behind Daniel and what his organization does is one of fascination, courage, perseverance, and admiration for serving the community.  I had the honor of being a guest at the Daniel Trust Award ceremony for graduating high school scholarship recipients now attending colleges across the United States. Each scholar who spoke had integrity and merit for what the founder of this organization stands for.  I give my highest recommendation for the Daniel Trust Foundation, for support and awareness of all the good it has done to the people it serves. 
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	220894		/users/profile/284587	CarS	Volunteer	5	10/08/2014	I have been volunteering with the Daniel Trust Foundation for a few years now and I am still blown away by the commitment and enthusiasm shown by this amazing group of people.  This Foundation was set up to help and empower students and teachers who are giving back to their community.  I can attest to the long hours and hard work put in to set up the non-profit, to continuously raise funds for student scholarships, and to spread the word about these students and teachers who are going above and beyond to make a difference in the lives of others. I originally became involved with the Daniel Trust Foundation because I enjoy helping others, but I have gotten so much more in return.  Each event I volunteer at or project I become involved with, I come away more motivated and inspired to do more in my own life.  
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	220104		/users/profile/283729	kellykhope	Board Member	5	10/05/2014	I choose to become a board member of The Daniel Trust Foundation because I believe in its mission and work to "advise and help teens plan their education and careers with meaning and purpose".  Inspiring students to excel, look past their current situations and see themselves in their destiny is something I've dedicated my life's work to. So, becoming a part of the Daniel Trust Foundation came with ease. The foundation, like myself, is committed to helping students reach their greatest potential via mentorships and scholarship recognition.  I am truly proud of the work we do, the level of excellence we exude, and the financial support we are able to provide to students and teachers. It's apparent to me that The Daniel Trust Foundation is not only a nonprofit, but it is also an extended family and support system for our interns and scholars.  We understand that when we give more we achieve more!
The Daniel Trust Foundation, Inc.	219948	1	/users/profile/283573	AshleyAS	Donor	5	10/04/2014	This nonprofit goes beyond any scholarship program out there. Not only do they award scholars who exceed in their studies and community service, but they go above and beyond by continuously mentoring their selected students throughout their entire college career. The nonprofit also gives students birthday gifts, a textbook fund, and start an emergency funding account for them just incase they need to come home or to assist them with any health care issues. They also award one student with a laptop, which is essential in college.  This nonprofit doesn't just stop at students, they also give out a grant to a teacher that goes out of their way for their students and community. They award teachers who teach in low-income school districts and students who are  living in impoverished communities.  This year they want to help 10 scholars go to college and help atleast 1-2 teacher(s). I'm a monthly donor because I believe everyone deserves a chance at a better future.

The flag that is flying has 48 stars just like the original flag and sand and stones from IWO JIMA. The most impressive thing is that is was built by the survivors. I visit this monument at least once a month and it brings tears to my eyes every time I'm there.

Gary Roy, the caretaker, does a wonderful job of maintaining the property for visitors.  It is an exact replica of the original, and the only Iwo Jima memorial in the country to have been built entirely by the survivors of The Battle For Iwo Jima.  Located adjacent to Rt 9, it is seen by thousands of commuters, every day.
Iwo Jima Memorial Historical Foundation Inc	231332		/users/profile/294928	monafelice	General Member of the Public	5	10/31/2014	This is a beautiful monument that is well cared for by a group of dedicated volunteers.  I first learned about them by seeing an announcement for an event in the newspaper.  To learn that this monument was built by actual Iwo Jima survivors was astonishing!  The ongoing care and maintenance, and numerous events held during each year, all done by volunteers and donations is spectacular- although many would assume that such a thing could not happen without government involvement- they are wrong!  I suggest visiting the monument during one of their fine events, meet the veterans, hear their stories in their own words, admire their bravery, and most of all take note of how humble they are and what they accomplished after they returned home.   Then, plan a return visit, when you are the only person there, examine the monument, read the inscriptions, walk the perimeter and read the plaques on each flag of the 100 Connecticut men who gave their lives on Iwo Jima, sit on a bench and listen to the flag in the wind, be thankful for those men who served, be thankful to live in the greatest country on the face of the earth.

Recently we had visitors from "across the pond" and this monument was a priority visit during their stay.  They were especially impressed and acknowledged the importance of learning this piece of US Marine History. While the location of this memorial in CT is an "easy visit", we all need to share with visitors from outside our state (and local community).  The people who volunteer and give of their time and treasures are true believers in our Country and our Marines.

People don't have to go all the way to Washington, D.C. to see an authentic memorial to Iwo Jima.  This monument is a lasting tribute to the brave Connecticut heroes who lost their lives in this battle.  It has actual rocks from the very island they died on.  I have an uncle who flew, and another who fought at that battle.  This monument has wonderful events on it's grounds several times a year where the public can come and learn of the sacrifices and dedication of those from "the greatest generation" who paid for their freedom with their lives.  Connecticut and New England have a true gem right in the center of this state.

At the root of this fine memorial's distinction is a dedicated group of selfless volunteers whose entire lives are committed to ensuring the memory of Iwo Jima and those who perished there is justly honored. You can sense the meticulous care and respect from the very moment you enter the grounds. I have had the privilege of getting to know some of these folks, and I am impressed. I also have not hesitated in recommending this group in a professional capacity as a veterans charity worthy of support. This is a small-town, grass roots gem.

The park is beautifully maintained and is just a wonderful place to visit and reflect on those times. I love that it is the only memorial built by the survivors.

At first, I was worried that it would come off as though we were being disrespectful by bringing our dog to the memorial, but I really think the men who served in WW2 and at Iwo Jima were doing their part to ensure that people like us could continue to live feely and enjoy time together without living in fear of a horrific government like the Nazis or the modern terrorists that the world is collectively threatened by. Their bravery, honor and sacrifice truly helped ensure that we could continue to live as free people and I think about it every time I'm there, which is what I feel the purpose of a memorial is. I'm very grateful to those who built and maintain this memorial, the people who served in the battle, and the families of those who served and/or lost a loved one as a result.

However I was distressed to see the American Flag in poor condition being tattered and caught in the line on the flag pole.  It is a discredit to the memory of one of the finest hours for our marines and the American flag to be in this condition.  Does it need to wait until Memorial Day to be replaced?  Remember, not only the residents of Connecticut see this monument but anyone traveling on that section of highway also sees the condition of the national ensign...... Jaquoline Legere, RM1 USN/Ret

Iwo Jima Memorial Historical Foundation Inc	136858		/users/profile/182809	jgm06074	General Member of the Public	5	11/10/2012	I was deeply moved to find this memorial in Connecticut when I moved here  because my uncle was KIA on Iwo Jima.  We cannot easily travel to Detroit to visit his grave.  My father and sisters and I donated to have a brick installed in his memory, so we now have a nearby memorial site to visit.  The inscriptions and engraved pictures on the monuments give a very moving tribute to those who served.  The monument park is beautifully manicured and maintained -- this shows the love and care of the volunteers who work on it.  The numerous moving ceremonies for veterans help the survivors and their families meet each other and keep the memories alive.  I hope it will remain this way into the future, so that our children and grandchildren will understand, too.

The perpetual flame and the inscribed information on the sculpture are especially appropriate, adding to the emotional impact of the site. My uncle, whom I never met, gave his life at Iwo Jima, and is now memorialized on one of the engraved bricks. We brought our 94-year old father here, and he was deeply moved.

I have attended many of the well organized events here and listened to the moving stories of the brave men who fought in this battle.  As this generation is lost, it is vital that we have something to remind us of the brave men who fought for our freedom and that we have a special place to reflect and give thanks.

It is not taught in schools and is not considered "real" to today's kids.  This memorial helps history come alive. It is important to the few remaining Iwo Vets  and to their families. 
Iwo Jima Memorial Historical Foundation Inc	134680		/users/profile/180556	mycoldhouse	Board Member	5	11/07/2012	We are volunteers because we became friends with the Iwo Jima Survivors 17 years ago.  Once you get to know them, you develop a deep respect and admiration for them and all our WWII veterans.  This is why we have voluntered for so long and continue to do so.  We want to continue on with the legacy of these veterans to ensure they and their sacrifices are never forgotten.  If they are forgotten, what is to keep today's Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans from being forgotten 60 years from now?  Think about it.  Someone once said, The character of a nation can be measured by the way that nation treats its veterans.    Our Organization's Mission is to Maintain the National Iwo Jima Memorial, pay tribute to and honr the men who fought and died there and to educate others about World War II and the the Battle of Iwo Jima.  We do this through fundraisers and events that bring about awareness of the Survivors, monument and park.  We hold annual ceremonies for the Flag Raising Anniversary, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.  We organize and put on events such as the Iwo Jima Survivors Victory Ride, Flag Day Open House and VJ Day Candlelight Ceremony of Remembrance.  We give organized tours of the park, hold Armed Forces Commissioning Ceremonies and Memorial Ceremonies for Veterans who have passed away.  We are presently raising funds by selling engraved bricks which will be placed around the memorial and by selling flag sponsorships for the 100 men who were KIA.  Volunteers are always needed.  There is so much more we would like to do to honor our Veterans but are short on help to get it done.  Come visit the park and email us if you would like to know more.  SOSIwoJima@yahoo.com.

My son is 14 and an avid history fan and we have been there many times, once to witness an Iwo Jima survivor receive the Purple Heart, finally, at almost 90 years of age.  The monument itself is an amazing work of art, and there is so much to learn by reading the inscriptions. The work this group does is extremely important and valuable to keep the memory of this battle and the soldiers who fought there alive, and to teach the new generation about our history.

True Colors, Inc.	113985		/users/profile/155103	tanmac78	Volunteer	5	06/06/2012	I have been a mentor and involved with True Colors for a few years now and this organization is top notch in the quality of training, care and expertise offered to the children they protect, the community they serve and the public they seek to educate. As a mentor, I have extended myself and become a living, breathing, positive representation of a future for our LGBT youth. I have also heard stories and been witness to the resiliency of our youth, when given the right tools of love, support and affirmation for their existence. 
True Colors, Inc.	113975		/users/profile/155088	Riley M.	General Member of the Public	5	06/06/2012	When I was 13, I was on the verge of suicide. I was the only lesbian student in my high school, and I took a lot of heat from the students and staff for it. My days were miserable, I was the victim of numerous hate crimes. In the spring of 2004, my school's Gay/Straight Alliance registered for the True Colors Conference. The conference was held at Central CT State University that year. I had no idea what to expect, I'd never been to the conference before. We pulled onto the campus at 8 o'clock that morning and my life changed forever. Within minutes of arriving, we were greeted by Robin, Nico, and the rest of the True Colors Staff. There were hundreds, if not thousands of  GLBTQ youth gathered. I was in shock. Here I was, one girl from a small, conservative christian town, surrounded by all of these fantastic, carefree, very gay people. Two days later, I left the conference with a completly new mindset. I was not alone. I had resources, new freinds, and a self esteem boost that was responsible for me surviving my years in high school. Through True Colors, I found a place where I belonged. I found people just like me. I found resources who stood up for me, and helped me work with my school's administration to stop the bullying and hate crimes. Suddenly, in a matter of two days, I had all of the love and support that any scared, depressed, lonely 13 year old girl could ever need. I attended the True Colors Conference for 7 years. After graduationg high school, I presetned a few times at the conference too, as my way of  giving back to the community that saved me. I'm 22 now, I live with my partner of a year and we're hoping to get married in 2014. I can honestly say, that without Robin and the rest of the folks at True Colors, I would not be here. Their love, dedication, kindness, determination, support, and hard work has made a difference in so many lives, not just mine. They bring together the most incredible people you'll ever meet, and they work to make the world a better place for the GLBTQ youth they serve. I owe my life to True Colors, and I know plenty of people who can say the same. That's what makes True Colors a GREAT Nonprofit. 
True Colors, Inc.	19798	4	/users/profile/20987	Jody	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2009	As a therapist for children and adolescents I have often looked to True Colors to assist in many ways over the last 10 years.  Robin and her staff are incredibly responsive and helpful.  Robin has also done some training for myself and colleagues and no one leaves without an incredible amount of insight of how to assist all children and families.  They are incredible.
True Colors, Inc.	6418	34	/users/profile/8232	Germangirll	Volunteer	5	07/09/2009	True Colors is a group that has embraced the LGBTQI kids that get lost in the system. Few existing social organizations  are able to fund or support programs where kids are labeled anything other than what society wants them to be. Many church groups can't handle LGBTQI youth because they have a need to change kids to what the church wants them to be, and when they can't- youth  are cast away for having the courage to be themselves.  True Colors embraces the youth of it's program.  No one is told to be anything except themselves.  The ability True Colors staff has to see each individual and treat their soul amazes me. If I had to name the number one service they provide- it would be acceptance tied with Love for first place. I decided to become a mentor for this very reason. I am impressed with the amount of community outreach True Colors does, from School GSA's, (which I might add provided youth with scholarship opportunities and information), to an amazing (yearly) national conference, to a variety of arts, entertainment, and spiritual groups.It is an honor to volunteer with this group!
True Colors, Inc.	6409	35	/users/profile/8221	JohnQ	Volunteer	5	07/09/2009	True Colors provides and outstanding service to the youth that seek it out by supporting them and affirming their worth as individuals regardless of sexual orientation.  Further, True Colors provides and outstanding service to all organizations in the state of CT that serve youth by advocating for lgbtq youth and assisting organizations in understanding the needs of such youth.
True Colors, Inc.	5552	16	/users/profile/7370	luckystreich	Donor	1	06/24/2009	True Colors is an organization that is dishonest as best.  They fail to present both side of the issue of homosexuality to youth.  The youth that they serve are very vulnerable and they come to programs run by this organization often with the question "What do I do? I think I might be gay."  Youth served are always encouraged to explore the path of homosexuality rather than the path of heterosexuality or celibacy.  The leadership of this group will not dare tell their clients that homosexuality may be a CHOICE!  It's a shame that such a biased group has been allowed to have such an influence on our kids.
True Colors, Inc.	5290	44	/users/profile/7086	cyds	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/17/2009	True Colors is a great, cutting edge organization which is devoted to improving the lives of LGBTQ youth.  Not only do they provide direct services e.g. mentoring programs and the largest conference for and about LGBTQ youth in the country, but they also educate those who work w/ youth in a wide range of agencies.
True Colors, Inc.	5083	41	/users/profile/6885	markp	Board Member	5	06/11/2009	True Colors, Inc., is an organization with one overriding goal.  Provide LGBTQ, etc., youth, their families and allies with the tools and support needed to ensure that these youth grow up knowing the value they themselves bring to the world and that they can truly make a difference and be proud of who they are.  As a board member and a long time advocate of True Colors, I have seen the group grow from being run out of a home to the small office space they now occupy, bursting to expand yet again.  The annual Youth Conference, provides information and eduction to thousands of LGBTQ, etc., youth from middle school through college along with social workers and other youth oriented professionals.  The conference is larger and more dynamic year after year.  Other shining examples of their efforts are the Safe Harbor project run with the State of CT Dept of Children and Families, their LGBT mentoring program and their GSA progams.The staff and interns are truly dedicated and caring professionals and have been recognized nationally and locally as have many of their training and other programs.True Colors is working hard to increase their donor base and rely less on grant funding for programs and operating costs, to ensure fiscal stability and growth in years to come.  The organization is poised to become a well recognized national player in support of LGBT youth.

True Colors, Inc.	4972	46	/users/profile/6729	thecure4urcure	Volunteer	5	06/09/2009	True Colors opened my eyes to the LGBT world. The 2007 youth conference helped me realize that you know it's okay to be proud. I don't have to hide or be in the shadows. True colors, INC has given me a voice and the courage to do great things in the LGBT commnity. If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be sitting typing here. They have inspired me to do such great things and I'm extremely proud to know the peoplw who run True Colors, their volunteers, and the 100s of youth they inspire.
True Colors, Inc.	4947	44	/users/profile/6702	puttysauce	Volunteer	5	06/08/2009	I have never seen an organization so intimately involved with their mission and so committed to the people they serve. Their tiny staff somehow finds a way to make an enormous difference for hundreds (thousands?) of LGBTQIA... kids in Connecticut and beyond every year. What makes True Colors different from many other organizations is the utter honesty with which they operate. They recruit dedicated volunteers by being unabashedly honest about what will be expected of them; they are honest with the kids they serve when helping them try to make the right decisions; and they advocate honesty in their community. With this honest approach, they pull off the biggest, greatest LGBTQI Youth Conference in the country. Going to that conference is like going home to the family you always wish you had. I am so proud to be involved with this organization. Every activity provides a first-hand account of lives being changed, if not saved.
True Colors, Inc.	4934	44	/users/profile/6687	Thomas Lawrence Long	Volunteer	5	06/06/2009	Any organization that aspires to serve adolescents had better have its act together, and True Colors has a very together act. Life ain't a cabaret, it's a three ring circus. True Colors handles its various programs and services with grace, joy, and professionalism, performing a juggling act while crossing a tightrope on a unicycle! It engages sexual minority youth, their families, their friends, and their allies and advocates. The True Colors annual conference is an astonishingly rich service to Connecticut, and the ongoing services that the True Colors organization provides (like adult/youth mentoring and mentoring training) are invaluable.
True Colors, Inc.	4930	42	/users/profile/6684	Gerald	Volunteer	5	06/06/2009	The best non-profits are mission focussed with strong professional practices and standards and with healthy personal commitment from leadership and staff.  While I have been around many good non-profits, I think True Colors may be the best of the lot.
True Colors, Inc.	4929	30	/users/profile/6682	Taureanna	Volunteer	5	06/05/2009	True Colors is officially a conference for sexual and gender minority youth.  I suppose that's correct, but to me it's so much more than that.I first attended the conference when I was in high school, not so long ago.  The next year I was in the fray, helping plan and volunteering. Working with True Colors has been my way of sharing the great fortune I've had in my life with youth who have not been so lucky.  Many of the children who attend True Colors are not accepted for being who they are and the conference is one of the few places where they can really be themselves, and I think that is a beautiful thing.
True Colors, Inc.	4927	31	/users/profile/6681	KarenDe	Donor	5	06/05/2009	True Colors is an amazing organization. I happened upon the organization by chance - Kamora, director of the mentor program, sat and chatted with me during a non-GLBT event at which I was set to present. I was more excited about the mentor program than my event and followed up with Kamora about the organization later on. As a lesbian who made it through her teen years, I immediately thought of how different my life might have been had I the opportunity to have a GLBTQI mentor, a GSA, or a organization like TC. I then met Robin, executive director, and I learned of the myriad of services offered by TC and I was officially hooked. I joined the Board and became a mentor. The importance of the organization cannot be downplayed. Although our community has seen so much progress we have so far to go. Bullying of GLBTQI youth continues, suicide rates for our youth is up, and there are not enough support services for kids in this population. True Colors offers so much hope and support to Connecticut's youth each day. And once a year they go global and host the largest GLBTQI youth conference. If you haven't attended the conference you should - GLBTQI or an ally - it is amazingly empowering to sit in a room with 3000 GLBTQI and ally youth. Yes, I wish I had this organization when I was younger - I wish I had  at least one person who then could have tole me what Robin, Kamora, Leah say each day to a kid - there is nothing wrong with you for being gay. To be involved with the organization is a blessing. True Colors gets my highest praise!
True Colors, Inc.	4924	31	/users/profile/6679	BarbCurry	Volunteer	5	06/05/2009	I have been involved with True Colors for over 10 years.  Their annual youth conference alone is possibly one of the most powerful experiences I have had in my lifetime (of over 50 years).  True Colors works diligently to help LGBTQQII youth develop their self image and dignity.  They give youth who often feel marginalized and on the fringe of their social circles a chance to be part of a thriving social network.  Thru their year-round mentoring program, True Colors gives support to those young people who might otherwise be ignored and left to founder in the layers of bureaucracy.  I applaud Robin McHaelan and her staff for thinking beyond their budgets, and structures, and capabilities to enabling the impossible to be done.
True Colors, Inc.	4923	29	/users/profile/6677	Diana060	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/05/2009	True Colors annual conference has expanded from from a small conference that was held at University of Hartford to a conference that attracts close to 3000 attendees at the University of Connecticut, many of them are professionals. They have added a third day to the conference just for professional working with LGBT youth.But they also have a mentoring program for LGBT kids. They work with to department of Children and Families to place LGBT youth with LGBT forester parents.In addition, True Colors is a member of the Anti-Discrimination Coalition working to pass a gender inclusive anti-discrimination law.
BIG FUN Education	219417		/users/profile/283033	GailPasternack	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/02/2014	I am an author and educator with over twenty years of experience in alternative education. In all that time I have never seen a more effective alternative education program as Big Fun Education. Not only does it make education fun, it inspires creativity and brings students from around the world together through its use of modern technology.   Last spring my son had the opportunity to participate in Big Fun Education's "Macbeth Goes Social" along with students from around the United States and Italy. The program inspired students to act out scenes from Macbeth, cook the food from the play, and incorporate Shakespeare's lines into a comedy routine. My son and I thoroughly enjoyed watching the fruits of their creativity. My son was then inspired to research the food of the time period on his own. Big Fun Education's new program, "Reading Without Borders" brings authors together with students from around the world. The Hangouts on Air used by Big Fun Education provides a rare opportunity for both the authors and the students. Reading and writing are usually solitary experiences, but through programs like Reading Without Borders, people come together to learn from each other. 
BIG FUN Education	217364		/users/profile/280886	kevindmclaughlin	Volunteer	5	09/25/2014	I am soon to be a volunteer with Big Fun Education completely due to the inspirational message and work that they do. Annabelle Howard is one of the founders and I became very interested in her work with Big Fun Education and how it could help children with reading. As an educator in technology, I am always looking for ways that utilise technology to improve education. Big Fun Education uses technology very effectively and successfully. In a few week I will take part in one of their 'Reading without Borders' programs that uses Google Hangout on Air as the medium to connect with its worldwide audience, and I can't wait to take part in this opportunity.
BIG FUN Education	216912		/users/profile/280438	Andrew73	Volunteer	5	09/24/2014	When I was at school life was not always FUN but I survived thanks to my pleasure in reading . So now  to be involved with BIG FUN Education is a gift.     I am now a granddad but I wish I had had this resource when my children were growing up.  This is where adults give back in creativity to the children who always have it until it is lost the serious business of "growing up". We need to learn from the children how creativity really works - and here it does Please join in soon where education is BIG, FUN and CREATIVE
BIG FUN Education	216866		/users/profile/280387	mauilibrarian2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/24/2014	One word describes BIG FUN Education -- CREATIVE! Annabelle Howard is full of creative ideas that she can't wait to try. She brings out the creativity in students and teachers throughout the world. She inspires us all to explore our creative side.  BIG FUN Education is education at its best. I can hardly wait to see what Annabelle and BFE have in store for us next!

BIG FUN Education	215710		/users/profile/279148	ishanikhanna1	Volunteer	5	09/19/2014	Big Fun Education is a dream come true!  I am an educator living in the UAE.  Quite by chance, about a month ago, I found Big Fun Education on Google+ and things have been different since then! All at once, I ran into a team of extremely passionate, experienced, talented and creative individuals who surprisingly, were not sitting on their high horses in spite of their  successful personal lives.  Instead, they were very welcoming...almost as if , we had known one another for years and quickly accepted me into the community, supporting me in every possible way to make me feel comfortable. They are real people out there with a great mission and a genuine desire to make a difference to the world of literacy, globally.  This organization is providing incredible opportunities to children and teachers all around the world to see, feel and live wonderful sessions where interaction between the children and superbly creative and talented people is possible with the use of the internet and the advantages of Google Hangouts on Air.  Who knew education could be so much fun, so sociable!  One of their initiatives, Reading Without Borders, has been able to cross all geographic and cultural borders and bring all the children in the world into one big classroom...how fantastic is that! The impact of this is surely self explanatory.  How often do we get to meet an author without having to take immense trouble?  Big Fun Education is making this a reality and children and their teachers are able to share space with their favourite authors, getting a glimpse of their lives and what goes on in their world of writing or illustrating.  Moreover, children all across the world are getting the invaluable  opportunity of being  read to them by people from different parts of the world, who have chosen to do this only because they are people for whom caring for children makes a lot of sense.  Big Fun Education has opened up another avenue of being able to add a different meaning to life, of being a global citizen and spreading literacy all across the world.  Kudos to Big Fun Education!

BIG FUN Education	191833		/users/profile/250386	suzgood	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/30/2013	I am  an educator with classroom and administrative experience and have worked in both capacities in suburban and urban communities. During my time as a principal in an urban elementary school with a diverse school population, I began my relationship with Big Fun Productions. At that time, the company had created an online set of activities designed to help prep students for the state mastery tests. They were fun, aligned with the state standards of the time, were teacher friendly, and most importantly allowed students to work AT THEIR instructional level, thus allowing for true differentiation of instruction. The addition of the learning activities by BIG FUN was the one variable in instruction and test prep. Test results improved from one year to the next. By analyzing assessment data on a cohort of students over a course of 3 years there was no doubt in my mind of the value of these activities. The founders of BIG FUN have proven their creativity and commitment to student learning over the course of the 5 years I have been professionally acquainted with them. The plays they are now able to bring into the classroom are just the tool teachers need to emphasize 21st century learning and to tap into the learning style of each student with whom they teach daily. Every student who becomes involved with a play will reap an educational benefit.
BIG FUN Education	191003		/users/profile/249342	MHB56	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/17/2013	As a 30-year public school English teacher with a focus on Advanced Placement courses, I have found Big Fun Education has "got it right."  Big Fun Education's materials directly align with Common Core goals, build critical skills and knowledge, and engage students in learning through technology.   However, Big Fun Education is unique in that this non-profit's overarching goal is to preserve creativity and the joy of learning.  Big Fun Education recognizes the potential in student learning communities and in global sharing of resources; its products offer opportunities for individualized and group discovery.
BIG FUN Education	190818		/users/profile/249099	Marisa A.	Volunteer	5	12/15/2013	As a European mom, I came to know BIG FUN through the Internet. The idea behind this nonprofit convinced me from the beginning.  Since then I was able to see it at work and was not disappointed.  I only wish it would spread all over the world so more schools could benefit from it. Also, I am proud to say I had the opportunity to work in two of BIG FUN's projects. I collaborated with a colleague who teaches in Spain and we volunteered to translate a couple of plays into Spanish. I must confess I was amazed by the dedication, enthusiasm and creativity I found in BIG FUN managers, all of it put to the service of childrens education and development. Indeed, BIG FUN was had by both of us, and we look forward to translating more plays into Spanish.
BIG FUN Education	190533		/users/profile/248768	mikefisher821	General Member of the Public	5	12/13/2013	I work in schools across the United States and often reference Big Fun Education's plays as a Common Core aligned resource that is engaging for students and teachers. Besides creating a wonderful resource, BFE has created an opportunity for access to text that leverages visuals, listening and speaking, and vocabulary in a way that invites children into learning versus text alone. What you have in their resources is representatives of multiple types of educational research including brain-based learning, building background knowledge, vocabulary as a process, and voluminous reading. I'm very excited by what they are building here and the teachers I work with are excited about it when I share it with them.
BIG FUN Education	190350		/users/profile/248513	Stacy35	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/10/2013	As an educator with 22 years of experience in public, parochial, and private schools, I have found BIG FUN Education's products to be both motivational and extremely effective with a diverse group of learners.  My special education students, most of whom struggle with oral reading fluency, benefit enormously from being able to listen to a play while reading the script.  In addition, the real-world connections and multimedia vocabulary glosses increase both background information and students' attention.  Repeated readings enable my students to perform the plays with confidence.

In my estimation BIG FUN Education brings an exceptional wealth of talent, experience and international expertise in education and the arts to its teacher and student recipients, coupling prudent stewardship with an extraordinary contact list from their Harvard, Yale, Scholastic, American & British backgrounds in theatre, film, music, writing and education to provide young audiences and their educators with the highest level of proficiency and fluency in the classics while revising them to the target audience for accessibility's sake.

Their executive director is unappreciative, disrespectful, and alienates its supporters. While the cause they serve is amazing, the waste is apparent at the most important level.

Getting together with others of their own age and learning about the manifestations of grief & strategies to handle their own confusing emotions after a family member's death has helped many young people I have known over the years as a therapist.  And the youngsters have fun while doing all this work with their new friends at The Cove.  "Priceless."
Cove Center for Grieving Children Inc	166035	1	/users/profile/220583	simonetzel	Board Member	5	08/24/2013	Back in the 1990's, I lost my wife to ovarian cancer.  I have three children who now are in their 30's and, even today, are haunted by that tragic event.  Although The Cove was in its infancy at that time, unfortunately, I was unaware of its existence.  So I am very committed as Chair of The Cove's Trustees to touch as many lives of grieving children as we can and help them journey the path to healing.  The Cove has just opened a new Family Site in Easton, CT to service the grieving children and families in Fairfield County, CT including those affected by the tragic events in Newtown.      The Cove fully relies on donations of individuals and organizations.  As we push to expand our geographic reach with the goal of providing services to all children across Connecticut, our finances continue to be stretched and our need of support continues to grow.  I personally do not want any grieving child or family to have to walk that very difficult journey alone so I ask that The Cove Center for Grieving Children be selected to receive a grant.   Thank you. Simon Etzel

It was wonderful to be able to be with other families and share experiences together. The children each received care appropriate to their age, and I met with other parents - now alone too. At the end of each meeting we did a family activity which helped our communication and grieving. We still have a box with some of the items we made. My daughter appreciated the care so much she became a facilitator when she was in High School many years later to help grieving children like her.

It is surprising that there are little resources available to address this area. Thankfully, The Cove exists to address this.

Cove Center for Grieving Children Inc	115587	1	/users/profile/157402	Barbara H	Volunteer	5	06/17/2012	Children are truly the forgotten grievers. Consequently bereavement groups for children don't exist in the state....except for The Cove. The Cove does an incredible job of supporting grieving children and adolescents. Simply being together with grieving peers helps to reduce the tremendous isolation associated with grief. The age-appropriate activities help to normalize the grieving process and provide coping skills. Imagine the impact on a child/adolescent grieving the recent death of a loved one when a peer states, "It does get easier with time." Imagine the impact on the grieving participant when the facilitator talks about taking a break from their grief to participate in an activity they enjoy. Imagine the chance to express regrets in a supportive environment. Research has shown that how a child/adolescent copes with grief is directly impacted by how the parent(s) or caregivers cope with their grief. Thus The Cove offers a professionally-facilitated support group for parents while the children are in their groups. My volunteer experience with The Cove was incredible. I have no doubt that the organization has made a tremendous difference in the lives of hundreds of grieving families.

The Cove provided the comfort and support we needed during a very difficult time as well as connected us  with others who related our sadness. The Cove was a place for my children to meet others who have also experienced a profound loss it gave them the feeling of belonging. The Volunteers are sensitive , loving compassionate people who are trained in dealing with children and grief. I would highly recommend this program to anyone who is looking to learn how to support their children after the loss of a parent.

They were both very young when e passed, 4 1/2 years old and 1 week away from turning 2.  It has helped us open the doors for better communication and understanding of our different stages of grief and opened our hearts and lives to a wonderful new support system.  Every Sunday there is the excitement of heading to The Cove and seeing our new friends and the anticipation of what the activities will be.  Over the past 6 months I have seen my children grow in their understanding and acceptance of not having their Dad with us.  I have also seen their bravery and self confidence grow with who they are becoming.  I'm proud of them and admire their strength more each day.  It is partly due to workers at The Cove that have helped in understanding of their grief.  Having the knowledge that The Cove will be a continued part of our lives give us all so much comfort and strength.  Thank you to you all!

Through the work that facilitators, board members, volunteers and contributors do this supportive environment helps children learn to cope with their loss and successfully grow through this difficult change in their lives. It brings children together with other children their age who have experienced a similar loss, which makes them feel supported and more importantly not alone in their experience. Through creative activities and group work children are able to process and learn from their grief, and I have seen many children become happier kids that go on to help others like themselves. This unique non-profit also support the family as a whole, enabling families to learn together and grow as a family unit. Death is a hard topic and The Cove makes it a safe and loving environment to process feelings and emotions that others may not comprehend. I am grateful for this non-profit and all the hard work it does to support children and families. The growth of this non-profit is a testament to the positive impact it has on grieving children and families!

Two years ago, I started taking my children to The Cove.  They had always felt "different" from their friends because they did not have a dad.  The Cove helped them to see that they were not weird or alone.  The activities my children participate in, at The Cove, allow them to express their feelings about their father's death.  We have developed great freindships with the other families and I feel happy that my children have a place that can support them through their grief.   We LOVE The Cove and the good work they do for so many families.

The Cove became our home away from home two Sunday evenings each month> the children were surrounded by caring volunteers and insightful, understanding peers. As a new widow I was able to connect with and learn from a peer group of parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles and foster parents of other children experiencing grief in all its stages. Through crafts, games, and shared meals, we drew strength from one another as we created new lives from loss. Even a field trip to a funeral home became a positive experience.On a Sunday evening in November, we celebrated Thanksgiving with photos of our loved ones and favorite dishes. Even when the kids just played basketball together or sat side by side drawing there was comfort in knowing of our shared past experiences. The environment that the volunteers and facilitators helped to create was one of warmth and caring.

When the Cove set up a program in our area 2 years ago, we were happy to join and try it out.   The program has been amazing...it's a "safe" place where the kids all have a loss and grief in common.  They can express themselves  freely without fear of being again the "different" one.  They learn about ways to honor the memory of their missing loved one while moving on with their own lives.  The volunteers are all so energetic and caring, they really enjoy helping others.. There is such a need for this service in the community and these kids-and us parents- benefit so much by having this support group.

First I've known and partnered with Mary many years ago when we jointly ran a crochet club.  I watched Mary as her business grew and morphed through the years.  However I was touched with story and reason for Mary finding Molly's Babies, Inc.  With the passing of her granddaughter, Mary's heart was opened to the need of others and she put those ideas and concepts to fruition and has since touched the hearts of many in need.  If there is only one organization you can help, I encourage you to help with this one.    Cylinda  CrochetMemories.com

Molly's Babies Inc	127103		/users/profile/172144	CarolDaly	Advisor	4	10/18/2012	I have watched Founder, Mary Blake build Molly's Babies for several years.  She has contacted me often for advice about her website and other start-up issues.  Starting a non-profit isn't easy, and growing it is harder yet -- I know because I serve on the Boards of three non-profits and work for another.  I know that it takes a truly dedicated person at the helm to do what it takes to make things work as they should -- and Mary is one of the most dedicated and sincere.  Molly's Babies is very special to her .... it represents a promise she made while grieving over the loss of her darling granddaughter Molly, who would never know the joy of playing with a baby doll.   Mary couldn't change that for Molly; but she felt inspired to make it her mission to provide baby dolls to other little girls whose parents couldn't buy them one, or who have no family.   This, and only this, is her mission.  She isn't looking for accolades, nor money for herself.  She's actually invested a good bit of her own money, time, talent and skill to make this dream for little girls a reality.   I have given my financial support, and hope that you will do the same.   This is one non-profit and cause that you can feel good about.  Christmas is coming, as it does every year .... and little girls have birthdays all year long .... some families need a little extra help to make those days special for them.   You can be sure that Molly's Babies will make that happen for as many little ones as possible.  -- Carol Daly

Montage Initiative	115125		/users/profile/156831	Ingrid Stellmacher	Board Member	4	06/14/2012	Montage Initiative is not just another NGO, it is an invitation to help lift not only the women of India out of poverty and change their lives, but an opportunity to change your own.  It is hugely humbling yet incredibly inspiring to sit and share not only food with the poorest of women but also their dreams. That's when you realise that the only difference between their situation and yours is geography.  Women the world over want the same for their children, their families and their communities - the best.  To feed, clothe and educate them.  The reality, however, is that even the basics are hard enough to achieve in the developing world and the best is sadly a stretch to far for too many.  Montage Initiative works to transform that, bringing those dreams closer, enabling and empowering women by providing training, education and access to markets and helping them to create sustainable livelihoods.  The Montage team are a powerful, passionate group of dedicated professionals and volunteers who get things done.  As Gandhi urged: they are being the change they want to see.

The work it does in terms of empowering women and creating a sustainable living condition for them is something that shows they are not only concerned about helping women on their feet but also teaching them to make it on their own in the long  run.             Having worked with Montage through a service learning class has given me a chance to step into the lives of the women they reach out to. Their mission to give women around the world expanded opportunities uses every thing it can from Media, Art, and Volunteering to help spread the world. It is often said that if you educate a man you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman you educate a family and a nation. That is what Montage is doing with their vision. By helping the women to stand on their feet and also creating  a sustainable future for them, Montage has not only educated a family, but also helped a nation back on their feet.

I worked at the International Organization for Migration for 10 years in Geneva and then 11 years at Save the Children.  After losing my first husband at a young age,  I sought to find an organization that would help widows in the developing world.  The pilot project of Montage Initiative to help destitute widows in India and its mission to empower women, especially, some of the most vulnerable - the widows, was an amazing opportunity for me to help other women who have not been as fortunate as I have been.  i'm pleased to write this review to let others know about this amazing organization.

My favorite story is when founders Joanne and Ingrid left on a trip to India, and they did not just instigate programs they believed the women of India needed--but instead Joanne and Ingrid lived with the women, gained their trust, and then asked--what do you need? Montage Initiative is born from trust and friendship. The group of individuals leading the INGO are always popping with novel ideas, purposeful and realistic planning, and unbelievably quick implementation. You could not go wrong contributing to this NGO--their hearts are right on their sleeves, they are incredibly transparent, and undoubtedly inspiring.  
Montage Initiative	113359		/users/profile/154263	Klevisa	Volunteer	5	05/31/2012	Montage Initiative is a unique non-profit organization with powerful leadership, vision, keen awareness of art, and strong drive to help people.  Only a few years old, it has already grown so much and touched the lives of many, especially by helping to improve the quality of life of widows in India. As I found out, one major way in which Montage Initiative does this is through its feature film project, stunning photography, film footage and videos, and artistic designs for fundraising events. I was fortunate to become involved with Montage Initiative through service learning at Fairfield University because I have learned so much, gained great experience, and met wonderful people, all the while helping to make a difference through the various projects of Montage Initiative. I have enjoyed working with projects like the Travelling Art Gallery and service learning because they have given me the opportunity to really expand what I can do and truly become involved, things which I didnt really have much confidence in myself about before Montage. The CEO and leadership of Montage Initiative do a fantastic job at educating all the volunteers on tasks, events, and more. With the leaderships attention to detail, care for all their volunteers, and dedication to teaching us and making us part of the family, Montage Initiative has succeeded in building a strong team of supporters. It struck me how the heads of Montage Initiative are always working tirelessly with Montage participants and partners to make sure that events and projects turn out the best possible. Montage translates this same attitude of care towards all with whom it engages: the leadership, volunteers, partners, and of course the people whose lives it works to improve.

The only difference between the women we met in India and the women we are is geography. As our trip to Vrindavan drew to a close, we knew our world would never be the same again, and we pledged to one another that we would do all we could to make a lasting and sustainable difference in theirs: Our pledge is Montage Initiative.

The only difference between the women we met in India and the women we are is geography.   As our trip in November drew to a close, we knew our world would never be the same again, and we pledged to one another that we would do all we could to make a lasting and sustainable difference in theirs: Our pledge was HeartShare International.  We left our lives under the banner of HeartShare to make this journey, made our own sacrifices to get here along with the help of a handful of women, many of whom we had never met and whose stories we didnt know yet who donated anonymously, generously and spontaneously, all in the space of just twenty-four hours, so that we could make this trip for them and that they could make a difference too.    An unforgiving wind swept through the open sides of our rickshaw carrying the rain deep inside our cab. Its not normally cold like this, shouted our guide above the engine noise, grinning over his shoulder and bouncing wildly in his seat as we hit crater after crater in the road.  The traditional Indian clothes we wore in honor of the women whose stories we had come to share gave little comfort from the cold and no protection from the elements, though being wedged tightly against one another did create a kind of seatbelt stability in the back, for which I was grateful as we had none.  The dirt roads, which were no more than narrow tracks in places, became a sea of mud in a matter of moments, seeping into our open-toed sandals each time we stepped out.  The last time I felt mud like this was making mud pies as a child in the garden.  Back then I was making my dolls eat it; sticking my bare feet in it wasnt part of the game until my shoe slipped off when my mother called me in for lunch.  This was no game though.  This was real, and neither the guide books nor our lives back in our native countries had prepared us for this.   It was meant to be warm; we had no coats, no sweaters, no boots or umbrellas and no idea of the depth of poverty we would see or of the height of inspiration our hearts would soar to. And so we carried on. Our first mission to buy socks for the widows at Vrindavan, requested by one donor, was one of many lessons learned and an example of how a small item of such seeming inconsequence in our lives can make such a big difference in theirs.  For a woman who has lost her husband, her home and her life, warm feet are a great comfort and a pair of socks a luxury.        With the generous help of Dr. Mohini Giri, herself a widow, and the tremendous organization she created, The Guild of Service, born from her own painful experience, we were able to encounter one of the many faces of India that outside the country few really see, at her widows shelter Ma Dham and some of the surrounding villages where the Guild helps.It is hard to comprehend how an entire society can reject a woman simply because she has been widowed, much less her own family.   There are approximately forty-one million widows in India. Of the twenty thousand living on the streets that make their way to Vrindavan, the holy birth place of Lord Krishna, Ma Dham houses only one hundred twenty.   In or out of the shelter, however, these women lose their status to invisibility and pray for the same thing-- an early release from this life and an end to their suffering.   A woman could be married at seventeen, be a mother at eighteen, and a widow at nineteen.  Now considered bad luck by her family, her life would be a long and difficult one, alone.   Among the women we interviewed at Ma Dham, which offers them shelter, sisterhood, safety and sustenance, fate had taken its toll on their spirits and their faces, aging them prematurely, yet still they kept on smiling.  Toothless, some of them, and poorly sighted, I found their loss of value to the world was a doubly harsh sentence to swallow.   If they are widowed without children, the stigma is not the same, and society accepts their remarriage; but once she is a mother and a widow, its a different story.  Since when did motherhood become such a crime, I wondered, and women become so worthless?  One lady we interviewed, a widow in her sixties suffering from osteoporosis and a former employee of Indias Ministry of Finance, widowed for over twenty years and at Ma Dham for three, was asked how she thought India treated its widows.   Articulate and in excellent English, her response was damning and evident: Terrible, she said, with a defiant strength in her eyes far greater than that of her frail body, Terrible.  The Guild helps not only widows, but also women in local villages, to form empowerment groups, and it offers computer lessons for some of the children.  Though internet connection was haphazard and the computers were aging, their teacher and Ma Dhams head, Mr. Dastagir Ali Azam, was eager to show us just what the children could do, ranging from Excel spread sheets to complex pictures.  Without printers, however, parents never got to see their childrens efforts, but then, printers needed paper, and paper, like socks, was a luxury. At one primary school we visited, run by the Social Outreach Foundation in Nodia, headed by one of Dr. Mohinis colleagues, Prabha Grover, and set up for children of rickshaw drivers who couldnt afford the cost of their childs education, we heard well-disciplined and well-educated children tell us their hopes and dreams.  Many of the boys wanted to be computer programmers or lawyers.  The girls wanted to be teachers, nurses or doctors.  To show recognition to students, instead of awarding them with childrens gift vouchers, computers or IPods, we gave them bars of soap, pencils and pads. As with socks and paper, we were back to basics, and it was impossible to imagine the kind of poverty these children returned to each day or their simple struggle to be more educated than their parents.  The pride and ambition of these children were both humbling and inspiring, and it was clear that the greatest gift of both Ma Dham and the Outreach School was giving not only knowledge but pride, things many children in the developed world have yet to encounter.     We turned a corner and entered our last village, Ramtal Ka Nagla, about three miles from Ma Dham, to meet another womens empowerment group eager to hear what we had to say and give their permission to be filmed.  By now we were running so behind schedule that some women had returned to market where they were selling jars of pickles they had made but came hurrying back to join us.  We met in the crche, a room with a rug but no glass in the windows, just bare concrete and care. Such tiny tots, so well behaved, sitting on the floor like the rest of us, all in a row; their little hearts touched mine and I wondered what their future would be.  All that these people have is each other, and they use that strength to their benefit.  Each woman, with the approval of her husband, saves fifty to one hundred rupees a month, just over a dollar; they are about to open a bank account so that if anyone in the village needs financial help, they will have access to money they could not otherwise receive. That these women, mostly uneducated and illiterate, had organized themselves in this way because they wanted to take charge of their own lives, and improve them, was inspiring.  With no running water in the villages if the tanker doesnt come, and it usually doesnt, these women have to walk miles to bring some back. While we were there to assess the opportunities for work, microfinance, and training, it was clear that the most immediate need for all the women we met in the villages was water and toilets.  Water, the source of life and a basic human necessity that we more often than not take for granted, is often lacking, and proper sanitation is impossible. Through the sea of mud women came.  Women dressed in such bright colours as to make your heart sing.  Carrying themselves with such dignity and grace, wearing smiles that seemed in total contrast to the struggle they faced.  The womens empowerment groups did more than just empower or inspire these women  they empowered and inspired us --to do all we could and be more than we were.  This is the real face of India.  It is the face of humanity, and she is beautiful, bold and determined.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	54289		/users/profile/55497	jao89	Volunteer	5	10/01/2010	Cambodia Children's Education Fund (CCEdFund) is an excellent organization that provides meaningful and sustainable assistance to the Cambodian population by providing scholarships to orphaned but promising children.  I have worked with the organization as their campaign coordinator so that we could raise enough funds to send 2 more children to school.  The way that CCEdFund handles the donations they receive and how they interact with their scholarship recipients is truly unique.  I would really like to see them expand their efforts as the year comes to a close and to provide more scholarships to more promising young Cambodians.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	54215		/users/profile/55423	dpowengarber	Donor	5	09/30/2010	I strongly support the work of CCEdFund which is changing the lives of children in Cambodia, 22 children at present.  I have promoted the organization to numerous individuals because I share the founders' belief that to create the leaders of tomorrow in Cambodia one must plant the seeds in the minds of the youth there.  To read the accounts of the students' accomplishments can literally bring tears to one's eyes.  To see where those children live and how little they have tugs at one's heartstrings.  I hope to have the opportunity to travel to Cambodia one day and meet some of these children.  They are Cambodia's future and I applaud the work of the CCEdFund to help them.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	54087	1	/users/profile/55290	jmg	Donor	5	09/30/2010	Shortly after the organization and qualification of Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc. as a charitable entity its purpose and vision was explained to me by one of its organizers, Carrie Garber.  She spoke from first hand knowledge of the poverty and societal cruelty to the youngest and most vulnerable members of the Cambodian population.  I was immediately impressed with her understanding of the situation and the need for immediate action.  The record of the growing number of children that the Fund has helped educate gives me hope that Carrie and Jennifer's generation understands the need for international charitable involvement to turn back poverty and ignorance.  In these difficult economic times I have personally budgeted funds to ensure that the education of the children of Cambodia continues  through the efforts of Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53952	1	/users/profile/55121	cstahlke	Donor	5	09/29/2010	My personal experiences with CCEdFund have mostly taken place vicariously through Carrie Garber, one of its co-founders.  After learning that Carrie was running an NGO while also juggling law school, I became interested in what it was that compelled her.  When she explained that the organization was founded to help Cambodian trash pickers, I became even more interested.  I had heard of the Khmer Rouge at that point, but I didn't fully appreciate the devastation that Cambodia continues to suffer as a result.  Carrie patiently explained the dire need of many Khmer children, and quickly sold me on CCEdFund as a way that I could help these people so far away.I have attended and participated in a handful of fundraising events, and I remain a consistent donor.  This has only been bolstered by my recent trip to Cambodia.  I traveled to Cambodia last month, and I was truly saddened to see so many starving and despondent children in every city I visited.  Though I was there on vacation to celebrate a recent personal accomplishment, I was humbled by the Khmer people and their story.  Seeing it all in person, from the killing fields to the remaining catastrophic effects of the Khmer Rouge, has only strengthened my loyalty to this organization.  CCEdFund provides for me a special opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way, where I can be certain that any money I donate will be used first and foremost to help the Khmer children.  For that, I am extremely grateful.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53869	1	/users/profile/55010	jeff24	Donor	5	09/29/2010	I've been very impressed with the work they do to both raise funds in the US and actively establish ties to schools in Cambodia by visiting and interacting with the teachers and school leaders there. I've discussed multiple times with the founders and leaders of CCEdFund the advances the children they support have made. I think they've made great progress towards improving their system of identifying promising students and transitioning those students into schools that are at the appropriate level for them. While there might previously have been an issue with this, they've since adapted the system to include an intermediate level so their support achieves the greatest success for any individual student.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53399		/users/profile/54536	abronson	Donor	5	09/27/2010	My sister first told me about CCEd Fund, and being a NYC teacher I quickly became intersted. As I learned more about the organization and the amazing people behind it, I am inspired to work harder at my job everyday.  It is difficult for me to look beyond the immediate problem of the achievement gap in our country, so I am very proud to support such an important organization that is looking to help solve a global problem.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53186		/users/profile/54263	jknc09	Client Served	5	09/23/2010	Tell your story here and help others understand this charity            I had the pleasure to participate in the charity benefits held in New York City & Greenwich, CT which were wonderful presentations on what amazing work the charity performs. The stories presented by its co-founders Jen Kinberg & Carrie Garber always give a real sense of what tough situations the children in Cambodia are presented with and natural struggle to aspire for a better way of life. I can't wait to participate in further events and opportuniies with CCEF in the future.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53180		/users/profile/54253	papa-jimbo	Donor	5	09/23/2010	We discovered CCEdF though our daughter-in-law who who saw the plight of the poor in Cambodia, recognized the essential role of an excellent education, and decided to do something about it.CCEdF provides scholarships to children of promise who in turn will help their fellow countrymen rise up from poverty. The latest recipients were children living in a garbage dump. They were selected from a number of fine candidates. The glad news is two human beings have been given a chance to develop, to evolve, and to help others in return. The sad news is that so many could not be helped due to lack of resources.The young women who founded this charity are passionate educators who contribute their time to identify interview,and select worthy recipents. They also make presentations, maintain the website, and raise the funds to get the job done. The program has Zero overhead; ALL funds go directly to scholarships. The need is great. The program is excellent. We are glad to suppport CCEdF.Pam and Jim Leahy
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53143		/users/profile/54221	cory2	Board Member	5	09/23/2010	This is an amazing charity helping to give Cambodia a chance. After the Khmer Rouge, the culture structure of the country was demolished, and education was largely lost. Slowly, Cambodia has been rebuilding with the help of others.Cambodia's Children Education Fund helps make that happen. It is an unbelievable program for the country and has changed many children's lives.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53132		/users/profile/54208	tim-sam	Donor	5	09/23/2010	You're never going to find people who truly care more about the mission of their organization than the people at CCEdFund. They always continue to push the bounds and never let themselves be satisfied with just a comfortable base of students. It is amazing to see them grow the organization year after year, and I can't wait to see where they go with things in the future. Way to make a difference!
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53113		/users/profile/54181	jaclynk1414	Donor	5	09/22/2010	I've been helping at the CCEF fundraisers since they organization began and have been able to watch the transformation in these dedicated kids. They are eager to learn and Jennifer and Carrie give them that opportunity. A better education means a brighter future for these kids and for Cambodia.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53111		/users/profile/54180	gk8989	Donor	5	09/22/2010	CCed Fund is a terrific organization. Their staff are very dedicated, caring people. They will go out of their way to help these under privledged children in any way they can. I'm proud to contribute to this cause and hope more people will too.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	53097		/users/profile/54163	janebond4	Donor	5	09/22/2010	CCedFund is a great organization. The founders are extremely dedicated to their cause. They are constantly looking for new ways to raise funds and awareness for the children of Cambodia who they hope to save from a life of poverty. Their hard work is evidenced by the Cambodian children they have already been able to provide an education for.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	52587		/users/profile/53528	tiffany4	Donor	5	09/16/2010	Carrie and Jen's generosity and large hearts never cease to amaze me.  Regardless that they are both very successful in their respective professions, they take a huge amount of time to make a difference in another part of the world. They are global leaders and the world would be a little less bright if these two hadn't teamed up during their time in Teach for America to bring education to a region that not many Americans think about.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	52527		/users/profile/53462	cmm384	General Member of the Public	5	09/16/2010	In March of 2010, I traveled with Jennifer Kinberg Leahy and Carrie Garber to Cambodia. In Cambodia Jennifer and Carrie took me on tours of the various orphanages where their scholarship recipients lived and the schools they attended. I was able to see the children in their daily lives and routines. I saw their living conditions, and their learning conditions. I was also shown the living conditions of the general population in Cambodia, and the condition of a public school in Cambodia. By seeing both the public schools and the private schools in Cambodia, I was able to see how truly amazing the gift Jennifer and Carrie give to those children really is. They are given an opportunity to attend excellent schools that they would never be able to attend under ordinary circumstances. They are given a superior education, far above what they could receive in the public schools. Cambodia's Children Education Fund seeks out children with potential who can one day lead successful lives. Jennifer and Carrie's organization changes the path of those children's lives. They begin their lives on the streets fending for themselves, or in orphanages abandoned by their family, or all alone in the world. Without those scholarships, the children would continue to live on the streets, or continue to live an dreamless lives. With the scholarships from CCEd Fund, they can be properly educated. Their job opportunities will drastically increase. They no longer have to live in survival mode, they can begin to envision a  future for themselves. While in Cambodia, I met several children who touched my heart. One teenage girl was so confident and comfortable at her school that she participated in the school singing competition. She has big dreams to study medicine with a singing career on the side. What is amazing is that she is able to dream about an amazing future. A nine year old boy seemed quiet at first, but he quickly warmed up to me, and was eager to have me look through his school notebooks at all of his great work. He went from not speaking any English when he first met Jennifer and Carrie to sharing entire stories he wrote in english only a few years later. I also met a nine year old girl who is very bright, and has a huge heart. Her mother is a prostitute. Her path could have led her to return to her mother, and then slowly learn what living on the streets was really like. However, with the scholarship she received from the CCEd fund, she is already living a brighter life. She attends a wonderful school where she is constantly challenged. She lives in a nice orphanage where they value the education she receives and support her. She is allowed to focus on her education and herself rather than having to neglect her education to make money for her family. Jennifer and Carrie put a lot of work into finding schools that are just right for the students. They research the best schools, but also make sure the schools they pick are a good match for those particular scholarship recipients. If a student is not finding success at the school they find an environment where they will be able to meet their full potential. They are sensitive to each recipient's wants and needs. The children I met while in Cambodia not only are bright potential leaders, they all were kind and compassionate. Each student looked out for the others. They care about Jennifer and Carrie as much as Jennifer and Carrie care about them. One girl even used what little money she had to buy thank you gifts for me, Jennifer, Carrie, and the other people went on this trip with us.  Jennifer and Carrie are also two people with huge hearts. They frequently travel to Cambodia with their own funds to interview and select the perfect scholarship recipients. They ensure that their recipients receive proper education but they go above and beyond that. They see to it that the recipients receive proper nutrition and health care as well. They make sure they have school supplies, and that they are happy in the both orphanages and schools they good to.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	52464		/users/profile/53382	jrogarber	Donor	5	09/15/2010	This charity was created because the two founders recognized the lack of educational opportunities for gifted Cambodian children.  In a situation of extreme poverty, these children would otherwise have no opportunity to help advance their own situation or that of their nation.  By helping to build an educated class of people in this developing nation, this charity will significantly help the development of Cambodia.
Cambodia's Children Education Fund, Inc.	52462		/users/profile/53380	jchristian	Donor	5	09/15/2010	I can't say enough how impressed I am by CCEdFund.  Carrie and Jennifer, the Fund's Directors, go to great lengths to ensure the children they support are excelling in their studies and attending Cambodia's best schools.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	189395		/users/profile/247237	TrishMartin	Donor	5	11/27/2013	I am so happy to be receiving the regular communications from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and have easy access to its website.  Both are full of updates on research across the US and abroad about new treatments and their possibilities.  Hearing about Kathy Giusti and her non-stop efforts to get the medical community and the pharmaceutical community to work together is so impressive.  I have great respect for her and the way she has established this foundation and its focus on putting the best minds together to find a cure for Multiple Myeloma.  The most important aspect of this connection is the hope it offers.  After reading the new information, I am always encouraged.  I feel this is evidence that all involved are working their hardest and using all of the available resources to help ME.  I can't ask for anything more.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	189145		/users/profile/246896	Bob_53	Volunteer	5	11/23/2013	When I was diagnosed with MM in 2010, my daughter and niece found out about MMRF and immediately signed up to walk in the Chicago area Race for Research which was a week after my surgery. My wife, sister, brother-in-law, and son-in-law also walked on that rainy chilly fall day, but, from that walk, we have discovered what an outstanding organization MMRF is. The information they have provided about MMRF and the progress being made in  its treatment has been so helpful as we have navigated our own journey with the illness. And the fact that MMRF has helped not only to fund much of the research but to spur some of that research and the collaborative way in which it is done is truly amazing. To top it all off, they are very resourceful in the way that they manage the funds they have raised so that almost all of  it goes into research. We have walked in both the Chicago and Twin Cities races since 2011 and have raised over $22,000 for MMRF. We look forward to joining family and friends each year hoping that a cure will be found soon. 
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	189144		/users/profile/246895	HalAnderson	Volunteer	5	11/23/2013	As a 15 year survivor of multiple myeloma, I credit the MMRF with speeding new treatments through the approval process so that I have always had other options available to me.  I am grateful for the work they do to get researchers and clinicians, as well as patients, to work together to facilitate efficient progress.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	189090		/users/profile/246827	deborahdietzler	Volunteer	5	11/22/2013	When my sister was diagnosed with MM in late April 2011, I was grateful to learn of the work of the MMRF and determined to get involved with this organization.  In the last two and a half years, I have run 4 marathons as a member of MMRF Power Team, participated in the Empire State Run Up, run 2 Race for Research 5Ks in Atlanta, and attended the 2011 Gala.  To say that I am thankful for the work of MMRF is to severely understate my feelings.  The advances made possible through MMRF's research and advocacy are why my sister is still with us today.  Until there is a cure, I will continue to devote as much energy as I am able to this worthwhile organization.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	189038		/users/profile/246752	mitzy	Client Served	5	11/21/2013	My journey with MMRF began with my diagnosis in 2009.  The organization is so well run with such singular focus, the results they achieve are truly life-saving.  When I relapsed this year, I knew there were more options available due in part to the tireless work of MMRF.  Family & friends look forward to the Race for Research in CA & IL.  It's rewarding to raise funds & know exactly where the money is going.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	189017		/users/profile/246722	michaelr	Client Served	5	11/21/2013	My wife was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma in in 2008. By July 2012 she had already had one stem cell transplant, gone into remission and then had the myeloma return. All of the available drugs had failed to hold the disease at bay. If it weren't for Carfilzomib becoming available that month, a drug the MMRF helped speed to market she probably wouldn't be with us today, in remission again. Simply put, the MMRF helped save my wife's life. This amazing organization is fundamentally changing cancer research and drug development as we know it. All of us will benefit one way or another as the rest of the research world adapts to their method of open cooperation between all stake holders, including patients.   
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188981		/users/profile/246656	diving2drums	Donor	5	11/21/2013	MMRF is a remarkable foundation.  They have found the magic model.  Their mission is simple: cure the disease, and help patients on the way.  They are not distracted from their mission by self-sustaining fund raising.  They create a remarkable connection between the leading edge of medical discovery and individual patients through a compassionate and caring community, the staff of MMRF.  Few in number, they bring the best docs face to face with patients and family, and work closely with pharm companies who want to drop the traditional ways of secretive research, and only work with a community of docs and companies who are willing to share data and results in the quickest manner.  That's quite obviously why such rapid medical advances are taking place through MMRF and their approach to a cure.  Our family has been touched by too many cancers.  I've volunteered and contributed to many cancer causes and foundations.  I'd not known of MMRF or the impact of multiple myeloma until my brother-in-law was diagnosed.   I've never seen a foundation so efficient in delivering services and information to patients and their families.  I've never seen one so diligent and committed to leveraging resources in  enabling direct medical studies.  And, I've never seen one so focused on the cure, not self-sustainment.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188962		/users/profile/246631	Allan17	Client Served	5	11/20/2013	I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma 5 years ago.  The treatments I received, and continue to receive, were all developed through research funded by the MMRF.  I feel very strongly that I would not be alive today if it were not for the MMRF.  Since Multiple Myeloma is a relatively rare cancer, research into a cure for it does not receive much government funding.  Thus, the work done by the MMRF to fund important research is critical.  Funds raised by the MMRF are well spent as over 90% of all donations go directly to research, patient education, and support.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188950		/users/profile/246610	TracyS	Volunteer	5	11/20/2013	I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma in December of 2010 and am in a complete remission. I am amazed at the work that the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation does. Their work increases the  life span of patients diagnosed with this incurable disease. They have funded development of new drugs that patients can take when other drugs have failed to control MM. This charity has changed the course of MM-making it more of a chronic disease and increasing the life expectancy of those suffering from MM. They also hold educational meetings for patients and caregivers. Recently message boards were introduced where patients can come together to support each other.  They are striving towards their ultimate goal of finding a cure by sharing data among researchers. The staff at the MMRF is amazing. I feel that we are a team working together to help raise funds to support this great nonprofit. I have attended small and large gatherings, races and an awards dinner. Though the events are different, the feeling among all the attendees is always the same. Our lives would not be the same without the MMRF. There is not a greater or more productive nonprofit than the MMRF.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188929		/users/profile/246588	SusanInNH	Client Served	5	11/20/2013	I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2011.  Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer. Thanks to the MMRF, this cancer is being battled with new drug and treatment therapies that have emerged because of the support of the MMRF.  Because the CEO has multiple myeloma herself, she understands the complexities of the illness, its effects on the body, and the urgent need for continued research into new therapies.  Those of us with MM want and cure.  Based on the work of the MMRF, it is not hard to believe that a cure will be found. Additionally, everyone I've come into contact with at the MMRF is fantastic!  They are supportive, knowledgable, and are intent on finding new therapies and a cure.  I can regularly expect emails or calls from the MMRF just checking in on me to see how I am managing my illness and how I am feeling.  They recently launched a new Gateway, which brings together those of us with MM from around the world into a forum to exchange information and ideas, as well as to offer support.  The Gateway will continue to bring topics of importance to participants and to the MMRF as well.  It's an amazing opportunity for clients, caregivers, and researchers alike. I am involved in the MMRF 5k Race for Research in Boston.  I will always support the MMRF through this race and other opportunities, because I know they are leading the way in finding a cure and are using their research dollars prudently, expeditiously, and with focused intention.  They are an organization that so clearly understands their priorities and objectives.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188922		/users/profile/246581	lauderdale.kimberly	Client Served	5	11/20/2013	My Dad was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma in 2011 and very quickly was given 4-6 weeks to live.  Thanks to the research and Doctors we were able to resource from the MMRF we were given two more years with my Dad.  It wasn't a cure but we were given more time and that was a gift.  He passed away June 2013.  I have been involved with the annual MMRF 5k race for the cure in DC for the past 3 years (my dad crossed the finish line in 2012  after a bone marrow transplant) and I am passionate about staying involved with the MMRF in order to help find a cure and honor my Dad's battle.  The few staff members I have had the privilege to meet are passionate about what they do.  Thank you MMRF....here's to finding a cure!
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188919		/users/profile/246577	JessicaTH7986	Volunteer	5	11/20/2013	My dad lost his 11 year battle with myeloma about two years ago.  While we miss him every day, I know that if not for the MMRF, my dad's battle would have been much shorter.  The MMRF has been incredible in bringing new treatments to the market and for that, my family and I are forever grateful as it prolonged my dad's life. Also, the MMRF has provided a real sense of togetherness for our family with other families affected by myeloma.  We have been fundraising by participating in the Chicago Race for Research for 13 years, and have even gone on to find new, creative ways to raise money and awareness for this amazing organization.  Since the MMRF donates an almost unheard of over 90 cents of each dollar directly toward research, AND shares information with other worthy organizations, it is easy to rally the help of our family and friends for this cause.  We sincerely look forward to our time spent raising much needed funds and awareness for the MMRF and will continue doing it even more in the future.   To everyone at the MMRF, thank you for everything you do!
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188912		/users/profile/105402	Jack	Volunteer	5	11/20/2013	I was diagnosed with Myeloma in 1995 so I was all ears when I saw Kathy Giusti and her sister Karen being interviewed about starting the MMRF.  I've always been impressed with the way Kathy has applied her prior business planning experience towards developing a successful business model for raising dollars for research and making sure those dollars pay off in succesful applications. I support the MMRF for all they've accomplished and continue to produce advances in myeloma treatments and long-term survivorship.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188830		/users/profile/246455	Believe	Donor	5	11/19/2013	I have been living with Myeloma for almost 12 years now (diagnosed at age 34).  I was introduced  to the MMRF in 2003 when a friend of mine read an article in Family Circle, about this young woman, Kathy Giusti,  who had myeloma and along with her twin sister, started the MMRF.  Since then my husband , many friends and I have been avid supporters of the MMRF.  This organization had given me great hope that someday there will be a cure for my cancer.  This organization has done so much for Myeloma, a once unknown, underfunded cancer.  MMRF has not only advanced research and treatments for Myeloma but for 30 other cancers.  The efforts of the MMRF and their partners, Pharma and research centers, have brought 6 new drugs to help treat Myeloma.  6 drugs in less than 10 years!! An unheard of achievement in the research world!! Their research is also looking into the genetics of this disease and finding drugs that focus on our specific genetic abnormality....which there are many.  I am eternally grateful to the the MMRF...because of them I have hope, hope for a long, quality filled life with my family and friends!
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188829		/users/profile/246452	PGHL	Client Served	5	11/19/2013	I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008.  I almost immediately heard about the mmrf through a friend and patient.  The work this group does to 1) share information/research and 2) to put patients together with other patients who have similar aspects of my disease is awesome.  They have been setting the standard and pushing the envelope for cancer research as a whole.  It is for this reason that I push myself to "give back" and raise money to fight MM.  Thanks to the mmrf, it is my opinion that MM will become a chronic rather than mortal disease in my lifetime.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188813		/users/profile/246426	sjkmustang	Volunteer	5	11/18/2013	I was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma in 2008.  At that time I started to do a lot of research and found the MMRF.  I signed up for their informative newsletter and from there my life changed.  I was asked to be on the MMRF Power Team for the Empire State Building Run Up  I used that race to get the message out to everyone what a great organization the MMRF is.  I am now training for my third ESBRU as a Power Team Member.  But what is so special  about this is the people I met at the MMRF and through the MMRF.  I have attended and participated in other MMRF events.  I am proud to be a member of an organization that does so much for research.
Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, Inc.	188807		/users/profile/246419	DavidGoad13	Volunteer	5	11/18/2013	I got involved in fundraising for MMRF because my brother is a Multiple Myeloma survivor, but I continue to put my heart and soul into fundraising with them because I know a majority of the funds are going directly to research, and because I have such respect for founder Kathy Giusti and the events team members who coordinate the fundraising activities. They make sure I am equipped with the knowledge and tools I need to maximize donations and even help with qualified expert advice on endurance training. And... they are just plain "good people." MMRF is doing big things with a small but mighty team!
Slant Of Light Theater Company	80747	1	/users/profile/88123	cliff	Volunteer	4	03/01/2011	Slant of  Light looks to be a rising star in the Connecticut community Theatre arena. Of the many community Theatres, SOL is a proactive and outreaching organizatino that is attempting to bring all forms of theatre arts to the community. I look forward to good things to come from this organization and hope to be a consistent volunteer.
Slant Of Light Theater Company	80654		/users/profile/88028	Rok25	Volunteer	5	02/28/2011	I have been working closely with Slant of Light since September 2010.  I continue to work with them and have no intention of leaving due to the amazing experiences I have had thus far with the company.  SoL attracts positive people who are driven by a zest for life.  I truly believe that Slant of Light can do whatever it sets out to do because of the atmosphere it creates.  The people involved create everything; and the people involved breed success, a safe work space, and a true passion for life and the arts.  
Slant Of Light Theater Company	75449		/users/profile/82414	retlaws	Volunteer	5	02/25/2011	Working with Slant of Light has been nothing short of an awesome experience. My thoughts are respected and my assistance is appreciated. I've met many new people through Slant of Light and continue to do so. Not just coworkers, but friends. Good people surround Slant of Light which helps make it a great organization. I have no plans to stop working with this group of good people.
Slant Of Light Theater Company	75160		/users/profile/82101	writer	Client Served	5	02/24/2011	On February 23, 2011, Slant of Light Theater did a reading of my one act play, Good Riddance, that was magnificent!.  It was more like a throroughly rehearsed production than a reading. I could not have been more pleased to have their talented actors deliver my play in such a wonderful way. 
Slant Of Light Theater Company	75118	1	/users/profile/76929	Abbie C.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/24/2011	Slant of Light is an excellent new theatre company creating forward-thinking, innovative, and relevant theatre through the different branches of the company that produce experimental new works, socially and politically relevant plays, and educational outreach that uses theatre to explore issues challenging todays youth. The projects that this company pursues surpass the traditional boundaries of theatre. They are not only focused on engaging the community about current issues but on giving the community a venue in which to respond to these issues. The Rail Against the Headlines and the New Play Reading Series present works by many Connecticut authors and SOLs play M&Ms IN HEAVEN provokes conversations about body image and self-esteem in local middle schools. SOL demands professionalism while encouraging people to step out of preconceived theatre jobs in order to more fully collaborate. This unique approach to contemporary theatre enlivens both the participants and the productions and gives ownership of the plays to every individual involved. I love working with this company and look forward to my continuing involvement and to SOL's growth and evolution.
Slant Of Light Theater Company	74353		/users/profile/81238	Heather	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2011	I love Slant of Light and everything it stands for. It raises awareness of  topics that most people don't talk about, but are very important to society. SOL provides a "safe space" and gives a voice to those of us who sometimes need that extra encouragment. 
Slant Of Light Theater Company	73955	1	/users/profile/80818	Natalie G.	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	Slant of Light is an organization that has a lot of heart and soul.  It is a mission-based organization that works towards that mission with every ounce of its being.  They are a relatively new organization and are very much working to find their way, make their presence known, be financially viable, and make a difference in the world all at the same time.  Any one of those would be a big goal to have on its own, but working toward all of them at the same time is nothing short of ambitious.  They are doing a great job so far under the leadership of their artistic director, Stacy Ruttenberg.  Her passion and efforts are nothing short of admirable.    She has really tried to choose people and productions that are worthy of what Slant of Light is and hopes to be in the future...so far so good!
Slant Of Light Theater Company	73534		/users/profile/80362	Lady GoGo	Volunteer	4	02/23/2011	I wholeheartedly support Slant of Light Productions and their mission of communication and awareness as key to inspiring action.  
Slant Of Light Theater Company	73384		/users/profile/80199	Katrina Y.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	Slant of Light is innovative and always seeking to do new work.  I know that the members who run it are intelligent, amazing, well-rounded and truly excellent in their craft.   I admire that they are always striving to present new work, and it's important to keep their work going!
Slant Of Light Theater Company	73218		/users/profile/80026	Susan cinoman	Client Served	5	02/22/2011	I'm a playwright and screenwriter whose work has been performed often in New York City and internationally. Several of my plays have had reading at Slant of Light Theatre Company. The atmosphere of the company is extremely warm and welcoming. The company can feel proud  of its efficiency, hospitality and artistic insight. I very much enjoyed working with the Artistic Director of the company, Stacey Ruttenberg, and would not hesitate to work with them again in the future. They deserve all good things in the future. 
Slant Of Light Theater Company	73175		/users/profile/79982	Jillian W.	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	I have been a supporter of Slant of Light Theater Company since it's inception.  I am proud to say I support a non-profit that truly gives back to the whole community and not just a specific socio-economic group.  SOL provides programs that bring to light very intense and debatable issues.  They don't stop there; they then partner up with educational and volunteer groups to provide educational resources to continue the public's growing knowledge.  I have been able to attend events and have also seen what goes on behind the scenes.  The energy and compassion that goes into every fundraiser and production is dynamic.  Slant of Light is gearing up for it's 3rd CT Idol Fundraiser at Daniel St. in Milford and each year the fundraiser provides interactive entertainment for all ages and enables SOL to continue to foster change and action in the community.
Slant Of Light Theater Company	73095		/users/profile/79901	Diana	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2011	What are young artists looking for in a theatre company? We are looking for a place to find refuge in a world of slashed funding where theatre companies seeking new voices are folding. Slant of Light fosters talented artists from different backgrounds and ages. It is a company that will continue to excel as the community it fosters grows with it. It is impressive in the current climate to have made such a wonderful start. I feel fortunate to be a part of its work and what will one day be its remarkable history. I look forward to working with the company more in the future.
Slant Of Light Theater Company	73048		/users/profile/79851	nichole	General Member of the Public	5	02/22/2011	I have had the privilege of witnessing a little of what goes on behind-the-scenes of the Slant of Light Theater Company's productions. What I have seen is a cooperative and creative environment for those who relish both the on and off-stage aspects of theater. The wholeheartedness of the Company's founder, Stacy Ruttenburg, is reflected by both the works that are chosen and the professionalism with which they are performed.
Slant Of Light Theater Company	68628		/users/profile/74986	Val in Westport	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/15/2011	True exploratory, original theatre at the grass-roots level is a rarity these days, as professional theatre has increasingly become a place for the privileged few - actors & directors lucky enough to get what limited work there is, and the ticket buying public flush enough to afford the stratospheric prices.  Slant of Light offers an entirely different and inclusive experience:  a laboratory-like environment for actors, playwrights and directors of all experience levels to come together, explore, discover, & take professional risks with new material in a safe, encouraging & collaborative space, free from the constraints of what will "sell" in  a commercial venue.  The founder, Stacy Ruttenberg has a vision not only of what this type of theatre should be artistically, but how to involve & bring together diverse members of the community, folding their feedback into the evolving works, virtually making them part of the production process and engaging them in an ongoing dialogue.
Slant Of Light Theater Company	68155		/users/profile/74475	Gandhifan6677	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	I have been a fan of Slant Of Light Theater Company since its inception. What has continually impressed me has been how consistently and clearly Slant Of Light Theater Company has stayed true to its mission of using theater to inspire theater-goers to think more critically about and engage more actively in the world around them to make it better. This has been the goal of theater for centuries and yet that sense of purpose seemed to me to have been lost by so many theater companies over the years as they began to be more concerned with profit than product. When I found out about Slant Of Light, I realized that they are succeeding at using theater to communicate and educate the public effectively in a way that I feel much of theater hasn't tried to do since the days of The Great Depression. I was particularly struck by their production of "M&Ms In Heaven", an original work that examines issues of body image and self-esteem with the goal of promoting healthy self-esteem and healthy living to children. Instead of just putting on a great play, the people of Slant Of Light decided to perform their play for Fourth to Eighth Graders. This impressed me because I was born prematurely and use crutches and a wheelchair to get around, and I was picked on and teased in school and as a result of that I had low self-esteem and a negative body image for much of my youth. Because I was finally able to gain a positive self-image after many years, I know how important it is for children to understand the message of "M&Ms In Heaven" while they're so young, because they're far less likely to tease each other and not to damage another person's self-esteem for years. I am very glad that Slant Of Light is able to do such important work so effectively and I hope it wins the $5,000 so that it can do more of it.    
Slant Of Light Theater Company	68060		/users/profile/74378	Sheila F.	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	My husband and I have been attending Slant of Light Theater company since its inception and have been very impressed with their productions. They do an excellent job of presenting a great variety of original readings and plays that are thought-provoking and timely. What has been most worthwhile to us is the opportunity to participate in the after-theater discussion of the provocative ideas which were embodied in these works-in-progress. It is particularly stimulating to see the writers, directors and actors interact with the public and share innovative ideas. We have been extremely pleased to see how all those involved were open to ideas and suggestions from the general public on improving and adapting their presentations. Slant of Light is a very welcome venue for those seeking stimulating presentations  as well as those searching for help with and in life-challenging situations. 
Slant Of Light Theater Company	68057		/users/profile/74373	David Paul Garlock	Volunteer	5	02/14/2011	The Slant of Light Theater Company has provided an ongoing source of inspiration and motivation to me personally, both as a fledgling, wannabe playwright, and as an enthusiastic member of SOL's growing audience.  The Rail Against the Headlines series has been riveting this season, presenting plays with spot-on relevance to a variety of contemporary issues.  I found the production values of both "The Goodbye Party" and "Hurricane Ike" astonishing, especially given the budetary limitations imposed by remarkably low ticket prices and the limitations of performing in makeshift space.  Both plays effectively sounded their disparate alarms--one warning against citizen apathy in the face of self-appointed oligarchy and the other raising a cry against officialdom's indifference to human tragedy--chilling and unsettling wake-up calls crafted to both engage (and sometimes enrage)  their audiences.  Superbly conceived minimalist sets, and highly creative use of sound and lighting effects elevated both of these productions to a professional level that is "de rigueur" at Slant of Light.  Both of the plays I have mentioned were thrillers, in the best Hitchcockian sense of the term.  Each provided a growing sense of dread in the opening scenes, laced with a sprinkling of gallows humor and strong character portraiture, obviously the result of skillful casting and directing.   Overall, I feel the laudable mission of The Slant of Light Theater Company is being carried out in a focused and productive manner.  Their underlying philosophy infuses every aspect of the theater's operation.  The environment is warm and nurturing.  Their commitment to theater with a social conscience is forward-looking and progressive, without being oppressive and agenda-risen.  Every voice is afforded a hearing, and disagreement is not only tolerated, but encouraged, but always in a context that is broadly accepting of disparate viewpoints.  Many "slants" of enlightenment are welcomed, in a spirit of discourse and in a non-threatening enclave that fosters self-expression and interaction of values and ideas.  A beacon in tumultuous times where discord sometimes seems an end in itself, Slant of Light offers a safe port of entry into the calmer waters of evenhanded exchange and reasoned dialog.

St. Luke's Lifeworks has saved my family from being separated because of homelessness, they provided a safe and clean place for me and my children to come and reorganize my life. I was able to do so with the help and support of the St. Luke's Lifeworks staff-not just residential staff, the Whole Organization all the way to the CEO.

I have witnessed such growth in the service they perform for the homeless of Stamford, CT.  The way they educate, provide shelter, and counsel individuals and familes, especially women and their children is indeed impressive.  Their leadership is amazing and their goals to better serve the oppressed are equally impressive.  I am involved with the children of St. Luke's through reading and art workshops and I can see the impact they are making to better these childrens' lives.  I can't speak more highly of this organization whose mission is to serve the homeless and help them to rebuild their lives.

Inspirica, Inc.	57798		/users/profile/61211	NBGramps	Board Member	5	11/24/2010	St. Luke's LifeWorks (SLLW) enables clients to become self-sufficient by providing educational opportunities, housing and and support services to people overcoming homelessness in 10 different locations in Fairdield County, CT.  Our tag line is: "St. Luke's LifeWorks,  Where People Learn a Living."  I saw this firsthand during a special dinner served to the Board members by our clients in the culinary arts class, which taught important restaurant skills (food preparation as well as wait-staff skills).  At the end of the dinner, the students talked about their past struggles, their journeys and achievements.  We were impressed with the excellent dinner and presentation, but even more impressed by how far each person had come.  Every story was different.  It was incredibly rewarding to see the pride each student had in his/her accomplishments -- and some had already found jobs.  SLLW isn't just putting a "bandaid" on homelessness by providing shelter;  It is succeeding by addressing the root of the problem and finding sustainable solutions for our clients, which benefits not only our clients, but also our community.

Everything that is done on the farm, from cleaning out stalls to putting on a halter, is done with a commitment to their mission statement of allowing the horses to live out their remaining days with dignity surrounded by the love and care they deserve.  The welfare of the horses comes first and foremost and I cannot say enough good things about the workings of this farm!

My horse retired a year ago at the age of 27yo (Dee had a spot for him when he was 23yo but he still wanted to compete!) and I went to visit him today. What a wonderful life these horses are given to finish their life! Dee is so aware of everything that is happening with each and every horse.  The horses look health and happy!!!! PLUS the volunteers are wonderful with a smile on their faces as they clean stalls and water buckets each day.My only regret is that I live nearly 1.5 hours away and I cannot come to volunteer for such a great cause.
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	301936		/users/profile/393040	Writer	Volunteer	4	08/30/2016	Great fun and exercise! I came to Mitcell Farm with no horse experience but with their patience and wonderful teaching, I am enjoying and learning a lot.  I am very comfortable volunteering there. Being a retired nurse, it has been fascinating to learn about how diseases and old age progress in horses. They are a friendly group of people from the owners, to the staff, to the other volunteers. It is a fantastic place to volunteer and for the horses who are well cared for by kind and loving people. 
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	301835	1	/users/profile/392890	lads	Volunteer	5	08/29/2016	My horse is now at Mitchell Farm and I have started volunteering there also.  Honestly,  placing my horse at Mitchell Farm is one of the best things I have ever done for him.  The care is superb, the attention to each horse's well-being is consistent, and the human-equine interaction is respectful, compassionate, and nurturing.  The horses are relaxed, happy, and comfortable.   As a volunteer  I  see how well the horses are fed, how well their stalls and buckets, and paddocks are cleaned, and how safety is a top priority for horses and humans at the farm.  I also see how staff and volunteers truly care about each horse.  The staff knows the unique personalities, needs, and preferences of the horses.  Mitchell Farm has exceeded all of my expectations for the well-being, happiness, care, and comfort for its horses.
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	301358		/users/profile/392275	summitdr	Volunteer	5	08/23/2016	I have been a volunteer at Mitchell Farm for about three weeks now and I already feel like part of the family, all the volunteers and farm owners are so friendly!  It didn't take a long time to realize that being a volunteer at the farm would be one of the most rewarding things that I have taken part in; you get to spend time taking care of the sweetest horses, and working alongside the other volunteers who you become great friends with.  The horses are taken care of so well here, Dee and Melissa go the extra steps to make sure that every one of the horses is treated with care and respect.  I go down to the farm a couple days a week and help with feeding and barn chores, while meeting new people and being outside in the fresh air (it feels great to be outside after being in the office most of the day!)  Any time you are able to give to the farm is so appreciated by everyone there, and bringing comfort and care to the horses is extremely rewarding!
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	299161		/users/profile/390069	Writer	Volunteer	5	08/03/2016	I can't say enough good things about Mitchell Equine Retirement Farm!Volunteering there gives me purpose and it will for anyone who opens their heart and loves to work in a beautiful barn pasture setting. People nature and animals what is better than that!
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	298263		/users/profile/389110	horses97	Client Served	5	07/27/2016	My horse was lucky enough to be able to retire at Mitchell Farm.  He was given all the time he needed to become acclimated to retired life.  Dee was very patient with him, as were all of the wonderful volunteers at the farm.  You cannot find a nicer group of people to care for your horse or to volunteer with.  I became a volunteer about 4 years ago because my horse was there.  However, I will continue to volunteer because of all of the friends I have made during that time.  It is a very rewarding experience to say the least.
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	297887		/users/profile/388710	Writer	Client Served	5	07/24/2016	My horse was allowed to retire at Mitchell. Dee and the Mitchell family took great care of him. When his time to cross was near they helped me through it so gently and with such kindness. The farm is well run. Efficient and clean and peaceful. The horses are truly cared for in a most wonderful careful way. 
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	297425	2	/users/profile/388218	Mary446	Board Member	5	07/20/2016	I have been involved with Mitchell Farm since the very beginning in 2004. First as a boarder and volunteer, then as a retiree "mom" and volunteer and now as a president of the board of directors. Our founder, Dee Doolittle, had a wonderful vision 12 years ago to start a safe sanctuary for an unwanted segment of the equine population - the senior and/or infirm horse. Since that time Dee and our wonderful army of volunteers have fulfilled our mission and vision statements of offering a beautiful and humane alternative to the sometimes perilous life of the senior horse. This organization works very hard to give each and every "resident" a peaceful and dignified life to their very last day. Every donated dollar is extremely well spent ( less than 2.5% administration costs) to care for the horses left in our care. I can't think of a better animal welfare organization and I KNOW my own retired horses could not have had a better home to spend their last years. Thank you Dee and all of the volunteers for making the dream of MFER  a reality. 
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	294495	2	/users/profile/186197	bornagain711	Volunteer	5	07/01/2016	Amazing staff and property! Volunteering is a pleasure, everyone is friendly and helpful.

Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	274696	1	/users/profile/364160	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/19/2015	Through word of mouth I was interested in spending my time volunteering for Mitchell Farm Rescue. The owner, Dee, and her husband are both kind hearted people who are truly doing an amazing job making a difference in each horses life.  The volunteers are very kind, and the barn manager is very patient and helpful dedicating herself to this great cause. The farm also provides music overlooking the picturesque landscape that is pleasing for all ages. Sarah
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	274488	2	/users/profile/363897	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/15/2015	Where one gives of their time volunteering,  doesn't matter as much at first. Then comes the ah ha moment, when  you realize that even though sometimes the work can be tough, nature is beautiful, though many times a force to respect. Receiving what animals have to offer us humans; a sense of oneness with animals,  barn mates, peace, gratitude, joy,  and dignity for  life well lived - gives you more than you could have ever  imagined.  That sentiment sums up my experience as a volunteer at MFER. It starts with Dee and Hank, but extends far and wide.Thanks to Tommy and Easy for showing us  how horses show affection! It makes me smile!! 
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	274451	2	/users/profile/363854	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/14/2015	Six years ago while volunteering at a therapeutic riding center, two of their horses retired and came to Mitchell Farm.  I was told I could volunteer there and maybe be with my barn buddy Poncho and Filly. I live three minutes away and never knew this place was here. So I went, met the owner and now volunteer three days a week. I have developed friendships and increased my knowledge of geriatric horses. It also keeps me in shape. If you love horses, beautiful scenery, concerts, lipizzan shows and not afraid of getting your hands dirty, this is for you. Check Mitchell Farm out! You won't be disappointed.
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	274450	3	/users/profile/363853	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/14/2015	It's the best decision I ever made to step out of my comfort zone and become a volunteer at MFER! At 60yrs. old and having no experience working with equines there were days when I though "you must be crazy"! Making mistakes, feeling stupid, etc. but loving the work and being in the presence of these beautiful animals made me want to come back and keep learning. Dee has been a wonderful teacher to us all and always willing to share her knowledge. Having patience do deal with newbies like me is a big plus on her part also! Now after 3 years and still learning, I will tell anyone "it is the best part of my day"! The horses are of course the best part but mucking stalls, the smell of the barn, beautiful fields, good friendships, hard work, getting dirty and being close to the earth is very rewarding. The horses at MFER are in the best of care under Dee and being part of it makes me look forward to my next trip down the driveway!
Mitchell Farm Equine Retirement Inc	274421	3	/users/profile/363817	Writer	Volunteer	5	12/14/2015	I have volunteered at Mitchell Farm for the past 4 or 5 years and I have to say, Mitchell Farm is quite the place. Dee Doolittle runs the farm with her husband Hank and they are two of the hardest working people you will ever meet. Dee works 7 days a week and she has been at it for over ten years! And the volunteers are the most devoted volunteers you can find. Mitchell Farm is Dee's vision, a retirement farm for horses to live out their golden years, relearning how to be a horse, to relax in the sun, roll in the mud and graze, graze, graze. But this comes with a price tag. Without the volunteer staff and creative fundraising it would be impossible. We are lucky enough to have a barn manager now, Melissa, and hopefully Dee can get a day off once in a while. I just wish I didn't have to work to pay my bills, I would be at the farm everyday too.

The Kiwanis Club of Darien has worked with the youth of The Depot for the past several years in community service projects. The youth have been very helpful to us and we have helped support their projects. Working with the students and the staff at the Depot has been very rewarding.

More importantly, it encourages community service opportunities for teens to see how they can make a difference in the world.  It also gives the kids a point of contact with adults other than their parents when they need someone to talk to who believes in them.

But most of my fondest memories of high school are of my friends and I spending time at the Depot. The Depot helped nurture my love for design and gave me and my friends a place to go when no one wanted to go to their own home or go to a diner where you have to spend money. The Depot became our home, and I will always remember it that way.

What a great place to be to hang with friends, contribute to fundraising, learn about yourself etc. It is a place for teens to go and feel like its a place of their own. that is very important in the world today, so many teens feel like they do not have a place of their own.

Circle of Care for Families With Cancer, Incorporated	88288	1	/users/profile/99240	Tonya R.	General Member of the Public	5	05/02/2011	As a  Board Member for TeamConnor Pediatric Cancer Foundation, I have had the privilege of getting to see the work of The Circle of Care intimately, as we have considered their organization for receiving grants from our foundation.  We, as a Board for TCF, have been amazed at the work Circle of Care does.  They are on the frontlines during a family's most difficult time, anticipating their needs before they are even aware of what it is they need.  Through the Purple Pages, the Bags of Love, and the support they provide through hospital volunteers and phone support, they help families know that they are not alone.A cancer diagnosis is a terrible thing, but particularly for a child.  Circle of Care is there from the very beginning and walks with the family through the duration of their treatment.  They truly are an amazing organization. 
Circle of Care for Families With Cancer, Incorporated	88262		/users/profile/99191	Kendra	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/02/2011	As the Child Life Specialist for inpatient pediatric oncology, I have been able to see, first hand, the impact Circle of Care has on children and families. At the time of diagnosis, families receive a "Bag of Love" which includes fun items for kids, care items, snacks, and vital educational materials for caregivers. This bag serves as a "welcome" to the hospital as well as an introduction to the Circle of Care program which is a resource families typically rely on throughout their treatment process.  Circle of Care provides volunteers that come into the hospital several times a week. These volunteers are invaluable in that they are willing to help in any way they can! Volunteers are able to play with children while families are talking with medical staff, able to "pick up" lunch or snack items, provide play activities at bedside or in the playroom, or, to lend a listening ear.  The Connexions program by Circle of Care is a lifeline to helping families comminucate! This programs provides laptop computers that patients and families can use to update blogs, communicate via email with friends and family, research a diagnosis/procedure, play games, or, watch movies! These laptops are usually the first things families ask for upon admission! Another special program that makes Circle of Care unique is Art from the Heart. This amazing program partners creative teams with patients to create room make-overs! Patients are chosen by a lottery system several times a year and, if chosen, patients are able participate in creating a new special space, just for them! This program makes all the difference for children undergoing treatment as many children are spending more time at home after a diagnosis. It also gives the children something to look forward during their difficult journey of illness. I can't say enough about Circle of Care and all they have done for our families. Every time we email or speak on the phone, they are always willing to help proivde support- whether financial or emotional. This is a relationship that I hope will continue for many years!

My son was diagnosed with hodgekins lymphoma at the beginning of summer of his sixth grade year. As most kids were celebrating the start of the summer we were in a hospital and then housebound most of the time. It seemed like every day I was telling what he could NOT do. No going in the sun, no going in the water, no crowds, etc. It was a very lonely and sad time. There was very few positive things I could offer him to take his mind off of this very scary situation. During the chemo there seemed to be very little room for joy. Then came circle of care. They were amazing. They got him involved in the room decoration and had all kinds of ideas. He was able to share with his friends something positive and fun HE was doing! I think it gave him something to focus on and look forward to. It was one of the few things he could actually enjoy and still gets enjoyment out of to this day. It was a wonderful gift which lifted his spirits in a way nothing else could. I can't say enough about these wonderful people who give so much of their time and energy to make complete strangers happy. Thank you circle of care!!

In big and small ways, they let families at our center know that someone understands what they are going through.

All I need to do is call them and share a story and they have always been available to help our oncology families.  For example, during the holidays they purchased entire meals (from turkeys to stuffing, to deserts) for families who could not afford a meal or who did not have the time to cook due to their child being hospitalized.  I have known Dawn and Liz for many years. They are caring, compassionate, and dedicated women who understand what our families experience on a day to day basis.  I applaud them and Circle of Care for their support of children with cancer at Yale.

My daughter won a room makeover from Circle of Care-her room was redone the way she wanted it!  It was awesome having them come to our house and do this for us.  They even made sure my older daughter was in the loop and treated her great!  Dawn and the girls were wonderful!  We will never forget them.

We were moved from the Emergency Department to an inpatient room that was to be our home for the next four weeks.  On the bed was a large, zippered bag. A bag filled with comfort.  A fresh shirt for me (we'd been in the ER all day), an oral thermometer to keep track of any infections (how many times a day did I use that during treatment?), a pen, a pad of paper (how else could we keep track of what the doctors were saying?), lots of other gear and a very important stuffed bear for a very scared little boy.  Circle of Care, a bunch of strangers I've never met, brought our family into their circle of love at a time when we needed it most.  We are forever grateful.

Liz and Dawn have been exactly where these families are now and know exactly what they need to do to be helpful and make an impact. When you realize, that you yourself could find yourself in a hospital with your child who has just been diagnosed with cancer and you have not been home all day, or eaten, and have $2 in your pocket, you need someone. You need Circle of Care. You realize they are indeed providing amazing service. I had a pit in my stomach and knew I was called to get involved. I volunteered to help in any way I could. Circle of Care makes a difference EVERY SINGLE DAY to someone. All who come in contact with them are very blessed!

I started off helping out with a fundraiser and saw right away the incredible motivation, willpower and dedication  these women possessed.  Hearing their stories about how their children survived cancer was so inspiring to me.  They met and wanted to help other mothers feel like they had a support system because when your child is diagnosed with cancer the world falls from beneath you.  I too, am the mother of a cancer survivor, so I could relate to their crusade.  I was, and still am, in awe of these women.  We all have other children, families, extra curricular activities, etc. and they are still out there trying to raise awareness and pounding the pavement in order to help other families that are experiencing pediatric cancer.  It's amazing how you can feel a connection with someone by exchanging chemo stories, blood transfusions, relapses, all things that we wish no one has to go through.  Circle of Care is an organization that brings a special light to a community that is growing day by day. It's nice to know someone out there cares and wants to help in any little way possible.
Circle of Care for Families With Cancer, Incorporated	85419		/users/profile/95295	annie	Volunteer	5	04/13/2011	I first learned of Circle of Care for Families of Children with Cancer when asked to volunteer on a fundraiser about 4 years ago.  I have been volunteering ever since because I know my efforts can make a big difference!What is immediately appealing about Circle of Care's services is the thoughtful and immediate help they provide to families; their care begins from the day of diagnosis and endures throughout  the end of treatment, comforting patients as well as their families.Circle of Care fulfills the emotional as well as the practical needs. Everyday essentials  fill the Bags of Love and accompany patients on admittance;  laptop computers are available for patient and parent use to ease communication and research,  a resource directory and respite support from well-trained, loving volunteers, as well as financial aid are among our programs.  The difference Circle of Care makes is palpable.Circle of Care is a community of love and support to families who need it most and deserves top-rating status!

Sofia Sees Hope Inc	270186	1	/users/profile/358903	Dave84	Donor	5	10/31/2015	Dinner in the Dark was a very eye-opening event... pardon the pun.  While the evening was a superbly entertaining and informative, I will never forget the intense feeling of isolation I experienced while blindfolded, even though I was surrounded by people.   It makes me wonder how much more connected a blind person would feel if they were given the gift of sight.  I want Sofia and others like her to have that opportunity!
Sofia Sees Hope Inc	270156	2	/users/profile/358876	Carol207	Donor	5	10/31/2015	Sofia Sees Hope is a shared effort from the heart - pure and simple.  A group of truly dedicated volunteers and followers have joined forces in a most wonderful example of sharing their love, caring, and concern for a cause.  The pebble that was first dropped has rippled outward to include more and more who have come to realize that with many hands, much is possible.  Their "Dinner in the Dark" is just one example of how contagious the prospect of giving to foster the hope of seeing can be for those who believe.

Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	93396	1	/users/profile/107406	ponirosp	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/05/2011	I am a Nurse Navigator for the Norma Pfriem Breast Care Center at Bridgeport Hospital. When patients are first diagnosed with breast cancer they are raw from the whirlwind of testing, biopsies surgeries and ultimately chemotherapy or radiation. Part of our navigation is to offer them comfort and stabiltiy during this journey as well as getting them into their treatment course. When I offer them financial assistance from the BCEAF in the form of bill payment or food assistance they feel so comforted in the fact that someone "out there" is thinking about them and wants to help.The help they receive is so vital to them as many are losing time at work and don't know how they will juggle the demands of chemotherapy with their daily living expenses.It is truly a "bright spot "in their  treatment course that puts a smile on their faces.Thank You to the BCEAF for helping my patients continue to heal with hope for the future.
Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	93086		/users/profile/106871	michelle	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/30/2011	I've  had the privilege of interacting with the Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation (BCEAF) since it was founded several years ago. As a psychosocial clinician in a busy community based cancer center, I deal with many women facing breast cancer who are in need of extra support.  I would describe the BCEAF as an extraordinary organization wholeheartedly committed to helping provide breast cancer patients with financial assistance for non-medical needs. I have submitted dozens of requests over the years for assistance with things such as rent/mortgage payments, utility bills, and groceries. The BCEAF is incredibly efficient in responding to requests with a reliable and greatly appreciated 48-hour turnaround. at maximum.  Patient feedback has been 100% positive. I have had patients remark on how touched they are to receive a hand-written note from BCEAF to let them know a bill has been paid. Others have come back to me in tears of gratitude because they can now buy groceries for their family. Aside from being a very professional organization, the BCEAF is also truly caring and compassionate; their staff brings a personal touch to the services provided and helps ease the burden on our breast cancer patients during an already stressful time in their lives.  The BCEAF really makes a difference, and we sincerely appreciate the ongoing support of this outstanding organization.
Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	92670		/users/profile/106346	cboyer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2011	I wanted to sincerely thank you for helping me obtain food card assistance for two of my breast cancer patients over the last year.   Since we do not have a social worker on staff, our nurse navigators help with obtaining concrete services for patients.  You walked me through the process and made it easy to apply for both the patients and me!  The patient recipients were overjoyed with receiving this assistance from the Breast Cancer Emergency Fund.  It fills a niche that other sources of funding do not. Again, many thanks for your support. 
Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	92668		/users/profile/106343	joann.hulnick	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2011	I would personally like to commend the contribution of the Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation to our Breast Cancer patients at the Rowan Breast Center at the Abramson Cancer Center, of the University of Pennsylvania. I have been fortunate to witness first hand the gratitude the patients feel for an organization to lift some of the immense financial burden off their shoulders. Few organizations include financial assistance for non medical needs. Our patients are consistently requesting financial resources for their monthly expenses, at times the payment of these necessities is a priority that often overshadows and interferes with treatment related issues. Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation helps lessen the stressors associated with patients financial hardships. The staff is wonderful, concerned and caring, and the process for accessing their grant is seamless.

Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	92666		/users/profile/106341	sarah.mandel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2011	Over the past two  years the BCEAF has been able to help so many of my patients struggling to pay bills because of the effect that their breast cancer diagnosis has had on them financially. So many of them have to go on disability because it is too difficult to work or they develop complications. BCEAF provides them financial help with a portion of their rent, utility bill or gift cards to buy groceries. As a Nurse Navigator who works with patients diagnosed with breast cancer, I see the relief this financial help provides to the patients.
Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	92630		/users/profile/106297	andeemil	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/28/2011	As a oncology social worker I have had the pleasure of working staff at  The Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation, Inc, for over 5 years.  It is a wonderfully responsive organization that provides financial assistance to women diagnosed with breast cancer.  While the patient and  family members cope with many additional financial and emotional stressors, they are surprised and delighted to learn that there are caring , generous people and organizations that will "Really just pay a bill for me?!".  The appliction process is not complicated, and turn around time is remarkably speedy. The relief and appreciation of recipients is palpable.  I extend a big THANK YOU, on their behalf  and a hope that the  funds keep flowing.Andrea Seigerman, LCSW Smilow Cancer Hospital
Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	92217		/users/profile/105699	Nancy S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/27/2011	The Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation is one of a kind.  Their financial assistance for breast  cancer patients make such a difference.  Many of the patients that they have helped are women that are dealing with breast cancer treatment and trying to run a household, parent children, and hold down a job.  The Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation has helped many of these women keep their apartment or home or keep food on the table. As a Patient Navigator at New York Presbyterian Hospital I feel so lucky to be able to call on the women at the BCEAF when I have a women at need. They are tops! Nancy Singleton

Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	92105		/users/profile/105549	Khart	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/25/2011	I would like to submit a review for the Emergency Breast Cancer Foundation. This orginization has been a life saver to so many of our patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer. They have gone above and beyond to assist us to assit them in getting anything from food to repairs on their cars so they can get to treatment. The financial burden facing those with cancer is so often the straw that breaks the camel's back--it is just one more stress to deal with during a frightening time. Often these women lose their jobs and are struggling daily. Without the help of the BCEAF, many of these women would be in even more dire straights. The dedication and passion of the volunteers of the BCEAF is top notch!!

I have only unconditional praise for the work they do and the staff that executes it.Thank you for whatever support you may provide this excellent organization.    Lina Chase, LCSWOncology Social WorkerSmilow Cancer HospitalPhone: 203.200.6360
Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	91514		/users/profile/104715	Diane Borman	Donor	5	06/21/2011	We have just granted monies for the second year to Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation.  This all volunteer organization has provided financial assistance to so many of the underinsured and uninsured breast cancer survivors and their families with non medical needs in our community.This organization is run with the utmost professionalism and "heart".  They do not want to turn anyone away.From a compliance perspective, they are very timely in adhering to their reporting requirements and with attention to evey last detail.
Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	91241		/users/profile/104295	joanne ballerini	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/17/2011	As a coordinator for women recently diagnosed with breast cancer, I have had been most fortunate to be able to work with The Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation, INC on behalf of those women.   This organization helps those with financial hardship.. As you can imagine, being told that you have breast cancer is an overwhelming experience. Often, household income is reduced as women work their way through treatment.  BCEAF is always there to give a hand, to pay a bill that is looming over the persons head, to pay for food for that person and her family, or to provide financial aid for any other emergent need that can cause such distress.  The communication with this organization is excellent and they respond to the patients needs quickly and with the utmost respect and care.   It is apparent that they are passionate about their work and their number one goal is to help these women at a very difficult time.   I am very grateful for their help and support of our patients.

Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation	91219		/users/profile/104267	Diane Haley	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/17/2011	I enthusiastically support the Breast Cancer Emergency Aid Foundation (BCEAF)  and the incredible work they do on behalf of breast cancer patients.  Financial challenges during cancer treatment are not unusual, however, there are few resources available to help with the non-medical expenses that come up for patients.  The BCEAF has helped patients with costs of automobile repairs, child care, groceries and utility bills.  They have helped to pay for breast prostheses, wigs and lympedema garments when those costs are not covered byinsurance or for patients who are uninsured.  The benefit to the patient goes far beyond the grant.  During what is typically a difficult and highly stressful time, patients are able to focus their attention and energy into their healing, feeling supported and cared for in a real and tangible way.

Money is also granted to local hospitals to provide education for women and men who are diagnosed with breast cancer.

He is such a showman, and with his parents coming up from New York, hanging over the balcony, the better to watch him perform, it was a magical evening.      Lion King is the most fabulous Broadway show I have ever seen, six times, from different locations, and it was a different show:  the performers who were not on stage were singing into their microphones from backstage or from the lobby where they made a quick costume switch! Fabulous.     Every spring we welcome high school students and their families into our huge auditorium for their graduation ceremonies.  Many of these scholars are the first in their family to graduate,  with much pride, many tears of joy, I feel humbled to share these tender moments.

They have been among the best years of my life. It is good to give back to the community! As a Bushnell volunteer I experience the joy of the arts experience through the eyes of our patrons and help them whenver and wherever there is need. While it si true that at tiems we get to see the shows at the Bushnell by doing thswi service, I always prefer to buy a seat if I wish to truly enjoy an arts experience there.  I particularly like volunteering for the children's school performances and early morning business breakfasts: The Rising Star affairs. I also love the volunteer for the symphony.  As a matter fo fact, because of my volunteering at these events  I have become a patron more often!!!

The Bushnell has the philosophy that it wants to be the best performing arts center in Connecticut and insists that we as volunteers perform at that level.  At the same time the Bushnell recognizes that we are still volunteers, i.e. for three years I was on an Advisory Committee that was the connection between the volunteers and the management team so that communication worked in both directions.

In addition to having the opportunity to sample a wide variety of performances (ranging from opera to dance to musical theater to lectures to individual performers), I've also had the satisfaction of knowing that I'm contributing to the well-being of Connecticut's premier non-profit entertainment venue.

My experiences include viewing most of the venues to which I've been assigned and greeting some wonderful guests, especially those who have been enjoying the Bushnell for 30+ years.  I love to share the wonders of this beautiful theater and its history.  And,  I've started taking my four-year old grandson to the age-appropriate activities. What fun it is for me to see his eyes light up and ask all those questions which only a four-year old can!! I've urged my children and their friends to buy tickets and often tag along with them.

The ladies that are in charge of the volunteers are wonderful to work with and for.  Marge Jagler's memory of all of the volunteer's names blows me away.  And when I call to talk to Gwen Howard or Joan Delaney, they are so accomodating to one's every need.  The Volunteer Team is a wonderfly run group.  And I'm sure that when Missy comes on board, things will run very smoothly.My wife and I have been to other venues for shows and the Bushnell tops them all for its organization and handling of Bushnell's patrons. Of course being able to watch the performances is a definite plus and some great musicals, comedies and the like have made the Bushnell a very popular venue.  I hope that I can serve as a volunteer for many years to come.

I believe the Bushnell does this and as a result we work in a venue that provides first class performing arts. As a volunteer we get to work with patrons spanning all ages and ethnicities. My pride in the city has grown over the seven years I have volunteered at the Bushnell. This venue is the lynchpin of a very active arts world here in Hartford.

Nicaphoto, Inc.	300992		/users/profile/174667	rwlindsay	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/18/2016	As a former expat working in Nicaragua in community development, I've known Ronnie since 2009 and seen Nicaphoto develop into a thriving community full of success stories.  I love dropping by the office there because there is always something exciting happening and good news to share - another young person with a scholarship, more kids in tutoring, a harvest from their beautifully managed garden to share around. Nicaphoto practices the kind of tough love that really makes change - holding young people to a high standard of responsibility, setting a high bar for their achievements, and then giving them the support and individual attention that shows them someone believes in them.
Nicaphoto, Inc.	300958		/users/profile/391835	Writer	Board Member	5	08/18/2016	I have been on the board since the inception.I am marveled as to what one woman can do with little and built an organization with a team that reasonable and understand her work.She is an example, oh so completely of what one can do if willing to dare the impossible.From after school programs that help educate not just the young but the not so...and make a difference in achieving what we here in the USA take for granted...Education is giving a choice to people.Garden to feed and to teach sustainable agriculture in a place like the barrillos of Nicaragua .Tell me that is not the way to help one another.Tell me that this women does not understand the need of other community.Because if you really can t tell me that non profit organization is the greatest  source of relief and support and need...then you have not understood that principle...Nicaphot,Inc has and deserves all of our support.SHe has mine and hope you will recognize that yours is just as important....Thx

I saw first hand the work that Ronnie does at Nicaphoto, and the profound impact she is making for the children in her program whose families are among the poorest of the poor. Nicaphoto instills confidence, nurtures, transforms, teaches and enables children (and their families) to see and strive for life's possibilities. Ronnie is one of my heroes. 
Nicaphoto, Inc.	294787		/users/profile/385541	Bree S.	Volunteer	5	07/06/2016	I volunteered at NicaPhoto this past March and had such a life-changing experience. The kids are fantastic and absolutely cherish the moments they get to spend with the amazing staff. NicaPhoto provides these kids with opportunities most of us take for granted - learning how to dance, eating a nutritious lunch, developing skills in horticulture, and many many more. I could go on and on, but the main reasons this place is so successful is that they care and they take action.
Nicaphoto, Inc.	294773		/users/profile/385526	Karen412	Former staff	5	07/06/2016	Nicaphoto, it is a big project full of emotions educational activities that generate a wonderful contribution to our childhood, characterized by its creative approach to each child to develop different skills for school and intellectual growth, which make a difference in their lives, thus generating greater opportunities in the labor market in the future.  It has been for me great pleasure and enjoyment to work with so humble cause.  The experiences I have lived since entering in 2015 have shaped me professionally and from a more humanitarian approach.  NicaPhoto is a project that changes lives. 
Nicaphoto, Inc.	294767		/users/profile/385519	kellycbanks	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/05/2016	I've known Ronnie before she started Nicaphoto and was just visiting Nagarote on her own to work with kids in town and teach photography. She created Nicaphoto out of a love and passion for this country, community and kids. Nicaphoto aims to improve the lives of the families they work with originally through photography but oh how they have grown to do so much more! What I love the most is how they work tirelessly to empower young girls through different trainings and classes.  I'm so proud of the work Nicaphoto does and as a former Peace Corps volunteer in this community, I couldn't be any prouder of the organization Ronnie and her team has built! 
Nicaphoto, Inc.	294743		/users/profile/385492	Writer	Volunteer	5	07/05/2016	I was approached do a mission trip in the fall of 2013 to help an afterschool program finish construction on two school class rooms. I thought it would be a fun trip and that would be it. Little did I know the caliber of people I would be working with at Nicaphoto 3 years later in 2016. August will bring about my third mission trip with this organization, and I wouldn't change a thing about it. Nicaphoto is staffed by people who genuinely believe in what they are doing, and that makes all the difference.  
Nicaphoto, Inc.	294738		/users/profile/385487	khmiller3188	Volunteer	5	07/05/2016	I went to Nicaragua last August for many reasons. I had wanted to be a part of an international community service trip for at least a decade, if not more. My father has been a part of trips like this since I was 3 years old. He had also been with Nicaragua to work with Nicaphoto in the years past. My 10 day trip changed my life. From the moment we got there, Nicaphoto felt like a family. The people who work there, believe so wholeheartedly in the services they are carrying out for this community. The barrio is a place that has so much need. The vastness of the needs these families have cannot be explained in words. It has to be something you see with your own eyes. Generations of families living in small plastic homes. People are hungry and the children are  craving extra activities and affections. Nicaphoto gives that opportunity to so many. The focus is to empower young girls to be more but Nicaphoto doesn't just do that. It encourages all children to want more for themselves and for their families. It starts now but will eventually trickle down to generations of children wanting more and going after it. Nicaphoto gives these children new goals. It is a happy place. Ronnie has turned a small vision into a nonprofit that is changing an entire community. She, along with her relentlessly hardworking staff, have started a movement. The more the organization has, the more it can give, and the more kids who can be a part of the program. My experience building latrines for families was so much more than just building bathrooms. I've never worked so hard doing manual labor. There are jobs for everyone. Even those like me, with minimal experience with tools and building. These people changed my life.  It changed my perspective on the world. I challenge anybody to spend some time being a part of an experience like this. Nicaphoto is an incredible place. Their mission should be heard all around the world.

I am so thankful for Nicaphoto for choosing to help Nicaraguan children live a little and laugh a little.
Nicaphoto, Inc.	294733		/users/profile/385483	Julia66	Volunteer	5	07/05/2016	Ronnie does amazing work at Nicaphoto! Her kids benefit so much from the opportunities she provides them. She is able to combine art, education, health, and community to create an extremely supportive environment. Her participants are already giving back to their community though this program. I visited a year ago and was completely blown away by these  wonderful students and their wonderful director. Art is so important to provide for children to create confidence, leadership, and self expression. Ronnie realizes what these students need in order to succeed.

MARIAN'S DREAM: Philanthrophy for Animal Advocates (Marian Rosenthal Foundation)	192088	2	/users/profile/250751	petermarsh	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/05/2014	   I've worked to prevent cats and dogs from being needlessly put to death in shelters for more than twenty years. Much progress has been made during that time, largely through the work of Marian's Dream and other foundations that have provided funding for small,  grassroots organizations in areas where the greatest number of animals are dying.    Over the years, Marian's Dream has fought well above its weight, saving more lives than many larger organizations and foundations, by providing funding for well-informed public awareness campaigns often overlooked by other funders, like its current Beat the Heat campaign. At the same time, it has undertaken strategic projects to organize and support a new generation of leaders by sponsoring annual retreats for shelter overpopulation activists from more than two dozen states.  As the editor of Animal People commented recently, the founder of Marian's Dream, Esther Mechler has been an animal advocate for forty years and has founded or helped to found nine organizations of national prominence eight of which either still exist or have active descendants. Marian's Dream gets things done because Esther Mechler gets things done.

MARIAN'S DREAM: Philanthrophy for Animal Advocates (Marian Rosenthal Foundation)	164945	1	/users/profile/219249	SpayMexico	Client Served	5	08/14/2013	For years I have know about the incredible work of Marians Dream and Esther Mechler's personal Dream to make a difference thru Spay Neuter.  It seems that when people get involved in doing something for animals the walk in the RESCUE door.  After more brain cells begin to fire...we all eventually come to the real solution SPAY NEUTER.   Since the late 90s Esther has gently pushed us to take on Marians Dream goal - Spay Neuter.  We began working in Mexico 10 years ago fixing pets across the northern Baja, California.  In 2010 we started SPAY MEXICO and proceeded to reach out across Mexico to link with like minded vets and community groups to teach and support.  Thru Esther's introduction we met Dr. Marvin Mackie the famous "King of Spay/Neuter" and the inventor of Quick Spay.  It has been an incredible relationship - as Dr. Mackie has made a personal commitment to present Quick Spay to hundreds of Veterinarians across Mexico. With the support of Marians Dream we have:  - Over 18,000 surgeries across Mexico- Over 5,000 in Mexicali 2012- Over 3,000 surgeries in Mexicali Jan thru July 2013- Spay/Neuter Conference Puebla, Mexico - Presented Quick Spay 400 attendees- Mega Spay/Neuter 5 day Training Cancun, 2011- 5 Low cost clinics established 2013  - 10 new veterinarians trained and certified in the last 10 months We are a work in progress and with the support and guidance of Esther Mechler and Marians Dream we have been able to learn from each other and share solutions for low cost safe spay neuter.  Our proven system is well documented and we believe the ripple effect of our program is now ready to take all across Mexico.  We are building a map and reaching out to veterinarians and communities that would like to share our dream. We go into Mexico because the people there have so little to give to help animals but they give anyway.  If you can help Marians Dream you are helping Spay Mexico do something about the poor starving abandoned pets of Mexico.  We are in the streets there making a difference. Thank you! Craig NeilsonCraig@SpayMexico.org

Our main focus is reducing the number of surplus cats. To that end, we support grassroots organizations all over the country, awarding start-up grants for clinics, both mobile and fixed site.  We host an annual retreat for the leadership of statewide spay programs, providing a collaborative forum where attendees can share knowledge, problems--and solutions.  Since our founding in 1981, we have been on the forefront of the fight against overpopulation. With programs such as Beat the Heat and the Cats Action Network (CAN), we are working to further stem the tide of unwanted litters by promoting approved protocols for early age spay/neuter (before first heat) as well as elevating the status and well-being of kittens and cats. Nor is our scope limited to the U.S. In recognition that cat overpopulation is a global issue, we go beyond the borders to Mexico and Panama to support model programs there.  I am proud to be a member of the Marian's Dream board as we work toward our shared goal of No More Homeless Cats. Hope C.

They support innovative, effective new programs that develop spay/neuter services in underserved areas.  Theire motto is, "work smarter not harder."   They were absolutely vital to the start-up of the rural spay/neuter networks that now provide thousands of  surgeries across low-income areas of Oklahoma and Arkansas.     Marian's Dream is much more than a funder, they are a friend to the often isolated grass roots organizations that strive to help those who are at greatest risk of suffering in chronic poverty.  Marian's Dream holds annual retreats to bring program coordinators together for information sharing and more.  This organization is a power house on behalf of those who reach out to truly prevent animal suffering.

Client Served	5	03/02/2012	Marians Dream has been a DREAM for this organization.  As a grassroots non-profit for animals, chartered in the state of Louisiana, the surplus of unwanted animals is overwhelming to animal control, rescue groups, and individuals. With an estimated 350,000 free roaming feral cats, SpayMart launched a public awareness campaign entitled Neuter Scooter to promote humane methods of controlling their numbers and making sterilization possible. Marians Dream defined the meaning of feral and spay neuter to this organization,  and  I can say brought us to our pinnacle. If not for funding from Marians Dream earlier campaigns would not have taken place. The foundations support and belief in our mission gave us credibility and a newly defined respect for ourselves. The campaign has grown from sterilizing 100 cats our first year to over 2000 in our most recent year. Thank you  for being such a cornerstone to this organization, as I am sure you have been to countless others.

Children's Advancement Fund, Inc.	225862		/users/profile/289614	anncfar50	Board Member	5	10/23/2014	I have been involved with Childrens Advancement Fund for the past 4 years.  This involvement has enriched my life merely by being part of this wonderful nonprofit organization.  However, the most important enrichment is what Childrens Advancement Fund (CAF ) is providing.   CAF provides funds for  therapies (language, social skills and motor skills) to those in need of assistance.  These therapies  enable children to grow and develop to their full potential.
Children's Advancement Fund, Inc.	221531		/users/profile/285221	CommunicationFoundations	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/09/2014	As a provider, I often receive phone calls from potential clients looking for services for their young children.  Most often they are hopeful to use their health insurance benefits to cover the cost of therapy sessions; it can be very disheartening when you realize your insurance will not cover therapy session fees.  Out of pocket costs can be prohibitive to families, but thanks to CAF, many families in CT are able to access much needed therapies for their children.  It's a great feeling when I can tell a family "your insurance plan may not cover services, BUT I know a great organization that can help!"

Our family would have to stop needed therapy services without CAF's help.  The guidance from the education for parents is so wonderful and accessible to busy parents.  It makes our family feel good about "giving" back when volunteering for events sponsored by CAF.

I was out of options, my sons no longer covered by insurance and I couldn't afford to pay for any programs out of pocket.  CAF came to the rescue - helped my sons financially to participate in a program.  Stephanie and Susan helped connect me with others programs I did not know about and as a results my sons are doing so well.  They even held a summer job! Keeping up with their daily living tasks while working!  For me that has been amazing.  And it all began with CAF helping me when I needed it most.

Families who have worked with CAF  all express their appreciations for the the support they receive, but especially the ease of the application process. Many families who try to seek funding find the process exhaustive and overwhelming, the supportive manner in which CAF provides their grants is invaluable. They make efforts to keep it simple for families to complete and maintain. As a provider, all of my interactions with  CAF have been positive. They have a level of caring and understanding that is essential and appreciated. I cannot speak highly enough about the work they do and we are honored to partner with them.  Melissa SaundersExecutive Clinical Director Creative Interventions

It has provided me with an opportunity to "pay it forward" in gratitude for my family. The CAF community, formed through the vision and leadership of our Executive Director,                            Stephanie Bendiske Klewicki, is a partnership among providers, families receiving services, volunteers, and Board members. Our mission has included the provision of therapy services to children with language, motor, and social skills needs.  CAF has funded approximately 1800 therapy services over four years, 270 social skills group sessions a year for 4 years, and 225 social skills groups a year for 3 years. These have been invaluable services to parents trying to meet the often multiple needs of their children. Our goal is to offer needed support so the children can grow to their full potential within family, school, community, social, and future employment settings.Carol Nelson

CAF does an excellent job providing funding for children who need therapy services that are not covered by their insurance or who have high deductibles or co-payments. The children can go to a variety of therapists throughout CT that have contracted with CAF. As a family physician, I frequently come across parents who are frustrated with limited services provided by the school systems for their children with special needs and are looking for other resources that they may otherwise not be able to afford. CAF is a unique organization that helps families with this service and funding gap.

Ballet School Of Stamford	233386		/users/profile/251291	bpoolme	Client Served	5	11/11/2014	My daughter has danced at BSS for 8 years, and I have nothing but respect for this marvelous institution.  In addition to instilling a love of dance and providing superior instruction, BSS has given her a strong sense of responsibility, community and respect for others. Her relationships with her teachers and the administration go far beyond the classroom.  They are mentors, field trip chaperones, and role models. As far as nonprofits go, BSS uses its donations to directly benefit our community -- giving so many children with a desire to dance the opportunity to learn from the best. It is an absolute pleasure to see the diversity or our city represented on stage during the year-end performance. I am proud to be associated with BSS as a parent, volunteer and donor, and will continue to support the school even after my daughter graduates this year.
Ballet School Of Stamford	192461		/users/profile/251291	bpoolme	Client Served	5	01/12/2014	My daughter has danced with BSS for 7 years.  The quality of instruction is second to none.  Most importantly, BSS has instilled a strong sense of community, responsibility, maturity and commitment in her.  I think they strike the right balance between competition and teamwork as well.  You do have to audition for larger roles in productions (and there are clearly some standouts) but everyone is able to participate and find their place in the spot light. Even the location of the schools contributes to my daughter's independence at a young age.  The girls have extensive rehearsals at various times of day, and over time have earned the right to leave the facilities and take advantage of the restaurants, shops and libraries of downtown Stamford. I am so pleased that the school is representative of the larger Stamford community -- doing so much outreach and offering numerous scholarships to children who wouldn't participate otherwise.  BSS is a second home for my daughter and I'm proud to support it
Ballet School Of Stamford	232483		/users/profile/296024	CathO	Donor	5	11/01/2014	Ballet School of Stamford has served as a place of inspiration and a second family and home for my now high school-age daughter  since she was a toddler. School director Marti Etter and the entire staff bring a high degree of integrity and technical sophistication to the dance curriculum and show compassion and care to every student on a 1:1 level. I'm also impressed with the diversity of the school. Children of all backgrounds--from Stamford, Bridgeport, New Canaan, Greenwich, Bedford, NY and other nearby towns--come together to partake in the joy of dance. Each student, no matter his/her dance ability or neighborhood, is welcomed and encouraged, and strong friendships spawn between students who would otherwise not have a chance to meet. This is a ballet school with heart. I'm proud to be the parent of a BSS student, as well as a volunteer and donor for the school.

My daughter has been dancing at BSS for the past 7 years and she absolutely loves it.  The instructors and staff genuinely care about the dancers and want to see them succeed and be the best they can be.  They have instilled self-confidence and pride in my daughter's abilities as a dancer, and as a person overall trained with focus and self-dicipline both physical and mental that will serve her well in life.  She has forged long-lasting friendships with her classmates as well as her instructors.  Most of the staff and instructors have been at BSS since my daughter began.  It's so nice (and rare!) to have that kind of continuity, especially at a non-profit.  Clearly, the staff at BSS love what they do and it shows - in their kindness, determination and exuberance for dance.

We switched because her primary interest is ballet.   Since she began she has improved every year. The teachers are excellent  The teachers have the right balance of firmness and nurturing.  My younger daughter began dancing at the Ballet School when she was 4.  The instruction for the young children is great.  The teachers are patient and kind and the students love it.   I love that there is no pressure to promote children on pointe before they are physically ready.  Once they begin pointe it is in small amounts so as to prevent injury.   They work with each student individually to help them develop into the best ballet dancer they can.  The end of year show is spectacular.  Unlike many studios, class time is not lost rehearsing for the show.  Those interested in performing have rehearsal outside of class time.  This way their development is not hindered. I love that it is a non profit.  Dance is important and students shouldn't be restricted to only those who can afford it.  In class, one cannot tell the socio-economic background of the students.  The school is very diverse.   I highly recommend and will continue to have my daughters dance at the Ballet School.

The school has amazing instructors.  This has become a home away from home for my daughter.  Besides getting the best dance instruction in Faifield/Westchester, they are taught discipline, compassion and team work.  It has given my daughter a wonderful outlet with the rigors of high school.

I am really happy that i choose this one because they make us feel like we are not the new family and they welcomed us in. My daughter stated that even the other students treat her like family and are very helpful. They are helping me to make my daughter a well rounded individual and to become more aware of the endless possibilities out there for her.

I'm proud to be a part of a school that is an excellent citizen of our diverse city too. BSS's outreach is excellent.  They are always willing to step up and contribute to public school functions in any way they can.

She is 14 now and has attended each session (plus summer sessions)continuously.  The BSS staff has become an extended family to us, they are genuinely concern and dedicated in grooming a well rounded dancer/person.  The program is reflective of the New York City Ballet in that the BSS requires uniform dress for each level achieved, in addition to Bun Day, where the student is taught the correct way to style her hair in a bun.  I have seen a young duckling grow into a beautiful swan.  Because of ballet my daughter has gained confidence in many areas of her life. She has established longterm friendships and new found friends from around the world. She has become exposed to such genres as classical music and foreign languages. I believe the physical benefits of attending the BSS will serve her well into her adult life.  We are grateful to have found the BSS program and recommend the school to every community.
Builders Beyond Borders	138271		/users/profile/184325	scz4	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I traveled with B3 for all four years of high school and loved each one!  Each trip had a huge impact on me and I could tell I was making a difference in the community.  I loved the fact that I was able to leave my "Fairfield County bubble" and experience life in other cultures, giving me a different perspective on the world and my own life. I will never forget the reaction of the community when, on our last day of my sophomore trip, we turned on a tap and gave them running water for the first time. Or that I climbed a volcano in Guatemala and roasted marshmallows on the lava.

Once I performed my first my first global service project in Ecuador, I never looked back. Joining B3 was the best decision I have ever made. Not only does it change the lives in the communities we work in, but it also changes the perspective of the students who work. It allows students to realize their role in the global community. B3 is a wonderful nonprofit, serving communities at home and abroad, and inspiring students.

I participated in two B3 trips and can easily say they were both life changing experiences. They present teens the opportunity to develop values outside their normal comfort zone while assisting the needs of others. Hard-work, friendship, respect, and honor are just a few of the characteristics Builders Beyond Borders has ingrained in my life.   
Builders Beyond Borders	138147		/users/profile/184192	ksd7	Volunteer	5	11/13/2012	I volunteered with Builders Beyond Borders for 3 years, starting my sophomore year of high school. By senior year, I had the great responsibility and privilege to be a student leader. Living on the East Coast, it is easy to get swept up in your own world and assume that everyone has it as well as you do. Surrounded by people who are just like you for you're entire life, it's almost impossible to understand the extreme economic, social and political diversity that exists in the world. B3 gives students an opportunity to get involved locally and in third world countries. Not only did I learn a lot about myself on the trips, I learned about the world around me and got to spread this knowledge with people at home.

She has learned so many life lessons from B3 that I'm not sure where I would start when thanking the organization.  Last year she convinced my younger daughter to go with her and they both went to Nicaragua.  With the older one now in college the younger one is heading to Guyana as a seasoned B3'er!

My team was supportive of each other through our local community service, and all the way beyond our trip to Nicaragua! B3 allowed me to dive deeper into what really matters in life, how you can work as a team, and how you can connect with a community of kids and adults who don't speak the same language as you. My only regret is that I didn't join B3 until my senior year. It's never too late to join this amazing organization! Thanks B3 for all you do in Latin America and back home in our community!

The B3 community is like family to me, i love the caring environment and the attitude of wanting a change. I traveled to Ecuador and Nicaruagua and had great experiences in both countries. In Ecuador we were up in the mountains digging trenches to lay piping for running water for a community that never had running water before. In Nicaragua we helped build a bridge, during so i got to use a jackhammer! My favorite part of these 2 trips was socializing with the local communities. Coincidentally enough both countries were Spanish speaking and it was great to be able to communicate to the locals and play with the little kids. Everyone who is a part of B3 is very caring and always strives to make the world a better place, even in our own backyards. The biggest advice i can give to a high school student is to get involved with this amazing organization, it is never to late, and any adults out there should look into getting involved as a leader!

I am in awe of the consistently demonstrated teamwork and collaboration across all the departments, focused on  the same goal of providing quality work and life/life skills opportunities for those with physical and intellectual disabilities.  The team is realistic about challenges and opportunities and focuses on celebrating small successes toward the achievement of major ones. I had the opportunity to visit a group home and found this same culture demonstrated by the home's leader and staff, via their consistent mantra that the residence/ home is for and about the residents of that home and that their role (the staff's) is to provide the right balance of support and guidance to ensure the best quality possible.  The residents were unique individuals with clearly different needs and yet there was a spirit of family that resonated.

The compassion of every employee and volunteer and joy of every participant moves me every time I'm in their presence.  They truly make a difference in the lives of the families they serve.
Harc, Inc.	300146	4	/users/profile/390998	gpc1986	Board Member	5	08/10/2016	Harc has been a part of my family since its early years.  It has been an honor to be involved with such a caring organization that serves families and individuals with intellectual disabilities.  The Harc family is a strong passionate group that will make everyone feel loved and know that they have the support from the staff at Harc.  My aunt has been receiving services from Harc and she has flourished becoming extremely sociable with everyone. Without Harc's support and guidance, she would not be as admired in the community as she is now.I have had the honor to be heavily involved with the organization from volunteering, working, Co-Chairing a fundraiser, Committee Member and now a Board Member. I look forward to continuing to help the organization spread the word about the caring individuals that work at Harc and provide service to our extraordinary individuals and families.
Harc, Inc.	300131	2	/users/profile/390981	Writer	Board Member	5	08/10/2016	Harc, Inc. turns 65 years old this year and what a journey this organization has had! It was started by a small group of parents who needed some help and options for their children. It has grown over the years to provide service and support to individuals with intellectual disability, as well as to their families. Day programs, supported employment opportunities, group home and independent living, respite care and the chance to get out into the community, like everyone else are some of the ways Harc has evolved. My parents became involved with Harc many years ago because of my sister and for me to have served on the Board , now to see my son join the Board is a family journey that has brought joy and satisfaction to all of us, including my sister. The work this organization has done and continues to do is so vital for the independence and acceptance of our participants. I can hardly imagine what the next 65 years will produce, but I have no doubt it will be amazing!

Christian Community Action Inc	57982		/users/profile/61503	Gail	Volunteer	4	11/28/2010	Christian Community Action Inc. is a remarkable organization dedicated to the plight of homeless families in New Haven.  Its mission is not only to provide shelter, food and counseling services designed to ease the pain of what homeless families have lost but also to inspire and help them find affordable housing and, most important, to develop their skills so they can find stable employment.  Ive been a volunteer at CCA for 4 years and have nothing but praise for the dedication of the director, Rev. Bonita Grubbs, and her wonderful staff.  
Christian Community Action Inc	57946		/users/profile/61421	Ali M	Donor	5	11/27/2010	Christian Community Action of New Haven is a truly amazing organization. They motivate the members of the community to help each other out while also accomplishing so much for the families in need. They truly make the most of out their resources and make a real difference in the New Haven Area. They have been achieving this wonderful work for over 40s! It is always a pleasure to make donations (clothing, food, money) since I know it is truly getting to the people who need it. Keep up the great work!
Christian Community Action Inc	57876		/users/profile/61317	none	Board Member	5	11/24/2010	I have had the honor and privilege of serving on the Christian Community Action Board for 8 years, 4 as Chairman.  Regardless of the ups and downs of financial fortunes, the Agency remains steadfastly focused on its goals of serving needy familes in New Haven, through its multi-unit housing facilities, its substantial food pantry, its many education- and work-focus programs to assist families rise above their current situation, and its advocacy programs in the political arena to make our elected representatives aware of the needs of those constituents without a clear voice to be heard.  CCA is a true treasure in New haven.
Christian Community Action Inc	57811		/users/profile/61227	cs1933	Donor	5	11/24/2010	I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the mission and work of CCA.  I have been actively involved with the agency for twenty years. Most recently8 members of my family worked with the staff and other volunteers on the Thanksgiving Food Drive. My 7 year old Grandson has been working at this operation since he was 3.  He looks forward to coming and works diligently. It is a fantastic opportunity for him to be involved with various groups in the community.  i am also on the Fund Development Committee. Economics times are tough and providing needed services is a challenge.

They also take significant steps to break the chain of poverty through the Stepping Stone program that works with families to help them transition from homelessness to self-sufficiency.

Christian Community Action Inc	44489	8	/users/profile/45382	cdharris67	Board Member	5	06/18/2010	I am a regular donor to CCA because of the people I have met that have been directly influenced by their giving! A co-worker several years ago told of an agency that helped her manage heating costs to stay warm in a brutal winter after one call and plea. This young lady is also a graduate of one of their programs designed to educate and empower parents in employment, nutrition and advocacy for themselves and their children. She received this wonderful help from CCA. I know without a doubt that what is given goes directly to those in need . Often I have observed the giving on the same day. CCA has a hand on the pulse of those in need. I pray God's blessings on this organization and the people it serves!
Christian Community Action Inc	24387	12	/users/profile/25460	Ray Andrewsen	Board Member	5	12/17/2009	Christian Community Action is an organization that is true to its creed. Consider CCA to be faith-in-action with a determination and commitment to serve those in need of food, shelter, counseling, and a time-tested program of helping those in transition from homelessness lead productive and stable lives. I have served with great pleasure on the board of directors for six years and currently chair the development committee. It is remarkable to witness the highly respected executive leadership and dedicated staff sustain an ongoing successful operation that does just what the mission statement of the organization proclaims. All those who work at CCA work hard and effectively. People's lives have been transformed. The pain of hunger is stopped. The hurt and confusion of economic dislocation is eased. Children, families, individuals have a safe roof over their head on cold winter nights. For over 40 years CCA has been serving the New Haven.However, CCA faces the ongoing challenge of needing the community's assitance to meet the growing needs of some of the poor in greater New Haven. To witness the largest meal distribution at Thanksgiving every year is to see how CCA's work to provide to those in need is so vital. There are so many organizations providing similar services across the nation but I believe you would be hard-pressed to find one doing it so effectively as Christian Community Action.
Christian Community Action Inc	24299	8	/users/profile/25391	Jennifer	Board Member	5	12/17/2009	I am a relatively new member of the Board of Christian Community Action, Inc. (CCA) but it is an organization that I have thought highly of for the the 35 years I have lived in New Haven.  CCA offers families in need a fresh start.  Whether they seek short term basic needs like food and fuel or whether they seek longer term support with housing, job counseling and financial management CCA promotes family stability and self sufficiency.  It seeks to put faith into action by supporting and empowering the people it serves. In my first six months on the Board I have been impressed with the commitment of both Board members and staff in carrying out the mission of CCA made especially challenging by the current economic downturn.
Christian Community Action Inc	23291	4	/users/profile/24365	joan	Board Member	5	12/02/2009	Christian Community Action has been in existance since 1967 in New Haven, CT. The organization provides vital social services and is engaged in advocacy by providing emergency and transitional housing, food and other support to those who are poor and by encouraging them in their efforts to attain self-sufficiency.  And CCA works to change systems that perpeturate poverty and injustice.  In spite of a bare-bones budget, the organization has grown and continues to serve those who are in need.   I have been involved at CCA since 1968 in one way or another.  I have volunteered my time to do jobs around the office and have worked on the newsletter.  For a great many years I had been on the Board and after a hiatus of a couple of years, I am presently on the Board again.It is wonderful to see the successes that have come from the work of CCA, mostly in its work with and the advocacy group called "Mothers for Justice" and in our 3rd shelter, Stepping Stone Transitional Housing where families get more of an opportunity for education and empowerment. There is an analogy that is used at CCA regarding the giving:  We "feed people" through emergency services, and "teach people how to fish" through our transitional and vocational programs, and start folks on "owning the fishery" through owning a business program, and finally, we help to "change the quality of the water so that eating and fishing would be successful" by our grassroots and public policy advocacy.In all, CCA rates so high on my list of people helping and inter-acting with people that I cannot stay away and continue to see this as my primary source for sharing time, talent and treasure.

Mikeys Way Foundation	311564	2	/users/profile/402922	APAG	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/18/2016	Mikey's Way is an amazing foundation.  Being a cancer survivor myself, going through long hours and days of chemotherapy as an adult was difficult enough- I many times found myself bored and then my mind would race back and forth thinking about all of the treatments I was going through.  - not to mention the loneliness that I dealt with.   Now- as I think of all of the children going through this terrible treatment, I can not even imagine how lonely and scary it must be for them.  Mikey's way has brought smiles to the faces of so many children across multiple hospitals.  This foundation is a beautiful way for these children to feel special, cared about, and loved.  The electronics connect the children to their family and friends and allow them to escape the thought of their treatment.  This idea is brilliant, as a happier child leads to a better, fast recovery.  Uplifting children is what Mikey's way is all about.

The families of these children are also overwhelmed with fear, exhaustion...and knowing that other people care so deeply about their children gives them the lift they so desperately need.

The cancer was first noticed in his leg and that leg had to be removed. I managed to pay for that myself through my savings and 401k. I needed more help so I applied for a fund donation from the Riedel and Cody Fund. They gave me a grant to help with cost of taking care of Thor. He goes back to the animal hospital every couple of months for x-rays and a blood test. Thor is almost 9 months post-op and his last x-ray and blood test came back normal.

He went over the rainbow bridge after an almost year long battle with Cushings disease and cancer. He quickly went into remission but a huge abdominal mass snuck up on him and it did not respond to treatment. Toby fought hard until the end and was a trooper but he stopped eating and it was time to let go. He was our big teddy bear!! He would be so excited and run towards you like a bull in a china shop but then stop short and lick you to pieces!! Shower done!! He was a true gentle giant! His best buddy was a little 10lb furbaby down the block named Emily and her little sister named Gracie.  He got to say goodbye to them today before we left for the vet as they just happened to be walking by around 8am...that was God lining up his last day to be just right. He had a good couple of last weeks;  long walks, a trip to the dog park and swimming in the lake.We are going to terribly miss our big Chocolate Chesapeake, but he's hanging out at the Rainbow Bridge waiting for us and we will see him again soon. His til wagged until the absolute last second. Thank you mostly for the extremely generous funding the Riedel and Cody Fund provided.in addition to the well wishes and words of encouragement during this hard time. This granted us  an additional year with our child Toby to spend with him.   .Forever gratefully,The Ericksens

He has given me so much over the years, I knew I had to do everything I could to improve his chances. After many tests and doctors we found a teaching hospital that had a great deal of success with Radiation treatments and Chemo Therapy to length life expectancy, and improve quality of life.  Obviously the treatment was going to be very costly.  My family and I had several local fund raisers to assist Mr Nash in his treatment costs, and sought the help of Riedel and Cody as well.  Without the assistance of Riedel and Cody treatment would not have been possible.I am happy to report that as of now Mr Nash is alive and well, 9 months past his initial life expectancy quote.  His bone cancer has stopped growing and has even shrunk in size. To date the cancer has not moved to any other part of his body, and he is happy and energetic.  He is still receiving on going treatment, of which Riedel and Cody continue to provide assistance with the costs.  We cannot thank Riedel and Cody enough for being there for our family and Mr Nash during our time of need.  I will forever be grateful that I could provide Mr Nash with the care he needed and deserved!

I couldn't afford the entire cost being a full time student & working only part time, this was financially difficult & put a lot of doubt about trying to give Tuxedo a second chance at life. However, the Riedel & Cody Fund were the only ones who helped give Tuxedo that chance to fight for his life.Words cannot express the gratitude & relief I had having them by our side and helping us by contributing to his Chemotherapy Treatment. Now, Tuxedo is "Cancer Free" (in remission) and is enjoying the rest of his youth to the fullest. I'm grateful to have their organization lend a hand to someone who was struggling to give their pet a fighting chance. Thank you to The Riedel & Cody Fund. Tuxedo thanks you too!

Riedel And Cody Fund Inc	197250	1	/users/profile/257843	Kathykear	Client Served	5	04/08/2014	The Riedel and Cody Fund was instrumental in helping me get my beloved dog Madeline her chemotherapy care in 2013.  I applied for assistance through their on line application and within 1 month, I was notified they would be giving me a 2500$ grant for her cancer treatment.  This was a monumental day!   Madeline is a rescued Pit bull that came to me after she was dumped at age 6, at a local shelter.  She came to me with mast cell cancer.  I was able to pay for her initial surgeries but when the cancer came back more aggressively,  her vet said chemotherapy was a must in order to try to get her into remission.  The cost was  400$ a month. I am a single woman with an income that could not easily support that kind of regular expense.  The Riedel and Cody assistance gave Madeline 6 months of consistent chemotherapy care and put her into remission.  There are not enough ways to say thank you to this wonderful organization.  My dogs are my children as I have no human ones. I rescue them  from shelters or the streets  - and to be able to give them the love, devotion and best care is my greatest gift to them.  I am so grateful to this group for helping support my Madeline.

To be clear Granted = we take your application no actual financial help nor email informing about status of your application, complete silence.  All it is they collect your personal info, use your pets picture  and you can only wonder what do they do with your information.

I have taken Andreas to music therapy in the past and I found it to be nothing more than a past-time. At Arts for Healing, Billy approaches Andreas with respect, care, and works to recognize that Andreas is already communicating.  It is then up to the therapist to understand.  I can think of only a few places that approach children with disabilities as equal to other children.  Other organizations try to achieve this but at Arts for Healing, they embody this belief.  For Andreas, I think that it must be a relief to be with Billy (and others like him) who get him. Janet (Andreas's mom)

Artists For World Peace Inc	32088	1	/users/profile/32890	sarah13	Volunteer	5	03/01/2010	Wendy pretty much is the one-woman dynamo behind this foundation; with her unwavering enthusiasm, optimism, and energy, she provides a true example of making an impact at the grassroots level. Her life, and her foundation, exemplifies the concept of enriching community through the arts. As just one example, the annual "Hats for a Cause" event brings together any interested volunteers who work together to design, create and sell fleece hats. This is truly a group effort where members learn specific skills from each other and are inspired to create functional art pieces beyound their imaginings, and which is in itself community-building, and enriching in a life-changing way for many of the younger -- and older!-- members. The proceeds from the first years' event were sufficient to build and staff a safe house in Cambodia for battered women and their children, which is literally saving lives. That is powerful stuff.

We have known Wendy Black Nasta for over 22 years and have witnessed her dream and vision come to fruition in Artists for World Peace.  Led by Wendy, Artists for World Peace has been a major and important contributor to our annual food and clothing drive.   Through Artists for World Peace, Wendy has organized an impressive group of volunteers including children and teachers from local schools and universities, boy and girl scout troups, local businesses, neighbors and families to come together to donate gifts, food, blankets, clothing and other much needed items, as well as the effort to sort, organize and help us pack these items in our truck that we drive out each year to South Dakota.  Not only have they generously provided a major portion of donations to our annual drive to the reservation, but Artists for World Peace makes donations to local food banks at the same time.  Wendy involves many different types of artists and artistic ventures to create ways to raise funds and inspire others to work for peace.  Artists for World Peace is doing wonderful and much needed projects around the world, to help provide children with shoes, educational scholarships, and have "adopted" children from different parts of the world to help with living expenses.  The way that local people are involved as volunteers, working with each other to bring all these ideas to action is so inspiring to see.  Not only is Artists for World Peace becoming an important contributor to world peace through active projects, but is also a place where many are learning about generosity and selfless giving.

Working with the foundation has had a huge impact on my life and if you ask anyone else who has worked with AFWP before, I guarantee they would say the same. The organization is proof that a huge difference can be made in the world by a small group of local people. Wendy Black-Nasta is the most amazing person I know. As the central heart and soul of AFWP she is able to bring people together all over the world. In the local community, she brings likeminded artists and volunteers right into her own home. On a larger scale, she has the ability to unite people in multiple countries with the International Peace Belt. Wendys devotion to the foundation, to children, to humanity, to peace, and to so much more is stronger than anything I have ever seen.

The 2009 Hats for a Cause Event sticks in my mind the most because of the progression. Artists' hands meet scraps of fabric, beautiful remnants, and even someone's favorite stuffed animal. At this point, peoples' lives were already changed, as they came together to learn, teach, and create. At the fundraising event, energy levels were high, and some wonderful connections were made as families came through to browse through our hats and make their donations to AFWP. This particular event raised money for local food banks. It was amazing to see how much food we loaded into trucks and vans to distribute to different food banks in CT.
Artists For World Peace Inc	29528	7	/users/profile/30541	Kathleen White	Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	Wendy Black-Nasta, the founder of and engine that powers Artists for World Peace, is a visionary who inspires people of all ages to channel their artistry as a force for good, one small step at a time. Wendy doesn't want to raise bazillions of dollars and then spend all her time managing that money. She has the ability to focus on small, doable projects. An example: Kids need shoes. Wendy heard/found out about kids in Ecuador who couldn't go to school because they didn't have shoes. She gathered artists who work in various media to design and build hats, which were sold at the first Hats for a Cause fundraiser, hosted by a local ice-cream shop. Wendy got the mayor to make an appearance, volunteers spread the word, and Artists for World Peace raised enough money to buy shoes for every kid who wanted to go to school. A gifted, successful artist herself, Wendy shows other artists how they can make positive changes for people whose lives are unbelievably difficult. In the process, she unites all kinds of people in the community and demonstrates the potential of grassroots activism.

I was one of her devoted jewelry students as a teenager, and I gained so much from my relationship with her. I was thrilled when I returned home after graduating from college and was invited to the first "sewing session" of a new project for AFWP: Hats for a Cause. I have been a core member of this group since then, and have loved every minute of it. I love working on a creative project with other strong, fascinating women and being able to sell our products to raise money for such worthy causes as building a domestic violence safe house in Cambodia and providing scholarships for children in Brazil, as well as helping local shelters and food banks in our community. I have also helped AFWP with their food/clothing drives for the Rose Bud Reservation in South Dakota. Artists for World Peace is an amazing foundation. Wendy has the biggest heart of anyone I know, and she is determined to make the world a better place. It has been an honor for me to work with AFWP and be part of something much bigger than myself. I have also attended presentations on the Peace Belt, another phenomenal project of AFWP. The impact that the Peace Belt has had on the people of the countries it has traveled to is incredible. It is very inspiring to be part of something so powerful.

TAILS	194093	1	/users/profile/253573	HealthyNeighbors	Client Served	5	02/10/2014	I have known numerous people feeding stray and feral cats in a neighborhood where my job takes me. In the Spring of each year there would be literally a hundred kittens running about, getting hit by cars, competing for food that the neighbors (who could barely afford to feed themselves) would put out for the animals, and ultimately reproducing to add to the numbers of cats. The people of TAILS were wonderful, not only helping with spay/neuter assistance but also putting me in contact with people who could help trap the cats, socialize the little ones, and ultimately get some of them adopted. The people in the neighborhood are thrilled that they still have many of the cats there to keep down the rodents, but mostly thankful that they don't have to worry about so many pitiful little kittens they cannot afford to help. Thank you, TAILS, and all of your great volunteers.

TAILs helps out when the shelters are overrun, even though their main goal is to spay and neuter cats (and dogs) --to help with the cost of adoptions and to make sure that the pets are spayed and neutered before they go to their forever homes.   When I was fostering 3 kittens last Fall, I brought the kittens to be shown at local pet store adoption fairs.  TAILs attends many of these pet store adoption fairs so the animals can be exposed to potential adopters.  I also help spread the word for 'Team TAILs' at local running events and attend TAILs fundraising events like the tag sale and Halloween party.

TAILS	193983		/users/profile/253410	Sharon104	Advisor	5	02/08/2014	This small, fiscally responsible group gets more done than many much larger groups.  The mood is upbeat and helpful when TAILS comes to help.  I have relied upon this group for years in assisting my elderly clients who need help spaying/neutering their pets.  The TAILS volunteers get things done efficiently and with as little fuss as possible.  They can work with people from all socio economic and age groups.Love love love them-go TAILS!
TAILS	193982		/users/profile/253409	David216	Donor	5	02/08/2014	I feel that every dollar TAILS receives has a multiplier effect.  This competent and caring group goes above and beyond anything I have seen in a volunteer organization particularly one this small.  A small cadre of volunteers raises funds, does public outreach and spays and neuters many many animals.  What I feel is unique is that TAILS will be faced with a problem and they do not pass it along - this highly effective team solves the problem.  Large group of cats, low income owner - no problem they will go in and speak with the person, physically transport the cats, have them spayed/neutered and vaccinated before returning them.  All in all a wonderful and effective group!
TAILS	193911		/users/profile/253310	Annalie L.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/07/2014	TAILS uses 100% of its funding to directly help animals.  TAILS is there on the ground making sure impoverished individuals can afford to have their animals spayed and neutered thereby helping to prevent pet overpopulation.  They work well with other groups in coordinating the lowest possible cost for spays and neuters for both cats and dogs.  TAILS has an excellent relationship with Veterinarians and have encouraged many to contribute free spays and neuters to this group on an annual basis - virtually unheard of.  They are compassionate and yet incredibly professional which allows other professionals to work with them.  It is an incredible mix of people who are able to deal kindly with the poor and elderly, able to go into situations most of us would not want to be in to help those in need of their services and yet able to manage a non profit by the books.  All in all an awesome group. 
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	53982		/users/profile/55154	lara2	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/29/2010	The DSC has done a lot of great work with their educational efforts. As a juvenile justice reform advocacy organization, we look at effective programs in the state that divert youth away from the justice system. We have found DSCs mediation practices to be really effective in resolving issues that would have otherwise resulted in a suspension or expulsion. The proof is in the numbers; for instance, in Danbury suspensions declined by almost 60% from 416 to 169. The Dispute Settlement Center is a well-respected organization in the communities it serves from Hartford to Bridgeport and from Stamford to Danbury. We have seen programs that do a good job of trying to prevent youth from offending, but mediation is, by far, one of the best tools for reducing re-offenses.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	53978		/users/profile/55150	vsf28	Board Member	4	09/29/2010	My association with The dispute Settlement Center began in 1995 when I became the second Executive Director in a then 3 year old organization.  During that time we grew beyond  our court mediation programs to include peer mediation training in the Norwalk elementary schools and community mediation services through our contacts with the Norwalk community police program.   Since that early period, I remained involved with DSC as a volunteer mediator and joined the Board approximately five years ago. I have witnessed the organization grow exponentially in the areas of youth mediation and community education.  At this point in time, the DSC has a well deserved reputation as the pre-eminent community mediation agency serving the Fairfield County Area.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	53956		/users/profile/55124	ibass	Board Member	5	09/29/2010	DSC (The Dispute Settlement Center) helps youth at risk, adults at risk, homeowners at risk, and teaches all involved in the process, the power of mediation as a tool to resolve conflict.  In many cases this process is a life changing event for youth at risk, and a tremendous ally to support systems in the education process.  The outcome is typically a successful resolution to a conflict, without burdening the judicial system, and without the fallout or expense associated with court proceedings.  This organization is staffed by a team of dedicated professionals and para professionals who believe in what they do, and the results speak for themself.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	53951		/users/profile/55120	rfrancis	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/29/2010	The Dispute Settlement Center (DSC)has been a partner with RYASAP for the last 7 years both through our Juvenile Review Board (JRB) as well as our Juvenile Justice Task Force (JJTF).With the JRB, DSC has provided mediation services to young first time offenders and their families who are being diverted from the juvenile justice system. The services are particularly effective where there is conflict between family members and with the community in which the young person ahs committed their offense. The model balanced and restorative justice is consistent across both the JRB and DSC.With the JJTF, DSC has been a ongoing member for the last 7 years and has contributed vital services to building a continuum of care for young people in the juvenile justice system in teh greater Bridgeport, CT area. The JJTF consists of over 40 area providers representing law enforcement, probation, detention, education, parent advocacy and children's advocacy and legal services. The DSC has been a very involved partner in the work of making major improvements in increasing services to young people and diverting a large number of young people from the JJ system.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	53941		/users/profile/55109	ms3	Board Member	5	09/29/2010	The Dispute Settlement Center in Wilton, Connecticut is a high impact non-profit Community Mediation agency serving a substantial cross-section of individuals, agencies and institutions in Fairfield County, Connecticut. For many years, DSC has helped individuals who have been involved in a wide variety of disputes and conflicts. The number of people who have been positively impacted by DSC has grown into the thousands each year. The help and assistance of skilled Mediators has proven to be an effective resource for all of the many communities in Fairfield County. Included within the scope of the populations served are: students in multiple schools; children in the juvenile justice system; adults in the criminal justice system; and many others who have taken advantage of the mediation and conflict resolution opportunities that DSC provides before engaging in more protracted and expensive litigation.  DSC has developed very positive and productive relationships with Chiefs of Police, School Administrators, Court Officials, Judges in both Adult Criminal and Juvenile Courts, Probation Officers, Family Relations Counselors, Attorneys and countless other professionals.  It is abundantly clear that DSC contribute enormously to fill the need for social programs and services above and beyond the limits of the services provided by established and existing institutions. This "public-private" partnership between DSC and those existing institutions continues to grow and flourish in Fairfield County largely due to the tireless efforts of a dedictate staff; a very devoted Board of Directors; and the extremely important and generous financial contributions from individuals, agencies, and foundations who share the concern for providing meaningful alternatives for individuals involved in various types of conflicts and disputes.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	53713		/users/profile/54858	msternheim	Board Member	5	09/28/2010	The Dispute Settlement Center, serving Western CT, is a model agency for the valuable role that mediation can play in the life of communities.  DSC works in the schools, in the courts,among neighbors and within families to find constructive, mutally satisfying alternatives to settle disputes.  DSC educates young people to resolve conflict through mediation and relieves the courts of ever increasing dockets through mediated settlements.DSC has helped renters and homeowners avoid eviction and foreclosure and given police departments alternative options for handling offenses within communities. Mediation is a humane and thoughtful alternative to resolving disputes and strengthens communities by reducing resentment and recidivism.  DSC has documented approaches and data to show the impact and value of its work.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	52973		/users/profile/54009	erynbingle	Former staff	5	09/21/2010	I am an attorney by training, and I was very interested in the growing field of alternative dispute resolution, especially in the juvenile justice and educational settings.  I was thrilled to come across the Dispute Settlement Center, a non-profit mediation agency based in Wilton, Connecticut that serves much of the state.  DSC is one of a very small number of mediation agencies in Connecticut with strong community and court mediation programs.As a former juvenile court mediator and researcher with DSC, I have seen firsthand the empowering, positive impact of mediation on young offenders and on the judicial process.  Mediation works -- our participants' reoffense rates are lower and satisfaction rates are higher than their peers who do not have the opportunity to try mediation.  DSC has a reputation for working well with the attorneys, judges and probation units in the juvenile and adult courts that they serve.  I would strongly recommend this agency to practitioners seeking a place to apply (or acquire) their mediation skills and to members of the judicial branch looking to join the growing alternative dispute resolution movement in Connecticut.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	52825		/users/profile/53821	amlong	Board Member	5	09/19/2010	The Dispute Settlement Center is a little known non for profit that accomplishes great things.  They keep their staff lean and really place as much money into accomplishing their goals.  They provide mediation services to assist juveniles avoid going into the court system, set up peer mediation programs in several schools, receive grant money to help people avoid losing their homes in foreclosure and provide affordable mediation services to the community for a whole host of disputes.
Dispute Settlement Center, Inc.	52592		/users/profile/53537	cbaker	Professional with expertise in this field	4	09/16/2010	The Dispute Settlement Center worked extensively with our high school staff and students to develop a mediation and a peer mediation program.  The best part of the work their trained professionals did, was help empower us to sustain these programs on our own and to integrate these methods into the daily practices of school life.  Since the development of our mediation programs, we have seen a marked decrease in behavioral incidents and suspensions.    We are also pleased that the Dispute Settlement Center helped us to develop more leadership opportunities for high school students by training them to become peer mediators.

Without these services, these children would perish due to lack of medical expertise, supplies and medicines in their home country. The 100% volunteer team and donated services means that HCI is able to put virtually 100% of donor dollars to work right in the host-country. Incredible organization and incredible results!

Heart Care International Inc	260246	2	/users/profile/348670	Amy_236	Donor	5	09/30/2015	Heart defects are the most common form of childhood birth defect.  In the US, all of these children will receive the most comprehensive medical care to rectify their potentially life threatening defect.  In under-developed countries, these children will not.  HCI sends expert medical professionals into the host country to help save the lives of these children, but they also train the host country medical professionals so that they can eventually care for their own.  With over 2000 children served and hundreds of medical professionals trained, the results speak for themselves.  And the fact that the medical professionals are NOT paid.  They take vacation time away from their usual place of work, away from their loved ones and dedicate their time to saving children's lives.  A truly amazing organization and one which I am proud to support!
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61859		/users/profile/67593	Egal312514	General Member of the Public	5	01/31/2011	I have been attending NHSO Pops! concerts for a number of years. Jerry Steichen and the NHSO Pops! are FANTASTIC. From Big Band to Broadway and Holiday programming to American standards these concerts have something for everyone. It's quality entertainment for people of all ages! I often bring my daughter and elderly parents and we have a fanstatic night out each and every time. The NHSO is a Connecticut treasure.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61838		/users/profile/67566	DCFinest4	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/31/2011	My favorite experiences with the New Haven Symphony Orchestra center on the innovative education programs, which reach an astouding number of children each year. As I am a firm believer in music education and its proven benefits, I am delighted each time I get to witness a childs first experience with orchestral music. The Music and Meditation program, presented by the NHSO and composer Jin Hi Kim, had an immediate and profound effect on each child it touched. I was grateful to bear witness to these effects. Its not every day one gets to watch a class of rowdy middle school children meditate peacefully and quietly. The look of concentration on their faces is something I wont soon forget.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61341		/users/profile/66955	cmcooooooooooooo	General Member of the Public	4	01/27/2011	My husband and I attended the Christmas Concert which included a sing-a-long portion.  We were very impressed with the quality of the orchestra.  We also enjoyed the quality of the school chorus that was featured.  We enjoyed the  concert very much and plan to attend other New Haven Symphony Concerts.I thought the banter between the conductor and soloist was a bit juvenile, and the song choices by the school chorus were a bit dreary for a Christmas concert. But we won't hold that against the orchestra.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61277		/users/profile/66872	Mario J. Zangari	Board Member	5	01/27/2011	My experience is new in my role as a NHSO Board Member, but my experience of enjoying their artistic talents goes back to my early years in New Haven.  As the fourth oldest Symphony Orchestras in the Country, the NHSO has shown not only endurance but creativity and resourcefulness in it's artistic presentations. It has had too!   New Haven is a small city, but the NHSO has been one of its large artistic organizations along with Yale and its artistic functions.  This artistic competition between Yale and NHSO has made both better.  However, NHSO has to compete with, obviously, a small fraction of the assets of Yale.   My point is that NHSO'S  artistic talent has been tested over time and in many macro and micro economic conditions.  NHSO'S ability to continue draw subscribers is due to the dedicated conductors, orchestra, and staff.  Any monetary support in these trying economic times will help!
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61259		/users/profile/66847	staceyrose88	Board Member	5	01/27/2011	The New Haven Symphony Orchestra is one of the finest orchestras I have ever had the privilege of working with in my 30 years of working in the classical music field.  As a board member and as a musician, I am continually awed by the level of excellence of this group. Not only its musical blend and nuance, but its range of syle in varied repertoire is most impressive and moving. The ensemble's innovative and comprehensive outreach to the community is inspiring young audiences throughout the area. This superb group of musicians has the magnetism that brings the glory of music to whomever is fortunate enough to hear them play.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61181		/users/profile/66757	Ioannes	General Member of the Public	5	01/26/2011	I often attended free concerts at Yale, then a friend gave me tickets to the New Haven Symphony for my birthday.  I had forgotten what a difference listening to a professional orchestra can make.  The concert was interesting, the players created an enormous sound and worked so well together.  It was an experience on an entirely different level. I especially look forward to their outdoor performances during the summer and I remember waltzing to the Blue Danube Waltz with my girlfriend (now wife) many summers ago.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61175		/users/profile/66753	DES Attorney	Board Member	5	01/26/2011	I am consistently amazed at the level of talent in our Orchestra.

New Haven Symphony Orchestra	61135		/users/profile/66702	buffalogal	General Member of the Public	5	01/26/2011	I have bought season's tickets for the last three years and have enjoyed every concert.  I like the combination of classic and contemporary pieces at many of the concerts.  I also like the outreach concerts for children and communities other than New Haven.  It's good exposure for the NHSO and it's a great opportunity to for many more people to experience wonderful music.  I enjoyed the time when 3 NHSO members came to our school and performed for the children and also allowed them to try out their instruments.  I think it's important to keep reaching out to the public.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	60921		/users/profile/66412	writerobrien	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/25/2011	Aside from their excellent regular programming, the New Haven Symphony Orchestra provides a wonderful program for children. Many of the musicians offer the children a chance to learn about their instruments and to try them many times. During the performance, the conductor will explain a little about the pieces being performed. It is a fantastic introduction to the classics as well as live performance.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	60899		/users/profile/66393	Ceorbhal	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/25/2011	I have been impressed with the NHSO for so many reasons.  The performances, led by William Boughton, are world class and the programming is intriguing.  The Family Programs are great fun (I bring my two-year old) and the teaching artists are so adept at drawing the children out, helping them try the instruments, and keeping them engaged during the performance.  The NHSO's trombonist was able to get my daughter to make a sound on his trombone and she was thrilled.  It is wonderful to have a cultural resource of true excellence right here in our backyard.
New Haven Symphony Orchestra	54639		/users/profile/56282	new-haven-symphony	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/07/2010	Soloist Elissa Koljonen shines in NHSO season openerPublished in the New Haven Register on Tuesday, September 21, 2010By David J. BakerNEW HAVEN  Thursdays season-opening concert by the New Haven Symphony Orchestra got off to a slow start. The audience in Woolsey Hall had to wait a full half-hour past curtain time because, it was announced, one or two key musicians were blocked out of town by storm and travel delays.The incident says something about your 100-piece symphony orchestra, in which 98 or 99 percent of members are not enough to make a quorum. By those rules, how would anything ever get done in a large school, corporation, hospital, or in the U.S. Congress? (OK, strike that last example.) Is an orchestra the only large institution that is not weatherproof?After the long wait, some kind of bubbly entertainment was called for, but instead we heard an academic-sounding almost-symphony by Robert Schumann that called for more patience. The title, Overture, Scherzo and Finale, meaning basically beginning, middle and end, is about as imaginative as the music itself.With the Violin Concert No. 1 in G Minor (1866) by Max Bruch, things instantly picked up. The tightly focused orchestra under conductor William Boughton played with such care, warmth and rhythmic variety that the performance would have been rewarding even without a soloist at center stage. But it had one, the remarkable Elissa Lee Koljonen, a violinist of charm and technical virtuosity.Her work gained in intensity after some initial competition against thick orchestra sound. She waxed lyrical as well as forceful in the undulating slow lines of the second movement, and the finale found her coolly and stylishly dispatching rapid-fire chords, triplets and staccato fortes.The concert concluded with a whirlwind performance of the colossal Symphony No. 1 in C Minor by Johannes Brahms (1833-97). In an apparent quest for romantic-style drama, the conductor emphasized speed, loudness, sudden shifts and harsh conflicts.Brahms was of course as cerebral as he was romantic, fascinated by structure, detail and as a devotee of the works of Johann Sebastian Bach  complex counterpoint. Boughtons insistence on dark, coarsened textures tended to blur the intricacy of the score. By the third movement, signs of carelessness suggested the intensity was taking a toll, but the players constantly bounced back, offering wonderful moments.The audience reacted warmly to the ambitious and exciting finale, in which some passages had a speed and precision, even at crushing volume, that seemed a rare accomplishment.

The community has also embraced the mission of Solar Youth, and we often receive correspondence from program participants stating how much of an impact the organization has made.I look forward to my continued involvement with Solar Youth.
Solar Youth Inc	37134	4	/users/profile/37880	colinthegreat	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/27/2010	Solar Youth is a great organization with a dedicated staff. I first came into contact with Solar Youth in 2004 in Indiana where some of their kids were participating in an environmental leadership conference. Since then, I have interacted with Solar Youth mostly in New Haven, Connecticut where they are recognized and respected as a top-notch educational organization.

Solar Youth Inc	36935	7	/users/profile/37697	jbnonp	Donor	5	04/26/2010	Having met Solar Youth's founding executive director (Joanne Sciulli) eight years ago, I have followed the organization's work ever since.  Integrating environmental and civic education with a caring, safe, supportive setting in which young people assume increasing responsibilities and leadership roles, Solar Youth is a tremendous asset to the New Haven community.  Impressed by its sustained offerings and accomplishments, I have been pleased for years to contribute financially to its operations -- one of many small-scale donors who appreciate how much this nonprofit delivers on a modest budget.My most personal connection to Solar Youth has come through a young man I've mentored, now in 10th grade, who has been part of the organization since I met him when he was a 6th-grader.  His maturity, social and verbal skills, environmental awareness and general sense of responsibility have grown in significant measure through his affiliation with Solar Youth.  Through a collaboration involving it and the Urban Resources Initiative, he also obtained a job planting trees here in New Haven, an assignment that further fostered his knowledge of natural resources while giving him teamwork and work experience. Though youth development is not my area of professional expertise (which involves school-university partnership in development of teachers), I do have some acquaintance with the broader out-of-school field through a research project that a fellow graduate student and I did for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts about a decade ago.  With that grounding in the key characteristics of high-quality youth and out-of-school programs, I can say with confidence that Solar Youth is an excellent one.  It deserves greater recognition and support.
Solar Youth Inc	36779	7	/users/profile/37563	stephanie8	Donor	5	04/23/2010	This is an incredible organization.  I am a former employee and very strongly believe in their mission.  Solar Youth really does great work!

I enjoy this non profit because it develops leadership in city children through a program aimed at environmental awareness. I have helped with year end work and have attended presentations where the future leaders present what they have achieved througout the year.  It is a great organic leadership program which develops life skills for children that may not have access to positive mentors.  The energy of the director and staff is amazing.

Hartford Food System, Inc.	313528	1	/users/profile/404894	Sheryl25	Board Member	5	10/23/2016	Hartford Food Systems has always been ahead of the curve. They have advocated for systems thinking way before this was understood as essential to solving multi-faceted complex problems. This is a lean organization that uses its resources wisely and is always imagining innovative ways to tackle the problem of universal equitable access to healthy foods. 
Hartford Food System, Inc.	313150	1	/users/profile/404521	FCofM	Donor	4	10/21/2016	The great thing about this organization is the way they take a system approach to dealing with food insecurity in the area. Because of this they are engaged in a number of multifaceted programs such as urban agriculture, youth leadership, farmers markets, mobile market, community kitchen, school gardens, child care nutrition, improving the quality and quantity of fresh food at local retailers as well as helping to create policy recommendations for the city's advisory commission on food and policy. This  organization is a valuable asset to the community that I am happy to support and I encourage others to do the same.

Hartford Food System does that, and goes well beyond that, bringing a multi-faceted, "systems-thinking" approach to address the issues of food insecurity in Hartford and throughout the region.

Now I have realized what a life changing experience this has been for my students. When you are able to instill knowledge and new skills and help someone lift themselves up out of their current situation in a BETTER one that is wonderful. I have seen many doors of opportunity open for my students with their new found language skills. Their self confidence is up they feel good about themselves and everything they have accomplished because of this program. I have personally overseen the improvement of quality of life for my students and their social life in society has changed since they have the skills to interreact with others in English.

Lifebridge Community Services Inc	194611		/users/profile/254330	alissaperlman	Volunteer	5	02/20/2014	The concept is almost too simple: get the food that's about to be thrown out to the people who don't have enough to eat.  When I first signed up I was nervous about going in the back door of restaurants and grocery stores, and even more nervous to walk into shelters.  But the employees were so happy to share their food with me and those at the shelters were so grateful to take it that I soon became confident in my role.  The web site is great.  You just scroll through, decide which routes fit into your schedule, and sign up for them.  At first I tried out a whole bunch of routes around town, then I found my favorite routes and adopted them, which meant that I was automatically signed up to take them each week.  Sometimes when you volunteer you aren't sure whether you actually contributed.  But when you physically hand food to someone who needs it, you can be sure your work had meaning.  The only reason I stopped volunteering here is that I moved out of the state.

School for Ethical Education Inc	229259		/users/profile/292908	jrrazz.ramos84	Client Served	5	10/29/2014	This organization added tremendous value to the Bridgeport Public Schools by challenging our students to reflect upon, write about and demonstrate ethical behavior.  As a result of our involvement with the School for Ethical Education, Inc, our students not only won distinction for their essays but they also created meaningful, charitable projects. Additionally, I can say that the School for Ethical Education leadership is comprised of outstanding human beings intent on raising the level of ethical consciousness across our communities.  It has been a pleasure to be associated with such fine citizens.
School for Ethical Education Inc	223064		/users/profile/286805	PamelaGardner	Client Served	5	10/15/2014	West Haven High School has a long standing relationship with the School for Ethical Education that has been overwhelmingly positive! Our students established an Academic Integrity Committee and have created an integrity policy that was approved by the Board of Education. This group has been very active  and the support from the SEE has been invaluable. AIC (Academic Integrity Committee) also develops lessons for advisory and reads to third grade classes about integrity (SpongeBob, etc.).  The School for Ethical Education has also worked with our teachers on a variety of projects including Achieving with Integrity where we implement integrity lessons into English, Science and Social Studies classes. The leadership, advice, and guidance offered from the staff as the SEE is extremely meaningful and helpful. 
School for Ethical Education Inc	215118		/users/profile/278475	JohannaF	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2014	I am a teacher who was introduced to the School for Ethical Education (SEE) in 2003.  As a language arts teacher, I am always on the look-out for ways to inspire student writing.  SEE's Laws of Life Essay Contest is a fantastic motivator; students are challenged to "dig deep" to find their own literary voices while exploring ethics and good character.  Student essayists invited to attend the Character Celebration are treated to an evening of inspiring speakers and are honored for their own dedication to ethical responsibility.  It is important for the youth to know that qualities such as honesty, integrity, and determination are valued by their teachers, parents, and greater community.  By highlighting a businessperson or community leader who exemplifies ethics in action, students see how success does not require a compromise of ones ethics or morals.  I am grateful to the School for Ethical Education for providing a challenging and inspiring opportunity to me and my students. They are a group of passionate professionals who help highlight the positive efforts and actions of others.
School for Ethical Education Inc	215105		/users/profile/278456	BrooksLoomis	General Member of the Public	5	09/15/2014	I came to this site for the purpose of sharing my review of this nonprofit from the unbiased perspective of an event attendee's guest.  Back in May (2014) it was my great pleasure to accompany a dear friend to The School's "Character Celebration" Awards Dinner. I refused to set any particular expectation for myself; after all it wasn't like I had any preconceived notion as to what The School's mission was or who was listed on their Board of Trustees. I was simply content attending this midweek function at the request of my friend.  Well, I was in for quite a surprise! I was genuinely shocked by each essay these children wrote. They did such a remarkable job articulating, I could no longer place "youth" in the same arena as "inexperienced".  There was a brief moment  during the ceremony where I felt no association to 99% of the room; the children truly shined like sparkling stars, the judges, faculty and trustees exemplified greatness and achievement, and I silently championed every parent that sat proudly next to their exemplary child.  It should be every school's objective to raise such phenomenal young adults and lead them into this world in the same manner SEE accomplishes on a daily basis! I was honored and grateful to be included for what ended up being a fantastic evening! I left that night both motivated and inspired, and continue to applaud this nonprofit just as loudly as I did for those children back in May!
School for Ethical Education Inc	214854	1	/users/profile/273927	kristiefink	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/12/2014	I have known David Wangaard, the director of The School for Ethical Education since the mid-90's, and have found him to be a very thoughtful and articulate spokesperson for the character and ethical education movement. I invited David twice to provide professional development to teachers I was working with on a grant project, and his presentations were outstanding and very helpful. The School for Ethical Education has a long history of developing high quality materials, professional development, resources and support to schools to help them integrate ethics into their broader curriculum. I often mention The Golden Compass to teachers as an outstanding publication that can help them teach their students a process for ethical decision-making and the importance for all of us in developing a golden compass to guide us in life. I highly recommend The School for Ethical Education to any teacher, school or district interested in integrating character education into their basic school program and school improvement process.
School for Ethical Education Inc	214481		/users/profile/277751	perryalbert2	Volunteer	5	09/10/2014	I have served as a judge for the past eight years for the Laws of Life essay program, which is a student writing and character development project that is capped each spring with an award program for the writers, their teachers and family members at an Annual Awards Dinner. The celebration honors ten Connecticut students who have written outstanding essays that reflect their own deepest values and character goals based upon their personal experience. I can honestly say that the  gathering held in New Haven this past May was the best organized and most inspiring celebration of its kind that I have ever attended. The recipient of the annual Ethics in Action award, Cindi Bigelow, could not have been a more positive and effective spokesperson for all that SEE seeks to represent; with her special brand of humor, intelligence, and generosity, the President and CEO of Bigelow Tea asked each of the 10 student recipients to stand as she briefly summarized the highlights of each essay. What a splendid model in character, ethics, and leadership this inspiring honoree set for every one of us in attendance!

School for Ethical Education Inc	98276		/users/profile/116697	gregryan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/27/2011	The School for Ethical Education (SEE) has been an active participant in the Connecticut Assets Network since 1998. During this time, SEE has sponsored a variety of Character Education workshops, conferences, contests and awards for youth and the adults who work with them throughout the state of Connecticut (see pictures below). Early on, SEEs multi-day state conferences were often youth-driven and demonstrated character education programs from around the state. Its only drawback is that it doesnt have enough staff and funding to bring its programs and expertise to every school in the state. SEEs greatest assets are its many programs which include: 1. Youth: Ethics in Service (YES) helps Connecticut educators and youth in grades 2-12 implement meaningful service-learning projects. The goal of YES is to promote academic achievement, critical thinking, character development and civic engagement through the teaching strategy of service-learning. Service-learning is different from community service in that it involves a deliberate inclusion of academic curriculum and reflection before, during, and after service. Under this initiative, the School for Ethical Education began a youth philanthropy board in January 2004 as a project supported by its Learn and Serve grant and support from the Connecticut Assets Network.  The goal of the youth philanthropy board is to provide high school students the training and experience to successfully distribute mini-grants in support of service-learning projects in New Haven County. Ten students were recruited from seven high schools in New Haven County. The students met twice a month and learned about youth philanthropy in support of service-learning.  The group's goal was to create a Request for Proposal (RFP) that could be disseminated to New Haven County schools in the fall of 2004.  The board named itself Student Activists for Service-Learning and identified leadership roles to help guide their activities. 2. The Laws of Life Essay: The Laws of Life essay program offers a great opportunity for students in grades 512 to think, reflect, discuss with peers and adults and then write about their core values, principles and ideals that will guide them throughout their lives. Laws of Life is a student writing and character development project that supports writing practice for CT Mastery and CAPT testing.  3. Curricula Development: the director of SEE, David Wangaard, Ph.D. has developed curricula to support their Character Education Programs. Some examples are:     a.  Service Learning Workbook: this workbook is intended to help youth and their adult leaders plan and implement service-learning projects. This comprehensive resource, Service-Learning: Planning and Reflection, A Step-by-Step Guide (Character Development Publishing), is directed at youth in grades 4 through 12 and their teachers or adult leaders in schools or in after-school programs.      b.  Integrity Works! is a program that promotes academic integrity to reduce cheating and plagiarism in secondary schools. SEE provides guidance for schools to form an Academic Integrity Committee (AIC) with the goal of authoring, implementing and evaluating a strategic plan promoting academic integrity. Integrity Works! has its own Academic Motivation and Integrity Survey (AMIS) for research-based student survey measurement.      c. The Golden Compass: the activities and skills taught through application of The Golden Compass workbook provide a compass needle that always points to alternatives in support of positive character. Teachers and students learn a character-based decision making strategy and are provided 56 dilemmas to help students practice the Golden Compass strategy.

The content covered and the manner it is delivered in makes an impact -- on a business, social and personal level. I would recommend SEE to any organization that:- has an ethics plan in place,- is considering putting one in place,- or simply is feels ethics requires a focus in their organization I encourage you to contact the School of Ethical Education to SEE what they could do for you. I am certain the results will be positive, as the surveys we conduct continue to be rewarding for our annual leadership program.

David Wangaard and his associates have a clarity of vision for schools to assist them in focusing on strategies to develop a caring and responsible classroom environment.  His books in service learning, character based decision making and now, academic integrity deserve the attention of all potential funders who understand that the development of good people is every bit as important as the development of smart people.  Indeed a good education must aspire to both and the School For Ethical Education raises this truth to a high level.
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	286447	1	/users/profile/174792	billmcca	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	What Norwalk MeansTo most of us, Norwalk is a small city in Connecticut.  But to many in Nagarote, Nicaragua, Norwalk means so much more.  Say Norwalk to a taxi driver in Nagarote  no street name, no address  and he will bring you to the Norwalk/Nagarote Community Center.  Ask a group of kids what Norwalk has meant to them and they will bring tears to your eyes.  Javier, a fifteen-year-old, says he is learning computers in Norwalk.  That $300 scholarship eighteen-year-old Evaristo receives from Norwalk enables him to attend college for a year; in return, he tutors younger kids at the Center.  Velia, a nineteen-year-old, tells us that in Norwalk, her teachers are friends.  Now a university student in Managua, she says shes studying law because of Norwalk.  Norwalk is family to me, says Jeffry.Juan Gabriel Hernandez Rocha, the ex-Mayor of Nagarote, told us Nagarote and Norwalk have been married to each other for 27 years.  Till death do us part, he half-joked.Norwalk means promise, hope, opportunity.  The Norwalk/Nagarote Sister-City Project means so much in the lives of the people of Nagarote.http://www.sistercityproject.org
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	129422	1	/users/profile/174792	billmcca	Board Member	5	10/25/2012	I visited the Norwalk/Nagarote Sister-City Project in Nicaragua last February.  I returned deeply impressed with the quality and scope of the Project, even more strongly dedicated to helping it continue to succeed. Now in its 26th year, N/N supports a pre-school program for little ones and an after-school program for teens.  Computers, baking, sewing, hairdressing, art, and martial arts are just a few of the programs the staff offers to 185 kids as an alternative to the gangs, drugs, and pregnancies that often go hand-in-hand with poverty. The Project also offers an extensive organic agriculture and home gardening program. Most importantly, the Norwalk/Nagarote Sister-City Project provides hope.  Eighty-two students are offered scholarships from grade school to the university.  While most of their parents never finished sixth grade, almost all of our scholars complete high school and continue on to college. (Sixth grade is as far as my own father went; I know first-hand how important education is, how much hope it gives).Part of the attraction of N/N is how personal it is, how local.  Friends and neighbors here in the Norwalk area are working together to help friends and neighbors in Nagarote (and once you have visited, you know these are friends and neighbors!).

Plus, we've experienced very little, if any, teen pregnancy in the 11 years we've had this program although Nicaragua has the highest teen pregnancy rate in Latin America.
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	133439	1	/users/profile/179157	kdenney	Board Member	5	11/04/2012	I volunteered to lick envelopes for the NNSCP after reading about it in the paper and right away had the chance to meet the President and Executive Director bc they are so deeply involved in this organization.   They are passionate about the program, working tirelessly to support the cause and even traveling regularly to Nagarote at their own expense.  It turned out that most of the board is just as invested.  I was hooked. Every penny - except for one staff person in Norwalk - goes to the program in Nagarote and is managed by an unbelievable field manager, with close financial oversight from Norwalk.  The accomplishments include a beautiful new community center (I attended its grand opening) chock full of programs and smiling kids of all ages, the eradication of gangs in the Jeronimo Lopez barrio, an organic farm around which a number of programs are being developed and kids attending school and college thanks to grants from the program.  There are also regular "delegations" that travel from the US, providing a chance for other people - especially kids - to see first-hand what is being done and how their contributions matter, hopefully creating new generations that will want to give back.  Having seen this board in action and having been to Nagarote to see the results of the program, I've become an enthusiastic donor and participant myself.
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	130769		/users/profile/176267	Susan148	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	Seven years ago, I took my first trip to Nagarote, Nicaragua to help establish a photo project and see first-hand what was happening in this project that I had heard about since 1986. I was hooked! I was so impressed with the work being done with the youth that I came back determined to help the project grow (and indeed it has grown tremendously over the past 7 years).                                                                                                                                                                          But more importantly for me personally, I had made some wonderful friends. The young people that I first met when they were 14 and 15 years old are now college students working with the youth currently in our program. They are thoughtful, energetic, and hopeful - wonderful role models for the young people of course, but also for the older ones who see them determined to make a better life. The family I stay with is like my own family. They have all given me far more than I have given them.                         For a small organization with a very small budget, NNSCP has made a huge difference in the lives of the people - from preschoolers and their parents, to elementary age students in the reading circle, to young people in our youth project, to all the children, youth, and college students in our scholarship program. It has also had an impact on the whole town, through its reforestation project and model organic farm. Its success in so many areas makes it a model for good development work.
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	130689	1	/users/profile/176183	kretscht	Board Member	5	10/29/2012	The Norwalk Sister City Project does some incredible sustainable community development work in one of the neediest areas of this part of the world.  As an active board member I have made numerous visits to our site in Nagarote, Nicaragua and I can really see the difference that our efforts are making.  Because we hire a director to oversea our efforts we maintain a real hands-on sense of what is being done.  On our last visit I think what really impressed me the most was to see so many of our young people who had been through the program, now working in various capacities as volunteers and paid workers.   You could see the glow in their eyes and feel the sense of self worth that they felt towards the program and how proud they were to be helping to continue the work for the next generation. There is very little overhead in running our project and the money we raise truly goes directly to our programs
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	129596		/users/profile/174968	jwoyke	Board Member	5	10/26/2012	This charity pairs Norwalk, CT with the city of Nagarote in Nicaragua.  The mayer of Nagarote asked the project to help with youth in one barrio in his city where crime was high.  The project has established a preschool set up youth after-school projects organized sports activities, etc. and as a result has eliminated youth gangs, lowered school drop out rates and and given hope to the poorest of chirldren.  Many of the project kids are now entering college.  In effect the programs have worked to turn poor kids into middle class kids with plans and hope of the future.  All of this has been done with a tiny budget!  This is truly a project that is a model for changing the world... one child at a time.

They have developed a long standing relationship with families in Nagarote and have partnered successfully with other local organizations in Nicaragua to support education, professional development, the arts, and food security among the youth and families of Nagarote.  
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	58023		/users/profile/61589	judyphillips	Volunteer	5	11/29/2010	The Norwalk/Nagarote Sister City Project does a tremendous job with very little.  For over twenty years the project has operated with no paid staff here in the states.  All of the money has gone directly to fund the programs in Nagarote.
Norwalk Sister City Project, Inc.	20263	1	/users/profile/21422	tishgibbs@sbcglobal.net	Volunteer	5	10/28/2009	The Norwalk/Nagarote Sister City Project has had remarkable success working with at-risk teens in a desperately poor barrio in Nagarote, Nicaragua by providing after school activities including community service.  Instead of getting involved with gangs and drugs, the youngsters created a tree nursery and grew more than 16,000 trees from seed over 4 years.  They give the trees to residents who agree to care for them.
After School Arts Program, Inc.	193573		/users/profile/252832	jsphmont	Board Member	5	01/31/2014	I have never served on a board that is as passionate and forthright about its mission. First and foremost are the children who take part in the workshops. So many have gone on to successful careers thanks to the supplemental work of ASAP, picking up and offering programs that many schools can no longer afford to do.Their outreach is crucial to developing the talents of local children.
After School Arts Program, Inc.	182400	1	/users/profile/239216	sarab	Volunteer	5	10/25/2013	Both of my kids have participated in several of ASAP's multitude of offerings, including attendance at summer camps four years in a row and many weekend workshops.  The curriculum is creative and keeps the kids engaged and wanting more.  The teaching staff is wonderfully talented and the administrative staff are extremely professional, organized and friendly.  This is a top-notch organization top to bottom, providing my kids exposure to the arts that exceeded my expectations in every way. In light of my positive experience, I have volunteered for ASAP in many different capacities over the years, most recently as a Board Member.
After School Arts Program, Inc.	179322	1	/users/profile/235965	annmarieyogi	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	The ASAP program is so important and needed in Connecticut.  There is so much diversity of programs that they offer.  I personal appreciate how almost all the programs are short between five to six weeks, this allows our children to get a taste of different programs and then they can see what resonates with them.  Both my daughters have enjoyed the summer camp, Pilobolus dance, and are currently in the Hip Hop class.  My daughter Ryan told me after the summer camp she no longer feels shy to dance in front of people.  This is a true testament to this program, all of the teachers instill creativity and freedom of expression which is so important for young children and their development.  I highly recommend this program to any parent that wants to offer their child more diverse after school programs.   ASAP is a non profit and no child is ever turned away from their programs.  I proudly support this ASAP and feel so honored to have my daughters benefit from the wonderful programs that they offer. 
After School Arts Program, Inc.	178098	1	/users/profile/234720	Laura165	Client Served	5	10/16/2013	Our children have been participating in ASAP weekend workshops and the summer camp for more than 5 years.  ASAP is always seeking to come up with new and exciting ways to engage children in the arts through very diverse workshops and summer camp classes.  It opens up children's minds and their world to areas they would not otherwise be exposed.  The warmth of the counselors and those involved in ASAP permeates the community.  They are open to new ideas and input from the families involved.  They have also taken extra time and measures to accommodate one of our children who has Down Syndrome.  He is very high functioning yet they have given extra "TLC" to ensure he participates in the program.  In addition, our family has benefited from additional ASAP sponsored events such as their Young Photographers exhibit and their Annual Benefit which is unusual in that it highlights and presents writings of the children.  There is always something new around the corner.  And we appreciate not only the opportunity ASAP gives to children but how it enables teaching artists to have opportunities as well.   
After School Arts Program, Inc.	177144	1	/users/profile/233663	Jflloyd	Board Member	5	10/12/2013	It has been my privilege to participate as a board member of ASAP since 2007.  Since that time I have witnessed tremendous growth.   Our annual budget has grown from $114,000 a year to over $600,000.  Our geographic reach has expanded beyond Region 12 (Washington, Bridgewater and Roxbury, Ct) to include participants from 81 different towns and cities within CT and NY.  We offer over 100 workshops to students age 3- adult.  We host three to five events annually which attract nearly 3000 audience members each year.  We offer afterschool workshops as well as during the day, in-school programming.  We offer inter-district projects that bring children of different socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds together to work collaboratively.  We provide financial aid to every child in need.  We employ over 40 artists from our region.  We do all of this with limited governmental support; 87% of our budget is privately funded through individuals, corporations and foundations.   It has been a great honor to work with the current board and staff to establish ASAP as the premiere arts program in our region.  
After School Arts Program, Inc.	174861	1	/users/profile/231163	MarieD2222	Client Served	5	10/07/2013	On a professional level, I am the Administrative Manager of a Foundation which has supported ASAP in the past and will continue to do so with great pleasure in the future.  ASAP has always had exceptional programs, but this group continually strives to improve and expand their offerings.  On a personal level, my granddaughter has attended several of the week-end workshops offered by ASAP and plans to participate in an upcoming Community Project with Pilobolus.  The staff of ASAP (both administrators and teachers) are excellent, and my granddaughter eagerly awaits each new adventure with ASAP.  As a 3rd grade student who was at Sandy Hook Elementary on 12.14 last year, Alexa was devastated by the tragedy.  As it happened, she was signed up for an ASAP holiday workshop the very next day.  After much discussion, we decided to let her attend as we were striving for as much normalcy as possible in the midst of chaos.  The director of ASAP assured me that she would alert the teachers and staff, and Alexa was welcomed and nurtured from the moment she walked in the door.  I cannot say enough about how much ASAP has done to provide programs that meet the needs of children and that allow them opportunities they would never have otherwise.  I also know that they reach out to others in need on a personal level as they did to my family.  I wish every school district in the United States could have a program like this.
After School Arts Program, Inc.	174764	1	/users/profile/231072	dream enabler	Board Member	5	10/07/2013	I have been on several other boards for 501c3's in the arts education world.  ASAP has been my most satisfying board experience.  The monies raised are used so effectively; there is a lovely balance between thinking big and thinking practically. I particularly appreciate how the board is committed to investing in future programs without sacrificing the programs that work today.  Many non-profits get "sacred cow" programs that can't be touched, even when they are not serving current needs.  The ASAP board does not shy away from evaluating each program in light of current demand, current funds available, and possibilities of better uses for the funds.  This is a lean, well-run, high-impact organization with a board that doesn't just say that it will donate time, talent, and treasure; the board delivers, and so does ASAP.
After School Arts Program, Inc.	174182	1	/users/profile/230390	Jamie51	Client Served	5	10/05/2013	I think ASAP is tremendous and helps serve our community by affording children the opportunities that they would otherwise probably not be exposed to. My daughter attends a good amount of their workshops and enjoys them by being able to creatively express herself. There is such a variety of programs that encourage the arts and they have helped our family with financial aid to afford my daughter and son to attend them. It is important for children to be a part of extracurricular activities, and this program makes it available to all children in our community regardless of their financial situation.
After School Arts Program, Inc.	174004	1	/users/profile/230219	RXCT	Client Served	5	10/05/2013	The ASAP Program, based in Washington, CT, is a stellar organization featuring enrichment programs that include Art, Dance, Music, Nature, Field Trips, inter-district concerts and projects.  These programs have provided children and adults in our area wonderful opportunities to learn new skills or hone-in on developed interests.  Each program is executed masterfully and casts a high level of integrity, inclusiveness and caring.  ASAP is a true gem in our area and a first stop of enrichment programs!
After School Arts Program, Inc.	172979	1	/users/profile/229010	ThereYouAre57	Volunteer	5	10/03/2013	I worked with the Counselors in Training at the ASAP Summer Camp to help them with personal presentation skills.  This gave me a chance to watch the workings for the camp as a "fly on the wall."  What most impressed me about the staff at the camp was the commitment to making the program the best it could be for this specific group of kids.  If some approach had been a success previous summers, but somehow wasn't reaching one camper this year, the staff sat down that day and discussed what kind of pivot was necessary to give that camper the best possible experience.  That ability to see each camper as an individual, deserving of personal attention, transformed the campers; for some of them, it was perhaps the most encouragement they had ever received.  They learned about the making of art, and the end results were impressive, but even more impressive was how the campers learned that they are individuals who matter because of who they are, not just what they do, and therefore they can believe in themselves and go make a difference.

New Haven Help Alliance Inc	88111		/users/profile/98968	gblaze25	Volunteer	5	04/29/2011	I have been with the Greater New Haven Help Alliance for many years and just became a lead worker in the Youth Initiative Program. I really enjoy the environment that it gives. They send a positive message to the youth that are in the program. They also allow a safe place for youth to be during the summer instead of being out in the streets getting into trouble. As a Lead worker, I have gotten a lot of essential experience. I learned how to better lead my peers and how to hold workshops that help keep the youth on the right path.  The Greater New Haven Help Alliance is a great place for youth to go and be enriched with not only work experience, but a christian experience. During the summer, we hold workshops that are fun and have a special meaning behind it. We always compare what was done in the workshop to certain events that happen in the bible. It gives the youth more undertanding to the teachings of the staff. Overall, it is a great place for youth to learn and grow in many ways. it is a safe environment for fellowship and gives practical experience in the work place. 
New Haven Help Alliance Inc	88060		/users/profile/98902	LLFoster	Advisor	4	04/29/2011	Greater New Haven Help Alliance is a terrific nonprofit that focuses on poverty and youth issues. It's summer Youth Initiative Program provides kids with practical job skill training as well as addresses character development. As an advisor to the program I have had the privilege of seeing youth come into the program with no direction and leave the program confident and focused with a plan and a purpose! The strength of the program seems to lie in the fact that much care is given to create and foster a loving supportive environment. The enthusiasm of the leaders is absolutely contagious and the youth thrive on the support and positive experience received in both their training and in their job placements. I believe the program would benefit from increased finances which would enable the program to include more participants.

This is a program where The Greater New Haven Help Alliance housed 12 homeless men for a week that could have otherwise been on the streets of New Haven.  It was a joy to provide shelter, meals and activities for them.  I had the opportunity to meet and know personally a great group of men.   One gentleman was able to secure a lease on an apartment and was hired for a job; another was able to reunite with his family.  It was an honor and privilege to serve these men.Rev. James Roundtree
New Haven Help Alliance Inc	87987		/users/profile/98817	jae3082	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/29/2011	My name is Jason Goubourn and I am the Director of Greater New Haven Help Alliance's Youth Initiative summer leadership program. Youth Initiative is an outstanding program that does an uncanny job of training the young leaders of today.   This program began training and developing approximately twenty of the Greater New Havens young people in the summer of 2004. Since then the program has blossomed serving an average of 30 young people each summer since its beginning. Youth Initiative is a program that gathers young people from different areas of New Haven into one setting in order to daily shed light on the issues that most commonly impede smooth transitions into adulthood, the workforce, and life as a healthy contributor to society and community. Not only do we expose important issues that lie under the surface, but we provide learning experiences that allow the young people to internalize their importance and decide to meet these challenges head on.  Through an incorporation of lectures, hands-on workshops, journaling, discussion, and real life work experience, the Youth Initiative Program fosters personal growth, intentional preparation, and compels our teens to consider themselves as individuals as well as essential parts of the collective. One aspect of the program that makes it unique is the role the provided work experience plays in the lives of the participants. Every summer Youth Initiative strives to place young people at establishments that compliment their career aspirations. In the past we have had aspiring attornies volunteer at a law office and through the experience gained are now studying law at prestigious universities such as New York University and Quinnipiac University. We have had aspiring nurses volunteer at nursing homes through youth initiative that are now in college studying to be registered nurses.   It is always a joy to see the young leaders of today come in unsure of themselves and unaware of their potential and leave  skilled, focused, and ready for the world.  Jason GoubournDirector, GNHHA: Youth Initiative

GNHHA serves an underserved group of young adults in the New Haven community, namely young adolescents.  The focus is channeling their skills, talents and energies in a positive direction before they fall under the influence of school dropouts, gangs and drugs.  Although the opening of a youth center has been stalled due to a zoning appeal, the organization is optimistic and continues to work to improve the prospects of New Haven's young people.  In addition, our executive director has worked in Africa and Haiti to help provide basic services such as clean water and safe shelter.

They run a boys mentoring program, a girls mentoring program and a Summer work/leadership program. I have personally seen the growth in young people who entered the programs as students and evolved into exceptional leaders. One formerly "stand-offish" young lady particularly comes to mind. When she first arrived at the Summer Youth program it wasn't clear that she really wanted to be there. Now in college, it brings me real joy to see her effectively and enthusiastically lead today's participants. The Help Alliance gave her a place  to grow and develop skills that will help her throughout her life and career.

Light of Hope Foundation, Incorporated	118468		/users/profile/161126	littlewaynesmom	Board Member	5	07/15/2012	From the President/Founder My son just passed away from Medullablastoma at the age 7 and this is our story. He was presented into CCMC's ER for seizure activity that was not in his history. After a few tests they told his father and I that he had a terminal brain cancer. He went in for immediate surgery shortly after. He had 3 tumors in his brain. One brain tumor they said was the size of a plum; this one was putting direct pressure on his spinal column. His spine was "sugar coated" with tumor, and he had a tumor deposit at the bottom of his spine. He had the biggest tumor operated on (in the back of his head) and parts of it were removed but not all could be. They would have had to cut into the top of his spinal cord and it could kill him. He went into the PICU at children's hospital for several months. He had some severe side effects from his brain surgery such as vision loss, the ability to speak, eat by mouth, walk or have much motion in his extremities. He had many things implanted/mounted in or on him (too many to list). His time in the PICU was always touch and go. Eventually we made it to the 8th floor which is Hemocology/Oncology. We got a little better, and got discharged home. We had a few more trips back into CCMC for some illnesses or minor problems but we were out in a week or less. We saw some new life and then a sudden decline and  he passed away in the home with his closest family around. I would like to think that we are a middle class family. I still didn't have a life insurance policy, big savings account or 401K to draw from. We were faced with financial burdens before all of this happened. I was laid off and had no income at the time. Health insurance did cover most expenses. His father and I were separated for years at this point. We shared our time with him so, upon discharge, we needed two of everything, which was not covered. I didn't have the funds to cover these things that were happening then so I thought how could I pay for a proper burial and end of life costs? Then I thought, if I am having these thoughts...don't other parents? That is how and why this foundation got its start. I had friends and family helping me out through all these struggles. I had been in contact with some of the cancer "foundations and organizations". I had the social workers from the hospital doing their best to try to find resources. I was very frustrated, upset, exhausted, and sad. I felt like there was no one who could help me in "this" situation. I wanted to create an organization so I could provide families with the here and now help. I want to provide families with "the one stop shop" of answers for all of their needs. A complete list of resources including help with meds, financial help, transportation help, end of life grieving and burial needs. I always felt that there was NO help out there for me and my situation with my son but, I now see that there IS help out there but the families, social workers and nurses may not know it. I want to be able to point them in the right direction AND be there to pick up the slack financially so parents and guardians can focus on the task at hand.Helping Terminally Ill KidsBristol, CT 06010860-261-7368www.LOHFoundation.com  R.I.P.

It isn't just a wish-making organization, but a lifelong support network for the Dream families with activities all year round to celebrate the kids who have been granted dreams and their families.  I am proud to work with such an amazing group of motivated and dedicated people that make all of these events come to life!
Dream Come True of Western Connecticut Inc	231401	1	/users/profile/294994	dreammaker888	Board Member	5	10/31/2014	I am proud to be on the board of Dream Come True of Western Ct who's mission is granting dreams to seriously, chronically and terminally ill children. It has been extremely fulfilling as both a volunteer working directly with the children and a board member guiding the direction of the organization. DCT may be a small organization in terms of manpower but we are a mighty organization in terms of making a difference in a child's life. 
Dream Come True of Western Connecticut Inc	224634	1	/users/profile/288389	ProudtobeED	Board Member	5	10/20/2014	I have been involved for about 6 years and have been completely fulfilled in doing so. I am proud to represent, volunteer and organize for this amazing non profit. The children we grant dreams to remain a part of our Dream Family forever...Once a dream child, always a dream child.  My hope is to continue spreading awareness about DCT, the mission and to attract like minded volunteers, donors and sponsors to reach even more families.
Dream Come True of Western Connecticut Inc	220729	1	/users/profile/284405	Volunteer1988	Volunteer	5	10/07/2014	I am proud to call myself a volunteer of Dream Come True since 2009.  There is no other wish granting organization in our area whose volunteers and board members care so much about the entire family.  Those individuals on the Dream Committee become a part of the Dream Child's family.  Even after that child passes, the organization is still a lasting part of the family's life.  The joy of a child is irreplaceable, just as Dream Come True is an irreplaceable organization to the chronically and terminally ill children of Fairfield, Litchfield, and New Haven counties. 
Dream Come True of Western Connecticut Inc	215609	3	/users/profile/279044	volunteer1968	Volunteer	5	09/18/2014	I am proud to say that I am a recent volulnteer for Dream Come True of Western CT.  Western CT absolutely needs this organization and the children benefit from their services.  I am honored and humbled to be able to participate in fulfulling dreams for seriously ill children.  I am overwhelmed with the enthusiam and passion all the volunteers have in this organization.  As a wholly volunteer-run organization, the volunteers are absolutely dedicated to the families they serve.  And the connection continues after the dream, through annual picnics and holiday parties for the children and families.  For these  families often facing daily hurdles, this is a break for them.  A time to enjoy a piece of childhood that many take for granted...     The organization has many different volunteer opportunities utilizing the skills and time commitment you are willing to offer.  There is something for eveyone who wants to contribute!  
Dream Come True of Western Connecticut Inc	212326	2	/users/profile/275321	DreamMaker2	Volunteer	5	08/26/2014	For a child battling a life-changing illness, there is no greater blessing than to have their dream fulfilled.  To give them respite from their toil and stress, for even a brief moment, is nothing short of a miracle.  DREAM COME TRUE of Western CT makes those miracles happen!   A wholly volunteer-run organization, they are dedicated to fulfilling the dreams of countless children who are seriously, chronically or terminally ill in the New Haven, Fairfield, and Litchfield Counties of Connecticut.  For over three decades, through grants and donations, they ensure that these children CAN enjoy some semblance of childhood.  Even more, these dreams have a positive, uplifting effect on the family as a whole, who are so often equally burdened by the childs situation.   I have personally seen the faces of so many of these happy, and THANKFUL, children.  Nothing brings me greater personal gratification than to know that I participated in making their DREAMs COME TRUE!

The dedication of our volunteers is truly motivating.  Our children suffering from life altering illnesses, are so grateful the dreams we are able to provide them with.

HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	146446		/users/profile/193281	christineCT	Client Served	5	12/11/2012	I went to my first Hygeia meeting 1 week after my son was stillborn Feb 2008. I had lots of family and friends support. But still felt alone. Hygeia helped me find my new normal. They helped me thru the darkest time in my life and then thru a subsequent pregnancy which we were blessed with a beautiful healthy girl in March of 2011. I will always be greatful to Hygeia for all they have done for me. And for the wonderful friendships I have made.
HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	137687		/users/profile/183683	Jenny_A	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/12/2012	I discovered The Hygeia Foundation after I delivered a stillborn baby girl on December 31, 2010. It was truly the most horrible time in my life. Even though I had support of friends and family, I felt completely alone and isolated. How could anyone even possibly understand what I was going through? With The Hygeia Foundation, I found a place where I could eventually find my new normal. Where I could talk to other women and families who have gone through tragedies like mine  people who I could relate to. Women who know about sheer anguish, and fear, and anger, and desperation.  I now volunteer my time to this outstanding organization, and I encourage you to visit www.hygeiafoundation.org for more information about all of the services they offer. You do not have to go through this alone. The Hygiea Foundation is here to help.
HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	136797	1	/users/profile/182742	buzzous	Volunteer	5	11/10/2012	Prior to giving birth to my beautiful twins, I lost four babies.  The Hygeia Foundation helped me to move through the grieving process, find the best way to tell the twins about their brothers and sisters in Heaven, and find ways to honor my babies by helping others in need.
HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	135295	1	/users/profile/181158	HMoore	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I experienced a miscarriage during my first pregnancy several years ago.  The days, weeks, and months after my loss I struggled to find any comfort from friends and family that were doing their best to offer me support.  I felt very alone and confused.   A few years later I heard about a local support group with Hygeia in Guilford.  I was so thankful to learn that there was a place families could go to talk freely about how this ordeal had affected their lives.  Nobody understands like somebody that has been through it.  I have since become a volunteer and help to facilitate the monthly support meetings.  I have seen first-hand the incredible difference it makes to these families to come each month to ask advice, cry, vent, listen to others, and sometimes to just not feel so alone.  I am so thankful that this wonderful organization exists.
HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	135127	1	/users/profile/180995	sloany1	Client Served	5	11/07/2012	I found the Hygeia Foundation through a friend of mine who had become part of the organization after she had lost her son just days after birth. Once we had a stillborn daughter (at 38 weeks) 7 years ago, I turned to this same friend for comfort and support and in turn met the amazing group of women who were a part of Hygeia along with Dr. Berman. Without this support network of families who have also lost babies I don't know how we would have gotten through those darkest days. When you experience a loss so sudden, tragic and life changing there are only those who have gone through the same experience that can really understand your pain. My bond with the Hygeia Foundation has continued all these years now that I am able to give back and help provide support to others who have lost by volunteering my time as a support group facilitator. 
HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	135076	1	/users/profile/180943	Ginny M.	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I learned about Dr. Berman and the Hygeia Foundation when we had a stillborn daughter, Emily, almost 9 years ago. It was horrific, unexpected and the worst experience I've ever had--me and my family still think about her every day. At the time, the absolute only way I knew I'd ever feel better about this tragedy, would be to take action in her honor and help others who had lost a child to miscarriage or stillbirth. Hygeia has grown significantly since then and offers support groups, assistance to the medical community and a facility in Woodbridge, CT. Hygeia's community and web of support saw me through my grief and continues to support us and others today. 
HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	135008	1	/users/profile/180874	MegTimKel	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I found Hygeia after I lost my son in December 2009.  I started attending support groups for my loss and hte facilitators were great as they have also experienced a loss.  They helped me get through the first year on top of a subsequent pregnancy during that year.  I was proud to walk in memory of my son at their Footprints to Remember Walk for the last two years.  I also went through training to become a facilitator this year to help those suffering a loss.  They were there for me and I want to be there for others.
HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	134943	1	/users/profile/180810	kerisa	Volunteer	5	11/07/2012	I found Hygeia when putting together a walk for pregnancy loss in my area of CT.  I was so impressed with their executive director and her plans for their first walk for pregnancy loss (Walk To Remember - Footprints on the Heart) that I decided to let go of my plans and join them with theirs.  I never regretted it.  I eventually joined their parenting board and and in training to be a facilitator for their support group meetings.  Having had two pregnancy losses myself - one at 11 weeks and one at 38 weeks - I have always found Hygeia to be supportive and helpful to those in need.  They are an amazing organization with so much heart.

HOPE AFTER LOSS  (Formerly the HYGEIA FOUNDATION INC)	119762	1	/users/profile/162806	Claudia W.	Volunteer	5	08/01/2012	I have volunteered for the Hygeia Foundation for many years, since my twin sons were stillborn. Hygeia supports families who grieve the loss of a pregnancy or newborn. I have found so much comfort and hope through my work with Hygeia. I don't think I could have survived the loss of my twins (and my two miscarriages) without them. They provide online support, hold support groups in three locations in Connecticut, and provide phone and email support. They also have a lending library and a burial fund for families who cannot afford to bury or cremate their child. Hygeia holds the "Footprints On Our Hearts Walk To Remember" in October every year.

I already had a job coming into it but I wanted to check what the hype was about. To my surprise the program smashed all expectations with joy. Having a practical side of things along with a biblical side of each lecture I believe Work and Learn brings hope back in work force for young and older.
Work & Learn Inc	314042		/users/profile/405402	oscarslady	Client Served	5	10/24/2016	I cannot express my gratitude to the founders, instructors,  spiritual leaders, advisors, mentors and other attendees for the outstanding balance of practical information and spiritual self analysis. The Work & Learn process  is the most beneficial as I have found that the majority of tips and pointers offered have helped me to identify and successfully overcome my own perceived weaknesses. My self-confidence has dramatically increased as I have barely completed half his course. The guidance and advice are invaluable
Work & Learn Inc	313325	1	/users/profile/404696	Rob'n June L.	Volunteer	5	10/22/2016	This is my first year participating in the Work & Learn Inc. program. I am very impressed by the opportunity the program provides. It has a comprehensive curriculum that effectively delineates solid work ethics, attitudes and values and includes practical exercises to develop job seeking skills.  The program exposes participants to local churches by having pastors instruct on specific work related bible based topics. Also, local business professionals present  topics such as defining ones aptitudes and talents , resume preparation, and public speaking to prepare for the interview process. Overall the 12 week program presents an excellent opportunity for a person to be equipped and prepared for a new start on a career and  life.

Volunteer	5	12/04/2015	Work and Learn in New London, CT brings people who need jobs and people who have experience in all aspects of employment together.  The volunteer mentors get as much out of the 12-week course as the rest of the people.It is important to know that the course is NOT just for people who are religious!  Everyone is welcome, whether they attend any church or not.  People who do not believe in God will find the course helpful, too.It was interesting to hear the various religious leaders tell us their understanding of the Bible passages, and how specific verses applied to different work situations.  Food for thought for each of us!Every week there was at least one expert in some aspect of getting and keeping a job.  Some people taught us how to decide which career might be best for us; writing resumes was covered by an HR manager; a representative from Toastmasters helped us feel more comfortable talking in public.Many of us made friendships that will last long after we stop seeing each other at Work and Learn.  We learned not only the course material, but also about ourselves and our neighbors.The most amazing part of Work and Learn is that everything is FREE!  All that is required is interest in getting a job (or better job) and the willingness to keep an open mind.
Work & Learn Inc	273535	2	/users/profile/362776	FBBandB	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/02/2015	Work & Learn helps everyone who participates: Those who want to get jobs (or better jobs) and the volunteers who mentor the other participants.  It is hard to believe that Work & Learn is completely _free_!  Each session of the twelve-week course is divided into two parts: Discussion of biblical principles affecting the worker and work environment (lead by a local pastor); Practical training in resume writing, interview skills, etc. (lead by a HR or business professional).  Everyone is welcome, no matter what their spiritual path (or none)! WWW.FaithBehindBarsAndBeyond.Org strongly supports Work & Learn for ex-offenders, people recovering from addiction, and other people involved with re-entry into society.

Work and Learn taught me different career soft skills while infusing faith based biblical standards. The class helped me sharpen my skills with public speaking by coaching me to give my 2 minute elevator pitch. I enjoyed listening to speakers from different churches and organizations. We were able to build our career development skills while practicing what matters most in the work environment such as showing integrity and resolving conflicts. I strongly advise people to take this class because you will learn more what you would expect!

I was an Instructor, Mentor and Participant.  It is a two part workshop where vital information is taught to help those who are currently searching for jobs/careers or already working to help sharpen their skills in addition to the emphasis on how the Bible tells us we should conduct ourselves in the working environment.  Excellent workshop that is well worth the time.

Emerson Theater Collaborative Inc	123953		/users/profile/168722	Yohanna F.	Board Member	5	09/30/2012	I played the role of "Ginny" in the phenomenal play by Jeffrey Sweet, "Court Martial at Fort Devens,"  produced and directed by the Emerson Theater Collaborative (ETC) in the Spring of 2012.  I got the chance to meet and perform for the playwright, Jeffrey Sweet, and it was all because of ETC!!!  That was my first experience meeting and performing for a playwright.  Throughout the production, I felt at home with ETC and was embraced as family.  In fact, ETC is a family!  All the elements that make up theatre is carefully crafted by ETC members from the set (designed and constructed by ETC) to the costume and lighting.  ETC is composed of a group of dedicated professionals who give themselves to the task of putting together thought-provoking and meaningful plays that touch the soul.  "Court Martial at Fort Devens" was one of these plays.  It was a pleasure working with the Emerson Theater Collaborative!!!!

Emerson Theater Collaborative Inc	120937		/users/profile/164550	Judith8	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/17/2012	I think the work ETC is doing is courageous, thoughtful and creative.  They have the best after show talkbacks and discussions.  They really make an effort to move their audience and to encourage and inspire a conversation about what took place on the stage, and what the audience feels about it.  They do socially relevant plays that make a statement about the society we live in, and go to the trouble of making sure they have an impact on their audiences.  They employ wonderful talent and provide opportunities for creative professionals to express themselves.  They give emerging talent a chance to see their work and further develop as artists.  This is an organization that is really worth supporting, they make the community they live in and the world a much better place by making a very big effort.  I wish there were more theatre companies like them.  Keep up the good work ETC!

AmeriCares Foundation, Inc.	277251	1	/users/profile/367038	DianeBosek	Volunteer	5	01/19/2016	I have been volunteering at AmeriCares since 2008. Without question, this organization is well run and focused on serving. During my tenure, I have seen AmeriCares quickly respond to emergencies in Japan, Haiti and Liberia (to name a few) with medicines, assistance and supplies. But I have also seen AmeriCares develop relationships with free clinics across the US, donating drugs and over the counter medicines to aid those unable to afford them. The compassion demonstrated and the intelligence used to distribute resources continues to impress me. I encourage people to support AmeriCares.
AmeriCares Foundation, Inc.	196005	9	/users/profile/256282	dejafra	Donor	1	03/20/2014	I donated to AmeriCares two years ago and, as is my wont, reviewed my charity contributions annually so that I would be able to donate to other charities in an effort to vary the impact my charitable giving has each year. Ever since I gave them that donation, they have relentlessly pursued me via attempted phone calls and letters. Frankly, they should spend their efforts on other possible givers and not keep coming back to the same donors. Their actions have made me much less interested in ever donating to them again.
AmeriCares Foundation, Inc.	147250	3	/users/profile/194530	Kirk S.	Donor	5	12/25/2012	We love AmeriCares and everything they do, and have been giving generously for serveral years. We feel that we can trust that our dollars are actually going into programs and support, and they seem very receptive to input from contributors. I am upset to see people using this forum to slam a charity for being persistent in their fund raising -- and without knowing anything about their programs or operations. Annoying as solicitations can be, it still seems petty. Likewise, it seems clear that charitynavigator.org financial ratings system unfairly penalizes smaller charities like this one that are not raking in cash hand over fist since the recession. AmeriCares is as good as it gets when it comes to low administrative costs and efficiency. They are one of the few American charities actually representing American values in a positive, unapologetic way.
AmeriCares Foundation, Inc.	125690	3	/users/profile/170919	gb53	Donor	3	10/16/2012	Hmmmm....  Maybe I am blind (my wife says so) but I cannot see how the COMMENTS feature works on these reviews.  I see either a link that tells me to login (I have) or I see no useful link at all.  So I will pretend to write a "review" as a "donor" in order to comment on previous reviews.  (As of now, I am still investigating and have not yet contributed to AmeriCares.)       Those that have scored this org low because of incessant (harassing) solicitations despite contacting the org to be removed from mailings should contact the BBB Wise Giving program.  The only way that BBB works is when people use it.  Get your negative experience in a public place, and it will help.  Also BBB should be able to get you off of their list.       As for the credibility of their 1% fundraising, I notice in their financials that they got over $626,000,000 of donated medical & disaster supplies in their 2010-11 fiscal year.  (This is more than 16x the $37,800,000 that they got in cash donations.)  With that big of a denominator, they can spend millions on fundraising and stay around that 1% mark.
AmeriCares Foundation, Inc.	120106	5	/users/profile/163319	Eugene Conner	Donor	5	08/07/2012	Being a former resident of Stamford, where AmeriCares is headquartered, I decided to visit their offices three years back.  I found the people to be warm, genuine and committed. I saw their operation in Connecticut as efficient and real.  I also met the President, Curt Welling.  My dealings with AmeriCares have been positive and encouraging.  It is always easy to criticize a charity for this or that.  I give thanks to God that AmeriCares is out there, serving globally.  Sure, there name is not always swinging from the media rafters, but they are,in my opinion, moving as Jesus would do to serve the needy, the homeless, those without competent medical care and/or facilities, and dong all of this without bias.  If any of you doubt AmeriCares motives or transparency, I suggest you get on a plane and go and see for yourself.  I have no doubt you will reach the conclusion that my family has-AmeriCares is real! I will keep on giving to them as long as I have money to do so! Eugene
AmeriCares Foundation, Inc.	100428	11	/users/profile/122386	Meghan Finn	Donor	1	11/08/2011	Americares is so bad they make me afraid to donate to anyone. I received a mailing from them where they promised to only contact me once a year, and I looked up their financials, they seemed pretty good so I donated.  Biggest.mistake.ever. They have proceeded to contact me weekly for the past year, continually hitting me up for more donations despite the fact I have contacted them 10 separate times to tell them to stop contacting me that I will never give them another penny ever they keep mailing.  It's ridiculous.  When I look at their reported amount of fundraising it doesn't seem possible, so I suspect that there may be something funny up with how they report the money they spend because they certainly were dishonest with me.

We contributed to Haiti relief effort nearly 1-1/2 years ago and have been receiving junk mail from them almost WEEKLY ever since.  I feel that surely half my donation went to "marketing" me ever since.  Very poor use of funds, if you ask me - so much so that I would never contribute to them again.

Once they suck you in you will NEVER get get rid of them. They will not communicate with you either. And  they will never stop. They are also listed on Americas Worst Charities. Sorta says it all.
National Veterans Services Fund Inc	207851	3	/users/profile/270538	lulu22	Professional with expertise in this field	1	07/30/2014	Terrible organization. As a social worker who has referred my homeless and disabled veteran clients as a last resort to this place for financial assistance when our organization cannot help them - not one has ever gotten any help from NVSF despite following all the specifications outlined on the application form. Instead, we've only have nasty communications from the people running NVSF. Stay FAR away, and seek out a BBB-accredited organization to donate to. This place is the worst of the worst scams - only 16 cents on the dollar makes it (if ever) to a veteran in need. Also - their bookkeeper was recently arrested for embezzling $186,000.00 from the organization and the amount could be up to $830,000.00. Needless to say, we will not be referring individuals to this place ever again.  See http://www.dariennewsonline.com/news/article/Police-believe-woman-embezzled-830K-from-vet-5522266.php 
National Veterans Services Fund Inc	195501	6	/users/profile/255576	Kathy150	Professional with expertise in this field	1	03/11/2014	According to their form 990, they received $9,111,243 but the veterans received $1,099,346.  So the 88% is spent on overhead and fund raising, and the veteran gets 12%.  Do you want your money to go to fundraisers or to the veteran?
National Veterans Services Fund Inc	160644	8	/users/profile/212999	jasonwinick	Client Served	1	06/14/2013	I just got off the phone with a lady in the office who was completely rude. I informed her that I was a 100% disabled veteran who was affected by the disasters in Oklahoma. She told me to contact Red Cross. I informed her that they were helping total loss victims. I said who do you help? She said dire straights individuals. I told her that I would keep her number for when I am in dire straights and she said that her charity is not for people to call and get help its for only people that have a social worker call for them. She made me feel small and insignificant and that my problem was not a problem at all. Who are they actually helping. Please do not support such a charity. 
National Veterans Services Fund Inc	150840	9	/users/profile/201161	John151	Donor	1	03/09/2013	This non profit is a scam.  I donated a boat.  I was given the standard 500.00 tax deduction form.  The next week I was contacted by a friend who saw my boat on craigs list for sale for 1900.00.  When I called the number I talked to the man who picked the boat up from my house.  His name was Wade.  He informed me the boat was sold that day to a man in Minnesota.  I asked what he got for it and he said 1900.   So I called the National Veterans Services fund and they confirmed that they sold the boat....for 300.00 dollars.  When I asked where the other 1600. had gone they could not explain it to me.  I called again to see if they would mail me a updated tax deduction for 1900.  They said no.  They said they would call me back after looking into it.  That was 3 weeks ago.   I have contacted the States Attorney General of Oregon, and the IRS...... DO NOT CONSIDER DONATING TO THIS CHARITY.   They do not give much or any of the proceeds to the vets.
National Veterans Services Fund Inc	121817	9	/users/profile/165761	Keisha Kinlocke	Client Served	1	09/02/2012	I am a veteran who recently requested assistance from NVSF.  I have several email communication from the charity in which they directed me to have a social worker contact their representatives on my behalf.  After speaking with the social worker (who was covering for another on leave), she told me I needed an application form and other documents.  While in her office, the social worker and I searched the NSVF website for said "application form".  I was asked to see if I could "track down" the form on my own.  I contacted NVSF and spoke to Cindy, who after hearing my name had an very negative attitude towards me.  I ignored her bad attitude and asked for the application form.  She then raised her voice and kept stating on the top of the voice that she had worked with my social worker for years and there was NO WAY she would have told me to get an application form from NVSF.  I kept trying to explain to her that the social worker was in a different office and was unable to get a copy of the form for the next two weeks she was out of her office.  I was NEVER given the chance to say anything during the exchange after which the NVSF representative (CINDY) hung up the phone.  I was in shock that any veteran's charity would treat me (a veteran) with such distaste.  I contacted my social worker (Sheila Harris, Atlanta VA Medical Ctr) who apologized to me for Cindy's unprofessional behavior.  She stated that she would contact Cindy and explain to her the reason she did NOT have the form needed.  I told Sheila that that would be unnecessary as I did not get the impression that this charity was willing to help me after the telephone contact.  Ms. Harris went on to state that NVSF had denied EVERY veteran she had referred to NVSF in the last 4-6 months.  If you look at thew NVSF website, you will see that every page of their site has a DONATE button.  There is NOT ONE page on their site that shows a veteran to GET HELP.  It is my belief that this charity, like so many others out there, are in the business of getting funds, but NO INTENTION of giving any help to the VETERAN.  I tried getting information on NVSF through The Better Business Bureau and noted that the NVSF refused to provide them with any information.  Obviously, this charity has a lot to hide.  For all the individuals who have given monies to this charity, you should know that the money donated is going to the charity, its representatives and their families and not to any needy veteran.  I hope other veteran's who have had contact with NVSF will join me in adding reviews so that everyone will be weary of donating to an obvious CON charity.  
National Veterans Services Fund Inc	108073	5	/users/profile/146838	johntf3	General Member of the Public	1	03/20/2012	This is more likely a money making project for the "fund raisers" since way to much money goes to fund raising expenses.  This charity is too inefficient in delivering services to veterans.  Their mail solicitation does not correlate with their on-line organization goals.  Giving to this corporation is a waste of your money and when they trick people into giving to them they take from legitimate charities who could truly help veterans.  One star is too high a rating for this group.  Shame on them!

Artspace Inc	228997		/users/profile/292667	Allison46	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2014	I am a young artist, working in an interdisciplinary fashion, based in southern Connecticut. Artspace accepted and supported my proposal for a two-day, site-specific performance piece in response to the old New Haven Armory, in conjunction with their 2014 City-Wide Open Studios Alternative Space Weekend. Although I have used the gallery in recent years as a resource to encounter provocative exhibitions and regional artists, this was my first experience professionally working with the space. By offering this opportunity, and the financial backing, to present my work at the armory, Artspace gave me the means to bring my studio practice to another level. It allowed me to take new, important risks. Not only do I now have a key piece to add to my portfolio, but a more focused and charged momentum with which to move forward. As well, the entire Artspace staff is a wonderful, rigorous group. They are intelligent, passionate people striving for challenges, critique and meaning. Their feedback, from concept to technique to context, is useful and wholly meant. It is rare to find such authenticity. This experience solidified my understanding of this space as a key resource for working artists both inside and outside the New Haven region. 
Artspace Inc	163897		/users/profile/217697	MMaleska	Board Member	5	07/30/2013	As a new member to the Board, I have been impressed with a number of aspects of Artspace. I'd like to highlight three of them: 1) The commitment of the staff and volunteers to the mission and success of the organization;  2) The integrity and dedication of the executive leadership and visual arts committee; 3) And the quality, breadth, and depth of the programming. For a small arts organization, it is able to deliver events much larger, and much more ambitious, than its size would suggest, because of these factors.
Artspace Inc	98092		/users/profile/116077	adi segal	Volunteer	5	09/25/2011	Artspace fulfills so many different roles in New Haven's art world; as a place for emerging and established artists to show work; as a place to go and connect with art and artists from all over;  as an organizer of community events such as the annual Open Studios and outdoor art projects; as a venue for a wide variety of art related events,  and more.  I am continually impressed by the range of activities/events and the high level of art that Artspace presents.  Over the past 2 years I have volunteered in a variety of capacities in artspace events, and  have greatly enjoyed the professional and creative atmosphere it maintains.
Artspace Inc	96996		/users/profile/113382	Billkal	Board Member	5	08/31/2011	Artspace recently completed its June 30th fiscal year and Im excited to say that it ended with a profit.   Just as encouraging, early indications point to another positive financial year for June, 2012 with clear momentum building for the future.  Artspace has been successful in expanding its revenue sources to include grant funding from the National Endowment of the Arts, Connecticut Commission on Culture and Tourism, the Community Foundation of Greater New Haven and other local foundations that were instrumental in the organizations past.  This spring also saw the return of its successful annual Gala benefit.  These are exciting additions that strengthen the existing revenue base, minimizing the risk of over reliance on a few donors.    This past year also brought changes in leadership, including the executive director and certain board of director positions. The board of directors, charged with the organizations governance, now comprise of individuals from diverse backgrounds including legal, finance, banking, medical, and artists from the community. The Board and management understand true fiscal discipline that brings long-term stability, requires implementing necessary expense reductions to complement the revenue increases.  Accordingly, annual budgets are developed, reviewed and approved with a focus on operating with minimal administrative overhead.  This will allow Artspace to use its new funding sources to expand its programs and mission in a fiscally sane way.  The organization administrative costs approximate 10% of its total expenditures.   Artspace, as with many local non-profits, has the daunting challenge of balancing the realities of the economy with the program vision that is at the core of its mission. There are no easy solutions and additional, hurdles are to be expected.  However, the financial transformation achieved this year.  Bill KalinowskiTreasurer
Artspace Inc	95241		/users/profile/110432	Cecily H.	Volunteer	5	08/08/2011	A non-profit gallery that focuses on presenting both local and international works of contemporary art, Artspace is very close to my heart in the service that it provide to the greater public: firsthand experience with, and education about, the arts, regardless of patrons social or economic classes.   As a volunteer gallery sitter at Artspace, I was able to take part in Artspace's wealth of different programs, from art openings to artist workshops to educational outreach programs for teens.  I found these experiences very rewarding -- discussing the idea of the contemporary still life with an exhibiting artist, or seeing children's eyes light-up as you explain to them that they're allowed to interact with an art piece, are both wonderful feelings.   Artspaces various opportunities for children and young adults exemplify the kind of programs that we need to further promote and expand the fine arts.
Artspace Inc	94110		/users/profile/108693	Catbalco	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/20/2011	Artspace is a crucial part of the CT cultural scene. I am an artist recently commissioned by Artspace to participate in the 2010 Student Apprenticeship Program. This  program brings 12 - 15 New Haven high school students, 3 - 4 college-age interns, and a professional artist or artist team together to collaborate on a large-scale public project. I cannot speak highly enough about the benefits of this program! It is a wonderful way to involve students in the arts; it is a great "practice job" for students; it provides a great opportunity and career boost for artists interested in getting involved in public work; it provides meaningful internships for college students who hope to work in the arts (my interns were wholly responsible for the entire education program that accompanied our artwork); and it is a great way to keep New Haven vital and filled with creative work. to The fact that projects are accomplished in a mere three weeks and with a minimal budget is a testament to the energy and enthusiasm of all involved (and especially to the fertile & supportive environment fostered by Artspace.) And the SAP project is typical of what Artspace does best: creating partnerships between artists and community members for the benefit of all involved.
Artspace Inc	93746		/users/profile/108052	Laura G.	Client Served	5	07/12/2011	Artspace not only brings fresh art to the people, it brings people to the art.  I count myself lucky to be a self-taught artist living and making art in New Haven--it has a democratic art scene at which Artspace stands in the center from my perspective.  Opportunities such as City Wide Open Studios, shows such as Scrawl that solicit talent from local artists, and artist education series such as Brainard Carey's presentations on obtaining grants and breaking into shows and galleries, are ways Artspace supports and enriches the experiences of new and established artists.
Artspace Inc	93630		/users/profile/107817	amyers	Professional with expertise in this field	4	07/08/2011	Artspace is unique in that it is inclusive rather than exclusive while maintaining curatorial integrity.  What I find so refreshing and forward thinking about Artspace under the directorship of Helen Kauder is that she is interested in how visual art and live contemporary performance coexist. Artspace is fast becoming a nucleus for artists of several genres to experiment and thrive. As a result more people in the community come together to learn about art forms they may not be otherwise familiar with.  I have to admit that I have a crush on Artspace so this review while biased stems from experience.  I am the Artistic Director of Adele Myers and Dancers, a contemporary dance company dually based in CT and NYC.  I have performed twice at Artspace at Helens invitation and each time I have found the experience to be illuminating in my own trajectory as an artist. Those in attendance have also been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about simultaneously experiencing visual art and live performance within its unique architectural frame. As a member of the New Haven community, I regard Artspace as a barometer for fresh perspectives in contemporary art and am always curious to see what is happening next.  The only things I think Artspace needs is more funding and support.  They are trying hard to have a broad vision with few resources which is challenging for any organization.
Artspace Inc	93568		/users/profile/107727	Claire R.

I have been impressed by the vision and commitment to sustainability and fiscal responsibility exhibited by the current director, Helen Kauder. Her relentless pursuit of creative, cutting-edge programming and her strong grasp of the organization's finances are an incredible asset to Artspace.
Domestic Violence Crisis Center	42156	7	/users/profile/42890	cipp	Board Member	5	05/31/2010	DVCC touches more people in the community than any other social service agency and addresses a need that no one else can meet.  I have seen first hand the impact of DVCC when answering hotline calls from women who are terrified and have no where else to turn.  We provide a safe place and a friendly voice, and hopefully, we are able to make a woman and her children feel just a little less alone.
Domestic Violence Crisis Center	41757	7	/users/profile/42543	marlene2	Volunteer	5	05/29/2010	After going through the training and certification program for DVCC (which is very emotional on so many levels -- from despair to an overwhelming sense of hope) I knew I wanted to be involved in a pro-active program within DVCC.   I was encouraged to look into the community educational programs and immediately focused on the childrens' program -- reaching out to children in nursery school (yes, nursery school 3 and 4 year olds) thru second graders!  The program is Stop Take 5 and Think ... and utilizies puppets!  I was a puppeteer and loved every moment of the experience.   The children understood angry feelings and hurt feelings and were eager to problem solve and come up with positive solutions rather than using hurtful words or fists.  They also realize that there are consequences for hurting someone on the inside with words just as severe as the child who may hurt someone on the outside by hitting.  The program proves that children are capable of empathy, know right from and wrong and truly are honest, helpful and loving at their core.   The program is available to all schools within our community.  Schools invite us back year after year and the children remember us and the lesson we leave them with even though it may 12 months later from our last visit!  I am very passionate about this program and believe it is critical to childhood development.  I moved out of the country two years ago and have lobbied very hard to bring this program my adopted home because I know the good that this program is capable of within a community.Additonally their PeaceWorks and e-voices newsletter are a welcome and creative addition to the Center!

I began my association with them by attending their annual luncheon.  I was then asked to be on the luncheon committee and finally to fill a position on the Board of Trustees.  The DVCC provides comfort and safety for abused women and their children in the form of safe houses in two of the seven communities which we serve. It also provides counseling and advocacy, both judicial and medical.  And, of equal importance, it enters the schools in each of the communities on every age level and provides courses for the students teaching them the skills needed to be a responsible member of society.

Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, Inc.	51426	4	/users/profile/52080	simonesyed	General Member of the Public	5	09/01/2010	I was first introduced to IEET as an organization at the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology Conference in Tucson, Arizona in 2007. At the time, I was just beginning to understand how possible emerging technologies might effect me in the future, but I was unaware of how to pursue information dealing with near future aspects of nanotech, an how to get myself involved with the community at large. IEET gave me direction via their website, newsletters, and their general out going personalities. Mike Treder and Chris Phoenix both helped me get into contact with other interesting people and organizations, and have continued to foster their relationships with me 3 years after first meeting them. IEET.org has some of the most comprehensive information and articles available concerning a wide variety of topics in the realms of future and ethical technologies by a wide variety of people. Theirs is the first site I turn to when I wonder what my peers are thinking about something new and wonderful! Without IEET providing me with a little direction, I may not have continued with my futurist inclinations and may not have become as involved with the community I love so much today.

This site is the ideal place if you want to get a sense of possible changes heading our way. It is time we leave the "i ll see what comes next" mentality behind us. We have to actively think about the future, anticipate it, steer it, design it ourselves.  us. Ranging from culture changing technology, to environmental and natural disasters. If it can happen, we need to think and talk about it before it actually happens or we will be unprepared and ill equipped to handle the situation. If we see these dangers coming, we can steer around them, avoid them or at least negate their effects. IEET is the best place for minds to come together and think about what the human race needs to do to sustain itself, to lead better, happier, healthier and more productive lives. Which systems are broken and which need an update? What does copyright mean for the future of genetics? Is our current political system a dinosaur? What does it mean to be human? What will it mean in the future? What do we want it to mean?If you want to activate that ball of wet, gelatinous matter inside your skull and really put it to work, you have come to the right place.

HHOC has given me, an emerging professional singer, a chance to learn roles and perform with other talented singers, both emerging professionals and professionals, and orchestra.  I do this for free, but at other places I would have to pay to do this, and the experience here is much better and really helps me grow as a singer.

As opera in the community, H.O.C. also promotes social awareness and activism linking art to action in the form of social artistry, most recently in support of the people of Haiti.    Both the president of the company, and the music director, the very accomplished Perry Price, are extremely generous in sharing and communicating, the fine qualities of the human condition as expressed and explored in opera.

Both productions were extremely ambitious. Don Giovanni was produced with orchestra and was very well attended. The opera scenes program utilized a large group of local talent and pulled off a performance that was something to be proud of. The energy and industry of the founding members of this group is the kind of backbone that any organization would want. I believe that State Funding would be a logical next step in getting HHOC on the map and attracting the attention and support that it deserves.
Hillhouse Opera Company	31483	3	/users/profile/32359	jaystock	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	Hillhouse Opera Company represents a coalescence of professional opera talent with local amateur musicians and singers.  If Lincoln Center has been criticized for putting opera on a pedestal -- quite literally, given that it floats on platform plaza elevated up from the sidewalk -- then Hillhouse Opera Company is the exact opposite: a way to make opera fresh and accessible without compromising quality.  It brings opera into the heart of Connecticut communities by inviting people from all walks of life to participate in a myriad of ways, ranging from set designer to chorus member to cellist.  This engages not only those who directly participate in productions, but also their friends, family, and colleagues, who now have a "hook" into the world of opera that makes them more inclined to attend.  As such, Hillhouse reaches out to whole new audiences who may have overlooked (or been intimidated by) highbrow performances by the likes of the Met or even Yale's own opera company.  At the same time, by bringing in professionals for strategic jobs such as lead roles, stage directors, and conductors, Hillhouse ensures that performances are executed with the craft, precision, and polish that opera -- that most multifaceted of the performing arts -- demands. With its judicious pairing of professionals and amateurs, local and regional talent, and with its efforts to bring opera into neighborhoods throughout the region, Hillhouse Opera Company is an asset to Greater New Haven that is ripe for growth.  After only two years of productions, it already stands a worthy model for those who aspire to broaden the appeal of this wonderful art form.
Hillhouse Opera Company	31473	3	/users/profile/29325	hillhouseoperacompany	Board Member	5	02/26/2010	The Hillhouse Opera Company (HHOC) is a great asset to the New Haven Community.  As a member of the Company I have been a part of all of its productions, including mainstage operas (fully staged and with costumes and orchestra), scenes programs (also staged), concerts and master classes.  The productions are always high-quality and professional, and you cannot beat the price (free, with a suggested donation of $10/person, $5 for students and seniors).  The talent is mostly from Connecticut, a few have come from New York (HHOC strives to use local talent as part of its mission), and they *are* talented.  The Company is still young, but they started out strong and are only getting better as they age.
Sound Community Services Inc	270591	1	/users/profile/359314	letshelp	Former staff	5	11/01/2015	I love this agency. After years of leadership by a person that did nothing to improve the agency, a culture of non-services lived. Under the new leadership, people are now getting what they need to be better employees and there are expectations that we all will focus out attention on the people we serve. Something we need direction, expectations and healthy boundaries. If lazy overpaid people think they and just not serve, this is not the place to work. The new CEO is a visionary who has awaken the staff, clients and agency with his leadership that leads from the heart, but at the same time pushes his staff to be accountable, and creative.  
Sound Community Services Inc	161415	3	/users/profile/214077	WMTAM	General Member of the Public	1	06/25/2013	I was a client served for over 4 years with high staff turnover.

Sound Community Services Inc	80010	1	/users/profile/87364	blondere	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	I can't be more proud of an organization than I am of Sound Community Services, having served on the board of directors since 1998 and as chairman for 3years until 2010. After being witness to friends and family members suffering from various  mental illnesses(manic depression, paranoia followed by substance abuse resulting in several deaths and suicide attempts) and failed treatments , I grabbed at the opportunity to serve and try to make a small difference. I thought the intent of the non-profit of  helping adults adapt back into the community both socially and possibly employment wise was wonderful. Immediately after I joined the board of First Step Inc. trajedy struck with the murder of a manager. But our board showed it's mettle in leadership by supporting improved treatment, improving safeguards for our employees and clients, community education about our organization and mental illness, and merging First Step Inc.(case management) and IBH(clinical side) into Sound Community Services Inc. in 2005 with the result of providing seamless care for our clients.Our board was formed by merging both boards but quickly took on it's own personality. With the direction of our CEO Dr. Gail Lawson we have perfomed the merger, in process of moving our day program, the Oasis Center,to a better andlarger facility,have an in-house pharmacy,moved the Norwich clinic to a newer facility, expanded housing, and in the process of acquiring a building to better house SCS. I am also extermely proud  of the development of our fundraising aspects of the board. We have many members actively involved.One example of usage of the money raise is to send two clints to High Hopes for therapeutic riding. Oter monies will be used for capital expenses.The saddest part is that I am off the board for one year after serving three cosecutive 3 year terms! But I do volunteer on some committees.
Sound Community Services Inc	73953		/users/profile/80817	JR22	Volunteer	5	02/23/2011	As a Board member since 2003, I am always delighted to have a chance to speak on behalf of Sound Community Services.  When I originally joined the Board, it was my intention to serve a 3-year stint and then move on.  Now, 8 years later, with the exception of a one-year hiatus required after every 9 years of service, I am committed to SCSI for as long as I am able.  I have been a marriage and family therapist in private practice for nearly 30 years, and in that capacity, have had occasion to work with clients who, either themselves or their families, have been consumers of the many and varied services of SCSI.  Time and again, both in my practice and as a Board member I have had the oppportunity to witness both the professional skill and the human compassion of the excellent staff at SCSI.  In my experience, they are an exceptional team.

That is a valuable thing.
Sound Community Services Inc	71507		/users/profile/78197	wardkm	Volunteer	5	02/19/2011	I have been on the board of Sound Community Services since 2004 and I have been the secretary since 2007. My day job is as a neuroscientist, so to me it made sense to volunteer my time with an organization that provides practical help to the people afflicted with the disorders that I study. It has been my great pleasure to experience the caring and dedication of the members of the board with the majority of them serving three consecutive three year terms and then taking the mandatory year off only to return again.  I think that speaks to everyone's commitment to the cause of caring for people with mental health issues. I have also had the priviledge to meet with many of the employees of SCS and have seen their dedication first hand.  They are obviously passionate about what they do and I hope to continue to work with and learn from them for years to come.
Sound Community Services Inc	66238		/users/profile/72402	Jason	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2011	I have worked in a software vendor capacity with Sound Community Services over the last 8 months.  It is always mentioned that healthcare in general is slow to change, and this belief is probably even more profound for the behavioral health community.  Gail Lawson and her team at Sound are an exception to this widely-held belief.  They have creatively used technology to drive greater productivity but, more importantly, to deliver high quality care to those societal members most in need.  They possess great attitudes, are enthusiastic about their mission, and deliver a great service to their clients.  One doesn't run across high-performing and ethical organizations very often, so it leaves a lasting impression when you do come across one.  Sound Community Services has certainly made a lasting impression on me.

With me volunteering and being a part of this organization my daughter, my son, my niece and my sister-in-law have also find a place in March for Education.for example; My daughter at 15 have learned secretarial skills by volunteering to take notes at meetings it was not easy at first but she was able to do so by receiving the help and instruction from someone who knew how to do it.    MY son at 13 put his leadership and promotional skills to work in MFE by recruiting his peers and older to help make a successful outing.They all learned the concept of planning an event and what it takes as well how important it is to give back to the community.I have also been able to see talented youth given the platform and opportunity to display their talents and gain confidence in themselves. Also because of MFE some student were able to go our Capital had a great experience. I strongly believe if we continue to gain the recognition of our leaders and community and financial support MFE will grow and do more.

Connecticut Against Violence Inc. uses Hip Hop music and entertainment as a way to engage with the youth and get our message of violence prevention to them. As the Executive Director who have volunteered to March For Education for numerous special events, I can testify that they uses similar tactic and it works for them. I have personally volunteered as a Disc Jockey for their events as well as the event planning team. I urge you to support this organization for the sake of our youth who needs a better educate to succeed.

I teach financial literacy and I have been in spired by the kids enthusiasm to learn. They are bright, polite, and very attentive. The experience is so uplifting that I really look forward to working in the ReachPrep program every summer. My enthusiasm for the kids and the program have led to my being asked to join the Board which I I eagerly accepted just so long as it doesn't jeopardize my teaching in the boot camp. I was assured that there would be no problem doing both. Robert S. Salomon, Jr.

Newtown Action Alliance Inc	281240		/users/profile/371276	Writer	Board Member	5	02/29/2016	Newtown Action Alliance is an all volunteer group that was one of just a few in the country that was formed after the community was devastated by a mass shooting. They were motivated to organize so that other communities could avoid a similar tragedy in the future by working on legislative and cultural issues to change the hearts and minds of citizens and lawmakers . They have collaborated with other national groups and are inclusive of everyone who wants to join in their efforts. The Sandy Hook School shooting was a turning point that woke many Americans up to the magnitude of the  gun violence problem in this country and the Newtown name is still very important and relevant. Over the past three years they have built a reputation that has earned the respect of lawmakers who are working on this issue at the state and federal level, as well as the gun violence survivors that they speak for.
Newtown Action Alliance Inc	281183		/users/profile/371215	Writer	Volunteer	5	02/29/2016	This group of incredibly active, motivated and dedicated people have almost single handedly put gun control reform on the map in the past 3 years.

Holy Family Home and Shelter, Inc.	198525		/users/profile/259254	Bonsie	Donor	5	04/21/2014	My family and I have donated to Holy Family Home and Shelter for many years.  All things, whether money, food, toys, clothing, bed linens, pillows and/or towels are greatly appreciated and very much needed. There is such a growing need for Willimantic and the surrounding towns to step up to the plate and take care of the homeless mothers and children who have no other place to live. The staff and volunteers at the homeless shelter are so caring and helpful to the residents. When the families leave the shelter, they are given guidance and assistance to potentially become self supporting. All things that have been donated  to the homeless shelter have been acknowledged with a written note of thanks.
Holy Family Home and Shelter, Inc.	198404		/users/profile/259117	nvieira	Volunteer	5	04/20/2014	I have been a volunteer with Holy Family Shelter for two years.  Once a week, I work with the children in the afterschool program, and it has been an amazing experience.  Holy Familys afterschool program facilitates learning and encourages patience, cooperation, and respect, while keeping the atmosphere light and fun- an important time for the children as they balance school and other activities with their transitional living situation.  Several weeks ago, I witnessed the pure joy of one of the children as he announced that he would not be in program that day because he was moving to his new home.  That moment reminded me just how impactful the work of Holy Family is for those who utilize its services.

Holy Family Home and Shelter, Inc.	198235		/users/profile/258927	aprue	Volunteer	5	04/17/2014	I have been a volunteer for 22 years at The Holy Family Home and Shelter. Throughout these years, I have seen many mothers and their children receive excellent care. They are provided rooms, food, clothing and new friendships.  They are given the ability to attend classes and meetings to learn better skills on child-rearing and how to provide for their children financially and socially while living with others who are also homeless. The children attend local schools with after school programs at the shelter . During the summer, they go on field trips and continue with arts and crafts programs. Many families leave the Home with a broader knowledge of survival and family management, also with a new home or apartment, and many reunited are with their fathers. If it were not for The Holy Family Home and Shelter, these mothers and children would have nowhere to go. It is very fortunate that such a place as this exists.

I have witnessed how homeless women and children (even babies) in need are taken in and taken care of at the facility. The Holy Family Home and Shelter works with families to create budgets formulate life plans and encourage further life plans and encourage further education. Residents, who stay an average of 60 - 90 days, are provided with 3 meals a day, life skills workshops, case management, laundry facilities, an education program for children, assistance with permanent housing and employment searches, and referrals to other agencies as needed. The physical plant could definitely be modernized but the staff make the best of what they have and continue to write grants to keep things moving forward. The staff is very friendly and dedicated at what that do.

ELI Africa	43912	7	/users/profile/44806	ssalomon	Volunteer	5	06/14/2010	ELI Africa engages with Mauritian students in a thoughtful manner, tailoring its projects to their needs.  As a fellow, I have been designing projects for two schools, one a primary school that is preparing students for a standardized test called the CPE, and the other a vocational school for students who have already failed the CPE. Mauritian schools typically favor a highly regimented method of teaching that allows little room for student innovation and input, but ELI Africa attempts to combat this with experiential learning projects. For example, at the primary school Etoile de Mer, ELI Africa is helping the students begin a fruit and vegetable garden and write books about themselves.
ELI Africa	43890	6	/users/profile/44794	vap3216	Volunteer	5	06/14/2010	So far working with ELI Africa has been a complete pleasure. As a current fellow I am directly involved with this organization and it has exceeded all of my expectations. It is well organized and has a strong and clear strategy. The mission is to promote individual and community development by leading locally-relevant, hands-on experiential learning projects cooperatively in non-profit schools and fostering a spirit of volunteerism and linking the community with underprivileged youth.
ELI Africa	43879	8	/users/profile/44787	cem44	Volunteer	5	06/14/2010	My experience with ELI Africa has been absolutely inspiring. I cannot wait to continue my involvement and see this organization grow. I am part of the inaugural summer pilot program in Mauritius, Africa. We work in four different schools around the island, where we engage the students in a variety of educational initiatives that they would otherwise not have exposure to. All educational programs are unique to the needs of the surrounding community. One particular program I am passionate about has been a sports program for girls. The objective is to empower girls through sports, as they normally do not have the option to participate. I also enjoy the interactive environmental programs we have implemented to educate students about their local community. A constructive criticism of ELI Africa has been that we are currently running off of very limited resources. The attitude and energy of all involved is enough to make a difference, but it would obviously help in the future to have more resources and supplies to help the educational programs.
ELI Africa	43869	7	/users/profile/44780	michael-rose	Volunteer	5	06/14/2010	My experience with Eli Africa consists of being one of six fellows participating in the organization's pilot program in Mauritius in June and July of 2010.  We will spend two months total in Mauritius, devising, organizing, and conducting educational projects for students at four schools: Etoile de Mer, a school for children between 10-15; Ecole Fatima, for students between 16 and 20 who have failed a Mauritian standardized test called the CPE; and two special needs schools--Amour Sans Frontieres and Anou Grandi.  In most meaningful aspects, the program is working out excellently.As an organization, Eli Africa balances idealistic vision and practicality outstandingly well.  Its board is well-fitted to its task.  To name a couple representative examples, Charles Hill's pedigree as an adviser to some of the last four decades' most important political figures attests to his intelligence and judgment, and Linda Cole-Taylor is a professor of teacher preparation at Yale University (with which most of the organization's members are affiliated) with experience teaching all over the world.  Vedant Seeam, the organization's president, has an life story that has inspired him to take on this project and equipped him to carry it out effectively.  He is native Mauritian who pulled himself out of a difficult household to become vice chairman of finance in the northern district council and national badminton champion, all before enrolling as an undergraduate at Yale and walking onto its football team. His strong and charming personality, coupled with a deeply empathetic nature, pushes the organization forward.Idealogically, Eli Africa is devoted to experiential learning, which is lacking in Mauritius.  This means learning through projects--through creativity and accomplishment--as opposed to the rote drilling that currently dominates the island's education system.  The other fellows and I are setting up an English language blog for the students at Ecole Fatima, orchestrating the beginnings of a fruit and vegetable garden at Etoile de Mer, helping the kids at Etoile de Mer write books about themselves in English, and running theater programs at both Fatima and Etoile de Mer.  The team is made up of motivated Yale students with experience in various fields, and, between teaching at the schools and the planning process, we work more than full time to get results out of this pilot program.  One of Eli Africa's greatest virtues is that we are given creative freedom in putting together our teaching programs.  We choose what we want to teach and how, and this makes us feel very attached to our projects.  The students have been enthusiastically embraced this new form of education.  Largely thanks to their generosity of spirit, we have an affectionate relationship, and they are receptive to our teaching.  The older students at Ecole Fatima especially have started to open up to us about their feelings and hopes, and the unfolding of mutual understanding has been an enriching experience for both sides.  Thanks to the students' openness and Vedant's guidance, we have learned even more than we have taught.I am having an excellent experience with Eli Africa.  It is an innovative and effective organization.
ELI Africa	35688	6	/users/profile/36492	nicksim7	Board Member	5	04/13/2010	ELI Africa is an innovative program which will do great things to address education deficiencies in Africa. They're passion and dedication to their cause has really paid off and I believe their first summer program will have all the success in the world. I would recommend this group to anyone who is looking for their donation to directly impact the life of an African child. Additionally this is a great opportunity for any individual looking to participate as a fellow. Way to go guys!

I was away from the church for a period of time after several moves but came back to the church after a loss in my life. I was welcomed back as if I had never been away.  I am very active in this "Church on the Hill" and I am very proud to be a member of this community of faith.  I am happy to provide my time, talents and treasure and appreciate all of the efforts this church makes in the wider community not just within the walls of our own church.  Our outreach to the homeless and under privileged is evident in all we do, from homeless awareness to our casserole ministry and the many world wide missions we are involved with.  This is a place for me...  It could be a place for you!
Prospect Congregational Church, UCC	125700		/users/profile/170931	Gwenn Fischer	Board Member	5	10/16/2012	I've been a member of this church my whole life. I will turn 61 in December 2012. As a baby, my mom brought me to what was then called Cradle Roll. Many moms and children gathered to get to know one another and it was a great experience for all involved. Over the years, I remained active and held many offices within the church. I now serve as the Financial Secretary after the former secretary gave up the position because of the computer age. She has since passed away and is sorely missed by our whole congregation. We are a very, very active church and are in the process of trying to raise funds in order to install a handicap lift mechanism to make our church available to everyone!

Prospect Congregational Church, UCC	56240		/users/profile/58631	ProspectPages	Volunteer	5	11/02/2010	I have been a member of this church since 1965 and have experienced quite a bit since I've joined. The church is a very active church and involved in a great deal of outreach programs. Our Missions Board is always active and seeking out other organizations to help. Although our membership may be low, the members who are involved put a great deal of their time and efforts into making it the best little church on the hill in Prospect, Connecticut. I have served in many capacities over the years and wouldn't think of attending any other church.
Prospect Congregational Church, UCC	55489		/users/profile/57647	preacher	Board Member	5	10/27/2010	Working with the volunuteers of this church to feed the hungry of the greater Waterbury area is a spirit-filled experience.  All ages from young children to our senior population, in fellowship with one another, work hard to feed as many as 300 people at the soup kitchen provided by GWIM.  It is an awesome shared time that means as much to the people who are hungry as it does to the people who prepare the meal.  I praise God for this church!
Double Dog Rescue	282275	1	/users/profile/372408	lgmurphy29	Client Served	1	03/14/2016	Terrible experience with this rescue group. We rescued our former dog, Hamilton through Double Dog Rescue. They told us he was a Retriever/Mastiff mix and that he was good with people, kids, other dogs. Now I realize that a rescue dogs temperament doesn't typically show until they get comfortable in their new environment. But after about 2 months Hamilton began showing signs of aggression towards people entering the house and towards men in and outside of the home. We had a trainer come in to evaluate him and help us associate good things with people. We worked on this every, single, day. We had our friends and family come over, toss treats, no eye contact, etc. but he ended up gaining more confidence and began lunging at new people coming into the house. Thankfully we don't have children or we would have had to surrender him earlier than we did.  We finally came to the realization that we were not the right fit for Hamilton and he wasn't the right fit for us. I made sure to tell Chey and Kathy the reason for the surrender and suggested Hamilton be in a home with an experienced, older owner, that doesn't have many visitors and specially no children. This all happened about 3 weeks ago. Today, I received a phone call from Hamilton's new owner, August, which I don't know why Double Dog Rescue would disclose my information to a stranger. Him and his wife have 4 children, two that are high school aged and two that are 10/11. He began to tell me that Hamilton has been aggressively barking/lunging at his children's friends when they enter the home. He asked if we experienced this and what he should do. I told him the reason why we surrendered Hamilton was because of these behavioral issues and that I specifically told the rescue he needs an owner familiar with his breed and/or behavior issues and that he cannot be in a home with children. They not only disregarded my suggestions but gave my information out and set Hamilton up for failure yet again. The gentleman also stated that his vet wants to speak with me as well. So I have a the new owner of my former dog calling me, who was very nice might I add and I told him I want to help him in any way possible, but also his vet calling me. I just don't understand how a rescue can get away with working as an assembly line and placing these dogs into homes where they don't do home checks or really do their due diligence to find the best situation for these dogs since most of these dogs already had a rough start. I'm going to keep posting any where I can to make sure this doesn't keep happening to not only the dog but also for people interested in working with this rescue group because I'm sure they're not the only rescue group out there that does this. We loved Hamilton and surrendered him in hopes of him having a successful life where he was able to thrive and that wasn't the case.

Double Dog Rescue	207353	2	/users/profile/270003	RJMichalik	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/27/2014	As a member of the Double Dog Rescue (DDR) Executive Committee (and advisor to the DDR Board of Directors) I want to post a message that affirms the statement made on this website relating to the relationship (or more precisely 'lack of relationship') between DDR and Dog Gone Recovery (DGR), a completely separate organization. I am not familiar with the management of DGR and so I cannot (nor would) comment on the integrity of the organization.  I do not know whether they are a sanctioned bona fide charitable organization per IRC Sec 501(c)(3) or any comparable State registration body.    What is clear is that DGR is completely unrelated to DDR.   Please refrain from making any comments about DGR (positive or negative) on the DDR pages.    Thank you !!!   Bob Michalik -----------------------------------DDR is a licensed charitable organization, founded in 2006 with the specific mission to rescue dogs who are at risk, transport them to New England, provide a health examination by a licensed veterinarian, and locate and coordinate the adoption of the dog into a good loving home.  
Double Dog Rescue	204765	2	/users/profile/266809	lazat	Volunteer	1	06/30/2014	Dog Gone Recovery (DGR) states they area non profit under DDR. First off Dog Gone Recovery is not a non profit even though they make false claims that they are. I used to be in this group until I saw first hand what they do and how they behave and how they treat people. This group claims to be experts in finding lost dogs, that couldn't be further from the truth. The truth is they do NOT know what they are doing, they create Facebook group pages and that's pretty much it. When they do actually attempt to do something it takes them days or weeks to coordinate the most simple task. They immediately demand the owners of lost dogs hire a specific pet tracker who has a horrible recovery rate and bad reputation, when questioned about this they verbally attack people or ban them from the FB pages. They are bullies and over bearing, they are a bunch of old retired women who who should take up knitting as a hobby, not finding lost dogs. 
Double Dog Rescue	194561	5	/users/profile/254266	jckoh5	General Member of the Public	1	02/20/2014	A fb group called Dog Gone Recovery claims to be a non-profit under Double Dog Rescue's name and liability insurance.  Dog Gone Recovery is not listed anywhere as a company, business or non-profit.  A BOD member who serves as facebook admin for Dog Gone Recovery has publicly stated this claim.  Person is also on the BOD of Double Dog Rescue and another charity called Dog Star Rescue.  This individual has claimed that Dog Gone Recovery will now be a part of Dog Star Rescue a new non profit group in CT.   Donators and volunteers should check to be sure all paper work on Double Dog Rescue, Dog Gone Recovery and Dog Star Dog Rescue is verified before you donate to any of these groups.  Dog Gone Recovery raises funds via a PayPal account to pay for a for fee pet tracking service and for supplies such as camera and other material.  It is not known who this account is owned by and where the funds are going. IF Double Dog and Dog Star ARE NOT affliated with Dog Gone Recovery, then they need to publicly deny any affliation.  The appearance is that Dog Gone Recovery  is NOT a registered non-profit because IF they are, they have ignored all written requests for proof of filing status. 
Double Dog Rescue	161855	1	/users/profile/214676	david.zellct	Client Served	5	07/01/2013	We just adopted a dog who was fostered by a volunteer.   All good, our newly adopted family member is enjoying her new home.   The $450 fee we paid Double Dog seemed reasonable given the amount of effort it takes to transport the dogs from the southern US and take care of them before finding foster or permeate homes.   I felt Double Dog had a great deal of credibility because in their adoption contract, they ask to be the first party to take the dog back should the adoption not workout.    This showed me they really care about the dogs and ensuring they find good homes.

However, when I went to get my flu shot this year, the nurse was most understanding and sort of babied me thru the process and made the experience a pleasure. The nurses and assistants are all so pleasant to everyone who comes in, and that makes a relaxing and comfortable situation for all. Thanks for the professional and kind attention. Frank Calise 
Visiting Nurse Association of Ridgefield Inc	174844		/users/profile/231143	Barbara Newland	Client Served	5	10/07/2013	This letter explains my medical situation and praises the Ridgefield VNA. On Dec. 24, 2012, I was hospitalized with a major heart attack.  After a week in Danbury Hospital where a stent was installed, I returned home under the care of VNA nurses.  A nurse by the name of Crytstal was caring for me.  Soon after coming home, I developed a heart Arythmia.  Frightened by the symptoms, and not knowing what was going on, I called Crystal.  She coordinated the situation with my primary care doctor.  I went back into the hospital for more surgical work.  I am a diabetic with stage 3 kidney disease and congestive heart failure.  I went on kidney dialysis, but I was fortunate not to need dialysis after only one treatment.  Needless to say, I was a pretty sick man when I returned home at the end of January 2013. Crystal picked up again as my nurse and continued to do a terrific job.  She made me feel confident in my recovery and praised my progress.  She explained everything to me and my family carefully & completely.  She made me feel that I could and would get better despite m y own grim outlook on my health problems. She is a great nurse and an amazing person.  You should be proud to have her as an employee.  during this time I also had other people from the VNA taking care of me.  An occupational therapist by the name of Theresa was instrumental in helping me take steps toward independence.  She put me at ease during times of showers which was an uncomfortable situation for me.  Her easy going manner and upbeat personality were very much appreciated.   Jasmine, a home health aide, was also excellent.  She was kind, thorough, and a great help to me.   Lynne was my physical therapist.  She was extraordinary!  She got me moving and exercising, praised my progress, and in general propped up my sagging confidence in my recovery.  Her great abilities as a therapist played a major part and was the main reason for my rapid improvement.  She pointed me in the right direction towards cardiac rehab which I now do three times a week.  She more than anyone is the main reason that I am doing so well today.  Thank you to all these great ladies and the Ridgefield VNA!
Love146	236082	4	/users/profile/319848	JustDoGood	Donor	5	12/30/2014	Love146  is an incredible organization doing some of the toughest work in regards to child trafficking. While IJM and other NGOs rescue young children out of sex trafficking, they bring the survivors to Love146 for long-term, holistic care that they themselves don't provide. Love146 is fighting the hardest battles on the forefront by implementing survivor care and prevention education programs. Few organizations, government agencies, or individuals take the time to fund or care about preventing trafficking and abuse from happening; Love146 does. If you are at all passionate about the issue, I would support Love146. They have offices in several countries and are growing to serve more and more children every day. I'm happy to support them as a donor and friend. 
Love146	215602	3	/users/profile/279035	GoodCounsel	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/18/2014	I have to respectfully disagree with w_65_j's assessment that this is an inefficient organization. Love146 has achieved a multi-year Four Star rating with Charity Navigator, which simply doesn't happen at inefficient organizations. Also, the organization places a very high value on transparency, accountability, and outcome measurement. All of their financials, program proposals, and annual reports are easily discoverable on the website. After working for almost ten years in the non profit sector I can confidently say that Love146's level of transparency and accessibility is the exception rather than the norm, unfortunately.  As both a longtime donor to Love146 and an attorney specializing in non profit governance and management, I feel utterly confident investing in the work of Love146. I cary high expectations for quality outcomes, which they consistently meet.  In summary: great organization, great people, great work.  
Love146	191628	2	/users/profile/250117	courtneyblujackson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/26/2013	As a graduate student studying Nonprofit Organization Management I highly admire and recommend this organization. The people working there are working for considerably less than people performing the same level of work in the private sector. These individuals are committed to their goal of ending modern day slavery. They spend their money well, including administrative and fundraising costs. How is an organization to do their work without spending money in those two areas? They cannot. For an organization doing as much work as Love146 is doing with the size staff they are working with and in the area they are working is mind blowing.
Love146	107489	2	/users/profile/145606	w_65_j	General Member of the Public	2	03/03/2012	Inefficient organization.

Love146	82694	2	/users/profile/91365	Craig Snedeker	Donor	5	03/21/2011	I never knew about modern day slavery until I heard about Love146 (they were a featured charity on Air1 Radio Station). Ever since I learned about Slavery (sex/labor/debt), I want nothing more then to help slavery and raise awareness. I love what Love146 is doing. God spoke to me though them. 
Love146	82559	3	/users/profile/91094	Victoria Tiedemann	General Member of the Public	5	03/18/2011	I used to live my life in a bubble world. I didn't realize many things that went on around me. Then in 2007 I found out about Love146. They informed me about how every minute, 2 children are sold into sexual exploitation of sexual slavery. They informed me that 27 million people were enslaved around the world and that more than half of them were children. I was in awe of what I learned. I thought slavery ended when it was abolished in the U.S. but I started to learn a great deal of information about modern day slavery and the abuse done to some as young as 5 years old (and some even younger than that). People are forced into prostitution, sold into bondage to do things that no child can even comprehend. It is happening, and Love 146 is doing so much to help restore those who are rescued out of their slavery. I have been so influenced because of what I learned from Love146, that as soon as I found out about what they were doing to help educate victims and show love that these children have never truly seen before through their advocacy, I started to daily research the issues. I have learned the greatness of spreading awareness and even did a presentation for my church on it, using the many examples given through love146. I also held a car wash with the youth group of my church to donate money to help them continue in it, as well as raise money for them amongst family and friends. I have enjoyed the updates I receive each month from them through emails, reading their blog, and knowing that their safe homes that I have helped support are making a difference in the lives of girls who have survived and will survive when they are restored back into society.  The workers at Love146 all seem to have twitters and have really great communication and ways that you can be involved in helping them continue in their work of changing lives. They've held bike rides and walks/runs each year to spread awareness and raise money, they've held their Car Wash Across America to do the same, and are very involved in their dedication to bringing an end to slavery! I will continue to love and support all that Love146 represents, which is bringing a voice of those who are ignored and abused.

The leadership is stellar, and the students benefit by committed attention to their needs.  Just in the several years we have partnered with them, we have seen students transition from wide-eyed children enthralled with their new-found exposure to the instruments to actual learning musicians ready to transition into membership in our selected-by-audition program.

Starfish Connection Inc	88256		/users/profile/99179	Peterhg	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/02/2011	It is with great pleasure that I write this review. The Starfish Connection came to us ( The Young Mariners Foundation, a non-for profit Org.) several years ago and asked if some of their children could be included in our program. The Young Mariners Foundation serve the inner city young population. The Starfish Connection have their mentors bring their children to our once a week all school year 5th grade program. They learn many things related to the sea, ecology, navigation, knot tying, rules of the road/safety at sea etc. Upon completion of the Young Mariner Program the Starfish Connection children are considered for scholarships to the Blue Water Bound summer sailing camp. Several of the Starfish Connection children have attended both programs and they are exemplary students. We at YMF feel fortunate to have such a meaningful and productive relationship with Starfish Connection.

Starfish Connection Inc	88150		/users/profile/99023	Juliebwrite	Volunteer	5	04/30/2011	The Starfish Connection pairs mentors with third-grade students who show academic promise, have good attendance records (indicating parental involvement), but are held back by economic circumstances. These children are bright, high potential kids for whom mentoring will hopefully provide the extra edge they'll need to score high throughout their k-12 schooling and then to go to college. As a mentor, I've committed to work with my mentee for 10 years, until he graduates from H.S. His parents are from Haiti. Both work. The father works two jobs. Starfish provides  the opportunity for my mentee to attend cultural events (concerts, plays) with me, to go to summer camp, to learn a musical instrument, to participate in the City of Stamford's Recreation program (my mentee has taken piano lessons; others do swimming, art, sports), to go on educational field trips. On our first day together, not quite a year ago, we went to the library and got him a library card. We go there frequently. We read together several times a week, over the phone and in person. He has a refurbished printer courtesy of Starfish (his family already had a computer). He has a piano, donated by a friend of Starfish. Donors make it possible for Starfish Connection to provide backpacks and camp clothing, to pay for the camp itself, and to provide at full-cost or a scholarship rate all of the programs I've mentioned.  I can see the enormous benefits my mentee has had so far from Starfish. I can't wait to see his success as a result. The founder, Judy Martin, is inspiring me and my fellow mentees to do all we can to make our mentees' lives all they can be.

We have been part of this nonprofit for 7 years, many businesses have donated their support in shipping books and donating recyclable items.  Children have offered up their savings to make Zambian children's lives better in a country so different than theirs. This nonprofit has connected our community of learners with another community.

Not only are widows and orphans supported, they have become donors themselves, giving back to their community and helping others move out of poverty.  I've never seen such direct and life-changing impact by a nonprofit organization.  I'm especially impressed that the leadership has mostly transitioned to Zambian women who have stepped up to the challenge.
Academy of the Holy Family Inc	95719		/users/profile/111228	nakalungi	General Member of the Public	5	08/15/2011	I hope that whomever is reading this as a means of trying to discern their Catholic high school choice will be helped in their decision by what I share.  I am an alumnae of Academy of the Holy Family (AHF) where I was privileged to attend high school.  Prior to attending AHF I was a painfully shy African 14-year old having an extremely difficult time adjusting to American culture.  The three years I had attended elementary and junior high school had led me deeper into my shell as my accent led most of my teachers not to understand me and many of my peers to ridicule me.  AHF was a God-send for there I found other young students from my homeland and wonderful God-fearing American friends with whom I made lasting friendships as we studied together, prayed together, and grew together.  God also blessed me with many teachers who encouraged me to ask questions and who helped me blossom into a good student and athlete, gifts God had put in me that I had never known were in me until I attended AHF.  The attention each student received due to the optimal teacher-to-student ratio received  helped shape each of us into being the best we could be.  For me personally, it helped shape who I am today because AHF is where I fell in love with Science (thank you Sister Maria) and which led to my pursuing a B.A. in Biology from Rosemont College and a M.S. in Biotechnology from Johns Hopkins University.  This all eventually led to my current job at the National institutes of Health.  At AHF my Catholic faith was fostered and so was the knowledge that as a Christian I should look for ways to give back.  This led to my involvement in various activities within the Church and non-profit organizations.  I am forever grateful for God using my many teachers at AHF to help me discover whom God created me to be as a Catholic and a member of society, while helping me build many wonderful friendships that have become another family to me; and a confidence that as a child of God I can indeed "do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Phil 4:13)  Thank you AHF! Forever grateful,Mary Kiganda (class of '86)

I am proud to say, that I am an alumnae of the fine school and would recommend it to any student, looking for the best education available.  Not only will they learn academics,but also faith, hope and love, from the heart of the Sister's of Charity, who give it their all in developing fine, well educated, young women.

The studies are rigorous and there is a great deal of study time.  Students are well prepared for college.  The professors, both religious and lay professionals are engaging.  The school offers an enormous variety of extracurricular activities for all and particularly boarding students.  They have made extra efforts to promote learning and personal growth.  Our daughter was selected to attend leadership conferences.  The relationship of the school to the nearby community college is a definite plus for advanced learning.  They deserve ongoing support to continue their fine work.

The dedication of the faculty & Staff was second to none, and the motto "where friends become family" still holds true today!  Once you walk through those doors, you become part of the family, and when you leave, you are always welcomed "home"!If you have a daughter, who is high-school aged, it will certainly be worth your while, to invest in her future, and have her experiecne the Academy  Life firsthand!

Wildlife in Crisis, Inc.	36514	4	/users/profile/37301	anna	Volunteer	5	04/22/2010	I was a resident intern for WIC in the summer of '08 and I continue to volunteer there on a weekly basis. My involvement with the organization has been immensely beneficial to both my personal and career development. WIC is a truly amazing organization that puts the well being of all wildlife before anything else. The organization's dedication to the life of each individual animal is truly unprecedented. This is something I was able to experience while working for the organization. We worked all day and all night to ensure each and every animal received the care and attention necessary so that it could be released back to the wild. WIC saves thousands of injured and orphaned animals each year. Being able to be present during the releases of hundreds of animals was truly a gratifying experience that illustrated the importance of WIC in giving injured and orphaned wildlife the second chance that they deserve.

It's great to see so many injured and orphaned animals have a second chance at life.  Dara has put her heart into this place and without her, the staff and all the supporters, WIC wouldn't be what it is today.  Personally my internship was an experience I'll never forget and it has given me the experience I need to pursue my career goals.  I only wish I were able to continue volunteering at such a great place.

Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, Inc	244777	11	/users/profile/331785	oklee	Volunteer	1	06/07/2015	I raised 8  puppies for Fidelco and will no longer support this organization.  It is very difficult to get accurate information about their placement rate of their dogs. The agency is shrouded in secrecy.  The atmosphere has changed and what was once a warm and caring environment is now a cold and unwelcoming place.  There are other guide dog foundations that do a far better job of training their puppies and supporting and appreciating their volunteers. As a volunteer it was very difficult to get any accurate information about the dogs I trained, other similar agencies go out of their way to include puppies raisers.  Fidelco goes out of their to distance themselves from their puppy raisers. It is with great sadness that I am no longer able to endorse Fidelco.

Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, Inc	168070	1	/users/profile/222966	7gsdsrgrate	Volunteer	5	09/06/2013	While living in Connecticut I had the privilege of raising 7 Fidelco guide dog puppies over an  8 year period as a "foster mom".   During that time I saw the wonderful progress of a tiny furry pup into a beautiful, well trained  partner to a visually impaired human being and witnessed the easy freedom each person had after pairing up with a guide dog carefully chosen by a truly caring staff.  I believe Fidelco's policy of training a person and their new guide dog in the individual's home area is superior to campus training.  Robbie and Charlie Kaman - founders of Fidelco - were two wonderful and caring people, and the members of their staff just as dedicated.
Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, Inc	167888	1	/users/profile/222772	GuideDogGirl	General Member of the Public	5	09/06/2013	Fidelco is my charity of choice because I know that when I donate, my dollars are immediately being put to use to change lives. I've donated to other organizations in the past where most of my money was used for long-term research. While that's worthy and good for the world, as a donor I want to know how I can do the most good, right away, RIGHT NOW -- not ten or fifty years into the future. Blindness won't be cured anytime soon, but there's something we can do RIGHT NOW for people who are blind, and that's helping them receive these amazing guide dogs who help them lead more independent lives and feel like part of society again. I can immediately see the difference my donation is making.  I also love Fidelco because they are the only guide dog organization that specializes in the German Shepherd Dog specifically. Other schools dabble in the breed but mostly use sporting breeds. Fidelco has been the GSD expert since 1960 and the Fidelco GSD is, simply put, the most superior dog for the very important, life-changing and often life-saving job of being a guide dog for a person who is blind.

The animals are very well cared for and they've saved countless from the south. I adopted a dog from there. He was a puppy when I got him and had gone to another family and then was returned.  The dog is now in training to be my service dog and is coming along very well. I only wish they reviewed applicants and chose the best one rather than do a first come first served basis. If they did this they would see less animals returned to the shelter, however I think they would have less money for the shelter so it may explain their motives. I just think less moves and changes of ownership is better for the dogs/cats especially at a young age.That's the only reason why this got a four instead of a five.

It was frightening to ask for help, yet the counselor was very patient in answering my emails; she was very encouraging.  I finally had the courage to go and I am so grateful I did.  The counselor gave much of her time to me, helped me to see my worth and not harm myself, etc.  Sometimes we met at the crisis center; other times she came to my home.  One session I was about to leave at the end and she recognized I needed to have someone with me.  We called my sister who came immediately.  When I ended up in the hospital, the counselor kept in touch and helped me.

We met people from other areas that relate to the industry- hospital staff, police officers, SANE nurses, Prison Wardens, etc.  Based on this training, I was able to get a complete understanding of the importance of the SACCEC's  effect on the community, the support it offers, and the team that I would be able to become a part of.   Every month I volunteer for multiple shifts, where I answer calls from individuals who have been sexually assaulted recently, and in the past.  I also answer questions from family members of victims, police officers, and others who need help.  Lastly, with recent victims, as a crisis counselor I go out to five local hospitals when we get calls from victims, and help them walk through the Sexual Assault kit, police questioning, and assists in the beginning of the healing process.   The SACCEC encourages healthy relationships in our local community.  They reach out and perform programs within local school systems and communities to raise awareness.

Initially, I trained with them for about 6 weeks with their volunteer coordinator. The training was very in depth with outside reading, quizzes, and 2 hour trainings done at convenient hours. I left the training prepared for my volunteer endeavors. After the training ended, SACCEC employees still provide opportunities for learning by meeting police, DCF workers, and other trainers that somehow relate to our work with the hotline.  I appreciate the support that the staff provides. They are kind and caring individuals who I have had the opportunity to spend time with. They truly care about their mission. Further,  this non profit really appreciates its volunteers and always takes the times to thank us for the work we do by throwing small parties or with just a simple thank you email.  SACCEC has provided an amazing opportunity for me to not only help, but grow as an individual.

She tells the board of the trials and tribulations involved in working with many different agencies.  There are the stories of success and failure in getting the Emergency Room personnel to notify victims of our availability. Likewise, there are successes and failures working with various police agencies and child protective services. The roles and goals of the individuals from these agencies are often at odds, but we have seen some wins in achieving group interaction. It appears to me that the public is much more educated than in the past, thanks in part to the work of our counselors.

The specialist was arogant and rude, he reminded us that we didn't have any medical degrees but the petiatrition listened. Unfortunately the test came back positive after Anthony surcomed to pnemonia. When the specialist was asked why Anthony wasn't tested sooner he replied " I was going to after I repeated the first tests (which were all negotive)". Anthony died at 3 yrs of age, how old did he have to be? The other test were all invasive and painful, thetest for canavans wasn't. When the organization is offering doctors credable information, why don'y they listen? During our quest we recieved great emotional back-up and direction. We spoke to others with children who had canavans and were very hopeful. I commend the foundation for all they do and tell everyone we meet about them. If I had a stick in my eye I wouldn't need a medical degree to know it hurts! When something is wrong and you don't know why it's good to have people that can answer Questions.

Canavan Research Foundation, Inc.	43510	7	/users/profile/44378	sally9	Client Served	5	06/10/2010	I came into contact with Canavan Research Foundation in 2005 when my son Ben was 2 years old, at the age of 18 months he had been diagnosed with Canavan disease. To say that this diagnosis completly broke our hearts does not nearly cover the depth of emotion we feel but I know of no words that do.I live in the UK to my knowledge there are only 4 children with Canavan Disease in the country and at the time there were only 2. However in America and Jewish communities around the world it is much more common.  Our doctors knew very little about the conditiion and we felt isolated and without advice and resources to help and understand our son.Finding the Canavan Research Foundation and being able to become a memeber of the parents forum we were being offered a life line, suddenly I was able to talk to other parents and the doctors at the foundation to give me advice and share experiences and support.  It is so valualbe to us.One of the best examples of how imporant a link to this experience is to us is as follows,In 2006 Ben had been having seizures for a year, these are unique to Canavan Disease and not epliptic fits but are very frighting and serious for the child as it involves the child stopping their breathing and then having very poor breathing, in Ben's case for at least an hour then the complete cycle of the seizure lasting the rest of the day.I was able to ask other parents and a doctor of their experience via the Canavan Research Foundation forum. But our doctors would not give Ben medication for the seizures because they had never seen anything like it.I read on the Canavan Research Foundation forum about how the seizures in canavan children can increase and reach a point where without medication the child can not come out of the seizure.About 6 weeks later Ben had such a seizure, instead of loosing his breathing for about an hour 3 hours went by and Ben was turning blue,I called an ambulance.  At the hospital they put him on oxoygen and lots of monitors but would not give him medication.  It was midnight when we arrived at the hospital all of the next day Ben's seizure continued but the doctors would not give him medication, he was put in a high observation room with a nurse by him all the time, a difibulator was plugged in by his bed as his heart rate along with his breathing was very irratic spiking dangerously high.  I told the doctors and nurses what I has read about other canavan sufferers needing medication for epilepsy althogh the seizure did not appear like a typical epileptic fit but they would not listen.Finally at 11pm on the second day when Ben's seizure had been going for 28 hours and I had not slept for over 40 I insisted that again that the nurse call the doctor.  I could take it no more I broke down and pleeded with him, telling him that I had read about these symptoms, insisting he do something, finally I asked him are you going to try something or just watch my little boy die? He gave in and gave Ben a shot of lorazepam, instantly the seizure stopped.For the rest of a week Ben had to remain in hospital, the seizure had left him so physically weak that he could not even cough.  He was more exhausted than I have ever seen a human being.  I feel certain that he could not have taken much more of the seizure and would have died.Shortly afterwards Ben was given a daily preventative medication for his seizures and has not had to suffer like this again.I also feel certain that had I not had the knowledge passed onto me by other parents via the Canavan Research Foundation forum that I would not have had that information from any other source and therefore not the knowledge or confidence to stand up to the doctor.  I feel sure that on providing me with the resources of their forum the Canavan Research Foundation saved my son's life and we are in their debt.I continue to check the forum regularly to share my experiences with and learn from other parents all over the world.In 2009 my husband volunteered to rebuild and maintain the Foundation's website, we were pleased to be able to do something in return.The Canavan Reserach Foundation to my knowledge is the only facility in the world dedicated to searching for a cure for canavan disease, their break throughs will also be of benefit to other better known diseases such as parkinsons and alzhimers.  Parents and doctors all over the world are looking to them for the latest information and management of Canavan disease and they alone carry the hopes of children all over the world that soon a treatment will be found to combat this cruel disease.

Board Member	3	06/23/2011	I am a new Board member of NORD who is absolutely focused on ensuring that NORD ensures its relevance and importance to the patient community and the patient organizations that it serves. NORD knows that it needs to do more than be the protector of the Orphan Drug Act. It has a new leadership team, and that leadership team has recently developed a new set of advocacy principles that we believe reflect the needs of patients with rare diseases. These include: -- A national awareness and recognition of the challenges faced by people living with rare diseases and the associated costs to society.-- A nation where people with rare diseases can secure access to diagnostics and therapies that extend and improve their lives. -- A social, political, and financial culture of innovation that supports both the basic and translational research necessary to create diagnostic tests and therapies for all rare disorders.-- A regulatory environment that encourages development and timely approval of safe and effective diagnostics and treatments for patients with rare diseases. There is a GREAT deal more that we need to do ... and I look forward to helping the leadership and the staff of NORD to make sure we succeed in achieving these new goals.

The Open Door Shelter, Inc.	151009		/users/profile/201466	faba	Volunteer	5	03/13/2013	As a volunteer, donor and supporter of the Norwalk Emergency Shelter (aka Open Door Shelter and Manna House Soup Kitchen), I have seen firsthand the good work and invaluable services provided by the staff.  They care about people in need and do their absolute best to provide temporary assistance and to offer counsel and services to help their clientele regain their footing in society. I was surprised by the low overall rating, but see that one old and misguided review is dragging down the average.  This is a homeless shelter operating on a shoestring budget.  They are understaffed and overworked, but do their absolute best.  The food provided through the soup kitchen may not be gourmet, but it is prepared in a Health Department certified environment by staff and volunteers who care.
The Open Door Shelter, Inc.	84093		/users/profile/93224	Luckyman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/30/2011	Homelessness is an emergency. Whether residents are chronically homeless due to psychiatric disorders or drug addictions, or non-chronically homeless due to job loss, abuse, or any number of other unlucky reasons, a shelter is first and foremost protection and safety. The Open Door Shelter provides all residents whatever services are required to create an exit strategy. The new Hope Works jobs training program offers residents who want it the chance to make it. Granted, it is not the Comfort Inn, but it adheres to all state health regulations and provides a temporary home for renewal and independence. The employees, volunteers, partners, corporate supporters, and board members are there to make a difference and do so on a daily basis.

The new executive director is extremely passionate about the residents and has a strong clinical intervention plan. He is working hard to straighten out years of neglect & abandonment. We need the residents of Norwalk to come together in support of our new director & give him the chance to make the Open Door Shelter the very best any shelter can possibly be. A place that provides a temporary home while providing clinical, psychological, educational, emotional support & job training opportunities, before they are sent back to independence.

He is a big bodybuilder guy with gentle demeanor and has interest in bringing treatment to the shelter. You should go visit this guy. awesome
The Open Door Shelter, Inc.	33345	7	/users/profile/34152	been-there	Client Served	1	03/16/2010	They keep people there far too long without working with them on housing. The food is not healthy for living things and the ducts probably have not been cleaned for 10 years in the female dorm. All of the women in there start wheezing and coughing and there is no fresh air to breathe and no air circulation.The place is vastly overcrowded.The apartments, however, are a nice respite from the constant BLARING TV AND SCREAMING PEOPLE.Staff vary- some are very good- others worse behaved than the clients they "suspend". (kick out).No mental health services at all. They don't realize when someone is dangerous or having severe hallucinations. They kick out the drunks but not the crackheads and heroin addicts. Constant threats of SUSPENSION (being kicked out on the street) for things that vary by staff. Rules not followed by some staff and some clients.
Spring Mountain Benefit Corp	286781		/users/profile/376851	Megan_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I grew up visiting Jamaica once a year as our family vacation. I got to know a few local Jamaicans and they were always very kind to me. I was not a popular child and found it difficult to make friends, but when I was there everyone loved me. Even as a child it was clear that the local people struggled to have quality of life, with all the poverty. Even when they had no food and tattered clothing, spirits were good and thanks were given for what they had and for life. When I got older and my parents separated, I continued to visit once a year and met up with my friends there. Eventually I started to stay with Jamaican friends and really got a feel for the poverty and daily struggles. I realize how lucky I am to have been born where I was, with all the opportunities that provides. I have dedicated my life to trying to improve quality of living for people who were not as fortunate as I was and who were born in a country with massive poverty and other issues. It is only luck that allows me to have a job where I am able to contribute to Spring Mountain Benefit Corp, a non-profit whose mission is to help local Jamaican people and animals. I contribute as much as I can to this organization and it definitely deserves the award. Thank you for your time.
Spring Mountain Benefit Corp	212160		/users/profile/275111	PD79	Donor	5	08/24/2014	This is an excellent charity that does a lot of good in the community it serves.  Megan and Marvia were a pleasure to deal with and I found them to be extremely effective at turning donor dollars into real and sustainable improvements to the community.  Highly recommend.
Spring Mountain Benefit Corp	211588		/users/profile/274509	flos	General Member of the Public	5	08/21/2014	I have traveled to this area  Jamaica many times over the past 30 years. The poverty and needs of the people is striking. Yet the people are warm, welcoming and so hard working. I have had the pleasure of staying at the villa which is the basis for this charity. It is lovely. Well maintained, spacious and sitting in the heart of the community, it allows not only a relaxing vacation but a unique experience in which to really get to know the local residents and experience the true flavor of the area.The residents are sorely in need of help. They struggle daily to provide food for their families and an education for their children. Medical care is expensive and difficult to access. The residents have to show initiative and creativity just to survive, and they do. There are no real supports for the people. Since this area is so dependent on tourism and tourism has fallen in recent years, the circumstances of the people has worsened.The director has already devoted many years and resources to help some of the families in this community. This non-profit will help to provide supports for the development of sustainable projects to improve the lives of the residents: it will help to give money for the (not free) educational needs of the children - books, supplies, uniforms, tuition; allow access to much needed health care so people don't die of conditions which can be easily treated and make it possible to improve the infrastructure of an area which struggles with not having the most basic services like adequate water and roads.This is a potentially wonderful way to help people directly - either through a monetary contribution or a visit to this lovely, enchanting villa.
Spring Mountain Benefit Corp	211504		/users/profile/274434	Todd26	General Member of the Public	5	08/21/2014	I've spent time in Green Island Jamaica on a few occasions while I was on vacation in Jamaica. We stayed at spring mountain villa which donates it's profits to it's namesakes charity. It's a wonderful place atop a beautiful mountain with ocean views. I went with a good friend who had stayed there many times and has made Jamaica a big part of her life. For me it was my first time out of the states since I was a child and first ever to a tropical island. We arrived in Montego Bay and had to drive to green island passing through Negril on the way. There were little hotels and a small ocean side city in Negril. Jimmy Buffets cheeseburgers and Sandals resort were on the way out of town. In a bit we reached green island. As we drove up the narrow mountain road we passed the homes of the locals. Manny of the houses were little more than plywood and patchwork with corrugated metal sheets for roofs and fencing. There were concrete and cinderblock homes as well. Manny buildings that were larger were in stages of forgotten construction. It must have been Sunday because we passed a few small churches which had rather large attendance. One nice older church was only a shell and had no roof, still there was a full service in swing. I really didn't know any of Jamaica's history and received the abbreviated version. At one point I noticed a thin PVC pipe half inch at most running above ground right next to the road. I was told it was water for the entire mountain, this blew my mind and brought into perspective a lot of things we take for granted back home here in the states. Sure enough I saw a few if the local men fixing the water line one day after a car had bumped into it, I also learned that even with the tiny pipe ship shape there are times that the water is shut off and diverted to the "more important needs". We had rather large water tanks at the villa so water was no issue. Every where we went the people were warm and excited to have us. Hard times have taken there toll on much of the world, for a place like Jamaica which depends on tourism to flourish it's that much tougher. Spring Mountain Benefit is trying to help address some of the issues. One that stands out for me was education for the local kids. Schools require fees, and the kids wear uniforms. All of that adds up to money that I'm sure some family's don't have. There's plenty of places that help is needed all around down there and this charity is a step in the right direction. With a little help from others I believe that Spring Mountain Benefit corp can really help some kind and decent people in need. Help out if you can or if you like the idea of getting more hands on look into the villa I mentioned and go spend time with the people you'll be helping.

Journey Found	321082		/users/profile/414265	wickerpa	Board Member	5	01/11/2017	As founders and Board members we are very proud of what Journey Found has achieved in a few years.  This is a truly unique nonprofit agency.  The culture ingrained in the organization's collective psyche is to provide a supportive and caring environment to people with intellectual disabilities to help them lead a productive life.  If you come to the agencys main office, visit its various programs or attend its social gatherings you will be struck by the smiles on the people the organization supports and how much the staff is motivated.  The field of services to people with disabilities is very challenging.  Journey Found is an organization willing to tackle these challenges,  learn from them and continuously strive to improve the lives of the people it serves.  Maryse and Pierre Wicker
Journey Found	320522		/users/profile/413176	CelinaK	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/27/2016	It is a wonderful experience to work for an organization where people are passionate about what they do. Journey Found puts the focus on people's abilities, rather than their disabilities, and helps to create a supportive environment to allow people to explore their abilities and achieve their dreams. They develop meaningful person centered programs that are uniquely created for each person they support.  From the support staff to the administrative staff and leadership, you won't find a group of people more dedicated to what they do.
Journey Found	320048		/users/profile/412116	tomdembik	Board Member	5	12/12/2016	As one of the founders of Journey Found I'm pleased to talk about our mission statement." The mission of Journey Found is to enable each individual to become all that they are capable of being"This statement leads to our person centered philosophy when working with new disabled individuals that require our services. Instead of offering a fixed program that wouldn't fit the person, we tailor a program to fit their needs and desires. The result is to provide a program that brings out the best of the individual and help them make progress and improvements in their life. We want them to be happy.Another way of saying this is " The answer is yes, what is the question?"  The overall result of this is that the individuals we serve are doing things they enjoy and are very comfortable in their surroundings.One individual who is in his 30's and nonverbal surprised everyone recently by saying hello to his mother for the very first time. The first words he ever spoke. Amazing!We cannot eliminate the disabilities these people have but creating a welcome environment can sometime lead to real improvements. This is only one example  of how Journey Found has made a difference  in the life of a disabled person. It's exciting to see these improvements and the results of the programs we have made for the people we serve.

Gilead Community Services Inc	122841		/users/profile/167329	MM1219	Volunteer	5	09/22/2012	When I attended my first "Quizine for a Cause" 6+ years ago I got to meet some Gilead clients and hear their stories.  I realized that evening that helping this local agency helps a lot of people in my own community.  The services provided by Gilead allow the clients to have a more fulfilling and independent life.  I do some very simple tasks like giving a client a ride to the grocery store or taking her to my child's baseball game.  She is extremely grateful for these simple errands and a lot of fun to chat with at the ball games.  We all win.

Those two roles have given me the privilege of seeing Gilead from two perspectives--that of the recipient of their services, as well as seeing what goes into making that happen.  My son has received high quality care, tailored to his particular needs.  Gilead is an extremely well-run organization, with exceptional staff and has managed to continue to provide the gold standard of care despite a very challenging economic climate.  I volunteer myself, and have never worked with a finer group of people, or done more gratifying work.
Gilead Community Services Inc	122111		/users/profile/166260	jimprobo	Board Member	5	09/10/2012	Gileads mission is  to provide a broad range of high quality health care and recovery support services in the home and community to improve mental health, physical well being, independence, and community integration for the individuals we serve.The recent news regarding Jesse Jackson Jr's hospitalization and Patrick Kennedy's support for him has brought to light the need to stress the importance of Mental Health issues and to treat them as equally important to any health disease  cancer, heart condition, diabetes and as such should receive the same support and awareness with respect to funding and treatment.  Gilead has been a strong advocate and provider of a full range of treatment programs and services for those dealing with mental health issues, as well as to the families that have to live with these issues every day.  The needs are great, but only through understanding and support, such as the programs and education provided by Gilead can we help all who are facing these issues with support and compassion who otherwise would be unnoticed, misunderstood and unattended to.

Danbury Children First Inc	194934		/users/profile/254802	DMN68	General Member of the Public	4	02/27/2014	I respect Danbury Children First as a living example of how to bring authentic parent voice into public discussion and action on behalf of young children and education.  It is a hotbed of parent leadership development, and those parent leaders have influenced deeper investment in Danbury's children, including refurbishing recreational facilities, playgrounds and parks among many, many other achievements.  DCFI also works persistently, patiently and effectively to integrate parents better into education.I am proud to be a citizen of a state where groups like DCFI can flourish.
Danbury Children First Inc	194920		/users/profile/254773	Katherine24	Client Served	4	02/27/2014	My connection with Danbury Children First began in 2008, when I was a participant in the Parent Leadership Training Institute program that DCF coordinates locally.  This program is a civics initiative designed to inspire and empower parents to become effective advocates for children, which is exactly what it did for me.  I learned that I'm not "just a parent", but in fact a critical partner in systems that effect children, and an important voice in decision making for children's issues, both locally and in government.Because of Danbury Children First and the programs they run, parents like me are better engaged, better informed, and are more responsive to the needs of children and families so as to make real change happen.  I've now transitioned into the role of PLTI coordinator at Danbury Children First, and am happy to be able to give back to a program and organization that has given me so much already.  
Danbury Children First Inc	194910		/users/profile/254760	CarolineLafleur	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/27/2014	I began as a volunteer with this wonderful organization, and then became an employee. Danbury Children First works with parents of young children to help them understand the critical role they play in their children's education, and to empower those parents to participate in the civic and educational institutions in our City. Hundreds of parents have graduated from their parent leadership programs over the years, and those parents have gone on to change the lives of other families in the community. Because of the work of Danbury Children First, Danbury now has: more safe places for all children to play; more recreational programs for children with special needs; more parents who are active in local and state government and who understand how to engage in civic life; more parents who understand the value of early literacy and supporting education in the home; and more parents who are connected with the resources they need to raise their children. Danbury is a better place for families to raise children because of Danbury Children First!
Danbury Children First Inc	194886		/users/profile/254719	pkeckeisen	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/26/2014	Danbury Children First is the only parent-led organization in the area.  Danbury Children First values, honors and respects parents as partners.  The lives of children - at home, at school, and in the community - are improved, because Danbury Children First offers to parents training and opportunity to become involved and empowered as leaders and community partners. It is presently the only organization in Danbury that offers a variety of Parent Leadership initiatives and programs: The Parent Leadership Training Institute and The People Empowering People program.  Graduates from these programs hold leadership positions in neighborhoods, towns and cities, and at state levels.  Parents have advocated on behalf of children's programs, informed community and legislative leaders, and have positively impacted public policy. Graduates of The Parent Leadership Training Institute often describe it as "life changing".
Newtown Foundation Inc	281354		/users/profile/371397	Writer	Client Served	5	03/01/2016	My child was shot 4 months before the Sandy Hook tragedy. Like every survivor any lives lost to violence feels personal and I felt such immense sorrow, pain and anger. 26 innocent children and adults made my faith in humanity shatter and doubt the existence of God  ... to be lifted up by a group of strangers who held their hands to reach out to ours in Chicago.  Those strangers recognized that our pain was the same, that we also needed to be heard, to be comforted...to be acknowledged.  This is the only organization that works for ALL survivors regardless of background, creed, location, race or religion. Since 2013 they have provided the place for both victims and survivors to  be lifted  and honored in the capital of our nation. The pain will never go away until we meet our loved ones again, but the selfless acts of others have restored my belief that God did not abandon us, it was in the hearts of the people who founded this organization, they give us strength to pursue justice and fairness with dedication in the belief that common sense will one day prevail, and that we are all connected by our love of country and for the future our children.

They also bring educational programs to the community and provide an outlet for those who want to channel their grief into something positive and uplifting via the National Vigil for All Victims of Gun Violence. Unfortunately the community of those affected grows each year and this group has become a big family over the past three years, providing education, comfort and fellowship to all.

I work for an organization that fosters empathy through story exchanges and appreciate the fact that the NAA wants to work with people from all walks of life regardless of color, creed, socio-economic status, etc.  One way we can make our streets safer is to visit Washington DC each year and tell our stories to congress and the political leaders that have the power to enact and change laws.  NAA funds this annual vigil and invites individuals from all over the country to participate.  I am glad to be a part if this organization and their effort to better humanity.

Neighbor to Neighbor Inc	184847		/users/profile/241781	Mary Lou S.	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I have worked as a volunteer at Neighbor for 10 years or more.  I see how people who have trouble dressing their children are able to find good looking clothing for their family members in order that they will be able to go to school and fit in with their friends.  I have watched mothers come to the food bank and get healthy produce and canned goods that will feed their family members.  I see how Neighbor to Neighbor is reaching out to people in need who are living in an area of wealth all around them and trying tosurvive and make a better life for themselves and their children under difficult circumstances.  I feel that I can help this to happen by working as a volunteer in this nonprofit organization.

The volunteers include students, men and women of faith coming from their places of worship, and others who just wish to serve their town and take care of the poor. The impact of the organizations and individuals who are so generous in supporting the Food drives is remarkable to witness. Volunteering is a part of life, make it a part of yours.  I'm still there!!

Neighbor to Neighbor gives free clothing and food to people in need in Greenwich, Stamford and Port Chester.  What many people in this very affluent town don't realize, is that there are people in need so close to us.  We take things like food and clothing for granted.  Going to Neighbor to Neighbor, I feel so good knowing there is a place where those in need can come to find help.

Our customers receive clothing they can be proud of and food that is nutritious in an environment where they can take their time and select the items that best fit their tastes. I find it very rewarding to help these people who would be struggling much more without our services.
Connecticut Labrador Rescue Incorporated	82028		/users/profile/90004	Kristen D.	Client Served	5	03/12/2011	I met Merri, the owner of CT Lab Rescue in February 2008 shorty after I lost my rescue of 15 1/2 years to cancer. Merri is a true dog lover and understood my pain. I helped her by fostering a 6 year old Lab that had been separated from her brother and the family no longer cared for them. This hulking 90lb Lab would body snuggle me in bed and helped warm my broken heart. My parents ended up adopting her. I adopted a puppy rescue from Merri in March of that year. Unfortunately he passed away 22 weeks later from congenital heart failure. I was devastated. I went to visit Merri and hang out with all the numerous dogs at her home. This one little black Lab mix pup had been left behind and wormed her way into my heart. Merri knew it was what I needed to be whole again. My little girl actually had kennel cough and it turned into pneumonia. Merri let me call her with all my concerns and gave me valuable feed back. She even picked up medicine at the vet for me when I was unable to get there. My little girl is 3yrs next month and an amazing dog. I rescued again from a girl who mistreated her dog. Merri welcomed my new rescue, a husky pup, with open arms. She also let me bother her via email or phone with questions. I actually think she and Caesar Milan could have a show together, Dog Whisper (ers). Merri is a straight up honest individual who will tell you like it is. i admire her for her honesty and loyalty to what is best for the dogs. Merri is a busy woman with several dogs of her own. If you are interested in rescuing, take the time to fill out the application before you meet with her because if you don't, you are wasting her time that is better spent caring for numerous dogs and pups. Filling out an application gives her the information to see if you are a dedicated owner. Do not make an appointment and show up late or not at all and forget to cancel. Again you are wasting her time. If you are a dedicated dog owner you will understand that filling out an application, being on time and following through is also indicative of how you will be when caring for your dog. I highly recommend CT Lab Rescue  to find your life long canine companion. You can check out her web page and Facebook page for pictures and more information.

I would like to give this organization great praise for the dogs in their program.  I personally have worked with their director Merri on may occasion.She takes the rehab  and re-homing of dogs passionately. She makes sure she personally brings the dog to obedience training to see the dogs potential for learning and discover if it has any issues that I as a trainer may notice that could cause an adoption from not being permanent.This is highly beneficial to the potential adopter.  She also stands behind her animals and if issues crop up after the placement  she is willing to help defray the cost of more individualized sessions so the dog can be seen in it's home setting for a more thorough assessment.I wish more rescues would incorporate some basic training in their programs.   Merri has had many a success with this part of  her rescue efforts.   I as a trainer and an ACO feel that she is doing a great service to the dogs in her care.

Uja Federation of Greenwich	183217		/users/profile/240122	NancyHSZ	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I have been a volunteer for UJA Federation of Greenwich for many years, serving in many capacities from running an event to raising money and being president.  I think there are two primary purposes for the federation; the first is community-building.  The Federation acts as an umbrella organization for the Greenwich Jewish community, bringing together families who belong to various local Jewish organizations, as well as the unaffiliated.  The Federation initiated a virtual JCC recently, which presents outstanding programming, and has served to unite the disparate Jewish groups within Greenwich.    The community-building has also allowed the Federation successfully fundraise, its second purpose, to help those in need both locally and in Israel and overseas.

If you have orthopaedic surgery, you have P/T waiting for you nearly the moment you emerge from the operating room. If you have a heart issue, cardiac rehab is there to get you back on your feet. For people who go through cancer, there's next to nothing yet the after effects of the life saving treatments can be as brutal as they are necessary. ...after effects like neuropathy, exhaustion, depression, heart disease, weakness, risk of recurrence and secondary cancers ...the list goes on.  The good news is, exercise and nutrition are the keys to countering these after effects. That's what CT Challenge provides, along with the community-building and positive attitude that truly helps people reclaim their lives from all that cancer would try to take away. That's why I support this incredible organization.

The rider fee is definitely more than the rider cost, so all donations should go to the charities.  The ability of the CT Challenge to get donations to cancer survivors is worse that Pallotta Teamworks. 
Connecticut Burns Care Foundation Incorporated	122277		/users/profile/166512	ctsems	Board Member	5	09/13/2012	I have served on the Board of the Connecticut Burns Care Foundation for nearly thirty years. Our most visible project is our annual Burn Camp for Children but that is only part of the story. We have supported the Burn Unit at Bridgeport Hospital, conducted burn prevention education for children and adults and have enjoyed the support of hundreds of volunteers who annually donate thousands of their hours to serve the thousands of burn survivors, students, professionals, the wider community and their families throughout the years. To coordinate this effort we operate with only two paid staff members, an Executive Director and Secretary, without whom the Foundation would not operate.

The all volunteer board is one of the most sincere and committed organizations I have been affiliated with.  I have also seen first hand how very carefully the organization spends.  I have also seen first hand the results of the great work done at the Childrens' Burn Camp.  My daughter, is a burn survivor.  The opportunity for her to spend some time with other kids, and councilors who have gone through the same ordeal is truly priceless.  The concept is so simple, it is refreshing.  These kids have really had some pretty hard times, and the camp is such a wonderful place for them to get away from the hard times, and see that just because a bad thing happened to them, it does not mean they will have a bad life.
Connecticut Burns Care Foundation Incorporated	54842	2	/users/profile/56764	hajamax	Donor	1	10/19/2010	Our event contributed nearly 400,000 over 29 years.  Since new leadership took over about 5 years ago they have steadily reduced their net assets with a reduction of about 50% over the last 3 years.  Last year the ratio of salaries and office expenses to what they give to the camp was nearly 97% salary and office expense.  A great cause but awful management with no changes in sight.  We had to leave them.  The 990's over the last years explain the problem.

Cancer Survivors Who Can Charities, Inc	280594		/users/profile/370511	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2016	Jack of CT, it's time to get your facts straight.  Cancer Survivors who Can is still in a start-up mode, however, NO FUNDS have been funneled for fancy film equipment or to Atlantian Films as you accuse.  You need to speak to those who have benefited from this charity.  Talk to the people who have never had to go to a chemo appointment alone because Cancer survivors Who Can was at their side.  Talk to the people who needed some extra dollars for their medicine or even needed food, gas or toiletries; Cancer Survivors Who Can was there.  Talk to the people who didnt know which way to turn when they heard the words, you have cancer", Cancer Survivors Who Can found the resources for them.  Because Cancer Survivors Who Can is a new organization, there are admittedly some growing pains.  But look for some charter changes in the future.  There will be more fundraisers; there will be more people who are supported.  Yes, people who have wanted to leave a living testimony video of their life , they have been taught to use a camera, but only because they wanted to learn. Insofar as Brian is concerned, he is a cancer survivor himself, so perhaps he sees what others who have not experienced cancer do not.   I dont see Brian Specter profiting from anything involved with Cancer Survivors Who Can, except maybe his heart just keeps getting bigger and he wants to do more. BTW get your facts straight a film commission gave Atlantian Films 200 dollars to help their startup not Cancer Survivors Who Can. You are making up lies probably because you did not like the politics of the Farmington Valley Film Commission.Could it be you are the only one who voted against the film companies donation?  Ask the president Nancy Antsey as she too has been informed of this post and is also disgusted by you childish attacks against an organization that has nothing to do with The Famington Valley Film Commissions donation to a separate film company.  I say again, get your facts straight, or hit the road Jack! 
Cancer Survivors Who Can Charities, Inc	275674	2	/users/profile/365323	mguilbault	Volunteer	5	01/05/2016	I originally met Brian Spectre over 25 years ago. We became fast colleagues then parted ways.   In 2012 - 2013 my wife (a stage four cancer survivor) and I lived in Hilton Head Island, SC. We received a copy of a full page interview on Cancer Survivors Who Can from my wife's mother. After reading what this organization stands for. Then realizing that it was an old colleague, Brian Spectre who was the head of this group. I immediately contacted him because, like, all other volunteers and members, I too have been, extremely, effected by the debilitating consequences of cancer. My motivation is due to not wanting anyone else to go through what we have if at at all possible.Upon making a renewed connection with Brian, my wife and I made a decision to move back  to our home state of Connecticut, largely in part to be involved with Cancer Survivors Who Can. Upon moving back to CT in November of 2013. I have worked on several film shoots. Brian and I communicate, on average, at least once a week. Even if it's to, simply, check in on how everyone is doing. To this day, I will stand behind this organization because Brian's passion and commitment has proven to me that he's a rare breed that has been through several recurrences of Cancer. Yet, he still finds the energy to help who ever he can. Whoever Jack of CT is that wrote such a scathing depiction of this organization, must have a deep rooted complex of some sort? Brian is living proof of someone who truly cares that people who suffer from cancer have an opportunity to have access to a creative outlet. Over the past two years working with Brian and the other volunteers/members. I have seen what Brian does behind the scenes for people.  He has continually put the needs of others before him, even though he suffers every single day with, faulty, broken titanium rods in his body. Brian (and his wife) has been nothing but selfless. He does not ask for a penny for his efforts although the organization could use funding in the truest sense. And he truly deserves it! I mean, think about it... What is someone to do with their life after multiple surgeries, multiple recurrences of cancer. The days of going back to a "normal" job and lifestyle are over.Jack of CT, your portrayal of this organization is seriously skewed to depict us as self serving and it's all for Brian's ego? That statement,  couldn't be further from the truth. I'm not seeking to lash back at you at all. However, I will stand up and say, you have made unjustified statements based on my personal experience. Brian uses his own funds to perpetuate what ever he possibly can to ensure that his vision can one day come to fruition.  All the while, he does not stop in his pursuit to see this vision become reality.Brian has gone way above and beyond to help anyone in need. He's rare in that, he listens, intently to people. He then does his best to provide a format for anyone who can utilize his assistance. To me, it's a sign of a noble gesture, worthy of support and praise. I'd like to say again, my wife and I moved back to CT, largely to be a part of this organization. And I would move, again, across the country if I had  to to support this entity and it's cause. My wife and I have have been beaten and run over several times in our experiences with chronic illness. And when it felt like no one cared or could identify with what we go through, on a daily basis. Brian Spectre was there and still is to this day.On a closing note in response to Jack of CT's mention of Brian's, former, attorney Colleen Kerwick. I decided to take your advice and google her. I implore people to look her up. From my observation, she's a tenacious individual who also stands up for people's needs and right to live a peaceful life? In the meantime, she too has been attacked via the corrupt legal system that some try to pass off as justice. Since Jack of CT's review in 2013 you will find this footage has been published which is a classic example of Brian's intent to help however he can (note Colleen Kerwick is in the video, laying the foundation) https://youtu.be/M-kQ-ExToC0 . You won't see Brian in the video as he filmed, edited and produced it. All gratis...  And people might think this is not a worthy cause?? Just look at what some people go through. They need help! Yet there are people who don't care and actually look down their nose at people who care?  This needs to change.

I had recently retired and moved to Fairfield and was looking for someplace to focus my free time and energy.  I heard they were in need of gift cards from department stores for people who had lost everything in the storm.  When I dropped them off, I met the volunteer coordinator and offered to help in any way needed.  I started off in the food pantry, putting together Thanksgiving baskets, and saw very quickly how much Operation Hope did for the people in this area and how appreciative the clients were for this support.  Since then, I have volunteered at the front desk and various other fundraisers, and am constantly amazed at the dedication of the staff and counselors to their clients and the people who are in need of their services.  The counselors are there for people in their lowest times and there to celebrate their brightest achievements. Operation Hope is committed to providing a safe haven for those who need it, food for those who are hungry, and resources for those who are affected by life's setbacks.  I am proud to be associated as a volunteer with such a terrific organization.

Operation Hope of Fairfield Inc	86500	1	/users/profile/96853	Mary	Volunteer	5	04/20/2011	In 1986 it became clear that people, without homes, were facing a harsh life on our streets. A genteel lady; a brilliant, addicted veteran; a sturdy, but jobless youth; and many others.Town leaders, clergy and others opened eyes and hearts, and got to work. I am grateful to have been a part of that early time for Operation Hope, as a Volunteer Director, former Board member and now available for any call.The Operation Hope of today is the wide, effective embrace that supplies - Hope and security to the most vulnerable among us - food - shelter - affordable housing - job training - medical screening - learning life coping skills. OH is a strong, successful safety net for many. Only lack of funding keeps us from reaching further into the community.Our staff and leaders are uniquely qualified and successful in serving our clients With improved funding our shelter can reach out to the long waiting list of needy seeking Hope.The gains on every dollar received, in human terms? Immeasurable.
Operation Hope of Fairfield Inc	86470	1	/users/profile/96803	rtlnd	Board Member	5	04/20/2011	Operation Hope was born 25 years ago, in a simple effort to give a few homeless men a place to sleep on cold nights.  Since then, while the basic mission is unchanged, the reach of the organization has grown dramatically, to include not only a mens shelter, but one for women, families, a soup kitchen, and housing and training programs that seek to attack the causes, not just the symptoms, of people in need. Getting people back on their feet and working and having them NOT need the help is the goal. Operation Hope is a beacon of light in our community, both to those in need and to volunteers, students and others who find joy in participating in this worthy endeavor.  The staff of Operation Hope has boundless energy for work, assistance and ideas, while all eyes remain on the goal of ending the need to have this organization at all.

He was very active and I wanted another dog.  For some reason, the people there think they know what you need and asked me why I wanted a second dog.  They made me wait 20 minutes to see the binder book and then no dog was fit for me.  I got my second dog from Craigslist last summer and I couldn't be happier.

I tried to contact them for 2 weeks until I finally saw a car in the parking lot and banged on the door until someone opened it and talked to me.  I left a message, but didn't receive a call back for over a month.  By that time I didn't need their services anymore as I had to go somewhere else.  But what a phone conversation I had!  It turns out that although they have lots of volunteers, they only want to play with the animals.  None of the volunteers wants to actually do the work of running a business, such as answering the phone or staffing the office.  That is absolutely ridiculous, and speaks volumes about the management.  They desperately need a volunteer coordinator who will whip this group into shape.  If you don't have the funds to hire staff, then you use what you have, and if they don't want to be useful, they should go.  I've also heard the stories about them not wanting to release any of the animals, which is counter to their mission.  The goal is to rehome the animals, not keep them as a private petting zoo for the volunteers!  From what I've heard, these animals stay in cages for months, if not years, and are only let out for short periods when the volunteers are present.  That's animal cruelty, not kindness.

My family adopted a dog that is sweet as can be until he gets angry or territorial, after which he bites the closest person to him and has bitten my mother until she bleeds all over the floor. After a little less than a year of not being able to improve the behavior or find a solution, she confronted DAWS about the aggression, and they told her they never actually tested him because he was only there a few days and did not have time, and then lied about it to my mom and on the paper work. They refused to offer her any resources and said he's now her problem. We spoke with Bethel Animal Control who said many people have had problems with aggressive dogs from this organization and they cannot help them if they are known to bite. When it comes to people and animal safety, DAWS does not do their do diligence and puts the public at risk. They either need a leadership change or need to consider why they are in the adoption business - to just re-home any animal they get or to create safe homes for their animals and adopters. I would never recommend or  adopt from DAWS again.

Very low rate of failed adoptions, because client matches are well done. Dedicated volunteers, many who live on site while a specific animal is in need. Among my most rewarding volunteer experience.

Landmark Community Theatre	239734		/users/profile/325649	David289	Volunteer	5	03/24/2015	A hidden gem in Litchfield County, CT,   Landmark puts on professional quality productions with casts and crews comprised of some the region's best talent.  I have appeared in a few myself, done sets for several others, and was always delighted to hear audience members pleasantly surprised to find the productions were "just like a real show" and not the slapdash affairs that the words "community theatre" conjures in the imagination.   The lion's share of the credit belongs to the staff & volunteer coordinations, who make every effort to welcome newcomers and to build the "community" part of community theatre.  Their efforts make people want to come back, to be a part of next show in some way and keep the tradition alive. The sound & technical crews do amazing work in bringing the stage alive.   A dedicated troupe of costume designers put in hours to make everything perfect. And a host of local artists and carpenters construct wonderful sets & scenery.    All of this takes place until careful eye of experienced local directors and stage managers. Their combined effect is what give the shows such tremendous polish and allows the performances to shine.  It is truly a team effort, and greatly satisfying to play any role in the process.  The Thomaston Opera House itself is a charming classic small-town theater being carefully restored to its earlier glory.  It's an intimate environment to see a play, as even the last seat has a good view of action.  
Landmark Community Theatre	239585		/users/profile/325445	ksantovasi	Client Served	5	03/21/2015	The Landmark Theatre is located in Thomaston, CT and is a home away from home for my family. When you first pull up to the theatre you are amazed by the towers that beckon you to come in side. My son and I had our stage acting debut in the show Miracle on 34th Street and was welcomed with open arms by the theatre. Since our first experience we have also appeared in a Christmas Carol together and my son recently acted in Winnie the Pooh. We attend all performances to support fellow cast members either as a patron or volunteering as an usher.  LLC is more then just a theatre with four walls. It is our extended family. We look forward to our next adventure at the Landmark Theatre either as an actor on stage, attending a show in the audience, or helping out behind the scenes. 
Landmark Community Theatre	239507		/users/profile/325345	LordAmhrst	Volunteer	5	03/20/2015	 The Thomaston Opera House is a 19th Century jewel in the Naugatuck River town of Thomaston, once a vital thriving center of industry, specifically for the Seth Thomas clock factory.  Situated on Route # 8, a few minutes north of Waterbury, Connecticut, the town is alive with community spirit, perhaps most visibly reflected in its festival of lights at Christmas.  That spirit is what drove the local community to form the Landmark Community Theater, when a previous production company foundered financially a few years ago, leaving the Opera House without a viable tenant.  The energy of the new group is palpable. It has been a "rise from the ashes" affair. The Board of Trustees oversees the mounting of a half-dozen productions a year, predictably a number of musicals, but also producing some lesser known "straight plays" as well.  In addition, a small "lab theater" on the ground floor is the setting for a number of lesser known plays, serving as a dramatic laboratory.  All this requires a large commitment on the part of the Board and a great many members of the theater community, which reaches well past the borders of Thomaston. I've been part of two productions in the past two years: Miracle on 34th Street and A Christmas Carol.  I'm looking forward to participation in more productions in the future. I have often said that there is probably no single enterprise as inefficient as the mounting of a play:  the number of man-hours ("person-hours?") required to choose a suitable script, audition actors, design and create sets, lighting, props and costumes and to rehearse and publicize a particular production are immense.  In anything but a coherent group of committed people, enthusiastically  engaged in the pursuit of excellence of a unified whole, the result will be less than satisfactory.  Landmark Community Theater has aimed high, and succeeded admirably.  The shows they have produced that I have been in or seen from the audience have been high-quality productions, rising above the oft-time condescending term "community theater" and embodying a joyous dramatic spirit.

The entire cast and crew were amazing to work with and made her debut experience with live theatre truly memorable.  She is a professional actor (though only a child) and she has been in on-camera productions in New York with top-notch production companies: the experience at LCC was nothing short of that.  Even better, the classic beauty of the Opera House and the community spirit and camaraderie enhanced every moment.  We WILL be back for more -- both on, behind, and in front of the stage!  
Everybody Wins Connecticut Inc	53274		/users/profile/54357	bev2	Volunteer	5	09/24/2010	Once a week during the school year, I leave the ringing phones, e-mails, and demands at my desk and travel to a local school where I meet up with my reading partner for about 45 minutes during his lunch.  He is a very bright young man, but in the beginning, he wasn't a great reader.  When we started, I read to him, but over time and with encouragement, he started to read aloud to me.  So the simple act of reading with this child has improved his reading level, given him greater confidence to participate in the classroom because he's engaged and thereby improves his classroom behavior.  This time we spend together is the highlight of my week!  Here are some startling statistics - if a child isn't reading at their grade level by 3rd Grade, we will most likely not see that child graduate from high school.  There are some states that predict their prison populations by 3rd grade reading abilities!

There was a large number of students and readers and EBW did a great job of keeping everyone on track.  I was also impressed how EBW adapted to our needs to make the process of getting in to the school and splitting the groups to make the sessions more productive.  The kids were great and really not only enjoyed our coming every week by I believe benefitted from the program.
Everybody Wins Connecticut Inc	52454		/users/profile/53373	mystyavalon	Volunteer	4	09/15/2010	When Everybody Wins! requested volunteers at the company where I work, I signed up.  I passionately believe that without the ability to read, and enjoy reading, one cannot fully develop or function in society.  That was more than 10 years ago, and I continue to volunteer with this wonderful organization.  I have worked with many students over the years, and have seen them mature through grade school.  The ultimate outcome is not always positive, but the time I spend with my student is rewarding and entertaining for both of us.  If my enthusiasm for reading is contagious, my students will learn about the enormous opportunities that books offer.  Their world will open up and they will find knowledge, an escape, new ideas or get insight into how others live around the world.  EW makes this volunteer opportunity convenient--they provide the transportation for my one lunch hour per week session.  Everybody Wins! is a practical yet optimistic organization, and I believe we are making a difference in the lives of our students.
Distressed Children & Infants International	191072		/users/profile/249427	Fabliha	Volunteer	5	12/17/2013	I volunteered for DCI in the summer of 2011 in Dhaka, Bangladesh. There, I had the opportunity to meet and teach basic English to the wonderful little girls who live in DCI's Sun Child Homes Orphanage. My experience working with them and other volunteers was rewarding, challenging, and ultimately, very humbling. Beyond interacting with the girls, I was also able to take a tour of DCI's free clinic in the Muhammadpor slum, and learn about the positive impact its operations are having on the community. Now, back in the states, I have the privilege of continuing to volunteer for DCI remotely, and contribute to its programs through various research projects. Not only is DCI great in its mission to serve the underprivileged; it is also great in its volunteer program, which truly allows you to do meaningful work, whether it is on-site or half way across the globe.
Distressed Children & Infants International	111977		/users/profile/152378	Dr. Questad	Volunteer	5	05/13/2012	I will be spending my second summer in Dhaka volunteering at an orphanage funded and managed by DCI.  The entire program has quality throughout.  The orphanage is located in the slum but safely ensconced on the top (6th) floor of an apartment building.  The little girls attend school 11 months a year and have a home tutor.  They receive dance lessons, their form of PE, and instruction in Islam from paid teachers who come to the orphanage.  The children are governed by Rojina Akter, a college graduate in economics who lives with them.  She sets up a healthy 4-meal-a-day nutrition system and involves the girls in a system of helping out with orphanage maintenance.  When there I live at this very clean, well-run orphanage where the children are delightfully happy.

Mercy Learning Center of Bridgeport, Inc.	273416		/users/profile/362639	dbmlc	Volunteer	5	12/01/2015	Mercy Learning Center is a very special place. You can just feel the positive energy when you walk through the doors here.I began volunteering at Mercy upon my retirement a little over a year ago. I had been aware of the good works of this organization for many years and knew that I would one day end up here.  What I didnt know was how incredibly uplifting and gratifying the volunteer experience would be. I have the opportunity to observe the respectful collaboration among staff, teachers, tutors and students on a regular basis, and I am continually amazed by the life-changing experiences that happen daily. Seeing so many amazing women work so hard to become educated, gain self-respect and conquer difficult challenges is truly humbling.    Every single person at Mercy Learning Center is doing something significant and I am honored to be associated with this truly remarkable organization.
Mercy Learning Center of Bridgeport, Inc.	143848	1	/users/profile/190335	Michele37	Volunteer	5	11/28/2012	I have been tutoring at Mercy for 8 years. Each of my students has come from a different background with different complications in their lives. Each has found themselves, later in life, serious about getting the education that they found unnecessary earlier.  They came back with a renewed, mature and unwavering desire to learn.  Sometimes they have had to overcome incredible obstacles just to come to class.  At times I have seen an almost physical transformation with my students.  They gain confidence, stand straighter, look you in the eye, and raise their life objectives.  It is amazing and gratifying to be able to be a part of this process.   I have also served on the board of Mercy for 6 years and have held positions as Treasurer and Chair of the Finance and Audit Committees.  My background is in corporate finance and I know how a good organization should be run.  I can tell you that Mercy is incredibly well run, organized, financially sound, thoughtful and caring.  I have every reason to believe Mercy will be around for the next 100 years, doing everything they can do to reduce the need for the long lines that they experience on registration day every fall.  
Mercy Learning Center of Bridgeport, Inc.	140215		/users/profile/186384	Bethbond	Volunteer	5	11/15/2012	I have been involved with Mercy Learning Center for the last nine years, first and ongoing as a tutor, and then additionally as a Board member, treasurer and committee member. In these varied capacities I feel I have gotten to know very well the organization, its leadership and its work.  As a tutor I meet twice a week with a student, teachering her English, math and writing. This is the most rewarding volunteer work I have ever been engaged it. It's very gratifying to help someone one on one and to see my student advance. And it's very inspirational to get to know the students who are working so very hard to improve their and their families lives, coming to school while juggling jobs and family responsibilities.  The organization is stellar, very well run with a hardworking and compassionate staff dedicated to the mission of educating and empowering women. They treat each woman with respect and offer the students a welcoming, safe place to learn. As the former treasurer I know that Mercy is very well run financially. Expenditures are well thought out, planned for and controlled. This year Mercy is undertaking some long-planned and much needed expansion of its building so that it can serve even more students. 
Serious Fun Children's Network	10417	2	/users/profile/12298	toni the tiger	Volunteer	5	09/16/2009	As a mom and a kids book writer, I have volunteered for lots of non-profits over the years. None of my volunteering experiences have had such a powerful effect on me as Hole in the Wall Camps. I have volunteered as a Family Pal at Family weekends for kids with sickle cell and hemophilia; I volunteered at a special events gala and had the thrill of seeing Paul Newman dress up as Little Orphan Annie, but perhaps my most profound experience was when I volunteered at one of their Hospital Outreach programs  in Orlando, Florida.My first impression of the program was, hey this isnt that much different from volunteer work I did at the Audubon Society. I read a book; we worked with the kids on an art project and created puppets for a Puppet Show. What immediately struck me however, was not only the positive, contagious energy of the staff, but the way they treated the kids with such, respect, love, and caring. Some of the kids were dragging IV Poles with them, some wore scarves around their heads, doctors and nurses came in frequently to poke or prick them, but the Hole in the Wall staff was on a mission  a mission to have fun, and to put on the wackiest puppet show in the history of the Florida Childrens Hospital.As not all children had the energy to get out of bed and join us in the program room, I took the art project to the bedside of Diego, a frail boy who looked to be about nine or ten. Diego was surrounded by toys his grandfather had recently brought him- Transformers, Nintendo games, comic books- how was I supposed to compete with this armed only with a box of crayons and a paper bag?  I was surprised when Diego pushed aside the Transformers and began drawing on the paper bag.  His owl was almost complete when a nurse arrived, announcing it was time for his treatment. A few hours later, staff kids and volunteers were ready to perform the puppet show extravaganza of the century! The Hole in the Wall staff asked if Diego was coming, but his parents and nurses doubted it. They had tried for days to get him out of bed, but he had no interest, his counts were down, they didnt think he would have the energy. Then a trumpet (actually a kazoo) sounded, announcing the start of the show. I heard a noise and turned around- there was Diego walking into the room, puppet proudly held in his hand. Not being one to normally quote commercials but. Cost of ticket to Orlando $350, cost of lunch in hospital cafeteria $6.75, watching the smile spread over Diegos face at the end of the show??? Priceless!!Thank you Association of Hole in the Wall Camps for being the Transformer in so many lives.
Serious Fun Children's Network	9425	1	/users/profile/11234	SusanO	Volunteer	5	08/21/2009	I have been volunteering at two of the Hole in the Wall Gang Camps for the last fourteen years.  Ive done just about every volunteer job there is: cabin counselor, family pal, parent group facilitator, lifeguard, work-camp leader, musician, fundraising helper.  Ive even run lights for stage night, run the camp store, chopped firewood and washed dishes!  Suffice it to say, Im committed. I think every kid needs a week at camp.  Every kid needs a place that is a bit wild and unfettered. Every kid needs to be allowed to sing at the top of his lungs at the dinner table, get her clothes really messy, paddle a boat, ride a horse, build a birdhouse.  Kids need these momentspregnant with promise, fortified with sun and campfire smoke and bug spray and glitter.  Theyre sort of a fertilizermakes em grow.  Kids living with chronic and life threatening illnesses need this every bit as much as kids without a diagnosis do.  Perhaps more.  The Hole in the Wall Gang camps give kids that bit of wildnessthat opportunity to live loudly & exuberantlyall while quietly tending to their medical needs.  In one of my first summers at camp, I was helping a boy with horseback riding.  He was 9 or 10, but tiny. As the staff members lifted him off the horse, things fell out of his pockets.  I helped him gather his belongings up, while the staff kept us both far from the horses hind legs.  There was a small wooden star from the woodshop, an acorn, a rubber piece of bait, and a small piece of hay.  These arent toys, he said.  As we walked out of the arena, he explained, I take a remembering box to the hospital with me. I want to put camp in there, too. I think about that kid a lot, and his pocket of memorabilia, which is really just a pocket full of normal.  I think thats what camp is about: giving kids living with a medical diagnosis a big pocketful of normal to make it through the year ahead.
Serious Fun Children's Network	9036	1	/users/profile/10826	camper	Client Served	5	08/12/2009	I cannot speak highly enough about my experience at The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp. As a child with a serious medical condition, "normal" is something you don't get to experience. But at camp, the fact that every kid has an illness makes it normal. The "sick kid" identity most of us are forced to wear in the world becomes null and void, and we get to be just ourselves. Only better, because at camp you can do things you never thought possible, make friends who completely understand you, and be the best version of yourself. I have spent time there each year for 7 years, and every single time I go, I do something I have never done before. From riding a horse, to riding a hot air balloon, reciting a poem on stage, sleeping under the stars, leading a camper on a horse as an LIT, to climbing a 40 foot tower (in the dark once even!). All these incredible opportunities would be nothing without the people, however. The staff are some of the most enthusiastic, warm, funny, loving people you could ever hope to meet. From the nurses, some of the nicest anywhere, who comforted me when I felt sick, to counselors who encouraged me to climb that tower, who high-fived me when I caught a fish. The energy and love of the place are downright inspiring, and I wish there were words for what it feels like to be there. Over and over I hear folks who go to camp who say there is no other word but magic, but I don't know if that even begins to describe it. I look forward to camp all year, and there are thousands of kids around the country and around the world who do the same.
Clearwater Initiative	166753		/users/profile/221524	ianmoise	Advisor	5	09/02/2013	Clearwater is a great project that has really grown from an idea into an effective organization that serves the needs of rural communities in Uganda. I have personally visited many of the areas Clearwater works in and the needs, after many years of conflict, are immense.   
Clearwater Initiative	159082		/users/profile/211197	briandusza	Donor	4	05/30/2013	The origin of Clearwater Initiative is well know.  Ben was a friend and the type of person that you would follow anywhere.  He was a very impressive guy who led by example and by setting out a clear mission.  Clearwater is his legacy and an organization I feel great about supporting.  The impact on the ground of providing clean water to those in rural Uganda is tremendous.  As a development worker, I have been to rural sites in Latin America, Asia and Africa and even lived in some of those villages where I had to carry my own water from river for hundreds of yards on a mountain path so I could cook some rice.  Imagine doing that everyday for all your whole life?  For villagers, it is usually the children who have to carry water, often missing school so their family can drink and cook and clean.  Clean, safe, accessible water is an essential basic service that American's take for granted, but is absent for 100's of millions of people.  Under Ben's guidance, Clearwater is doing something about that.  I have great confidence that Clearwater management is fulfilling's Ben's mission and managing my donations effectively. 
Clearwater Initiative	110756		/users/profile/150759	Jim_14	Donor	4	04/25/2012	This is an organization that simply provides clean water to the most needful citizens in Uganda.

Community Foundation of Greater New Britain	183709		/users/profile/240621	Jim105	Donor	5	10/28/2013	When an old and trusted family friend learned that I wanted to give back to the residents of New Britain in the form of financial aid, she suggested I consider the Community Foundation of Greater New Britain (CFGNB).  I took her advice and was very impressed with the people I talked to and the programs the organization is involved in.  I first talked to the Director of Development, Ann Bova.  We had several conversations discussing the CFGNBs programs, my goals, and how best to integrate the two.  I could not have asked for a better first-contact person to talk to. Next, I wanted to be sure I understood the numbers in the 2012 IRS form 990 so Ann put me in touch with the Vice President of Operations, Robert Trojanowski.  Bob spent a couple of hours educating me on what I was reading in the 990 since I do not have an accounting or finance degree.  He was knowledgable and had the patience of a saint -- another credit to the organization. Lastly, I wanted to talk to the President, James Williamson.  I was impressed with Jims passion for doing good---and the work that is actually being done to fulfill the CFGNBs mission.  Jim, like Ann and Bob, willingly spent whatever time was necessary for me to feel comfortable with the organization.   After talking to Ann, Bob, and Jim, I know I made the right decision in selecting the CFGNB to manage my money when the time comes to dissolve my Trust.

American Chamber Orchestra	89090		/users/profile/30025	highseas2	General Member of the Public	5	05/24/2011	The American Chamber Orchestra continues to bring top quality music to Fairfield County.  One arts council recently rated the ACO as one of the top five orchestras in the county.
American Chamber Orchestra	28981	11	/users/profile/30025	highseas2	Client Served	5	02/18/2010	I had the pleasure of hearing the American Chamber Orchestra in concert on February 6, 2010.  This was an ambitious and highly rewarding program featuring Leslie C. Smith performing the Josef Rheinberger Organ Concerto #1 in F Major, Bedrich Smetanas the Moldau from Ma Vlast and the Schumann Symphony #1, the Spring Symphony.Throughout the evening, this rich romantic music sparkled and sang as conductor Christopher James Hisey and the musicians rose to the occasion.   The Rheinberger was a highlight of the evening with orchestra and organ interplay truly beautiful.  The andante movement was especially gorgeous and transported the audience.The spring symphony is always a treat and was a welcome reminder of the season to come on a dark and cold February night.This is a fine organization and is a real treasure to have based here in Fairfield County.
American Chamber Orchestra	28920	7	/users/profile/29965	rmwhitt	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2010	I had the privilege of attending an American Chamber Orchestra performance in October 2009 that featured  Dorothy Kolinsky perform, as a soloist, Piano Concerto in A minor by Robert Schumann. What a memorable event it was for my sister and me! The experience was unparalled--wonderful music played by a superlative pianist-- with an added bonus that it was held close to home (rather than in NYC, where we must typically go for a'dose' of arts and culture), in a comfortable environment where the music resonated.  Dorothy's stellar performance was moving and uplifting in equal parts. Bringing fine performances close to home and making them accessible to the local community is an important and vital function that The American Chamber Orchestra has brought to Fairfield County.

Wells Valley Cat Sanctuary	257458	4	/users/profile/345879	ctyankee	Client Served	1	09/15/2015	Our application had been approved before we went to look. One of the volunteers was pushing a kitten on us that needed to be worked with based on the information that my dog was a difficult dog that I worked with. I had the dog before I got married and had children. The kitten would not have been a good fit with my children. We looked at other cats and took home two orange tabby's. One was wonderful and full of love, the other became highly aggressive immediately when we brought him home. My 2 year old was down for a nap and my 3 year old son was in the living room when we let the cats out of the carriers. My son never left the living room so he did not traumatize the one cat like this organization is claiming. They were 1 year old males who supposedly grew up together. They were neutered the day before we took them home. The one male kept hissing at the other and us. The sanctuary claimed they were bonded. I saw no love lost between these two cats. All night while we were sleeping the one cat kept jumping on and off the bed hissing at us. The one cat attacked me once, then again when I was petting the other cat; he then attacked me again while carrying my son to his bedroom. I called the sanctuary the that same day and was told to bring the one cat in. When I got there I was told about an email asking to bring the other cat back but the person told me I could ignore the email and keep the other cat. Then I received an email asking for me to bring the other cat back. THEY WOULD NOT LET US ADOPT ANOTHER CAT.  PERSONALLY I THINK IT WAS OUT OF SPITE THEY WOULDN'T LET US KEEP THE WONDERFUL CAT BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T CONSIDER THE KITTEN. We at least got our check back and I am left with a puncture wound from the mean cat. By the way I have had cats most of my life. So I am not an inexperienced cat owner!

Mary Wade Home	67539	1	/users/profile/73820	nealy	Client Served	5	02/13/2011	My mother, who had Alzheimers, was a resident of the skilled nursing area of the Mary Wade Home from September of 2005 until her death in August of 2009.  The staff at the Mary Wade Home was great from the beginning.  There was a sense that they enjoyed the residents.  I felt that the staff really enjoyed my mother and that she was well taken care of.  When my mothers sister came to visit from Chicago with her husband, they noticed how the place felt.  The good care was in the atmosphere and in the way visitors were welcomed.  There was also a sense that the staff was well taken care of, which had a ripple effect.  Another aspect of the Mary Wade Home is the beautiful garden.  My mother enjoyed many hours in the garden area.  When it was time to bring in hospice, the nurse suggested it and we were fortunate to be able to have hospice care brought in so she did not have to be moved.  The staff was very accommodating to us at the end.  I was able to spend the last night in an empty room across the hall and my mothers roommate was temporarily moved out of the room to give us privacy.  My brother, husband, my Moms long time private aid and I were with her at the end.  We had decided to celebrate her life and toast her with her favorite cocktail.  We did so and as soon as  we were finished, she left peacefully.  I feel fortunate that my Mom was able to spend her last years at the Mary Wade Home.  Nealy Zimmermann
Mary Wade Home	63058		/users/profile/68940	Linn B.	Client Served	5	02/03/2011	I am always telling people that the Mary Wade Home is the best! My dad (Russell M. Smith) was there for the last 13 months of his life. He passed away October 6, 2008. My dad was admitted there with dementia, and one of us "kids" were there every day. I  usually stopped in there 6 days a week. I had stopped in at all different times, from 6:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and each time, every one of the staff members treated each and every resident as if the resident were part of their own family. From the Administrator to the office staff to the nursing staff, dietary, housekeeping and maintenance staff all displayed the utmost respect for the residents. The  other thing I always tell people is that if I ever need long term skilled care, I hope I can get into Mary Wade.One of the nurses there (Charise) once told me "We're (Mary Wade staff) not their real children, but they're like our own family and when we lose one, we hurt too". My dad loved it at Mary Wade too. On one of my dad's trips to the hospital ER (he was unresponsive), when he was feeling a bit better, and we had to choose to have him admitted or sent back to Mary Wade; my sister and I asked him "Dad, do you want to stay here a few days or go back to Mary Wade"? My dad replied "I want to go HOME to Mary Wade". That's how much like home it seemed to him. On his last trip to the hospital ER, he was declining, and again we had to make a choice. We had no doubts that the best choice was to let him go back to Mary Wade. We then were given the option to transfer him to the local Hospice. We said no. We wanted him to spend his last days in the presence of the people who had so lovingly cared for him.As my dad declined, Mary Wade provided him with a special quilt to cover him, a floor lamp was brought in near his bed, to shield him from the sometimes harsh overhead lighting, and there at his bedside was a CD player, playing soothing music ever so softly. A special quilt square was hung outside his door. This was to let staff know he was in the dying process, so they would know to say their own "goodbye". We received the call in the wee hours of the morning that it was time to come, and had our last moments with him. I found out the next day, that after we left, one of the maintenance staff had gone in after we left, to say a prayer over our father. THAT is a prime example of all the staff there, caring - even when the family is not present.In my fathers obituary, we made mention to thank "his other family, the staff of The Mary Wade Home" who took such excellent care of him. We later planted a Lilac tree in the courtyard garden that my father so enjoyed, and celebrated his life with a Thank you cake for the staff. I will continue to recommend the Mary Wade Home to anyone who is seeking the utmost in excellence of care for their loved ones. Respectfully submitted, Linn Bodle
Mary Wade Home	62519		/users/profile/68337	Thomas Pruzinsky	Client Served	5	02/02/2011	My family and I will be forever grateful for the care the magnificent staff of the Mary Wade Home provided for my beloved father (Joseph Pruzinsky) who was a resident there from March of 2009 to January of 2010.   When admitted to the Mary Wade Home my father was suffering from dementia as well as multiple medical problems, including a broken hip.  Though my family and I had extensive experience with dear relatives being in nursing homes in the area, we were not familiar with the Mary Wade Home when we arrived there.  I now consider our time at the Mary Wade Home to be one of the greatest gifts we have ever received in our life.  Our family was treated with the greatest kindness, compassion, and professionalism at every step of the way.  The admission process, which can be stressful, was made particularly easy by Roseane, who showed us a profound level of thoughtfulness that set the stage for our entire stay there.  On the day that my father died, we were blessed to be reminded of the deep and personal commitment that the staff of the Mary Wade Home make to their residents; they too experienced the sadness of his death.  In between my dads admission and his departure from Mary Wade he and our family experienced the highest possible quality of care and professionalism from nurses, doctors, physical therapists, recreational staff, maintenance and kitchen staff and, most profoundly, the certified nursing assistants.  It is hard to express in words the depth of our gratitude for all of these individuals.    One of my family members or I visited my father most every day that he was a resident at the Mary Wade Home. Depending on our work schedule, we would visit at different times of the day; that is, on some days we would visit in the morning and on other days we would visit in the afternoon or evening.  I mention this because we were always struck by the fact that whenever we were there that the staff was friendly, professional, and very clearly doing the best they could to take care of my father as well as the other residents.   It was impressive how professional the staff was and it was deeply moving how thoughtful they were and how they created a loving, relaxed, clean, and safe environment.   Despite the sadness of seeing my father decline, I nevertheless remember with great affection how the staff was so skilled at using humor and playfulness in just the right way at just the right moment.  It is important to me to stress that my family and I believe that our experience at the Mary Wade Home is also the experience of the other residents and families as well.  We cannot, of course, speak for any other family.  However, we do know that we witnessed, every time we were there, the same professionalism and compassion being offered to all other residents and families.    Over the past year I have said to many people that I believe  there is something very special about the Mary Wade Home and I am forever grateful for them being there to help us in the time of our greatest need.  We have offered many prayers of gratitude and we will continue to do so for the rest of our days. 
Pencils of Promise Incorporated	234413		/users/profile/298697	Jd T.	Donor	5	11/24/2014	I had the chance to visit one of POP's locations in Laos and visit a few of the schools they had built there. It was incredible how they were able to get the entire local community involved building these school houses. A lot of the labor form the local villagers was donated as well. The previous "school house" was actually open-air held underneath the stilts of one of the village huts, so this village was definitely due for an upgrade.  I was also able to witness/take part in a training session set up for local teachers. I love how they are empowering locals to improve the education of their own towns/villages/countries. It is teaching people how to fish instead of giving them a fish, the highest form of charity/service that I can think of.  Pencils of Promise is doing great things and their staff are as good as it gets. I couldn't recommend this organization any higher.

Several of our top donors were able to visit one of the schools in Laos and the were blown away by the sophistication and rigor of the in-country operations.  PoP is an organization that puts impact first - and the team from MIT feels confident that our donated dollars have been leveraged to create maximum positive impact in the lives of the students, community, in-country staff, and young professionals who carry out the mission.

Whether it's sitting with a patient so their caregiver gets a break, or simply tranporting equipment to patients' homes, the Center for Hospice Care Southeastern Connecticut is a group I'm very proud to volunteer for.  Our training is second to none and the staff especially qualified and helpful.  I came to realize that it is an HONOR to be with these terminally ill patients, and an HONOR to interact with their families facing an utlimate grief.  The mission and practice of easing the lives of these people is not just charitable, it is unique. My parents both passed away at Hospice facilities in a different state.  I am determined to continue volunteering and to help this particular agency achieve the reality of a Hospice residence in our area of southeastern Connecticut.             
Center for Hospice Care Southeast Connecticut	149473	1	/users/profile/199236	Robin59	Client Served	5	02/15/2013	Being a parent of her first born diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia was hard but what took our family down was the diagnosis of being out of remission and never being able to fight the cancer.  Hospice came to us as our 12 year old son, Ethan was near the end of the battle.  We as parents who had never experienced anything like this were so very lost with what decissions to make and all too proud to allow others in our home.  We felt like no other person could care for our child like we could and being that he spend most of his life in hospitals...I forgot to mention that he also had cerebral palsy and also had other issues with seizures.  Hospice Of SE CT came in and helped us.  The gave us the information we needed, they assisted with every day needs so I could spend the final time with my son.  Hospice's staff knew we were fragile and helped us gain the strength to move forward.  We ultimately decided to keep Ethan at home to live his last days with us.  We also had days that he felt well enought to attend school, Hospice SE CT went into his school and worked with the staff in the elementary school to answer all of their questions and help them through this hard time..Ethan passed in 1997, 4 months after his not being able to go into remission.  For those four months Hospice was our family and our rock.  We could not have been as strong as we were if it were not for them.  I now support Hospice of SE CT with all that I can.  I feel honored to see them be able to grow into a Center for Hospice Care.  I consider myself an advocate for Hospice Care.When Ethan passed I remember at that moment looking at my husband and tearfully saying - "this is how I want to leave this earth, with the people I love around me"  Hospice made that happen for us.

They were moving into an apartment, and the funding for their security deposit was eliminated during their move.  As their housing coordinator, I called Extended Families of Connecticut, and the staff was very willing to help out this needy family.       Since the family was helped by Extended Family, the parents and the baby have successfully been housed in an apartment and continue to pay their rent.  Extended Family was a life-saver in this desperate situation.  They were resourceful, compassionate, and a great liason for our agency.  We greatly appreciated their generosity!

Both experiences have been enriching and inspiring.  My students have exchanged art with students in Cyprus, Sri Lanka, and Uganda.  I also co-taught a class with visiting teachers from Latvia. I think that visual art is a wonderful way to find a common language between these young people around the world.  When the children review the work they receive, they are more likely to be struck by the similarities than the differences with their partners around the globe.

It serves the local residents, but also attracts people from all around.  Its book collection is nothing like a University Library, but through it you can access books from other libraries throughout the State.  It is over 100 years old, and traces its origins to one of New England's many late 18th century reading clubs. Unlike the library at the regional school, there is only one reason to come here: enjoyment!

Schooner Inc	142580		/users/profile/189065	ksea	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/26/2012	My child participated in this program during the 2012 Summer Season.  The camp staff was well-trained, responsive, and very excited about the program.  Each morning, my daughter was pushing me to get her out the door to get to camp and each car-ride home was filled with her discoveries about hermit crabs, saltmarshes, and sailboats.  She is excited to move on to the next camp this summer - we are excited to have an academic camp to send her to where she is truly among friends.  As a Marine Scientist by trade, it was amazing to see Marine Biology undergraduates teach so much to my child - even though she has spent her life on the water!  
Schooner Inc	119501		/users/profile/162489	dab2036	Client Served	1	07/30/2012	My child participated in the summer camp 2012.  There were counselors that seemed to be better trained than others but those who were not left harmful marks.  In  my opinion and from what I observed, children at this camp should never be left to be supervised with those that do not have appropriate criteria for understanding child development.  A director should also be responsible in protecting the growth and health of a child first.  Approaches seemed to have shown proof of control behavior before expertise of children, ganging up on thoughts about children from those not well qualified, and leaving children without the proper guidance for healthy development.  The director in charge of the sailing portion does not seem to bring to Schooner an education involving child development and his lack of skill has proven to be painful to those very young.  This should be taken seriously.  it is my understanding that children were eating in high alert  humidity and hot deck floors because there was not enough room to eat anywhere else.  I was told that children were told to let a counselor know if they felt hot.  Again, staff needs to be trained about what is needed to allow children to be safe.

When I got hooked on Crack Cocaine I lost my $75,000 a year marketing job in Manhattan. I burnt my $260,000 home in Massapequa Long Island  to the ground when I threw my crack ashtray away. I went to cop more drugs in Brooklyn and while I was away my house was burning. I spent $100,000 in one year on crack. I was homeless and broke. I was arrested and inprisoned for armed robberypossession of narcotics and stealing boats. I was sent to Niantic Ct  women's prison. When I finally was released in 1996 I was sent to CMHA Transitional living center. I had relapses while in first couple years of program. The support and extremely caring therapist (Victor Incerti) visited me in hospital and told me he didn't want me to die. My parents were drunks so not much support there. From that day forward I have been clean and sober. I have a successful dog grooming, training and boarding business. I still have a very debilatating depression issue. Dr. Chaplin has been saving my life for 19 years. She is always available to me when I get suicidal. My Yorkie was killed by a car and Victor, Linda Fillipetti, and Dr Chaplin kept me from spiraling down the black hole of depression.  My parents both died in 2015 and I am so depressed, lost and lonely now. I probably would be dead or gone to Crystal Meth to drown my sorrow. Dr. Chaplin helps me cope with my desperation . CMHA is a divine intervention for me. I have been in program since 1996 and I never miss an appointment because I love the staff.

Triangle Community Center Inc	4896	14	/users/profile/6637	janisTCC	Board Member	5	06/04/2009	The TCC is a labor of love.  Some 18 years ago it was founded by a group of dedicated people who wanted to create a place where the LGBT community could meet and support one another.  We stand strong today in that endeavor.  I have been a member and on the board of directors for 6 or 7 years.  The TCC has provided a rich experience in my life: making friends and making a difference to the lives of others in the community.  Each time I go there I see people who are finding each other, sharing experiences, growing together.  I have seen transgender people find their true expression and the courage to live their lives authentically; young people find peer support; all types finding spiritual calm; people having fun together, celebrating each other.  Fairfield County, CT without the TCC would be like NYC without Central Park!  Where else would we find a breath of fresh air??  I give the TCC 5 stars because I see how the board pours its heart and soul into the organization.  I see the effect it has on our community, but maybe more importantly, I see how much more effect it could have with a broader membership base and better funding!

They also have a very successful summer camp and learning center for children in Batey Libertad that provides them with educational opportunities to break the cycle of poverty. I worked with them as an intern for 6 months and the experience changed my perspective on development and education. Their board members and directors are extremely committed individuals with lots of experience and passion. Development in Batey Libertad through Yspaniola is a participatory process with community leaders, which you don't usually see with NGOs here. They are very invested in the future of the community and train many local youth to serve as teachers in their center. Overall, I'm very happy with their work and recommend this organization to everyone.
Yspaniola Incorporated	86001		/users/profile/96122	jota	Donor	4	04/16/2011	For  years, Haitian workers haved been toiling on Dominican Republic sugar plantations, called Bateys, without basic workers' rights allowed to native Dominicans. Generations of Haitians have been born on the bateys, but no one has been allowed to register as a Dominican national. Hence these workers and their families have no rights and are kept on these bateys, forced to pay some of their wages back as room and board . This organization is attempting to provide batey families with some sort of future, even as the Domincan government ignores its own constitution and UN findings that anyone born in the DR must be recognized as a citizens and afforder all rights thereof.

The kittens and mother were soayed and neutered as soon as it was appropriate and Mama is currently still with us being treated for dental disease she was born with. In 2913 alone TQF adopted out almost 40 cats which is no small feat for a small organization. I enjoyed my experiences so much that when aproached about becomming a board memeber later last year (2013) I was flatered and accepted with out hesitation. We are currently reorganizing our fundraising prigram to include more interactive fundraisers and get our followers, former adopters, voulenteers and board members more contact. Enid is a very soecial person accepting animals she knows have little possibility of being adopted and cares for them as her own. You can tell she cares about each animal just by the way she talks about each one and makes sure to keep in touch with previous adopters.
The Queenie Foundation, Inc.	189315	1	/users/profile/247067	queeniefound	Board Member	4	11/25/2013	The Queenie Foundation, an all volunteer 501 c 3 organization and consistently in good standing with the IRS, was founded in Dallas, TX in 1996 when I lived there. Originally, I founded the organization because I wanted to talk to the public about humane education and issues that I care deeply about such as spay/neuter, veganism and interrupting the animal abuse/child abuse/adult violent behavior link. Our small breed dog rescue is located in Ennis, TX, just south of Dallas, and run by our vice president. To date, we have placed hundreds of dogs in loving homes over the last eight years. Our cat rescue is run by me, the Founder and Executive Director, in Manchester. In 2011, we placed 13 cats, in 2012, we placed 25 cats and as of this writing in November 2013, we have placed 33 cats. All donations and adoption fees are used for veterinary bills and supplies for our foster animals. Our Board of Directors has one member in Texas, our vice president, and five members in the greater Hartford, CT area. At no time has any donation or adoption fee been used for purposes other than our foster animals' care. The previous reviewer is a disgruntled volunteer who is an habitual liar and has not volunteered for us since 2010.  I invite anyone who's interested in The Queenie Foundation, our rescue/adoption program, and our business practices to contact me at queeniefound@hotmail.com. Enid Breakstone
The Queenie Foundation, Inc.	164294	1	/users/profile/218339	queenid	Volunteer	1	08/06/2013	This organization is not legit.  It is a organization of 1 person, Enid Breakstone.  She in fact, has in the past used donations to fund her own animals in her home.  The animals she has in her home are not adoptable.   She hides money donated or spends it on her animals, including6 dogs and about 8 cats.  Animal Control has tried countless times to go to her home to inspect animals after neighbors complained about seeing a lot of animals, and hearing and seeing dogs locked up in crates all day in the basement.  Beware.  Do not give your cat to this woman.  Her outlook, is every cat she brings in, she can make money off of.  She steals is not one to trust, and she is a animal hoarder. She was arrested for theft in Texas.  No one wants to volunteer for her because she treats her volunteers like garbage, has them raise money for her wine, and personal benefits.

This non-profit is the best! When looking for a group that is compassionate, understands a variety of disabilities, puts their entire heart into the work they do, then this is the organization. I can't say enough about this group. My daughter is non-verbal and needs someone to be able to be creative and have lots of patience.  A group that is willing to think outside the box! Well Sensations Charitable Foundation is that and so much more!! I'm grateful to have found this organization and so will you.

Many thanks for always acting on behalf of animals first and for keeping their integrity. 
Friends of Animals, Inc.	237147	2	/users/profile/321438	Adam50	Donor	4	01/21/2015	I discovered Friends of Animals while walking my dog many years ago.  A fellow dog lover informed me that I could have Max neutered through the low-cost spay-neuter program run by Friends of Animals for well over 50 years.  F of A referred me to a participating veterinarian in my neighborhood.  I paid a very low fee and Friends of Animals covered the rest.  I assume the doctor did not charge Friends of Animals the full cost.  Either way,  my dog became a client until he passed away at age 14.  Since that time, i donate to the Spay Neuter Fund each year.  I also donate to Primarily Primates, a sanctuary I supported before Friends of Animals took it over.  I do not donate for Friends of Animals' vegan, anti-fur and anti-hunting campaigns, though I respect the group for being truthful in it's mailings about it's positions on the issues.   Transparency is essential and so is efficient use of my donations.  F of A does not use for-profit solicitation firms and earns high grades from Charity Watch and other evaluators.  
Friends of Animals, Inc.	113394	3	/users/profile/150747	Cody D.	Board Member	5	05/31/2012	Friends of Animals is one of the rare organizations that truly embodies its mission and principles in all of its actions. Since I first discovered FoA in 2007, I have witnessed their perseverance on a number of issues pay off in terms of greater protections for animals. Their ability to work on multiple fronts of animal rights is impressive: from their long-standing and expansive work on cats and dogs spay/neuter programs to wild animals in the US and abroad, they are championing a clear and unwavering principled commitment to freeing animals from human interference and human-perpetrated violence. I came to FoAs work having gone through multiple personal transformations, over 15 years, about being vegan and eliminating animal products from all aspects of my life. But, FoAs understanding of animals rights and the institutionalized forms of violence against animals helped me to deepen my commitment to the vegan moral perspective. This perspective and understanding of animal rights is applied with great clarity throughout their diverse programming: animal advocacy, activism for legal protections and bans, and their vegan awareness raising, and the direct support they provide to animal sanctuaries in the US and abroad.Finally, I think Friends of Animals is poised for leadership into the future of animal rights. Social norms are shifting globally, and in accelerated way in the United States, away from use of animals in meeting human needs while additional consensus is being reached on the linkages between environmental degradation, animal industry and climate change. People are looking for a vision of animal rights that is in sync with peoples beliefs and that does not compromise the rights-based approachs most deeply held principles. Friends of Animals, with its principled approach and single-minded focus on supporting concrete programs that benefit animals, offers such a vision.
VICKI SOTO MEMORIAL FUND	298005	2	/users/profile/388829	reseacher	Donor	1	07/25/2016	Disappointed in the amount they give to the local children for the scholarship. Every year we get a mailer asking for money that goes to scholarships for kids going into teaching, but when the local paper announces how much they raise, and 8 months later the paper shows the scholarship amount awarded, it is very disturbing. Will be donating elsewhere in our town that gives 100% to the cause.  They received enough from our family already.
VICKI SOTO MEMORIAL FUND	271242	3	/users/profile/360047	PingPong15	General Member of the Public	1	11/05/2015	This organization does not tell the sympathetic donors that only 5% and 10% of funds raised goes to the actual scholarships. So when they say "thousands of dollars given..." that would be $5026 x 2 for the over $200,000 raised in 2013, and in 2014, $100.000 raised, 10% went to scholarship...So for this year the question to ask is, what % of these funds actually goes to the students entering College in 2016...An inspection of their non profit tax records appears to show that they spend more on t shirts than scholarships...Better off donating directly to the High Schools, at least 100% would go to the students continuing their education to become educators and not just5% and 10% of the dollars you give the Soto's, in memory of their daughter, which is the saddest part.

Wow, what a beautiful day was had by all.  The Navajo blessing turned out to be for both the horses and me.  From the moment I met Cynthia and saw what she was doing I wanted to help out.  Although I wish I could do more, it is always a blessing to be on her property working with her and the horses.  The horses are receiving the best care, lots of love and plenty of room to roam around.  I truly believe they know that they are safe and loved.  Many have been saved from slaughter and are now at their forever home.  Cynthia is a one woman team and she needs all the help she can get.  Any donation will be most appreciated and will go directly to the care of the horses.  You can trust that your money will go to do what you intend it for, the care of these beautiful animals.  If money is tight, please consider donating your time, you will love it!!
Hay Burr Inn Corp	319699		/users/profile/411491	traveller1	Donor	5	12/01/2016	I have been evolved in helping 3 horses find their way to Hay Burr Inn and I can't say enough nice things about the care these horses receive under their care. All three of these horses were believed to be going there to meet a quiet end to their lives. But under the constant care and many vet and farrier visits all three are living fat, happy, and healthy.  I donate as often as I can to help but as we all know there is always a shortage of everything in a rescue and sadly some horses have had to be turned away due to lack of funding. If you are thinking of helping a rescue Hay Burr Inn would be a excellent tax deductible  investment into the rehabilitation of abused  horses.

By accomplishing this, physicians and researchers will be one step closer to unraveling many of the mysteries surrounding tick-borne diseases.  Lyme Research Alliance needs additional funding to complete the work that will benefit everyone who spends time outdoors from potential crippling illness.

Its mission is compelling and, since its founding in 1972, it has enjoyed remarkable success in setting aside wildlife corridors, hiking trails, fragile environments, increasingly rare agricultural land and magnificent vistas.  Through its efforts, "Mary's Rock," which affords a panoramic view north towards Springfield and beyond, and the sadly decimated Granby Oak have been protected.  And, too, the Land Trust has partnered with other "sister" organizations such as the State (Enders Forest, particularly), the McLean Game Refuge, The Nature Conservancy and the Town of Granby to achieve the shared goals of all of those land stewards.  Its web page, www.GranbyLandTrust.org, has won statewide recognition and is worth a visit.  In short, amazing!

That year was the first year that she attended Camp Rising Sun.  The first 8 months of chemotherapy was awful and she was in and out of the hospital for treatment.  She was in pain from the chemo but they convinced us that she should attend camp because she needed to have fun and a "normal" experience.  They  kept a very close eye on her and Dr. Joe was there to offer her meds and make sure she rested.  When I picked her up later in the week, I couldn't believe the smile I saw.  She was a different child.  She had a ball and made lifelong friends.  My daughter continued to go to camp until she was 18 and wouldn't have missed it for anything.

Apt Foundation Inc	306528		/users/profile/397787	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	09/26/2016	Apt foundation definately does not care about their patients. Their program sounds great on their website with all the services they offer. Primary care psychiatric help vocational training It's ALL bullshit!! You wait hours to see the primary care doctor just to be told they lost your blood work, they don't address your medical conditions, you wait a couple more hours to see the pyschiatrist because you are in need of counseling, but he doesn't understand why you're there because his only function seems to be doleing out prescription after prescription to the dozens of patients that breezed in and out before you. Hence, he never bothers to talk to you about anything. You wait to see about vocational training yet when you finally get in, you're told you are being put on a very long waiting list because there's only one person in charge of offering vocational services. The APT foundation is a complete JOKE!!! People who are truly in need and want the help ARE NOT getting it. The only thing they are consistent with is keeping their patients on methadone with no real plan to ween them off!! And my GOD people should n able to post the names of the incompetent doctors working there! No wonder addicts can't get/stay clean!! This place should be investigated. 
Apt Foundation Inc	122483	3	/users/profile/166812	genusbolloxed	Client Served	1	09/18/2012	I've been a client at the APT foundation on Ella T. Grasso in New Haven, CT for over 4 years. They may have " strengthened their funds balance", but their quality of service has dramatically decreased. Councilors repeatedly do not answer phone calls and worse yet some don't even return your messages. When you tell them how bad it is, they simply point to all the people filling the room and it's clear the manpower to handle the business simply isn't there. There used to be two clinics in one at this location (6 dispensing windows), they consolidated them both together and now the place has a line to the back door every single day especially during the morning hours when you're trying to get to work (not to mention they closed a second location in New Haven as well). The APT Foundation does not appear to care about it's client's recovery at all- it's clear because it's patients demonstrate the ability the continually fail urine analysis and the only punishment is that you won't get any take home bottles, but you'll be considered in recovery as long as you buy your methadone everyday and go to an APT group once a month. I have a severe stomach condition and am almost completely weened off methadone because it exacerbates the latter, funny thing is that the APT doctor and councilors keep telling me its not the methadone making it act up and that I shouldn't get off methadone (EVER if they had it their way- I think 4+ years is long enough, no?) yet 2 doctors from my PCP's office and my G.I. say the complete opposite (obviously APT's doctors have biased opinions and should be considered a conflict-of-interest, to anyone considering seeing a clinic doctor OR psych.). I've also had horrible experiences with the employees who work there (bad attitudes, lazy employees, misinformation, lying etc.) although, I won't get into any particulars and ruin anonymity. I will say SOME of their employees have been highly helpful- but have had to do so in a way that was out of the scope of being an APT employee, sadly (meaning they were giving me info. or guidance as a friend not an employee of APT) but MOST are uneducated and skewed in their view of what recovery is. APT appears to have it's own definition of recovery- or is just really uneducated. They continually make changes within their program and then a month or two later they change it back or change it to something else. This place has NO idea what it's doing! It's an addiction treatment center. Whether you go to group shouldn't matter, passing urine analysis and not relapsing is what should matter. It makes me wonder- what underlying motivation/goal are they holding above ACTUAL recovery? Granted I've been successfully clean on the methadone program for the past 4 years- but with NO real help from the APT foundation except simply that I get my methadone from them.

In addition, our Friendship Center provides free meals and case workers to connect individuals to an array of health and employment services.  Through the generosity of many active volunteers and donors and the expertise of our professional staff, many lives are changed for the better!  When I have the opportunity to interact with our clients, I am always struck by their gratitude and perseverance, and the often heartbreaking stories that have lead to their current circumstances.  Without a safe place to call "home", it is exceedingly difficult to manage one's life well or negotiate the systems to success...Mercy H&S understands this and does remarkable work to help individuals turn that around!!

ADOPT A BOXER RESCUE	132144		/users/profile/177750	Angela42	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	I love being a volunteer for adopt a boxer rescue!!! I admire the other volunteers who have given selflessly of themselves to give boxers a second chance and the love they deserve.  I have also met wonderful people through reference checks, vet checks, home visits, marketing events and transports.  I rescued Brody who was found on the side of a road at 4 weeks old and Princess Nona who was dropped off in the dark one night in the yard of a shelter.  Se was later adopted and returned because she didn't listen.  It turns out that Princess Nona is deaf which is not apparent since Brody serves as her ears.  She sticks to him like glue and we have never had a problem with either dog.  They both enrich the lives of all who know them and they are amazing with our baby.  Please keep up the good work AABR!  
ADOPT A BOXER RESCUE	132117		/users/profile/177723	Karen113	Volunteer	5	11/01/2012	Adopt a Boxer Rescue volunteering has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.  I cant express the feelings when you have been able to assist in being a part of a dog finally being placed in a loving wonderful forever home.  Some of these dogs have been abused, not properly cared for and all they want is someone to care for and love them.  The people in this group are very caring and expend so much of their time as volunteers to help these poor dogs.  I personally am a foster mom, and I assist in reviewing applications and have done home visits.  I will for sure be a part of this organization for many years to come and hope that you consider them for one of the Top Rated Non profits because they sure deserve it and they make a difference in a lot of animals and peoples lives!!!!!!!!!

Judy Dworin Performance Project Inc	286589		/users/profile/376659	Judy_W	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I was so moved by a performance of In My Shoes that I was inspired to give to the Judy Dworin Performance Project [JDPP]. In My Shoes brings the voices of the women at York Correctional Institution to the public. Six guest artists - some of whom were previously incarcerated, and another who is a child of a parent who was incarcerated - perform with JDPPs professional ensemble members to tell the story of the walk to, through, and out of prison. My reaction to their spoken words, dances, and songs was so visceral that I didnt even realize I had been holding my breath until the tears welling up in my eyes began to fall down my cheeks. I was overcome by these women who had such courage to share their own and others painful stories and bare their souls. They were so brave; I wondered if I were in their shoes, if I would have had the personal fortitude to deal with what happened, to move on with my life, to try to learn how to be free. Because this touched my heart, I knew I wanted to do something to express my gratitude to the performers and to JDPP. I wanted to thank the performers for the privilege of being witness to their heartfelt transformation. And I wanted to thank JDPP for creating such beautiful and important art. And I felt so good knowing that I would be helping them to continue to enrich my life and the lives of others.  #MyGivingStory  #GivingTuesday  #JDPPMoving4Change
Judy Dworin Performance Project Inc	286588		/users/profile/376658	Robin_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Walls Are For ArtI give to Judy Dworin Performance Project (JDPP) because I know . . .nearly two thirds of incarcerated women are mothers.one in fourteen U.S. children has or has had an incarcerated parent.Children are the collateral damage of our national plight of mass incarceration. When their parents are incarcerated, children suffer. These broken and underserved children become broken and underserved adults, greatly at risk of becoming incarcerated.As a society we can, and must, do better to uplift families and to end mass incarceration. I give to this organization because The Judy Dworin Performance Project has created and implemented successful programs that challenge mothers to reflect upon and move beyond the wreckage of their pass, inspire children to work through the shame of having an incarcerated parent, and nurture the relationships of moms and kids. On the horizon is a dads and kids program. Using the arts as a catalyst for change, these programs truly help to heal families and strengthen communities, which are real strides toward transforming our failing justice system. I have enough faith in humanity to think that if more people could see and feel what prison really is, we would not have prisons. Seeing inside prison is not possible because we, the public, are never invited in. Or, are we? Through multi-arts performance, JDPP brings to the public stage an emotional, authentic experience of life behind the walls, including performers who, while incarcerated, worked with JDPP on the inside. I became aware of the dysfunction of our justice system first hand, about twenty years ago, when I was incarcerated.  Believe me, taking in this performance is as inside as you can get, without losing your freedom. I give to Judy Dworin Performance Project to uplift families and end mass incarceration. I believe that if you could feel what prison is like, you would want change, too. You would be ashamed, as was I, of who those walls are really separating. #JDPPMoving4Change#MyGivingStory#GivingTuesday

The way they treat the homeless with regard to overnight accomodations, the three meals they serve daily to the hungry, the clothes they distribute to the needy, the counsel they give to the people who wander in off the street, the program for getting these men's lives back on track . . . there just isn't ANYTHING better around and I am truly proud to be a part of it!

I was put into the care of Ahava kids two years ago by the court.  I know you have a a very strong opinion about this matter and I'm here to shed a little light on it.  Because this is something too that is very near and dear to my heart.    Ahava kids saved my life!!  For four months they actively sought help for me in every aspect possible. not to mention the emotional support and lifelong friendship I gained through out my stay with them.  When no one else was willing to help, they were!!  They helped me out with court, kept me hidden while I was being hunted, found me counseling, fed me, clothed me.  Most importantly taught me that what happened to me wasn't my fault.   They put so much effort into taking care of me.  No one else would have done that.  Not even my own family.  I was a full time job!  Still to this day I work very closely with them.   Believe me when I say that I have been through a lot and can spot someone who is a scam artist and insincere from a mile away.  Ahava kids should never be put in that catagory.  It is a shame that this has happened to them.  The one thing you have to remember is that this is a very new concept and is still very unknown territory. They will be criticized and questioned all the time for what they are doing, but the fact of the matter is that they are doing something.  They are trying and that is all you can ask for.  That is all I can ask for!  I would know better than anyone that what they are being accused of is false and uncalled for because that grant helped to put my life back together again.  I know first hand.  I hope that this matter does not keep them from helping others like me, because they are so very good at what they do!Cordially,  Marie

Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association	174116	1	/users/profile/230327	John Brown	Professional with expertise in this field	2	10/05/2013	I'm an Australian aviation historian whose findings about Connecticut's aviation pioneer, Gustave Whitehead, were peer-reviewed earlier this year and recognized by both the world's highest aviation authority, JAWA, and a unanimous resolution of both houses of the Connecticut Assembly along with the State's Governor. Both withdrew first flight recognition from the Wright brothers and assigned it to Gustave Whitehead. CAHA's involvement, so far, has been limited to snide remarks about me by one former and one current staff member on internet forums. Both have publicly made factually incorrect statements about Gustave Whitehead, thus disqualifying them personally and reflecting badly on the institution they represent. Both appear to also have made factually incorrect statements about inquiries their organisation has conducted in the past. I therefore appeal to other members of the organisation to take measures appropriate to ensure the organization's legitimacy before it becomes necessary for outside investigations to take the initiative.The Organisation has taken the unusual step of sealing files of historical interest to researchers. This would appear to be at odds with the Code of Ethics of Museums and its own charter.  
Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association	173985		/users/profile/230151	gwfirstinflight	General Member of the Public	1	10/05/2013	Connecticut Aeronautical Historical Association is NOT transparent. CAHA misrepresents aviation history and its own history in documenting witnesses to the flights of Gustave Whitehead. Learn more about this and view a YouTube of its founder and president, Harvey Lippincott Interview, 1981, acknowledging the flights of Gustave Whitehead that took place in 1901-1902: http://historybycontract.org/?p=257. NEW UPDATE:  TWO NEW YOUTUBE VIDEOS  View what CAHA FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT Mr. Lippincott said about Whitehead in 1981 (that he believed Whitehead flew in 1901-1902, with power and control) Historian Agrees Whitehead Flew 1901-1902 on YouTube at http://youtu.be/MuXcQjjNBZc and Crouch & Lippincott Whitehead Discussion (YouTube) http://youtu.be/Eu0OB4jBKm0.   CAHA/NEAM refuses to recognize Whitehead's accomplishments, under its current leadership has done a 180 degrees on this. They have even sealed the files from the time period when CAHA recognized Whitehead. A recent letter from NEAM's Carl Stidman, research archivist: "The New England Air Museum's stance for the past 45 years has been to recognize Gustave Whitehead as a pioneer Connecticut machinist and a pioneer aviation engine manufacturer; but that insufficient evidence had yet been discovered to ascertain and/or determine the proper merits of Whitehead's claims of flight in 1899, 1901 or 1902. This stance was undertaken following a multi-year review in the mid-1960's that the then-CAHA Whitehead Research Committee .... undertook regarding the Whitehead claims. " The problem with this stance is that CAHA did find, even in the 1960's, by interviewing eye-witnesses that Gustave Whitehead DID FLY in the 1901-1902 period. Therefore, NEAM's current stance is NOT based on CAHA's findings, and thus, NEAM does not have a Whitehead exhibit, nor is it "in sync" with current findings and opinions and law recognizing Whitehead as first in flight by the state of CT. If NEAM is to be in CT, then support the research findings and recognition of the state on Whitehead with an appropriate exhibit. Otherwise, people in CT may just boycott NEAM as presenting biased, obsolete information to the public. Carl Stidson, NEAM librarian, agrees with Smithsonian that Whitehead didn't fly, and advises the director at NEAM to take the same stance. (see http://blog.nasm.si.edu/). Smithsonian has a formerly "secret" agreement with the Wright heirs to ONLY recognize the Wright Flyer and the Wrights as first in flight OR the museum will lose the Wright Flyer which reverts to the heirs. That is called making history by contract. NEAM, if it is to provide valid information to the public on early flight history, should not condone this sort of "backroom dealing" to subvert historical inquiry. I advise that CAHA and its museum NEAM put together a positive exhibit on Gustave Whitehead that reflects his growing recognition as first in flight in the world, and open up the CAHA files to show everything examined and said about Whitehead by 1970 at CAHA, particularly, what was determined by President Lippincott. View what Mr. Lippincott says about Whitehead (that he believes Whitehead flew in 1901-1902, with power and control) Historian Agrees Whitehead Flew 1901-1902 on YouTube at http://youtu.be/MuXcQjjNBZc and Crouch & Lippincott Whitehead Discussion (YouTube) http://youtu.be/Eu0OB4jBKm0.  Yet, currently, with the death of Mr. Lippincott, who founded CAHA in 1959, there is not a shred of recognition for Whitehead, an exceedingly important aviation pioneer who beat the Wrights into flight, in Connecticut. CAHA is not only hiding the evidence of their investigations, they are literally turning their backs on the people of the state of CT in doing so.

Labrador Life Line Llc	189051		/users/profile/246769	Jordan R.	Client Served	5	11/22/2013	I received info about a puppy that was being physically abused and neglected by its owners. I immediately starting perusing the owner about giving up the dog to me so I could give it a good home and the care it needed. Finally after much persuasion they gave up the puppy. I immediately discovered this puppy was in much worse shape then I thought and got it to the vet ASAP. The vet informed me the puppy ( I named her Raven) had a horrible case of fleas and was loaded with worms, but worst of all she had a hernia. The hernia was the size of a half dollar and Raven was in great danger of her intestants becoming instrangulated, potentially killing her. The vet recommended surgery ASAP. This information weighed on me so heavily knowing I could not afford an expensive surgery. So I started searching for help. Called my local SPCA, animal control officer, town office all in hope there was some sort of funds out there to help with a situation like mine. There wasn't any money available and I was turned away at every attempt I had made. I eventually took my search online nation wide. I came across Labrador Life Line. I received an email only hours after I filled out the application online. Cindy was the name of the volunteer that was covering my case. We starting exchanging emails about my situations and any questions she had for me. She send me all the forms I needed to get the process started. Ravens surgery was scheduled for the next morning so we didn't have any time to waste. The next morning I got to the vet and had them fax Cindy all the info she needed to present Ravens case to her board. She was with me every step of the way. Letting me know every move she made. She also showed great concern for Raven and even though my application hadn't been accepted yet made sure the vet proceded with the surgery determined to get me the help I needed. She worked on my case all day. After so much work and effort on her part, she got the board of LLC to accept my case. LLC covered 75% of the cost of the surgery. 75%!!! I owe in large part the life of my dog to this organization and Cindy. So greatful there are groups out there like LLC that truly care and are willing to help! So much love for this organization! 
Operation Love The Children Of Haiti Incorporated	110449	1	/users/profile/150349	David79	Donor	5	04/21/2012	Having visited OLTCH twice within the past year, I am even more impressed with the work that Jasmine & Greg are doing for the orphaned children of Haiti.  They do so much, with so little, that it forces you to ponder what more they could accomplish given additional resources.  A small group from my church visited OLTCH in Haiti just a few weeks ago.  We had the privilege to be there on a Sunday and participate in worship time with the kids.  What a blessing to wtiness Jasmine as she "preached" to the kids, weaving together 3 different Bible stories which emphasized that God is always with us, even when bad things are happening.  It was all about being grateful, in everything, and the joyful worship reflected that them.   Jasmine & Greg have an amazing story of how God has blessed, provided, protected and empowered them in their short 4-years of ministry in Haiti.   Unlike some orphanages in Haiti, the kids at "Jasmine's" are healthy, happy and learning about how precious they are in the sight of God.  This is a ministry worth supporting as they continue to grow.  OLTCH truly does love the children of Haiti.

Jasmine runs an amazingly efficient operation in Leogane, the epicenter of the 2010 Haitian earthquake. She is a deeply faithful Christian that loves these children. Our team visited 7ministries during our recent trip to Haiti and have put Jasmine's at the top of our list of ministries with which we wish to partner. Jasmine has acquired a large parcel of land and her vision is to build an orphanage and community center "campus" on the property. From there she will help care for needy children but will also help the community find ways to become self sustaining in some of their food and water needs. Jasmine's is an amazing place and I am blessed to have been able to visit there, to meet Jasmine and her children. There is great financial need here in order to maintain the current level of care and to move on to the future and the vision Jasmine & Greg have for much bigger things in the near future. God has truly blessed the people of Leogane by placing Greg & Jasmine in this place.

New Haven International Festival Of Arts & Ideas Inc	29832	7	/users/profile/30821	barb13	Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	The New Haven Festival of Arts and Ideas is a remarkable and transformative organization. It started during a very difficult time in New Haven, and I believe it contributed greatly to the city's recovery and current position as a great environment for both arts and creative ideas. I have attended the festival every year but one (I was in the hospital in 2007, and could not attend) and each year has been different. There is such a variety of events: dance, music, theatre - even the written word and visual arts are represented. We have enjoyed Jazz, classical and modern dance, Asian puppetry, Shakespeare, Opera, contemporary world theatre, And street performances. We have seen things outdoors and in. There is a whole weekend devoted to children's events on the city green. But the most remarkable thing about the festival is the Unifying Ideas theme for each year. Events of all kinds are selected to tie in with or complement this theme. The year after hurricane Katrina was devoted to New Orleans' artists, solutions to poverty, and other related topics. These themes have brought us everything from quantum physics to food. I thought the food events would be predictable, cooking show presentations, and was not looking forward to much. I should have known better! They talked about global hunger, how farming in the US impacts our environment and our health, the pros and cons of everything from local food movements to fertilizer use. And they fed us wonderful foods, in a festive environment:food for the soul as well as the body and mind. The festival is always stimulating and mind- expanding, always world-wide in scope, always surprising.Any flaws? Of course. There are too many things happening at the same time, all of which I want to see; and I can't afford all the events. The calendar/brochure put out by the festival is sometimes hard to follow, and the website is even worse. Both are beautiful, but not always logical and clear.I can't imagine New Haven, or my summer, without this festival. It has enriched my life and my city enormously. It's a wonderful way to spend two weeks!

I've been going to this event evry year since it started and enjoy it immensely. Of equal impact is the transformative nature of those two weeks in June when the City of New Haven is at its absolute best - brimming with visitors, artists, along with the local community and people of all ages and backgrounds enjoying this cornucopia of aural and visual delights.And it truly is not just Arts, but also Ideas, and last year I attended several remarkable Ideas events, most notably perhaps was the Community Poetry Project with Frank McCort, in conversation w/ Rose Styron - McCort simply entranced us and we would have gladly stayed for hours if he allowed us to do so (this Ideas event was SRO, as were others), and a dozen community members aged 14 to 80 were all remarkable reading their favorite poems and capturing us all in their varying expressive ways.  New Haven truly felt like a community where the notion of ideas and openly sharing ideas was encouraged and embraced.I look forward to what the Fesival will offer up for 2010.  They have set the bar high!

I will carry the magical memories and lessons learned at YPI for the rest of my life.
YPI, Inc.	102964		/users/profile/136406	andrew.dangio.white	Client Served	5	01/06/2012	I attended YPI for five summers during my middle and high school years, and worked there as a counselor for two.  I had always been vaguely interested in theater and the creative arts in general, but had never really thought of it as a serious undertaking.  At YPI, the Master Teachers are all working in the fields in which they teach.  As a young person, seeing adults who were passionate about the arts and willing to share their expertise with people my age was inspiring.  YPI helped me to understand the importance of expressing myself creatively as a part of my whole identity, not just as a hobby.  Perhaps more important than that realization is the fact that all of this learning takes place in one of the most supportive and affirming environments I have ever known.  One of my proudest moments as a counselor at YPI was telling a parent who was concerned her child would be teased: "That doesn't happen here."  Here, young people are encouraged to take risks in exploring new ways of expressing themselves.  The important thing is not just the end result of making good art, but to learn and revel in the process of creating something new.  Please support this wonderful organization, and help them to bring a remarkable experience to more young people.

Sonia Plumb Dance Company Inc	286528		/users/profile/376598	Zoe_A	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	A Push to Excel as a Community -Why I Give to Sonia Plumb Dance Companywww.SoniaPlumbDance.orgI first learned about the Sonia Plumb Dance Company as a student at the University of Saint Joseph. They were Artist in Residence, a first for our school, and I was a student director of the dance program. We were fortunate enough to have the Artistic Director, Sonia Plumb, set a dance piece on our ensemble. She pushed us to excel, dig deeper into our capabilities, and to think and to work as an ensemble  as a community. I later learned that she  asks that of everyone she works with, students, dancers, board members and volunteers. Upon graduation, I joined the Board of Sonia Plumb Dance Company. As Board Members, she continues to ask us to excel, to dig deeper into our capabilities, to inquire how we can do better as a Company, as Artists, as Teachers, and as Leaders in the Community.Sonia Plumb Dance Company enriches and educates the community through innovative, high quality, modern dance. Her vision reaches students from the inner city of Hartford to professors from around the state and further to artists and teachers across the nation. The creative teaching methods and performances of the Company transform audiences through unique  learning  experiences and paths of  inspiration. Bringing the community together through the pursuit of excellence. As an educator, I know the importance of  participating in the arts. Synapsis are fired, connections are made, work is created. The dancers of Sonia Plumb Dance Company are local teachers and performers who have a passion for interacting with the community and building dance based connections to curriculum that are rare to students.I look forward to viewing the work the Company creates as I know it is something I can share with my students. Whether it be the connections to their media driven lives through Privacy Settings or the dark and mysterious tales of The Odyssey; the company never fails to impress and I am eager to challenge my students to view art as important and relevant to their course work. As a donor, Board Member, and supporter of this program, I encourage you to share in the grand experience that is the Sonia Plumb Dance Company and support the chance for someone else to be inspired.
John L Starks Foundation Inc	268816		/users/profile/357551	Writer	Donor	4	10/28/2015	I've been supporting various charities centered on furthering the education of young people.

Empowerment Through Arts Inc	82970		/users/profile/91768	P. Sirade	Board Member	5	03/23/2011	I enjoy being a board member at the Empowerment Through Arts Foundation and working by our president's side. Monica is a goal-oriented professional with excellent interpersonal skills that allow her to liaise efficiently with stakeholders at all business levels. She has the ability to motivate and inspire those around her with her enthusiasm, creativity, high energy and engaging personality. Monica eagerly accepts new challenges and finds innovative ways of meeting them. As a trustee she does not think outside of the box because she does not even know that the box exists. That is an important trait for a leader to have when you are examining an organization and how it functions. Monica has demonstrated the ability to create solutions that fit the situation rather than embrace a one-size fits all mentality. Shes resourceful and is a true administrator, fostering leadership qualities in others. Her leadership style is smart: allowing people to grow in their roles, welcoming new ideas, and providing direction with encouragement, earning well due respect from staff and volunteers in our campaign. I highly recommend her as a consummate professional with whom it is always a pleasure to work.
Passion 4 Paws Inc	117451		/users/profile/159691	Kanna	Volunteer	5	06/30/2012	Cage free cat shelter. The cats are loved and well cared for. The student volunteers socialize the cats and they even care for elderly and cats with special needs. They are a small shelter, but if you adopt from them, you will get a cat that has been cared for and loved...even if it spent the last 15 years at the shelter.. as some have. Please consider adopting from them or at the very least a donation. There are not that many shelters that are cage free and take the time and money to welcome elderly or special needs cats.

Center for Women and Families of Eastern Fairfield	133596	2	/users/profile/175937	valfoster	Volunteer	5	11/05/2012	A friend introduced me to the staff of The Center for Women and Families of Eastern Fairfield County a few years ago, and at that first meeting, I knew I had to find the time to help them spread the word about the valuable work they do daily, turning victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault and bullying into survivors. Many of these attacks happen behind closed doors, and what I have learned are those doors know no economic boundaries. Victims are hiding in high-rise projects, middle-class capes and magnificent mansions. And through the dedication and professionalism of the staff at The Center, many of these victims find the courage to seek help and save themselves and their children from future assaults.  It is my honor to volunteer with this wonderful non-profit.
Connecticut Invention Convention Inc	222210	1	/users/profile/285905	Danny13	Board Member	5	10/13/2014	My kids have all been through the CIC.  It's a 30+ year old institution in CT, and a staple alongside the Science Fair.  Kids are taught to invention a solution to a problem they have, and then go through prototyping, researching patents, creating marketing, etc. Winners of local invention conventions get to go to the State level at UCONN's Gambel Pavilion where you have almost 1000 kids showing off their inventions.  Each year the CIC teaches about 15000 kids in 200 schools to be inventors, which I think is just awesome.  Very efficient from a funding point of view too--they do all of this with just a few full time staffers and a boatload of volunteers.  Very awesome program.  I have been volunteering with them since my first of four kids went through the program.

As a volunteer I have seen the miracles that take place when sharing God's love with the ladies who live at the house. We call it "The Hope House." God has blessed this home is every way  possible from providing carpeting, appliances, oil for heat, food, clothing and more importantly a steady stream of loving people that give so freely of their time and money. Annette Eldridge has worked tirelessly to make the dream of having family type home where woman who are recovery from addiction, homelessness, and other seemly hopeless situations become a reality . Annette and her husband Dale always pray in the needs and God provides each and every time. It's an amazing place. I have a friend who lives at the Community of Hope. Through tender (and sometimes tough) loving care she is growing closer to God and beginning to discover own self worth. Thank you Annette and your team. You are an Angel...

On any given Saturday, the kitchen serves between 125 and close to 200 decent breakfasts (on my Saturday my brother makes the pancakes) Then another crowd (some are the same people, but not even half) another 125-165 people for lunch. The people who visit are normal everyday people, many are very lovable, all have distinct personalities. I am grateful that this appeal serves all people in the Diocese without judgment.

Netpets Inc	113756	2	/users/profile/154774	Alison11	Client Served	1	06/04/2012	Actually, I'm a client who was NOT served. This is an organization that places the pets of military service members in temporary foster homes during deployment: a rare & much-needed service. The website lists impressive credentials & has a thorough application form. I filled it out & when I received no reply for a/b 3 weeks, I called. I was told there had been a computer crash & dozens of applications had been lost. I would need to re-apply. I did, but I also asked if there would be enough time to place our pets as deployment was now a/b 1 month away. The man who runs the group assured me it was no problem. He is extremely distracted & very, very, chatty but clearly loves animals & seems to really love what he does. After I did not receive the e-mail he'd told me to expect re: Power Of Attorney, I e-mailed him to request an update. No reply. I called again. He told me that they'd found us a foster home! I was irritated that we hadn't been informed, but still relieved. He said he thought he'd sent me the e-mail but must have forgotten so he would send it right away. I did not receive the e-mail. With just over one week before deployment, I called him AGAIN to inquire about it. He seemed to think I was silly for worrying about it so much & assured me I'd have it by the following morning so it could be notarized & mailed back to him at the start of the work week. He couldn't give me the foster family's contact info until he received the notarized form back. I was very stressed by this point knowing that we had so little time for the paper to get across the country & then I'd have only one weekend to get my animals to this foster family. There would be no time to meet them in advance like I'd wanted. Guess what? HE DIDN'T SEND THE FORM! By an amazing stroke of luck, a new acquaintance has offered to care for my pets at the last minute. If not for that, I would be totally screwed thanks to this man at NetPets! I'm so disappointed in their service & frankly, pissed off. Military families need a service like this & when someone promises that their pets will be taken care of, it's NOT right to leave them hanging last minute. There's no way to put off deployment & people could be left with no options & even have to resort to giving their pets up!!! I hope that this was an isolated case but I have found no other reviews of this organization online & if they have fostered as many pets as they claim, it seems odd that no one is spreading the word since like I said, this is a very rare service. In my opinion, BEWARE & DO NOT rely on this group unless you have a secure backup plan.

Animal Haven Inc	234557		/users/profile/300459	oldgreycat	Volunteer	5	11/27/2014	I first visited Animal Haven several weeks ago.  My husband and I had lost our beloved cat/furry boy of 14 years and we have mourned and miss him so deeply.  I miss that little happy face looking up at me when  I petted him while making the morning coffee.  Yes, I am a responsible adult but I just melt into a loving goo when in the company of cats.  I really just wanted to go to  Animal Haven  to pet a cat.  Any cat.  I needed to feel the furry  joy/love you can only get from a critter.  My husband said he wasn't ready yet  to look at another pet so I went by myself.  At Animal Haven I found a modern, welcoming, bright  building and staff and I walked into a bright sunny room with ca. 15 adoptable cats in it and  my heart just melted.  I was given the opportunity to see other cats and spoke to some of the staff and within  about 20 minutes I was asking if they needed any volunteers.  I was hooked.  I love this place. They love their critters and take great care of them. I know. I am not a push-over with my time - I work full time; my husband is disabled and my heart still has room to give help to these beautiful critters.I presently volunteer on Saturday mornings and for me it is a slice of heaven.   Animal Haven is super-worthy of any support you can give them.  Please help if you can with a donation. Thanks

What is amazing about this charity is how dedicated it and its members are to passing on its legacy of teaching responsibility through sound horsemanship over its almost 75 years of existence.  People who were members as children 50 years ago still keep in touch and share amazing photographs and stories of how the lessons learned at NCMT have shaped their lives.  NCMT continues to impart this life experience on children today.  NCMT also gives horses who are otherwise not needed anymore wonderful new jobs and a new home where they are loved and cared for expertly by NCMT's professional staff and by all the children in the program.  NCMT has also recently added a therapeutic riding program to its roster.

I offered my services to a local Shopping Center in 2000 as a Santa.    I suggested they donate the proceeds to a Children's Charity to build their image and create a sense of community.    That was i5 years ago and I'm still involved.        Since then, I've served on the Board; as its President and as a volunteer.    In the beginning, the financial situation was dyer to say the least.    But with the hiring of a dynamic new Executive Director who knew where the money was and how to go about getting to get those folks involved with the organization, it is thriving today.        I've seen it go from serving only 5 Children with a wish in my first year to serving more than a wish child a week today.    I will also say that decisions are always made while keeping the 75% / 25% up front of mind.        When folks ask Ol' Santa about "a Wish with Wings"; I like to simply compare it to "that large Wish organization" by saying, "a Wish with wings is a member of the Association of Wish Granting Organizations whose bi-laws require that 75% of the funding donated be used for funding individual wishes, while the other charity simply can't qualify.Ol' Santa

Hygienic Art Inc	81207	1	/users/profile/88804	Just GRIPPO	Board Member	1	03/04/2011	Some of the things Hygienic Art Inc. does not want the public to know: 1. An active boardmember ( Terry "Davo" Davis ) had a blog on the hygienic website for 3 months, in which he describes Marc Chagall & Milton Glasier as "Jew artists". This was defended by other boardmembers as "freedom of speech"! 2. That there was a case of sexual harrassment filed against the president V.Scarano & treasurer J.Stidfole of Hygienic Art Inc. (CHRO Case# 0740337).( This suit cost Hyg.Art.Inc. over $20,000 in atty fees & settlement ) See 2007 tax records. 3. Multiple Dept.of Labor Law violations. (6) involving the same parties. monies paid = $3700. 4. A artpiece that satirized the sexual harrassment , was documented and witnessed as entered into the infamous"uncensored" annual hygienic (29th.) show. mysteriously disappeared when the gallery was closed for "cleaning"!  5. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baybrOVHMso Listen Carefully! Read the full vid description.   6. As both ex-vice-president and original incorporating officer, I can personally attest to the above, (also utilizing F.O.I.) and also being threatened with arrest TWICE by Mr. Scarano (hyg. pres.), once at a board meeting because I notified some of hygienic arts finiancial supporters of hygienics board anti-semeitc apathy .  When I  went to their boardmeeting, I was threatened with arrest by their president, Vincent Scarano, because I sent a f*^king letter and I signed it! - yet another boardmember ( Joe Althouse) defended Davo's blog as "freedom of speech".   Now isn't this ironic, for not only was I was once an officer and leading force in Hygienics incorporation, but they decided that one of their fellow boardmembers anti-semitic rants was easier to defend then taking action and doing the right thing.  I have also been banned from their website for speaking out on Hygienic's hypocrisy, though Davo's anti-semitic blog was allowed to remain for 3 months. It's also ironic because Hygienic Art grew to fame because of it's annual "uncensored" art show. Please let it be noted that Hygienic Art was started by Allyson Holtz, a jewish artist! Sadly, Gregg GrippoNorwich, Ct 860-886-4051

A woman named Jacky called our office after receiving our written request for information. She was defensive and rude and tried to distract from answering our queries with diatribes about polictical leaders in Haiti past and present. When pushed for answers about how they have spent their money on the ground in Haiti she finally hung up the phone. 
Bridgeport Area Youth Ministry Inc	285385	1	/users/profile/375372	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/09/2016	I volunteered a total of eight months at this location and I have to say, these are some of the most wonderful people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. They treated me with kindness and respect which was reflected to each and every customer they interacted with. Listening to how passionate they were about their work and how much they loved helping the community was a humbling experience. Each sale was done with honesty and with each interaction the employees would try their best to find a desktop or laptop that would best fit their needs.BAYM also holds classes for youth, where they teach them about computers, hardware, software, and basic programing. Once the youth have completed the course they receive a certification and a free desktop computer. BAYM has been around for about twenty years now and during my time there I spoke to customers who had been doing business with BAYM from the beginning. Every customer I spoke to had the nicest comments, not only about the service done for tem, but for their children through their classes.This is a wonderful place filled with wonderful people who try their best to support the community and could use all the love and support in return from us. Please, as I have come to do myself, donate your used computers or laptops, and at least take a look here before purchasing something brand new. Many of their computers were on par with newer computers at such a reasonable price. We can't let these wonderful businesses be drowned out by the bigger corporation, because unlike those big corporations, these businesses try to do their best for us.So lets try and do our best for them and maybe, we can make that right step forward toward bettering our city for our children.

Agency On Aging Of South Central Connecticut Inc	234749		/users/profile/302994	Sondra D.	Client Served	1	12/01/2014	This is a desperate cry for those in charge of providing government funding to this organization to pay attention to what is happening. Using my own experience with my 80Yr old father as an example of the machiavellian choices this nonprofit makes in delivering on its mission, it must stand to reason that there are others out there as well.  Part of the challenge is that the public has no idea that this is a private nonprofit profit, NOT a government department. The Dept of Social Services and others grants money to the nonprofit Agency on Aging- large sums of money, exceeding $42M, every year. This dollar grant is calculated based on the number of elderly people 'counted' in their service pool - those whom are registered and require assistance. My father was one of those counted, and so the state provide a capitated rate of funds to this organization on his behalf, of which they are to determine and help to coordinate and pay for his care.What happens and what should happen are far apart. What SHOULD happen is that my fathers doctor should be helping to set the standard of care required. In this case his doctor did - determining that his dementia and delusions require him to have 24 HOUR care, for he is a danger to himself and others. What HAS happened is that this private not for profit, who receives a set amount for my father every year for his care, has decided he does not 'qualify' for 24 hour care and provides him with 4 hours of care and 2 hours of homemaking assistance (he lives with us, a busy dual working family) per day. This leaves him alone - in direct violation of the doctors orders- for upward of 5 hours per day.  Why does this agency do this? So they can retain a portion of the money the states provides for his care, to balance their bottom line operationally. Yes, they are skimping on his care, to make their nut for 2014. I am beyond frustrated and horrified at their careless nature and the states blind acceptance. This is but one venue, among phone calls to DSS, Ombudsmen, state reps, atty general and the media, which we will be pursuing restitution and a reinstatement of the care the doctor is ordering, as well as spreading the word on what this agency is and does.

Protectors Of Animals Inc	277220		/users/profile/342750	lisaraja	Client Served	5	01/19/2016	These people are the best. Judy in particular helped me several times with feral cats in my neighborhood. One mama kitty that kept having litters, her kittens kept dying. I was feeding her over a 2 year oeriod, but couldn't get close to her. She had another litter and we wanted to help her with them so they would survive. Judy put in great time and effort with her own trap, because the cat was too smart for the have a heart trap, and trapped mama and all 5 kittens, got them all spayed/neutered and their shots, and I  adopted them all. After feeding and loving Mama who I named Rosalita, for 10 years, she one day went off, to die I assume, we never saw her again.  I loved her and fed her and sheltered her for 10 years, but never once did she let me pet her. She must have been very traumatized by some human at some point in her short life.  One of her babies died, Felix, he was a sweetheart and we still miss him, and we have the other 4, who are not as feral as they once were, Cougar sits on my lap and let's me pet and cuddle him, sometimes even sleeping with me, and Vixen and Little Bear let me pet them occasionally.  Stripe looks just like her mama, and she will let me pick her up and cuddle her. These babies wouldn't have had a chance except for me feeding them, if not for the selfless actions of Judy from Protectors of Animals. I can not say enough good things about her and this organization!

Young Mariners Foundation Inc	286530		/users/profile/376600	Susan_R	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Teaching children through boating for the Young Mariners Foundation (www.youngmarinersfoundation.org) enabled me to impact many under served families.Children are our future.Boating is my passion.Many children do not have access to boating, despite living within a few miles of Long Island Sound and in an affluent area.Walking daily round Greenwich Point overlooking Long Island Sound, gradually I realized I needed to be ON the water and not just BY the water.  I took all the classes I could and eventually became District Commander of the U.S. States Power Squadrons, the largest recreational boating organization in the world. The Young Mariners Foundation asked me to teach safe boating to 20 under-served children as part of their experiential program educating children through boating. Reworking adult education for 5th graders was a long process but fun, and once in front of my first class, I realized how much I could learn from them.  At the start of the class, I asked; what are you most scared about in sailing? and one answer was capsizing.  At the end of the year I asked; what was the most fun for you? and the answer from the same student was capsizing.  Bringing 20 students through the program, and seeing them grow in confidence, maturity and raising their grades gave me great satisfaction. My program is now used as a best practice for the U.S. Power Squadrons, so extends far further than Greenwich. Rewards have been many and include seeing one student receive Connecticut Teen Volunteer of the Year and another accepted into the High School Sailing Team.  But meeting a parent at the beach shouting to me Hey, Susan  Carlos sailed solo last week! was as good a reward as any.Thanks, kids,  thank you boating, and thank you Young Mariners Foundation for making such a difference.

Crosby Fund For Haitian Education Inc	59345		/users/profile/64001	The Crosby Fund for Haitian Education	Board Member	5	01/02/2011	The Founder's story --In 1999, I visited Deshcapelles, Haiti as a volunteer at the Hopital Albert Schweitzer.  The hospital is located about 50 miles north of Port-au-Prince in the Artibonite Valley, an agricultural area of Haiti.  While I was there, I met a young man named Oltin Roshnaider who  was sitting outside our house studying.  During lunch break, I sat down with him and asked why he wasn't in school on Tuesday afternoon?  Luckily he could speak English, and he explained to me that education was not free in Haiti.  His family was very poor and couldn't pay the tuition and fees.  He had a U.S. sponsor for a little while, but the funds stopped coming, and he was not able to continue.  I looked through his notebooks and it was clear that he was studying on his own.  Oltin was 19 years old at the time and had completed 8th grade.  (This is a very typical stopping point for Haitians). The workbook that he was studying was a 9th grade level.  My heart told me what I should do...   I told him I would like to sponsor his education.  A problem immediately became clear.. how would I sponsor him?  I was leaving to return to the U.S. the next day, there is no mail service in this area, Oltin has no bank account -- he has no money to put in one!  I didn't want to give him the $200 in cash (in 1999 this was the annual fee), because I wanted to make sure that he used it to pay his tuition, books and uniform fees.   So I found a U.S. doctor who worked at the hospital.  He agreed to receive my money and give it to Oltin on a monthly basis, review his receipts and report cards and monitor his studies.  This program worked very well, and I wrote letters to Oltin and through the doctor on a regular basis (this is prior to email being available in Haiti).  Doctors rotate frequently in Haiti and so the doctor passed the baton to another willing doctor and so it went on in this fashion through 5 doctors.    In 2003, Oltin graduated from high school, and I returned to Haiti to see him.  His transformation was remarkable -- seeing him brought tears to my eyes.  He was so proud of his high school certificate (Philo).  I learned then that only 15% of young Haitians graduate from high school, and only 2% go on to post-secondary study.   I truly felt so good about what my husband and I had made possible for Oltin.   We looked around at the hundreds of young people like Oltin who sat on the side of the road not able to go to school, not able to get a job, no future possibilities of success, only a continuation of the cycle of poverty.  My husband and I decided to create a non-profit organization that serves the same function as the doctors had for Oltin.    In 2004, we became The Crosby Fund for Haitian Education, Inc., a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization.  We have an office in Deschapelles with 4 Haitian employees and 7 board members.  The board members, through a fair application process, select the brightest and the poorest students and our organization pays for their tuition, books, uniforms, and exam fees.   Our organization selects students beginning in the 7th grade (tuition is much cheaper for elementary school, and the need seemed to be greater for secondary) and promises them that if they are successful in their studies and work really hard, we will continue their support through a bachelor's degree or a post-secondary certificate.  I big promise, but the incentive pushes the students to work hard.  We offer tutoring to help them succeed.   We have grown from 32 students in 2004 to 155 today.  In our program are  120 students in high school, 10 students in technical school, and 25 students in universities in Port -au-Prince, all studying disciplines that will contribute to Haiti's growth: medicine, nursing, computer science, engineering, environmental studies, business managment, communications etc.  So far we have graduated 2 nurses, and physical therapy technicians and these 4 are employed!  More will graduate this year, and we have been told that there is a good chance that they will find jobs as well in the restoration of Haiti.  NGOs like to hire educated Haitians to help them run their organizations, and there are few qualified Haitians.  Our students will be in the forefront.   The earthquake deeply disrupted our university program, and we lost one of our university students, Antonio Alphonse, in a collapsed university.   Today with a lot of help from our new employee, Vaudy Jean Baptiste, who works with the university students in Port-au-Prince,  all of our university students are back to school and doing well.  The Crosby Fund for Haitian Education is  a positive force in our students and their families' lives, and our impact in Haiti is growing each year.   My husband and I continue to sponsor Oltin privately, and he is in his last year of a medicine degree.  It amazes me that this young man who I met in 1999 will soon become a pediatrician working in Haiti.       With the Haitian illiteracy rate at 55%, and  with 85% of the youth without a high school diploma, where is Haiti's future?  It is clear to us that education is the only way to break the cycle of poverty, violence and corruption in Haiti.   Our organization has the structure in place to grow and help many more very poor Haitian students in the country.  We simply need more funding.

Military Museum Of Southern New England Inc	160775		/users/profile/213158	Turk	Volunteer	5	06/16/2013	This is a great museum if you are looking for a place to take your kids or like American history.  While visiting most museums you can only look at the displays from behind a plexiglass wall, or from behind a barrier, but once a month this museum has "Open Turret Weekend" when you can actually climb up and into WWII tanks, as long as it isn't raining.  (Tanks are slippery if wet.)My favorite interior artifacts- As you enter the WWI gallery, there is a serrated bayonet used by the Germans.  It was such a cruel way to kill a man, it was outlawed, and any German caught with it would not be taken prisoner if captured.As you turn the corner of the museum's first display room, take notice of the map of the world.  All the countries that were involved in WWII are in solid black.  it was the entire globe except for parts of South America and central Africa.  Look up - you'll see one of the dummy parachutists dropped on D-Day to confuse the Germans about where we were landing.Last but not least of the artifacts I find the most fascinating is the signed "Meatball" Japanese flag.  It is the best example I have ever seen.  These flags were given to Japanese soldiers and signed by their friends and families as gifts before these men went off to war.  After the war, Japanese families wanted the flags back if their soldier was killed.  Many U.S. Marines gave them back, but some still remain in the United States.

(Very rare) Thankfully, our pediatrician had expeience with this condition, diagnosed it the day she was born and she had surgery when she was 5 weeks old to remove the cataract. Without early detection, Julia would have lost vision in that eye within the first few months of her life. Early diagnosis and treatment of many eye disorders is critical to saving a child's vision.

Horizons National Student Enrichment Program Inc	90590	3	/users/profile/103375	Marnie	General Member of the Public	5	06/13/2011	I have been involved with this program one way or another since I was a child. My mother (Lyn McNaught) spent over 30 years as executive director of this program at the New Canaan Country School in New Canaan, CT. I worked there as a counselor as a teenager and Horizons was in integral part of my life until my mother retired. She has gone on to serve on the board of Horizons National as Horizons now has programs all over the United States.  I have seen first hand how this program helps inner city children. It is an opportunity for them to get out of their environment and spend 6 weeks in the summer learning and interacting with others. The academic program is outstanding and children enter school in the fall ahead of their peers (or all caught up if they were behind). They also have the opportunity to swim and do outdoor activities. The friendships they ofen make there can last a lifetime. It is truly unlike any "camp" experience that a child can have.

We were roommates that year. Together, with three others, we founded the NYU China Care club, a university club dedicated to raising funds and love for the children of China Care Foundation. Being involved with the organization has given me a new perspective on what it means to care for others. Through raising funds for dozens of disabled children, I have had the opportunity to touch the lives of so many. For this, I am truly blessed.

Before this, I was looking for a feeling of purpose and belonging, I didn't feel like I could connect my technology interests to anything in a meaningful way. When I found Robotics & Beyond, I felt like I belonged. At Robotics & Beyond, I was able to relate to everyone there. They would get my nerdy jokes and understood what I was talking about. These people shared my interests, and this is a huge reason why I volunteer at Robotics and Beyond. Whenever I go to their office, or wherever they are holding a class, it fills me with excitement, knowing that this is a place I belong, a place that makes me happy. Robotics & Beyond also has shown me that I love teaching. I love being able to interact with people who are excited about a subject that I can help them in, and let them expand and grow in, without feeling like they are being judged or that they will disappoint anyone. This is one of the biggest and most important reasons I volunteer at Robotics & Beyond. Please support Robotics & Beyond so more kids can find their passion.

Ordination is available only within our structure and through acceptance, participation and commitment within the Inner Court.We are open to Witches and Pagans of all traditions who honor harm none, which we consider to be a universal tenet of all true spiritual paths. Our practices however are devotional, and are primarily Odyssean tradition, although individual rituals may vary depending on the people leading them and the traditions they practice, but we are not eclectic. For more information about Odyssean tradition, the WCC, and our Canadian Elders, Tamarra and Richard James please visit the Wiccan Church of Canada Web site at: http://www.wcc.on.caWe welcome people of all ages regardless of race, sexual orientation or physical disability.

She told me she had a kitten that sounded horribly sick.  I gave her your telephone number and she called.  Your organization went right out to her home that evening and took the kitten.  It later died it was so sick.I did not know whether any one would go out to rescue this kitten but, they did very quickly.  This organization has grown a lot.  It is entirely staffed by volunteers and desperately needs to build a shelter.   The cats are in foster homes.  If there is someone who could write a grant to obtain money to build a shelter please contact me. Jean Corsini catbird1@atlanticbb.net
Connecticut Community For Addiction Recovery Inc	149674	1	/users/profile/199567	healthcarereport	Professional with expertise in this field	2	02/20/2013	It is of concern that this organization reports a loss for 2011 when the salary and expenses of the leader role is in excess of $100,000 annually. This reflects just under 9 percent of the budget for a grassroots organization. There is no doubt that there are layers of good intentions and work but as many grass root ideas grow the lure of money results in a dull diamond
Kent Kats Inc	190854		/users/profile/249175	patina14	General Member of the Public	5	12/16/2013	If I was a cat in need of shelter my first choice would be Kent Kats.   It is a loving comfortable clean place.  I'd feel safe there.  Being the human that I am, I fell in love there with a 1 year old kitty called Honey.  She is a beautiful long fair haired wise and nurturing angel.  We were meant for each other.  She chose me.  When another potential owner came back to see her, I think Honey pretended to sleep.  When I heard she was available for me, my heart was pounding loud and I couldn't wait to pick her up.... a perfect girl in good health.. flea free due to the great attention she received at Kent Kats.  Honey and I now called Serena... we help out donate what we can each year.

Goodwill of Western and Northern Connecticut, Inc.	278383	1	/users/profile/368319	Writer	Client Served	1	01/30/2016	I wish I could say good things about Goodwill of Western Connecticut, but after helping a disabled family member get a job there I cannot.  Goodwill is supposed to help people who would otherwise be unemployable, but over the last few years as they have remodeled and expanded their stores I have noticed they are acting more like a profit minded business than the charity they purport to be.  At the location my family member worked they fired all the disabled workers and brought in young kids without disabilities.  I also notice the same thing happening at other Goodwill locations.  They don't pay much, and don't give decent raises, unless you consider .25 an hour a decent raise.  This is for the stockers and clerks.  I don't know how the managers are paid. My family member started at $8 an hour and was told that the salary capped out at $8.25 no matter how many years worked.   What I am left wondering is what happened to Goodwill's lofty ideals and stated mission of providing employment and other services for the less fortunate.  Oh, and by the way, when my family member was fired, Goodwill refused to give the earned vacation pay which had accrued over 2 years because they had always said they were "too busy" in the store to schedule the employee's vacation.  That's right - a disabled person was forced to work 2 years without a break and then had the pay stolen!  Disgraceful!

National Theatre Of The Deaf Inc	199584		/users/profile/260540	tomwillard08	Professional with expertise in this field	1	05/03/2014	The National Theatre of the Deaf used to be a source of pride in the deaf community, but in recent years it has become just sad and pitiful.   More than 10 years have passed since the NTD mounted a mainstage production and sent it on the road, which one might argue is their main reason to exist.  Instead, all they do now is maintain the "Little Theatre of the Deaf," which consists of three performers named Christina, Chris and Chrissy who skip around and wave their arms in school cafegymnatoriums in front of cheesy, primary-colored backgrounds. It has been more than 25 years since the "Deaf President Now" protest at Gallaudet University established the precedent that deaf organizations should be run by deaf people.  Yet two years ago the NTD appointed a hearing person to be the director without allowing any deaf candidates to apply. The previous director had been deaf.  When he resigned in 2011, the NTD board appointed a hearing "interim" director and spent the next year doing nothing.  No search at all for a new director.  And then they just handed that hearing person the $65,000-a-year job on a silver platter. As the former executive director of Deaf Artists of America, Inc., I find the NTD's current operations to be deplorable and unacceptable.  I think the organization should be shunned, and no donations made, until the board opens up the director's position again and makes a point to choose a deaf person to run the theater. Let me clarify that a hearing person as director would be acceptable if he or she did a good job.  But the current director is remarkably incompetent.  Look at their website calendar -- you will see entire months in which nothing happened at all.  The last time they sent out a news release was eight months ago.  Their Facebook page has almost 6,500 fans but until recently they would go months at a time without posting anything. I'd also like to point out that I expressed interest in serving on their board, even though it would require a lot of driving from where I live to where the board meets.  My expression of interest went totally ignored.  I also wrote a detailed report on how the NTD could get back on track by focusing on earned income instead of handouts.  It, too, went basically ignored. Disgusted, I started a Facebook page called "Let's Make the National Theatre of the Deaf Good Again."  Tons of helpful suggestions have been posted, but have resulted in no response from the NTD at all. The NTD in its current state is a truly pathetic organization that does not deserve support.  It needs a clean sweep of staff and board.  Anything else is just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

West Hartford Community Tv Inc	286527	1	/users/profile/376597	Sneh_S	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	WHCTV - 'For the Community, by the Community'What inspires me to give to West Hartford Community Television? The intense passion behind such a thankless cause. It's easy to rally around nonprofits that focus on homelessness, hunger, or illness...but when it comes to taking out your wallet - or time out of your schedule - to support your local station, people pause. 'What's so important about community television?'  I asked the same thing when I was nudged into volunteering for the organization by my parents. Fast forward 10 years - after many hours of working cameras, crafting marketing, prepping for events, and discussing strategy - I know the answer.If it werent for community television, hundreds of students, interns, and volunteers (like me!) may have never gotten experience in the world of media, cultivating skills in camera operating, television production, and sound engineering that could inspire dedicated hobbies or even full-fledged careers. If it werent for community television, countless show ideas would die as rough drafts on the page, lacking the nurturing and guidance of an experienced television crew as well as the dedicated airtime offered free by the station to any resident who requests it. If it werent for community television, townspeople would have nowhere to turn to for an unbiased, organic source for news, politics, history, arts and events that make up the heart of our town. This organization is the essence of West Hartford - for the community, by the community as the motto says.Supporting my local station means supporting free speech, creativity, knowledge, and the infectious passion of the WHCTV team that has grown and flourished over the past 35 years. If it werent for community television, my town wouldn't be as great of a community.(Visit the West Hartford Community Television website - http://whctv.org/ )
Ywca Greenwich Connecticut Inc	135992	1	/users/profile/181897	dgnh	Professional with expertise in this field	3	11/08/2012	I spent so much time dedicated to the YWCA in Greewncih, raising funds from donation for years. After putting my heart and soul into to this organization, I was greatly disappointed by how they handle their affairs and even more how they treat their employees.  In essence it is great organization, but awful politics overcome its principles and leave a terrible ache in one's heart.
Holcomb Farm Inc	120005	1	/users/profile/163152	William13	Volunteer	5	08/04/2012	Holcomb Farm was transferred to the Town of Granby in 1990 from the University of Connecticut. It is a monument to Tudor and Laura Holcomb, one of Granby's pioneer families. A non-profit was formed -- Friends of Holcomb Farm -- which managed the property and offered programs since 1992. It evolved into the HF Learning Center and in 2010, with the acquisition of the HF CSA from the Hartford Food System, it was renamed Holcomb Farm, Inc. In 2012, a new relationship evolved with the Town to increase the programming and provide a stronger support system for the building and lands. HF Inc. continues to offer programs and operate the Farm, which benefits the CS membership and several food delivery charities in the Farmington Valley and Hartford. Volunteer opportunities are available with the farming operation, building maintenance, and land conservation activities. Call Jill Ford at 860-844-8616 for more information.
CONNECTIKIDS INC	254728	1	/users/profile/343091	Kiera	Volunteer	5	09/02/2015	This company has been empowering Hartford's youth for over 35 years! Not only do they provide tutoring and mentoring to students in kindergarten through eighth grade through the school year, but they also have a summer program that gives students enrichment opportunities. It's programs like this that Hartford needs to continuously help our young people make better and brighter choices for the future! I love being part of this organization and hope it continues to empower Hartford's youth for years to come! 
Cardinal Kung Foundation Inc	166129	1	/users/profile/220710	TeBe	Donor	5	08/26/2013	Started by the nephew of the late Chinese Cardinal Kung, who was imprisoned by the Chinese for decades. It's role is to expose and educate the public on the policies and human rights violations of China and the scam "Patriotic Catholic Church" that they promote nabbing uninformed tourists.

Connecticut Humane Society	146980	4	/users/profile/174943	rozdow	General Member of the Public	1	12/19/2012	CT Humane has a very BAD reputation!

Special Olympics Connecticut Inc	244505	3	/users/profile/331428	dh1234	Donor	1	06/03/2015	I believe the organization that does the print and tele fundraising for this Special Olympics CT is unethical. For 3 years in a row- after my company has donated following an outreach- we receive another donation form (email and print) with the same pledge amount indicated. This has caused us to contribute 3 times in one year and it is not apparent until we do our taxes at year end. This year we contributed in February only to be re-solicited in May. Keep track of your donations if you choose to support Special Olympics CT monetarily.   
Animal Rescue Foundation Inc	203399		/users/profile/265314	Petlover3	Volunteer	1	06/21/2014	the Board is very controlling and you don't know where your donation is going. New trainer for dogs doesn't know anything.  Very sad after being in charity business for over 40 years.  Need new leadership.
Connecticut Hospice Inc	279019	1	/users/profile/369052	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	02/04/2016	This hospice provides quality care, but they are secretive about their financials, and that's a red flag for me.  There is no audited annual report available on their website, nor are they forthcoming with this information when requested.  Moreover, for being the oldest hospice organization in the united states, this organization is not registered with the Better Business bureau's Give dot Org site.  Something isn't right.
Nature Initiative Inc	40632	9	/users/profile/41536	brooklyngreen	Volunteer	5	05/25/2010	They are a very small organization, but they think big and really make a difference on a very limited budget.  They are also very efficient - the directors and founders cover all of the adminstrative costs with their donations.  So your donations go straight to the eveironmental causes.  In this event, over 200 trees were planted and volunteers were allowed to participate regardless of whether they had donated to the organization.  Everything was well organized.  You can check out their website at www.thinknaturally.org.  It lists lots of things you can do to help the environment.
Alliance For Cancer Gene Therapy Inc	188393		/users/profile/245808	AuntieKitKat	General Member of the Public	5	11/12/2013	I attended a panel of the scientists that do the research and trials for cancer gene therapy, which ACGT helps fund, and I am a vendor of this organization - they are my client.  All of the company and its volunteers attended the recent panel event and are engaged and passionate, knowledgeable about their efforts to fund and bring advancements in cancer gene therapy and to help patients thrive, not just survive.   They are the only charitable organization in the United States that is dedicated exclusively to cell and gene-based therapies for cancer.  They have funded 17 research projects that have been approved for human clinical trials, and 11 of these trials have started. These trials provide scientists and patients with the opportunity to put research into practice  and save lives.  100% of donations to ACGT go directly toward research endeavors. Funding for administrative and fundraising costs is provided separately. $23,200,000 has been awarded for ACGT endeavors. Of that, $11.3 million has gone toward discovery and research, and $11.9 million has gone toward translation into treatments.

Marycare Inc	271627		/users/profile/360490	Anneperkins	Donor	5	11/09/2015	I heard about Marycare from its president, my dear friend Anne Bates, and I was immediately struck by the grass-roots nature of this organization.  Their latest projects are under the guidance of Nigerian doctors and nurses and leaders and Fr. Emmanuel, a Nigerian priest who is pastor of 2 parishes in Hartford, Connecticut.   With their hep Marycare has brought clean water to the priest's home village, Umuoduwa, one of the five villages of Ejemekwuru, a town of 10,000 people in Imo State in rural Nigeria.  This means that the children previously taking hours to fetch unclean water from the river can now be in school, and that the mortality rate has declined dramatically.  And Marycare has also recently built a medical clinic in Ejemekwuru and it is already attracting patients from the region at large, an area completely lacking in medical facilities.   The doctors and nurses are all Nigerian, and are eagerly awaiting extensive medical supplies and equipment which Marycare will be sending over from the USA in the next few months.  Marycare always collaborates with the community leaders already in place--that way there is a mutual giving and receiving.    95% of Marycare's donations go directly to its programs because of the completely volunteer staff in the USA.  
Silvermine Guild Of Artists Inc	61191		/users/profile/66769	c.j. guerin	Volunteer	5	01/26/2011	I've taught middle school students fine arts skills:  Drawing painting and printmaking.  Many of the students find art a way to express themselves that other programs at the school do not.  I enrich their lives by giving them the opportunity to work with me, a professional artist and provide them with the relaxed creative atmosphere they are seeking.   Some of my students have come to my Saturday art class at the Sil;vermine School of Art through scholarships.   They've been given the chance to attend a true art school and partake in the program.   Some have gone on to advance placement art in the High School and still others have gone on the win scholarships to art colleges.  At a time when so many extras are being cut from the public schools, it's great to now that there are p[laces like the Silvermine School of Art who care enough to reach out and helpNot all the art students are artstically talented , but all who attend, even those with special needs, find the program exciting and I've seen a true growth in both their social and art sills.  There are values to my program that extend beyond learning fine art.Through culminating art shows at their school the students have developed a sense of pride and belonging to the larger schoool community

The Joyce D & Andrew J Mandell Greater Hartford Jewish Community	100828	1	/users/profile/125068	Emet	General Member of the Public	1	11/19/2011	According to the JCC's mission statement, it is dedicated to "Jewish identification and the creative continuity of the Jewish people."  Unfortunately, this organization pays no more than lip service to its mission, chosing instead to run its facilities as a for-profit fitness center and preschool.  Examples of its disregard for its mission include:* Running their fitness center and Swim and Tennis Club on the Sabbath* Serving non-kosher food at their Swim and Tennis ClubPerhaps the worst thing about the JCC is the fact that its success with its for-profit endeavors allow it to execute massive marketing campaigns that raise funds which should instead be going to other Jewish non-profits in the region, Jewish non-profits that--unlike the JCC-- excel at their stated missions.

During this time, I have seen the most dedicated volunteers as well as professionals giving their time and their talents to this performance group.  We have had musical and artistic directors with amazing credentials.  They coach us through both musical, dramatic and comedic productions.  Each of us has come from a point of not performing ever in public, to feeling like a star.  We have referred to our organization as a "family".  We are just that close.

Paper For All	52428		/users/profile/53340	emmanuel	Board Member	5	09/15/2010	Paper for All (http://www.paper4all.org) is an ngo made of volunteers only that provides academic resources to improve the learning conditions of children (6-14 years old) in four elementary schools (2,000 children) in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The non-profit aims to support education to enable greater development. Paper for All is registered as a 501 (c) (3) in the US (#109090026), in the UK (#1116888), France (#20020080003) and Burkina Faso (#2007366).The need for academic resourcesBurkina Faso is one of the most illiterate counties in the world, and only one person in five can read and write. Thechildren are very keen to learn but do not have basic academic resources such as paper to write on or a pen. They sometimes resort to writing in the margins of the notebooks used by their brothers and sisters in the prior years.The impactPaper for All tries to help children get access to better learning conditions by distributing essential academic resources: notebooks, pens, pencils, books, chalk, etc.. For instance, before Paper for Alls intervention, Zoe, 6 years old, would come to class excited to get educated, despite leaving her parents behind with the home chores.However, with no money to buy a notebook, she would reuse the notebook used by her brothers and sisters before and constrain anywriting to the margin, the only piece of blank paper left. With 90 other students in classes made for 30 pupils, significantly more efforts than normally required would be required to learn mathematics, literature, etc. With time, Zoe might eventually get discouraged, give up school a couple of years later and get back to helping her parents at home. With no education and the inability to read and write, she would not contribute as much as she could to the development of her own country. Paper for All attempts to help children like Zoe by giving them the appropriate resources, so thatthey get have better learning conditions and eventually become better contributors to the development of their country.The quarterly distribution programme currently targets a select number  of schools in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, or about 2,000 children: Cit de lAvenir (670 pupils) Trame dAccueil A (880 pupils) Trame dAccueil B (500 pupils) Yaaka (150 pupils)Overall, in two years of operations, more than 8,000 notebooks and5,000 pens have been distributed to the children.In addition, Paper for All launched a tutoring programme for 150 children, to assist them for the academic fees, track their performance and distribute supplies such as mosquito nets and lamps, with the same focus, enabling better learning conditions to enable them to have a greater impact on the development on their country.We thank anybody for their support.  This is a small ngo full of great energy to achieve great things.

HAITIAN STUDENTS PARENTS SOLIDARITY ASSOCIATION HSPSA CORP	202492		/users/profile/264191	Simone5	Volunteer	4	06/10/2014	My name is Briyana Mondesir and I am currently twelve years old  and go to school at Harry M. Bailey middle school in West Haven, Connecticut. I am a volunteer for the organization Haitian Students Parents Solidarity Association. They do work in Haiti  helping the children who still struggle after the residual effects of the 2010 earthquake. They donate food and money as well as their time helping these unfortunate people who have to live with so many struggles. This is one of the reasons I volunteer by donating clothes and doing fund raisers to help raise money. HSPSA is a capital organization. This I do not say lightly. This is why I dedicated the book  that I wrote, "Humanely Dark", to HSPSA.  It can be found on Amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com. One of the reasons I wrote a book so young is so that the royalties  could go to this organization to help and finance all the work that they do to help Haitians. I am  quite aware that it is not cheap to do all these things.  In finality, HSPSA does great things and to help them, I did some great things as well.

They claim to have a "Wildlife Sanctuary" but consistently ignore the Bylaws of the Association by ignoring spraying of Pesticides, toxic fumigants, and water polluting chemical fertilizers. To boot, they ignore the fact that they advertise themselves as a "Sanctuary" for animals, but ignore a wretched homeowner who decides to kill a Deer "for fun" and they look the other way. Terrible. Regret buying a house here at all given the arrogance and outright ignorant, belligerent and even hateful behavior of a few who refuse to step down from the board yet dictate the overall climate of the entire neighborhood. They need to be exposed. Sorry, but this is unfair to innocent homeowners moving in from other parts of the world and country who deserve to get their money's worth when they buy a home. I deserve a clean environment, clean waterways without pesticides and toxic fertilizers, intelligent people, kind and giving people, and a TRUE Sanctuary where animals are truly free, and I can peacefully live my life.Everyone deserves this.

I am inspired by their mission to prevent suicide, promote mental health, and create hope for young adults, accomplishing this with their unique programs for colleges and universities. Their tagline is "We're in it for life" and they certainly are "in it for life" every day saving young adult lives, nationwide. There are student testimonials that speak to how their programs are making a huge difference. With suicide rates at their highest number in 30 years, they need support more than ever to help combat these statistics.
Pathways Togo Inc	286990		/users/profile/377062	Winter_H	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Pedaling for Pathways Togo: Our Cross-Country Adventure on Wheelswww.pathwaystogo.orgThis summer my best friend and I crossed the country from Lubec, Maine to Seattle, Washington by bicycle. It was no easy feat. We pedaled through torrential downpours, biked in a high of 110 degrees and slept in a low of 26 degrees. We got lost, laughed, and swore at hills. We slept in unexpected places and shared the road with some of the angriest drivers we have ever encountered. We sported weird tan lines and collected scars that may never fade. Despite the literal and figurative ups and downs  of our trip one cause made it all worth it: Pathways Togo. Led by Peace Corps Volunteers and inspiring Togolese partners, Pathways Togo is an organization based in Togo, West Africa with one goal in mind: educate women and empower the world. Throughscholarships, life skills training, and mentoring Pathways offers a rare opportunity for motivated Togolese women and girls to pursuetheir personal goals and dreams. As one of the poorest nations in the world Togooffers few educational opportunities for women and children; less than30% of Togolese girls are enrolled in high school. Child marriage, pregnancy, school fees, and a lack of role models are only a few of the reasons why many girls never continue their education. One of the initiatives working hard to change this is Pathways Togo.I learned about Pathways first-hand during my two years in Togo as a Peace Corps Volunteer. From 2012 to 2014 I watched Pathwayscreate positive change in thelives of Togolese women and girls across the nation. These girls are intelligent, motivated, and want to learn so they can give back to their communities. Whenever I felt tired or defeated during my bicycle trip I thought of these girls. They reminded me of all the things I have to be grateful for as an American woman and inspired me to continue pedaling so that they, too, can have the same opportunities I have had in my life.After biking 4300 miles this summer over the course of four months we were able to raise $4700 for Pathways Togo--money that will go directly to Togolese girls in the form of scholarships, an annual leadership conference, and mentoring. Countless strangers and friends helped us reach our goal. We are forever grateful. Now, despite having crossed the 'finish line' of our bicycle adventure six weeks ago, we still want to continue to spread the word about Pathways Togo. Because when you educate women, you empower the world, and that's always a cause worth supporting.Thank you for your consideration.

Israel Palestinian Cooperative for Economic Expansion, Inc.	241465	1	/users/profile/328014	Robzwang	Board Member	5	04/21/2015	Peace Through Medicine ~ pushing forward the spread of prosperity IPCEE believes that an essential avenue for helping end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is to push forward the spread of economic prosperity and improved healthcare for the Palestinians living in the West Bank. IPCEEs ultimate goal is to help realize an independent Palestinian State, living side-by-side with the Jewish State of Israel. IPCEEs activities advance economic and physical well-being, but not as a substitute for achieving a political peace: but rather, our initiatives serve to facilitate the process of coexistence that is more worthwhile for the Palestinians  as opposed to the radical Islamist projection of continuing misery and unending conflict. Our current focus is strictly on Health Care in the West Bank  working from the ground up through cross-border activities. Our IPCEE Multi-level Healthcare Initiative is rooted in five pragmatic, core principles: 1. Improved healthcare protects our core human assets: namely, the family and the communities in which we live. 2. IPCEEs activities are deeply rooted in partnership, not paternalism -- in doing things with other people and not for them. 3. Strengthening essential infrastructure and institutional capacity within the West Bank helps to facilitate prosperity and self-reliance -- ultimately leading toward a healthy separation and inter-independence between Palestinians and Israelis. 4. Unlike third-party mediators, we build on voluntary collaboration that is mutually beneficial, so that both Israelis and Palestinians become involved -- out of choice and from the ground-up. 5. Sector specific, cross-border activity such as the IPCEE Multi-level Healthcare Initiative fosters mutually beneficial individual and institutional relationships. To be specific, health care providers share a common language and a particular understanding in the field of medicine, facilitating the drive to improve the physical lot of those living in their respective communities. IPCEE, together with select hospitals in Israel and the West Bank, and in coordination with key leadership, have agreed to promote cooperation in the field of medical care on the basis of mutual respect for each others autonomy  in conformity with the laws and regulations in force in each country and institution, and within their respective available financial resources. The IPCEE multi-level Healthcare Initiative is designed to raise healthcare capacity and delivery to world-class standards, while reducing reliance on Israeli medical facilities, through fellowships between hospitals and improved biomedical training and equipment. The stated goal of our initial initiative model is to improve and increase healthcare capacity and to improve healthcare delivery for the underserved throughout the Palestinian West Bank. IPCEE intends to model the Healthcare Initiative and then to apply this model of multi-level healthcare to other specific areas within the West Bank. The IPCEE Healthcare Initiative will be conducted with three strategic partners: 1. International SOS or equivalent service will provide an independent, third-party review of the existing healthcare system in Jenin. International SOS will identify required healthcare needs and related costs including: appropriate equipment usage and distribution of biomedical equipment, technical training, and medical supplies. 2. The second IPCEE project partner is MediSend International, based in Dallas Texas, and is certified by the United States Certification Commission (USCC) and the US BMET Board of Examiners; and IPCEE and MediSend International will train and equip a workforce of indigenous biomedical technicians in the internationally recognized MediSend BMET Program: Basic & Intermediate, to support hospitals and clinics in the District of Jenin and select hospitals in Palestine. IPCEE through MediSend International will provide the necessary equipment and tools to establish a biomedical school based at Hadassah Ein Kerem, under Israels School of Military Medicine, following the training of MediSend International TOT biomedical technicians in Dallas, TX. 3. The third and critical IPCEE project partners are Israeli hospitals and select hospitals within the West Bank. They include but are not limited to hospitals in the areas of Jenin, Tulkarem, Afula, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Ramallah, Hebron, and Nablus. Cooperating hospitals to-date include: Tel Hashomer, Augusta Victoria Hospital, Ichilov General Hospital, Hadassah Ein Karem, Rambam and Emek Medical Center. These IPCEE partner hospitals agree to provide short and long-term fellowships for physicians and nurses, as well as symposia for training in priority areas identified in the initial ISOS review.  Robert Zwang is Founder and CEO of Israel-Palestinian Cooperative for Economic Expansion, Inc. IPCEE promotes peace and pragmatic cooperation between the Israelis and the Palestinians in the West Bank by encouraging mutually beneficial activities and cross-border relationships between individuals and institutions. Mr. Zwang was previously CEO and Executive Director of the Jewish Federation: Jewish Communities of Western Connecticut for 19 years, directly accountable to the Board of Directors and Federation/Foundation Trustees. Mr. Zwang led an alliance of individuals and organizations whose support and compassion contributed to successful fundraising and advancing community life, the Jewish State of Israel and support for world Jewry. He promoted a culture of innovation and creativity as a means to educate and motivate individuals, enabling a close attachment to the organization and its mission.  Mail: P.O.

Sandy Hook Promise Foundation	286773		/users/profile/376843	Penny_C	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Im going to shoot you.  Im going to kill you. Tom yelled at me while pointing the pistol at me.  I slowly rose up from the couch, frantically yelled put the gun down, you can hurt someone and made my way to the bathroom nearby.  Locked inside with the towels and scented soaps, I noticed the telephone on the counter. This was the 80s, and a phone in the bathroom was an uncommon sight.  Without that phone to call my dad, and the parents of the boy I was babysitting  I could have become one of accidental shooting statistics now reported weekly across the United States.  Thirty-plus years later, I am the mother of two school aged children.  Like many, I reached new levels of despair open learning that 28 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown CT.  The shooter, Adam Lanza committed matricide, followed by murdering twenty children ages 7 and younger, six school staff members, and then committed suicide.    In the three years following Sandy Hook, I got involved in the cause to reduce gun violence.  To me, this meant being vocal about my stance on gun law reform.  I donated to the advocacy group founded by Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly, following her survival of an Arizona Mass Shooting.  I posted my views on Facebook, I spoke with friends and family.  I thought I was doing enough.On October 1, 2015  a shooter at Umpqua Community College stormed the campus killing nine and committing suicide in the process.  This time upon hearing the news, something changed.  I questioned what good I was doing.  I doubted how throwing money at advocacy groups, and voicing my opinion on Facebook was making a difference.  But what had really changed was.I wasnt horrified.   In fact, I felt numb.  I became fearful of desensitization.  Was I indifferent?  In an attempt to rally myself back to a place of being shocked  I watched a documentary produced by Nightline regarding the NRAs rise to power.  Id hoped I would recharge my resolve, and generate new ideas on how to solve our gun violence problem.  But instead, I sat broken.  Defeated.  Its no use.  The NRA has won.  Americans, we love our guns.  We cant win.  Its over. Head in hands, I cried and quit the fight.  The next morning, as a brand new day often does, I found myself staring at an opportunity.  With Facebooks Suggested Page fairies sprinkling their pixie dust on my screen  a beautiful green tree  with leaves made of handprints caught my eye.  I spent the next several hours educating myself on the Sandy Hook Promise (www.sandyhookpromise.org), and rediscovered my soul.  Sandy Hook Promise spoke to me, in a way that other efforts hadnt been able to.  It provided a vehicle for volunteering my time, not just my money and social network.  I could get directly involved in my community.  I loved how Sandy Hook Promises programs were heavily weighted on prevention  not waging war on gun lobbies or alienating responsible gun owners. I loved that the focus was on mental health first aid programs.  That the definition of gun violence was inclusive of suicide prevention & unintentional shootings.  That the programs are predominately youth led.   Volunteering and spending time with kids  teaching them how to be inclusive of other kids, how to recognize mental crisis in their friends and classmates, how to #saysomething to a trusted adult when they have witnessed a potential sign, signal or threat of gun violence.  This spoke to me. That tattling and looking out for your friends and classmates are different.  That we need to have a plan for kids, which they can easily follow, should they encounter a firearm unexpectedly.  That we open the dialogue with youth on these issues, not brush the tough talks under the rug. I loved that Sandy Hook Promises legislative philosophy is based on upholding the rights of gun owners, while advocating for gun safety, gun lethality (magazine size) and that reducing gun violence is not solely about the gun  that Mental Health advocacy, education and programs are key components.  I signed on as a Promise Leader.  A Promise Leader makes the commitment to be an active participate in their community, to bring the Sandy Hook Promise programs to schools, youth centers, places of worship, and any other community organization where we can educate the public on Mental Health First Aid, and other prevention programs like #saysomething, #startwithhello #Keepitsecureandsafelystored (Kiss).  That as a Promise Leader, I will educate other adults on the programs and how to get involved. Before I donated financially, I decided it was time to donate that most valuable of all resources  time.  I created a plan for how I was going to get involved with Sandy Hook Promise within my community, starting with the local middle and elementary schools my children attend.  Sitting in my sons middle school principals office, I was fearful that he would view me as an overly involved, helicopter parent.  I presented my reasons for signing on as a Promise Leader and that I wanted to get our middle school, and other schools involved with Sandy Hook Promise Programs.  That I felt our public school systems were already strapped, and thin on time and resources, and that I wanted to be the heavy lifter to help get Sandy Hook Promise off the ground running for them.   As I sat looking at my sons principal, nervous about what he would say, he began slowly, Penny, this cause is one that is near and dear to my heart.  We are all very concerned that something like this could happen here, in fact, our demographic is not necessarily an if its going to happen in some ways its a when.  Our school already had one lock-down due to a man in a nearby neighborhood brandishing a shotgun as he walked through the streets, so I really want to support this, and in fact have some ideas on how you can get started.  The look on his face, of surprise and gratitude that a parent would want to help them in this way  answered any doubts.  It felt good to show them how much I value all their hard work in caring for our communitys kids. He gave me unlimited access to the staff, suggested a small taskforce of teachers and administrators, communicated with them that this was something they were to get involved in.  He asked me to get involved with the student led News Network and the elected student body and council.  He wanted the programs to be student led  which provided me a huge sigh of relief, wondering how I was going to pull this all off with a full time job, a family to raise, and a 90-lb German shepherd nipping at my feet. We are now in full swing preparing for our first Say Something week.  A week of inclusion and education events which will dovetail with other positive behavior programs that our county has rolled out to districts county-wide.  Despite all this doing and action and communicating  the biggest gift Ive received from volunteering for Sandy Hook Promise- is the return of hope.  That a group of families, who experienced devastating loss, could redirect their grief, for the greater good and provide an unwavering example of forgiveness  I am deeply humbled and grateful for each and every one of them.  I owe Sandy Hook Promise so much in return.

Outrun 38 Inc	286813		/users/profile/376883	Kellie_L	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	OutRUN 38  Outrunning Cystic FibrosisGiving comes in a variety of forms. Sometimes, we give in ways we would never have imagined. For me, it was through running, an activity I discovered late in my life but has given me rewards beyond the obvious physical improvements. Last winter, via the power of social media, I happened to see a story on people making a difference in my state. And within that list, I learned about a non-profit group called OutRUN 38, which seeks to support those living with Cystic Fibrosis, support research for a cure, as well as promote healthy living for all. Cystic Fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disease which affects the lungs and digestive system of more than 70,000 people around the world, and essentially robs them of the ability to breathe freely. This charity was meaningful to me because it involved running, about which I am passionate, and Cystic Fibrosis, of which I am a genetic carrier.Because of OutRUN 38, I am giving practically daily to a cause in which I truly believe. Whenever I run, I log my miles for the charity; I post about my running adventures on social media for the charity, creating awareness for the organization; and when I can, financially, via purchasing merchandise or signing up for an OutRUN activity. OutRUN 38 has given me a way to help that is far more than just writing a check. But OutRUN 38 has given back to me as well, as the charitys Outrun the Odds Facebook community, which features thousands of members around the world, is a support page for everyone who is a part of it, a community where one receives encouraging words for any odds its members may face.The Outrun 38 community is involved in races all over the country, wearing the charitys name on shirts and creating an awareness for a cause about which we are passionate. Just weeks ago, at the Hartford Marathon, nearly 150 runners donned the 'Outrun 38' logo, pounding the pavement in three separate road races that weaved through streets past tens of thousands of spectators.As Outrun 38 'outrunners,' we run for those who cant, especially those with a disease essentially robbing them of their breath. And as a result, our running has become much more than footsteps. It is a healing, philanthropic act. The act of running may bring mental toughness to our mind and brawniness to our bodies, but outrunning has made our hearts stronger and better in so many ways, allowing us give back, help others, and find a sense of community that feeds our souls.
