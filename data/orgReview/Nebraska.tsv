Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	314659		/users/profile/340416	mattdcoan	Volunteer	5	10/26/2016	I have never had a bad experience volunteering with Habitat-Omaha. For the second straight year I am the President of the Habitat-Omaha Young Professionals and over 100s upon 100s of volunteer hours spent with this organization I can honestly say I've enjoyed every minute of it. Our YP group is continuing to grow and new opportunities regularly present themselves. It is a great organization that truly helps the community. A nonprofit where you can actually see the progress and the work that you are doing come to fruition. 
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	252354	1	/users/profile/340416	mattdcoan	Volunteer	5	08/10/2015	I have been active through Young Professionals and as the community service chair for my company for a few years now and the professionalism of Habitat-Omaha is second to none. They are very knowledgeable about Habitat's mission, extremely welcoming and just great people. I will never forget when I did my first Habitat event: I met a Habitat representative that day and didn't see him again for almost 8-9 months, not only did he remember my name but remembered specifics from the conversation we had from months before. That experience made me realize how much they truly care and appreciate the help they get. I will continue to help Habitat for years to come.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	284446		/users/profile/374493	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/02/2016	I have long appreciated the good work of Habitat for Humanity and the Restore.  I work with National, Bellevue and Omaha groups, who all do important work for our country and communities.  The Omaha program is vital to the many families who seek a better life.  Their investment partnership with Habitat makes for an otherwise unavailable home ownership that means community roots.  That more stable home life for the children benefits our entire community.  We are blessed to have such caring dedicated people working and volunteering here.  Thank you all!  Don

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283986		/users/profile/374000	Crystal Rhoades	General Member of the Public	5	03/29/2016	Habitat for Humanity of Omaha and the ReStore has helped families to build and maintain their homes. They provide tremendous resources for working families that enable them to become or remain home owners by supplying them with supportive resources and programming to help them get or stay on their feet.  I'm so grateful for their contributions to our community.
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283964		/users/profile/373974	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/29/2016	I have had the opportunity to volunteer on several Women Build renovation projects.  The crew leaders and staff were very organized and used materials very efficiently.  It was a pleasure to work with the future home owners and see their pride in helping build a home for their families.  Habitat does a great job in improving neighborhoods and enhancing the city of Omaha.  
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283959	1	/users/profile/373969	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/29/2016	I have volunteered with Habitat for Humanity in Omaha several times and every time the staff is very friendly, organized and keeps everyone on task.  They offer a variety of events around the city to get people involved and of course have an excellent mission.  They are very thorough and efficient in their use of resources and build an impressive number of homes a year through volunteer staff.  I am very impressed with their operations and their breadth of services they perform.   They aren't just building houses, they are re-building communities.  They have a very impressive and comprehensive approach to their work.
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283953		/users/profile/373962	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/29/2016	I have volunteered on several builds for Habitat; sometime with my co-workers and other times on my own.  I am impressed with the organization and the homes they build.  Even though built by a lot of volunteers, these are quality homes.  I like that the future home owners put in their own sweat equity to build that house and that Habitat ensures they have the skills to maintain it throughout the years.  On several builds I was fortunate to work with the future home owner and got the opportunity to meet them and their family.  While my intent was to spend sometime to bless someone else, I was truly blessed by the entire experience.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283883		/users/profile/373884	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/28/2016	I have had the pleasure of being a volunteer with Habitat for the last 10 years.  The great people at Habitat have worked with me in finding the best ways for my organization to help at Habitat.  This has usually been through providing 10-12 builders from my organization for 3 different days during the year.  This flexibility has allowed us to help Habitat, while also allowing us to have the greatest amount of overall participation.  Habitat does a great thing for the community and I know that the people that work for me look forward to the build each year.  Keep up the great work!

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283871		/users/profile/373872	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	03/28/2016	Habitat Omaha has been a great partner to work with. Whether it is their hospitality for our community meetings, collaborating on strategies to ensure affordable housing for all in the Omaha metro area, or serving on leadership committees, Habitat can always be counted on. Additionally, the local office philosophy of asset based neighborhood development has made an impact on the way our region looks at community development (lifting up what works, and looking for strengths in the existing community) Oh, and the Habitat ReStore has helped me personally to find items to rehab my house at a fraction of what I'd have to pay elsewhere!
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283858		/users/profile/373855	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/28/2016	Habitat for Humanity Omaha is my favorite charity.  I really believe in the mission of giving a hand up not a hand out. I have been involved in many local builds and am now on the Friends for Humanity Board.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283845		/users/profile/373841	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/28/2016	At my first dedication, I noted the new house was without a lawn.  A local State Senator and I made some calls, that new house became a 'home' with a lawn.  From that time on, Habitat connected with sod distributors and 'green' greeted new owners.  Summing up Habitat For Humanity of Omaha in one word, 'AWESOME'.  When you support them (time, talent, treasures) you actually see the end result and that's 'priceless'  Councilman Garry Gernandt
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283844		/users/profile/373840	NancyPr	Board Member	5	03/28/2016	I have been a volunteer with Habitat for Humanity Omaha for over 5 years and have witnessed first hand the impact the organization has in our community.

In all of my experiences with the organization, I have always been in awe of the passion this organization puts forth in improving the lives of families and the community in which they live.   Whether it be fund raising, managing building costs, developing new programs to help new and existing home owners, transforming whole neighborhoods, or getting families into safer and more productive environments- the Habitat team is all about finding ways to help more families.   The organization has grown substantially from when I first became involved in the group, responding to the demand for its services in the Omaha area.    I am very  proud to be associated with such an effective organization, and the many accomplishments achieved by this organization over the last several years, and how they have positioned the organization to continue to help more and more people each year. 
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283840		/users/profile/373836	Writer	Board Member	5	03/28/2016	Habitat is one of the best run companies in the area.  It transforms neighborhoods and families.  We have personal experience in seeing the transformation.  Good friends have participated in their programs and the purchase of their home changed their lives.  It gave them responsibility and pride.  Their children are in a safer environment and as a result, are exceeding in school.It's not about building and acquiring a home - it's changing lives.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283781		/users/profile/373769	Robb S.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/27/2016	I have been volunteering for Habitat for Humanity since 2010 as a volunteer, project leader/organizer, and committee member on several projects and events.  I became part of this organization because I have a passion for building and wanted to give back to the community.  What I found was an organization that has strong leadership and is well managed, has great people that really care about the mission, and most importantly the projects and events are exciting and fun to be a part of!  It is hard to find all three of these components in not for profit organizations.  Thank you H4H!
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283739		/users/profile/373719	Phil25	Volunteer	5	03/26/2016	I have been volunteering for HH Omaha since 1983 starting on a build with my teen aged son.  Mostly working on trees on the lots they build on. From 2000 till they moved in their new office location I managed their recycling.

This Event is our largest Fundraising event for the year and we always have Habitat for Humanity Omaha as the Benefactor.  We love to give back to the Committee.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283687		/users/profile/373664	Writer	Board Member	5	03/25/2016	Habitat is known for helping families with new housing projects, something at which they excel.  My experience is different, and focuses on their ability to remove blighted and abandoned houses.  It is this activity that is often the last step in rejuvenating a neighborhood; the beautification that is brought, and reduction in crime associated with vacant properties, are as important as providing economical and affordable new home projects.  They absolutely rock.
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283686		/users/profile/373663	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/25/2016	I have volunteered for Habitat for Humanity of Omaha (HfH) to help build homes for the past 25 years.  During that time, I also assisted HfH in purchasing their two office/warehouses and two Restore retail buildings.  Since 2007 I have negotiated the purchase of over 150 vacant lots on which new homes were build.I have always been impressed with the way HfH tries to give their volunteers a good experience.  They are good at expressing their gratitude.I have also been impressed with the their effort to continue to improve the quality of the construction.  I think their houses are some of the best built homes in Omaha.HfH has done a great job to change neighborhoods in Northeast Omaha.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	283667		/users/profile/373643	Writer	Donor	5	03/25/2016	Habitat for Humanity of Omaha is a gift to Omaha.  The folks here work extra hard and give so much to our city.  The impact to the lives of the families they help is so rewarding.  I have had the honor of working on a few projects in past years and annually I enjoy the annual fundraiser another organization I am a member of- Women's Council of Realtors, Omaha Chapter- does to raise money for Habitat.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	252901	2	/users/profile/341034	pcarrier	Volunteer	5	08/13/2015	I have had the pleasure of working with Habitat Omaha in various capacities for over 8 years now. As an organization they really put the needs of the prospective homeowners and different areas of the Omaha area they work in first and foremost. I really appreciate the fact that they involve the homeowners on the front side of things to get them engaged in working towards bettering their lives and living arrangements with some "sweat equity" of sorts with the process. I also feel a contributing factor to the outstanding success of the building programs revolves around the homeowners investment into their new home versus just giving them a place to live in. I feel like it really helps them to feel a sense of ownership and pride in what they've done and where they're  at in their lives.
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	252634	1	/users/profile/340731	RMarkB	Volunteer	5	08/11/2015	I have been a volunteer leader for Habitat Omaha for several years, clocking hundreds of hours per year.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	252420	2	/users/profile/340487	JeremyTG	Volunteer	5	08/10/2015	Habitat for Humanity of Omaha has always delivered a very positive volunteer experience and allowed me to help improve the lives of multiple local families while learning valuable skills from experienced construction staff. I highly recommend supporting Habitat to all of my friends and colleagues as a great opportunity to give back to the community by building a suitable home to a family in need to purchase with a no-interest mortgage.  And, for those considering donations rather than volunteering, ALL of the financial contributions go directly to building the homes and not to overhead costs.
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	252367	1	/users/profile/340428	Robyn25	Volunteer	5	08/10/2015	In 2010, I became a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity  Omaha! I was initially drawn to HFHs motto, Providing a hand up not a hand-out however because of this organizations mission, strong leadership, and outstanding dedication to changing the Omaha community; I was also empowered to build with Habitat for Humanity International in Haiti, South Africa and soon Nepal.  Through these experiences, I have witnessed firsthand that this organization transforms lives! The Omaha staff is empathetic, professional, knowledgeable, passionate about Habitats purpose and the real deal!  They put people over profit and are always grateful for all contributions: volunteer time, donations for the Restore, monetary donations or attending one of their many fundraisers!

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	252071	1	/users/profile/340103	LDiehl	Client Served	5	08/07/2015	Recently my family and I re-tiled and remodeled the "scary" bathroom in the basement--we all known the type--and purchased 95% of our materials from the ReStore.  I didn't find all matching tiles though; instead, I found an array of colors, which enabled us to make a beautiful, color-complex mosaic. The tiles weren't the same material either; along with porcelain, I found limestone tiles, mica tiles, and kaleidoscopic, iron-infused shale tile.  Now a tour of our house includes a geology "lesson" in the downstairs bathroom.  I also didn't see the type of curtain rod I thought I needed.  With what I did find, I constructed a steel cable suspension line to hold up the curtain, held in tension by an antique, cast iron, window counterweight.  At the ReStore you don't always find what you think you need; you find something better that ignites your creativity and allows you to be that person who posts to Pinterest and instructables.com, not the person who copies them. I love the ReStore and would happily drive past 2 Menards, 5 Home Depots, and 16 Lowes to shop there.   -LaRue Diehl
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	252016	1	/users/profile/340037	cjinomaha	Volunteer	4	08/06/2015	I look forward each year to volunteer to help build a home locally in my community.

Highly recommend donating your time and/or money.  The staff is great to work with as well.  
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	251912	1	/users/profile/339908	bart_qualsett	Volunteer	5	08/06/2015	I've had the privilege to volunteer with Habitat in various ways over 20 years.  It's compelling to see the "hand up, not a hand out" concept in action for those truly in need.  I appreciate how Habitat values Jesus' statement concerning those in need, "as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me."
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	251696	2	/users/profile/339677	buildmore	Donor	5	08/05/2015	Habitat Omaha is on my annual giving list!

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	196714	1	/users/profile/257123	kdroessler	Volunteer	5	03/29/2014	I have volunteered through the young professionals group for 4 years now and have had a great experience!

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	196666	1	/users/profile/257054	ODW1	Donor	5	03/28/2014	Omaha Door & Window has had nothing but awesome experiences with Habitat for Humanity. We have donated consistently to the Habitat Restore for several years, but most recently we donated a large quantity of siding. There was a lot of material to be transported and Habitat sent a large and very efficient crew to help move the large bundles of siding. They loaded two semi-trailers and multiple box trucks in one day. It was a well-organized effort and Omaha Door & Window enjoyed teaming up with this worthwhile organization. Their commitment and passion to help families in need is inspiring and we look forward to donating in the future.
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	196526	1	/users/profile/256872	JulieFielding	Volunteer	5	03/26/2014	I started working with Habitat for Humanity of Omaha in the capacity of assisting with marketing.

The team is respectful of their volunteers time and talents, and take their mission to heart.  They are thoughtful strategists and a joy to work with.  There are few organizations that make volunteering  FUN - the Habitat Omaha team has actually got that figured out!
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	196492	1	/users/profile/256834	BillSauter	Donor	5	03/26/2014	Our company first started working with Habitat volunteering to transport useable + sale able product between Des Moines and Omaha ReStore locations on our trucking system. Because of what we saw in how the local Habitat organization has grown as a quality alternative for families that would otherwise not have an option for home ownership, we engaged our customer network for their participation by donating excess home building materials to be used in home construction or to help offet building costs keeping home ownership affordable.  By their actions, the entire Habitat Team has shown us their commitment to serving the community and engaging families that are pursuing a second chance in life. Because of this, our personal commitment will continue for the mission Habitat brings to the area.

I love their strategic approach to developing entire neighborhoods - going well beyond just building homes.

The office and support staff work extremely hard to provide our crews with the technical and logistical support that we need.  This has been a continually improving process that has seen a very positive change over the last five years.  The overall organization has continued to improve the growth in families served and the facilities to support staff and volunteers.  The new safety initiative is another positive step forward.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	177473	1	/users/profile/234032	Buraaga	Board Member	5	10/14/2013	Habitat for Humanity of Omaha is the most professionally run charity with which I have ever worked.  Because of effective and caring leadership, it continues to grow year after year, providing decent, affordable homes for God's people in need.  Habit doesn't provide "a hand out,"  it provides "a hand up" for the working poor who live in inadequate, sometimes dangerous housing.  At it transforms the lives of individual families, it is also transforming entire neighborhoods in our city.  Its impact is immense.

I have never been so personally affected and enriched by a volunteer experience as I have with Habitat for Humanity Omaha.  I have seen first hand, lives transformed, homes built and neighborhoods renovated.  Most importantly, I have seen families of all backgrounds come together under one roof and move forward in their lives.  Homeownership changes lives.  Habitat for Humanity continues to do great things in our community.  I will forever be involved.

Since I first started volunteering in the spring of 2009, they have doubled the number of new and rehabbed homes being completed and begun a much needed blighted home demolition program.  Habitat for Humanity is a fabulous organization and the Omaha affiliate is certainly one of the best and rivals the work of affiliates with much greater population bases.
Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	150618	1	/users/profile/200849	Robert Lynn	Volunteer	5	03/06/2013	I have been a volunteer with H4H Omaha for about 3 years now.  Because I am semi-retired, I am able to put in as many as 30 hours in some weeks.  In that time I have worked in many different roles but I currently spend most of my time helping out in the technology area on the telephony and computer support.  I am also a member of Faithful Builders, a coalition of 8 churches that fund and build one of the many H4H homes in Omaha each year.  At some time or another I have had the pleasure to work with all of the office staff and most of the construction staff.  I have found the staff to be very dedicated and passionate about their work and the necessary and critical mission of bettering the lives of our new homeowners.  The volunteers in our Faithful Builders coalition are their equals in dedication and passion. There are many fabulous charitable organizations that I choose to support with my time, talent, and treasure, but none has been more rewarding to me than my time spent with H4H Omaha.

Through the years, there has been some changeover in staff, but I have had so much support and help from each and every one of them.  I have made lifelong friends and hope they continue to work with us for future builds here in Washington County.  Hats off to Habitat of Omaha!

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	150644	1	/users/profile/200885	Yaravi L.	Board Member	5	03/06/2013	I have been involved with Habitat for a number of years.  I am the daughter of a Habitat home owner and It wasn't until recently that I became more involved by joining the board.  I can tell you that management is determined to improve Habitat and make things better for their staff and volunteers.  In a short time the staff will be enjoying a brand new office and plans are in place to offer the volunteers more training.  Habitat for Humanity of Omaha is a great organization that is growing and doing their very best everyday.  The staff is amazing and management goes above and beyond the call of duty.  They where there for my mom when she needed a home, they where there for me when I lost my job and they are still there for me when I need a referral for a good plumber.  Habitat of Omaha is a young chapter that is growing fast which can lead to some stressful situations but I have seen first hand how management works tirelessly to improve the quality of the organization, the quality of their homes, and the quality of the life of the home owners.

Habitat for Humanity of Omaha	147611	1	/users/profile/195271	Zach H.	Professional with expertise in this field	1	01/03/2013	While volunteering with Habitat, in Omaha, I got to know several of their employees. After a year, I could no longer work there as I watched 1 manager, and 2 Supervisors get fired for disagreeing with the management, mainly because of being overworked and under prepared.  At the same time I observed as there were under performing staff, who were allowed to stay because they were "minorities". (Another direct quote from an HR Manager). Their volunteer management was a complete mess, with groups showing up to the wrong sites at wrong times, and many sites not being ready for the number of people.  I observed as some volunteer groups treated the staff poorly, and continued to work on sites because they were "large donors" (a direct quote from a Habitat Manager).  Overall, I was very disappointed with a local group doing such a dis-service to an organization that has such a large and respectable name.  I have several friends, and families of those mis-treated and even fired by this organization (over primarily political issues) that will never donate, volunteer, and who have little good to say, especially about their upper management.

Unfortunately I met Tom Everson and KKAD25 after my nephew was killed while running on a gravel road.  I am a long time runner and have always been concerned with the safety of runners/bikers/walkers/kids on roads.  My sister was also killed in a preventable car accident when she was only 16 years old so I knew this was the place for me to be.  The group is amazing and Tom does everything possible to make us 'newbies' feel welcome.  I'm not sure where my family would be this first year without the support of this wonderful group and the inspiration it gives.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	308163	1	/users/profile/399550	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2016	Living in Southern Calif on a very busy residential street with an elementary school ( with over 700 students) just down the block, I noticed that traffic was increasing along with the speeders as they passed by my home.  So in 2005, I was looking for resources to addressing the speeding problem here. While searching online I happened to find KKAD25 and contacted Tom Everson about the signs that he used to promote traffic safety. For the past 11 years, I have been using this method to remind drivers to aware of their driving habits and people seem to know the house that has the signs in front of it.  Driving safety is very important for everyone on the roads today with all the distractions that people have in their vehicles.  My signs are out every school day and if it helps make one person safer than it worked.  Thanks to KKAD25 many communities in our nation have been made safer for their residents.  Thank you, Tom!

I use information from the KKAD25 website when I meet with new teen drivers to talk about the responsibility of being a safe driver.  I encourage all to check out the website and apply what you learn, and please consider supporting this great organization.  Keep up the good work Tom! Doug Geyer, Agent, State Farm Insurance, Omaha, NE

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	256850	2	/users/profile/345249	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2015	Through their many outreach events in NE and beyond, Tom Everson & the Keep Kids Alive 25 team have made a positive footprint in the lives of thousands of families across the nation.  Ranging from the organization's massive outreach in community education on traffic safety, to commemorative events such as the annual Live Forward Run, KKAD 25 is truly going the extra mile to honor the lives of children lost in traffic accidents, while impacting public perception & awareness on what safe driving means. Now THIS is an organization committed to changing the statistics, one safe driver at a time.  Most recently, the KKAD 25 team completed an ascent of Pike's Peak in support of their mission, demonstrating once again, that there are no limits to the power of saving lives.  I had the honor of attending a KKAD 25 Live Forward race last Spring, and simply put, am moved by the compassion of this organization to honor each and every child lost, while stopping at nothing to empower each of us to Drive Safely. Great work KKAD25!!! 
Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	256165		/users/profile/344560	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/10/2015	The Keep Kids Alive Drive 25 campaign has strengthened the community engagement efforts between the police department and the community. This helped to solve a community problem (speeding) through education  and awareness coupled with enforcement. In partnering with the neighborhood association and using the resources at the police department, we successfully launched this campaign to slow traffic down in a section of the city that has been a problem for many years. Tom has been instrumental in providing safety information and assisting with the logistics of the signs/decals. We look forward to using this program for many years to come.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	255661		/users/profile/344043	Natersmom	Board Member	5	09/09/2015	I am both a board member, but I am also a parent who lost a child in a car accident. KKAD25 does great educational and outreach programs, but the weekend at Pikes Peak with the other families who lost kids was unbelievable. I was there to run in memory of my son Nate, who was 15 when he died. Nate would have loved to run the Pikes Peak Ascent, so I ran it for him. I really thought that weekend would be mostly about the run, but I was so wrong. This past August we had about 10 families there who had lost a child to a traffic accident. Once you lose a child, you have to find your new normal, but that new normal is no where near the normal everyone else has. But all of the families there have the same new normal that I have. We were free to talk about our kids without having to explain anything. We could talk about our kids without getting that "poor you" look. Sometimes we spend more time comforting people who just found out that we lost a child. That weekend in Colorado, we were free to laugh, cry, hug. smile and share. I never, in my wildest dreams, thought that the fellowship of that weekend would be something that I would treasure forever. The emotional boost of the weekend at Pikes Peak is something that can only be felt, it cannot be expressed in words. KKAD25's mission is to make the streets safer for all, but they have also given an amazing gift to those of us who have lost kids. Ideally, our education programs would end all traffic accidents, but until that happens, we will continue to have our weekend at Pikes Peak to Live Forward and Run to Remember.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	226878		/users/profile/290615	KayFarrell	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2014	When I was president/CEO of the National Safety Council, Nebraska, I had the opportunity to work with Tom Everson and the Keep Kids Alive program.  Tom and his wife, Wendy, were aware of the need for neighborhood street safety programs and began their program in 2008 in response to a tragic incident in our Loveland community in Omaha.  After a childs loss of life, the neighborhood sought help and Tom provided it through the Keep Kids Alive program.  It is fabulous how this program has grown and reached many in the U.S.  (51 U.S. communities in 20 states  this year alone) and around the world in the past 7 years.  Thats not surprising when there is such a need to make our streets safer for all and such a dedicated and creative leader as Tom Everson to meet the challenge.  Statistics showing speed reductions prove the success.  Lives saved are the greatest benefit.  Thanks Tom!

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	169648		/users/profile/224835	Mandy F.	Client Served	5	09/13/2013	My family has endured the over whelming loss of my 7 year old baby boy, Matthew. During this time we have been graced with meeting many loving, caring people and organizations. One of the organizations I would like to recognize is, Keep Kids Alive Drive 25, created by Tom Everson. The mission of this organization is to create public awareness of obeying the posted speed limit signs, especially in residential areas and support families who have lost loved ones due to careless/reckless motorist. This organization has helped me to connect with other grieving families and motivate me in pursing to educate others of the tragedies that can be a result of speeding. We all know it only takes seconds to have a life changing incident happen and all I ask is that people just SLOW down. We, the motorist have taken the responsibility to operate a motor vehicle and should do so with respect to the laws, other motorist, pedestrians and more importantly the children; who may run out into the road for a ball, their dog or on a bike. Mr. Everson has dedicated himself for this cause and has reached out to my family, consoling us and letting us know that we are not alone that there are other families who can empathize that burning overwhelming feeling of emptiness you have left in your heart, feeling as if youre alone, hopeless and broken. Mr. Everson is making a special trip to meet with me and my family on Sunday, to have dinner and show his continued support. It takes special Angels here on this earth to comfort a broken heart and we are honored to be able to meet with him. We will forever be grateful for Mr. Everson and this cause.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	169388		/users/profile/90100	kylefoster03	Donor	5	09/12/2013	I had the privilege of meeting Tom 10 years ago....under the worst of circumstances.  My son's best friend was hit and killed in front of his house on Halloween, 2003.  He was 10 years old.  The speed limit was 30 mph.  He stepped out between parked cars and was struck down by a teenager on her way home from school.  Witnesses believed she was exceeding the speed limit, but a Grand Jury failed to find her at fault.After reading an article about Tom's organization in a family magazine, we contacted him for advice on getting the speed limit lowered in our neighborhood.  Tom did WAY more than offer advice.  He came from Omaha to Mesquite, Texas to speak before our City Council.  After that, our House Representative got involved and authored a Bill  which was later signed and written into Texas law, making it easier for cities to lower speed limits in areas of need without a costly traffic study.  Tom traveled to Austin with us to testify before a House Committee...... I believe that his knowledge and testimony is what convinced our Governor to sign the Bill.  After the Bill became a law, our city of Mesquite immediately changed all residential speed limits to 25.   I will forever be grateful for his involvement and dedication to his organization and to the families and friends who have suffered such a great loss.   I have followed Tom's activities since 2003 and will continue to donate as long as I am able.  Keep up the great work KKAD 25!!
Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	82100		/users/profile/90100	kylefoster03	Donor	5	03/13/2011	I became involved with Tom Everson's group (KKAD 25) after my son's best friend, Kyle Foster, was hit and killed by a teenage driver in front of his house on Halloween, 2003.  Tom met in person with a group of us who wanted to get our city to lower the speed limits on residential streets.  He was instrumental in providing research data regarding speed limits.  He spoke with us in front of our City Council and then travelled with us to speak before a Legislative Committee in Austin, Texas. Within a year's time, a Bill authored by our State Representative, Elvira Reyna, was signed and passed by our governor.  The Bill allows cities to by-pass lengthy traffic studies in order to lower speed limits where they see fit.  I'm confident that his support was instrumental in changing the residential speed limits here in Mesquite, Texas.  I now donate monthly to KKAD25 and smile with a heavy heart every time I see the speed limit signs on our streets. Through Tom, Kyle Foster will never be forgotten.  With much gratitude,  Susan Lopez

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	80584		/users/profile/87956	4ever9	Donor	5	02/28/2011	We learned about KKAD 25 the hard way - the way that no parent wants to find out about an organization. On November 23rd, 2004 our 9 year old son Justin was hit and killed on a road by our house. The speed limit was set at 40 mph through our subdivision.  After Justin was killed we read an article in the USA Today about a similar incident in Texas and how an organization called KKAD 25 had helped get the speed limit reduced on that street.  We emailed Tom Everson and he called us back the same day. Tom helped us as we took on our city to lower the speed limit in our subdivision. He provided his expertise and his compassion with our situation. With his help we were able to have the street that runs through our subdivision restriped to a 2 lane road with a center turning lane instead of the 4 lane road. He also helped us to get the speed limit reduced to 35mph. We wanted the speed limit reduced to 30mph but this is all that our city was willing to do. Tom Emerson is an awesome man. He had the insight of such a simple concept-lower the speed limit to 25mph through neighborhoods- and the fortitude to promote this concept and organization with his strong convictions. Tom started this organization after realizing how fast people where driving through subdivisions. He wanted to be proactive about getting his message out to the public. Tom did not start this organization because he lost a child. Tom Everson started this organization to help get this message out- Keep Kids Alive Drive 25- something every driver should remember. KKAD 25 is a great organization with lots of information and statistics every driver should be aware of. In today's society everyone is always in such a hurry. If only the driver of the car that killed Justin would have been driving 5 mph slower the chances of Justin's survival would have been greatly increased. Please don't let the few seconds you save by speeding be the last 2 seconds of someone's life. Sincerely, Gordie, Vicki, Jordan, Justin and Jesse FaustLee's Summit, MO

I have seen the way traffic flies down the hill at our school (yet the city does nearly nothing to slow them down); my own daughter watched her junior high friend get hit by a car not 2 feet from her on the way home from school one day  (did a back flip, lost her shoe, and miraculously received no fatal injury); and I even received a warning ticket years ago for driving too fast near a school (in summer, so I didn't realize the speed limits were "on").  Keep Kids Alive Drive 25 is SO IMPORTANT in getting the word out.  The phrase, "Don't let the two minutes you save be the last two minutes of someone else's life." sticks with me... almost hauntingly.  I hope it sticks with EVERYONE who hears it. and if they all take it to heart, the lives that are saved may one day be my grandchildren, the kids at my school, YOUR children, YOUR neighbors, and YOUR friends.    This is the single most important organization I have come across during my first year as a PTA officer.  EVERYONE needs to know about this group, their message, and the means to save lives!   Keep Kids Alive Drive 25 deserves respect, donations, and recognition for the wonderful job they are doing to educate and reform drivers while saving lives.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	75409		/users/profile/82371	aaronharley	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2011	Traffic safety seems to be a thing of the past. Texting, talking, reading, writing and not paying attention to driving are now the standard.  Speed limits are routinely ignored, tailgating is the new norm, as is passing in no-passing zones, not dimming your brights, and acting as if nothing bad will ever happen. Those of us who believe in traffic law, and have advocated in our communities for safer driving, have been disappointed when local law enforcement and governing bodies shrug it all off . Tickets are only written for 10 MPH or ABOVE the speed limit.  Traffic calming is poo-pooed. our communities suffer, with no recourse. Some people never learn, until there is a dire consequence. KKAD 25 has stepped in to fill the void. Helping to advocate for victims and their families, to support local grass-roots traffic safety actions, and to provide the tools for the average citizen to fight back against those who really can't see beyond their own narrow, irreponsible actions. This is what a non-profit is supposed to do.  It is about being accessible, providing important information and making itself available to provide seminars, training and more for those who advocate for safe roadways, and also for vicitms and their families. For all they do, KKAD 25 should be given accolades. They are impacting the lives of EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US in a positive manner, whether we know it or not. It might be that that driver who would have hit you yesterday, slowed down because they learned a lesson from a KKAD 25 roadside, or heard a community presentation on safe driving, or learned of a fundraiser in the memory of a deceased pedestrian.  It really does matter. It really is effective. Even making one person stop and think before driving is a life or two potentially saved. I attended a seminar in NJ about 10 years ago, where KKAD 25 was instrumental in encouraging law enforcement in our communities to take these issues seriously, set up neighborhood traffic monitoring, and provide the community with resources to stop dangerous drivers.

And, with these gifts comes the tremendous responsibility of keeping them safe. Keep Kids Alive Drive 25 is an on-going campaign through-out the United States to continually reemphasize that safety on  the streets is within our hands. Make sure that everyone in your household knows the city speed limit is 25, and to drive faster is to put someone's life in jeopardy. Also, order a KKAD25 sign to put in your yard to remind others that we all need to keep our speed limited!

KKAD has been instrumental in efforts to change speed limits entering into, and leaving school zones in  the state where he lived, thereby making streets safer for children.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	74478		/users/profile/81374	Buff	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2011	We have the KKAD 25 signs in our neighborhood. I think they really help. We have so many children on our street and anything that can be done to help keep them safe is a good thing. I know it always makes me check my speedometer when I see the signs in any area. There may be other programs like KKAD 25 but the dedication of these people is obvious as I have seen the signs in areas all over Omaha. They have worked to spread the movement across the United States and it's working. Thank you KKAD 25 for your tireless efforts to protect our most beloved and valuable treasure - our children.
Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	72408		/users/profile/79165	ralloyd	Board Member	3	02/21/2011	My wife and I became aware of KKAD25 after our daughter Shannon was killed in an automobile/bicycle accident in front of our house in June 2001. While speed was not considered a factor in the accident, driver inattention was surely a cause.  It was an inexperienced 7 year old bike rider (fresh off of training wheels) and an inexperienced 17 year old car driver, unaware of his surroundings as he drove through the neighborhood. We met Tom Everson at our church and his desire to help prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again was evident. He really wanted to help.  Through our conversations with Tom over the next year and a half, we were convinced this was a worthwhile organization that we should be involved.  We joined the original Board of Directors when KKAD25 became a non-profit.

His energy, attitude, knowledge, and belief in the cause are a few of the reasons we support Keep Kids Alive. In addition to this, we simply believe in the Keep Kids Alive mission. There needs to be a change in the behavior with regard to acceptable traffic habits inside neighborhoods. The accidents and speeds at which people drive in these areas has become a silent epidemic that is simply swept under the rug as an "accident." We need to change this way of thinking, and Keep Kids Alive is without question an excellent springboard to achieve same.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	66457		/users/profile/72639	Gerry L	Board Member	5	02/10/2011	 As HOA president, I was always looking for ways to remind drivers to slow down, obey stop signs and be more alert. No one wanted more speed humps... and other "traffic calming" devices were pretty expense. Our city Traffic Manager suggested I look into KKAD25, so I did. Tom Everson, the founder of KKAD25, was very helpful in explaining the program and made a number of suggestions on what would work best in our particular situation. We invested in Yard Signs, Waste Can Stickers and Entrance Signs.  We were the first neighborhood in our city to use the KKAD25 program. Since then, the City Council and Police Department have adopted the program and a number of neighborhoods have invested in KKAD25.  We have found that the variety in size, location and messages of the signs creates passive reminders that people really notice. And the nice part is... no training, no fees, no minimum investment. You can do as much or as little as your neighborhood wishes.  In our case, our waste management company paid for the entrance signs as a community service and the city installed them at no charge! A great traffic calming program!
Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	66016		/users/profile/72165	almero	Donor	5	02/10/2011	KKAD25 is an outstanding organization.  Tom Everson has made it his life's work to educate citizens about pedestrian safety.  In a world where everyone is moving full speed, KKAD25 reminds us that taking the time to slow down and be aware of our surroundings when driving may be the difference between life and death.  I believe that every local, county and state government agency should embrace KKAD25.  At a time when police budgets are being cut and there is not enough manpower to effectively patrol and enforce speed limits, KKAD25 empowers local citizens to stand up and make a difference in their community.  I am proud to be associated with KKAD25 and Tom Everson.  Thank you for all of your efforts.  Keep up the good work!

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	64193		/users/profile/70173	Daniel Hanlon	Client Served	5	02/07/2011	The Keep Kids Alive Drive 25 program has been extremely well received in the community of New Berlin WI for many years.  Our citizens have embraced this program with yard signs each year.  We have also used permanent street Keep Kids Alive Drive 25 signs in some of the major problem areas.  As with most communities, speeding in subdivisions remains a constant problem.  The signs build an awareness that neighbors are concerned and want the violators to be aware of the danger and to slow down.  We also run radar sets in numerous neighborhoods in conjunction with the signs.  Tom Everson has been terrific to work with and his sincere concern to remind drivers to slow down is evident when you speak with him.  We appreciate all he has done for our community.

Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	63320		/users/profile/69230	Chocolategoldenticket	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I started a Chapter in Maywood NJ, Bergen county many years ago, in memory of my Brother who was a Police Officer in Tuckerton NJ. As a community we were able to put the KKAD25 Trash can stickers on all the recyclable cans in town.  And we were able to purchase the Large signs to go around town as well.  I just wanted to make the streets a bit safer.   About 5 months into starting this, as a family we went to an event down the street from my home.  When we walked home my then 4 year old decided to break away from my hand and run into the street to go to our home.  We were literally across the street from my house.  An SUV was driving up the street a supporter of KKAD25 and her husband was able to stop the vehicle within inches of my son's body.  I was a supporter before but that day I turned into a BELIEVER.  Awareness, suttle reminders, all of this truly helps!  It SAVED my son's life!  
Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	62766		/users/profile/68625	bbendar	Volunteer	5	02/03/2011	I learned about Keep Kids Alive - Drive 25 a few years ago from a friend of mine in our home town of Forked River, New Jersey.  The concept that Tom has put forth sold me on the organization immediately.  There's only so much that the police and public saftey personnel can do to make sure our children and our future is protected, but by having the reminders of driving safely when children are around spread around town (via Lawn signs, garbage can stickers, etc.) reinforces the goal in "real time" and redundantly.  Every time we have had signs available for folks in town, they've gone faster than hotcakes.  I can't tell you how many times complete strangers have stopped me in front of my house to ask where I got my lawn sign.  I'd like to see more events around Monmouth and Ocean Counties in New Jersey like the 5K I participated in in Colts Neck two years ago.  KKAD25 is an organization that not only strives to keep our children safe, but also strengthens the feeling of "Community" within your town at the same time.
Keep Kids Alive Drive 25	62671		/users/profile/68514	Sgt. Robert Dudash	Professional with expertise in this field	4	02/03/2011	I am very pleased to write about Keep Kids Alive Drive 25. This program has been going strong in Edison  Township, NJ for about 5 years. During which time we have focused on residential neighborhoods primarily in close proximity to schools, public buildings and parks. Our goal has been to reduce speeds of vehicles and hopefully prevent a horrific accident. Our program has ben multi-faceted, we utilize: signage along the roads, placement of a speed trailer to remind drivers of their speeds, we go door-to-door handing out literature and encouraging resident participation in the program, and finally we add additonal traffic units to run radar enforcement in the neighborhood.  SPEEDS HAVE BEEN REDUCED! I would also like to thank Tom Everson and KKAD25 for their updates and assistance whenever needed.  I encourage other towns to get involved to protect our most important resource, our children. Very truly yours,Sgt. Robert Dudash Jr.Edison Police Department

We have heard countless stories about speeding and wreckless driving in residential areas where our children play.  Through implementation of the program, residents feel they are making a difference and report that drivers do take notice of the yard signs.  With support from KKAD25, we organized a "walk" to call attention to problems related to driving too fast where children play.  We have worked with Norfolk PD, who appreciate this program for what it does to make Norfolk streets safer.

I met him at the "Towards Zero Deaths" conference in Minnesota in 2008, after my husband was rear-ended and killed in a traffic accident. Not only did Tom provide support and empathy, he asked me for my story and if I would like to be involved in a new campaign targeting tail-gaters. I said yes and he created "It's Not a Race! Create Space!" to honor my husband and me. Over the last two years, he has worked tirelessly to get our new initiative off the ground and onto the back of semi-trucks throughout the country. He always keeps me current with the various organizations and grant requests he submits. We have had some success, and some disappointments. But Tom is always positive and so respectful. When the organizations has its annual run, Tom always writes to me with the news, t-shirts for the event, and how he and his family will keep James' memory with them all the time. Keep Kids Alive Drive 25 is a responsive, caring, and hard-working non-profit that I recommend to everyone I know.

We provide shopping cards to elementary aged children at our local Penney's store.  We get referrals for the children in need from counselors/nurses at our local schools and then schedule the children into a time slot offered for shopping.  The children come in, get their shopping card and an amount allotted and away they go.  The sparkle in their eyes is beyond our expectations and is so fulfilling.  Some children have never been to a department store let alone get new clothes!  What would these needy families do without Operation School Bell?  Their teachers always tell us the students come to school the next day in their new, clean clothes and it is an obvious boost to their self confidence.  It is so satisfying to me as a volunteer to see these children and hear their stories knowing that Operation School Bell is making a huge difference in their young lives.

First hand I saw the benefits of their fund raising efforts as clothing, shoes, and a book was given to those needy children. Through my career in the public school system I saw more families struggling to provide for their children with the increase costs of food, gas, shelter along with job losses and an influx of immigrants with limited resources.

I had heard about the program, but never really was involved, so it was interesting and exciting to be a part of it!  The professionalism of the staff at ALO was amazing, especially when I had made a few errors in my submission and they had to bail me out!  The parents were grateful and the kids were excited to participate.  It was heartwarming to see the kids come to school 'strutting' in their new clothes!  What a wonderful program.  Thank you for all you do!
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	312346	1	/users/profile/403699	Redinbjl	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2016	Assistance League of Omaha is a wonderful organization!  Every fall, they serve students through their Operation School Bell by allowing them to shop for clothes they need and coats for the upcoming winter.  These shopping nights and weekends are very well organized and the students love getting the chance to pick out new clothes.  The next day, you can see these students beaming with pride in their new clothes.  What a blessing this organization is to the Omaha Community!

I recently got to spend some time with these wonderful people at the "Operation School Bell" event that I have actually had the pleasure of attending 3 yrs. In a row now and Ive thanked God for the Assistance every year.  It gives my son and myself some quality / positive time together shopping for clothes/coats that without the help would probably be a stressful situation, as I'm sure some of you know.   I really would like to say thank you  to the members of this awesome organization and how appreciative my son and I are that they continue to be so careing and so friendly.  Thanks you guys you are all amazing!!!

Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	287927	3	/users/profile/378109	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/02/2016	As a member of this organization for over 8 years, I am very proud to say this is a groupwhere the majority of our 350+ members all support and work our philanthropic projects.It takes our large membership numbers to cloth over 3400 local school children, supportSanta Monica house, distribute clothing for assault victims, give bears for children at hospitals, assist with ACT/PSAT and involved with teen parents.

Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	287679	1	/users/profile/377807	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/29/2016	When it is cold outside it is hard to arrive at school ready to learn - if all you can think about is how cold you are from walking there without a decent coat. It is hard to concentrate on studies when your shoes have rubbed painful blisters on your feet because they are two sizes too small and you try to hide your embarrassment when your teacher asks why your parents don't get you new shoes.It is hard to make friends at school when you try to avoid questions about why you wear the same clothes everyday. It's hard to be young and poor and powerless to change your situation.Operation School Bell provides 50 children at our inner-city school with the opportunity to shop for a warm coat, shoes that fit, or a few outfits to allow them to fit-in with friends.The faces of the children change every year - but the excitement and positive effects to those served is always the same. Better attendance - more focused on studies and peer acceptance. For many of the children it is their first time in a mall or 'new' store. The first time they can actually choose their own clothes and have things that are the right sizes or 'fit'.We are so thankful to have this opportunity for some of our students each year. It has truly been a blessing.

Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	285892		/users/profile/375932	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/14/2016	We are an all-volunteer philanthropic organization that raises money throughout the year to fund our efforts. The biggest of these is Operation School Bell, which provides new school clothes each year for needy children. Last year more than 3500 local children were helped. We also provide assault survivor kits to all the area hospitals. When a woman is assaulted, the clothes that she's wearing are often needed as evidence. The kits consist of a season-appropriate top and bottom, undies, and a toiletry kit, which allows the woman the dignity of being clothed when she leaves the hospital. These are just two of our programs that are in place to primarily help women and children in need.
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	285780		/users/profile/375808	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/13/2016	The  Assistance League of Omaha is a remarkable group of volunteers that continues every year with many wonderful programs for the community.  The Operation School Bell program that clothes 3400+ children in need throughout the city with new school clothes,  and adult programs also that help victims of assault, those in need of help in job search, and many more programs make this an amazing group in the accomplishments every year.

Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	285733		/users/profile/375755	HuskerFan2	Volunteer	5	04/12/2016	As a teacher, I knew first hand how this program impacts the children in this community. I had many of my students who received new clothes, coats, jeans and gloves. Now that I am retired, I am part of this wonderful organization. This fall, we will clothe  about 4,000 children with new clothing. This is one of my favorite events because as I watch these children look and try on new clothing, the smiles tell the story. At the end of the evening, they love to show off their new clothing and their brand new book. So many hugs, smiles and a big thank you from the parents and children, make this event worthwhile. But this is not the only program that our organization does for the Omaha area. We provide kits to assault victims, teddy bears to fire and police to give to children, and our teen program and Santa Monica program make a difference in the lives of the people we serve. What a great organization!!

This program clothes children in need in the Greater Omaha area by holding a Shopping Event at JCPenney Westroads Store for two weeks in October.  The Kindergarten through 8th grade children are selected by the school based on a number calculated using the free & reduced lunch program statistics.       One of the reasons I am so proud to be a member of Assistance League is that we are an all volunteer non-profit 501(c)(3) and have no paid employees.  Our members share the responsibilities of all the tasks/jobs within the organization...Leadership, workers, office staff, Thrift Shop Management, Bookkeeping, Retail staffing,  for all our programs.  Besides Operation School Bell (our largest program - 2015 children clothed 3423) Assault Survivor Kits , Addiction Recovery for Women,  Education Support for Teen Parents and their children as well as incentives to graduate from high school and then to continue their education,  the support of the ACT/PSAT Reviews by hiring the teachers and providing enrollment for the classes, and providing Teddy Bears for children in crisis situations through the police, the firefighters, the justice system and health care facilities.

This group provides clothing for children in need.  Originally these clothes were provided through our own little shop.  Several years ago we entered a partnership with Penneys and now the children come to the store to choose their own clothing.  Last year 3500 children received clothing and a gift card to Payless Shoes.  Recently counselors, nurses, and teachers were surveyed to see if this clothing influenced the children who received them.  The responses were resoundingly positive.

Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	238413	4	/users/profile/323651	cnorah84	General Member of the Public	5	02/23/2015	I am an elementary school teacher in south Omaha. I have taught 5th grade for 7 years and have had over 45 students benefit from the Operation School Bell program. Teaching in a high poverty area means that many of my students have a great need for clothes that fit and an appropriate coat for the wintertime. My students are always so excited to get the opportunity to shop in a department store  and love to show off their new stuff at school. Most of my students have also told me how kind and helpful the ALO volunteers were when getting their new clothes. Several of my parents have personally thanked me for nominating their child to receive new clothes because they want the best things for their child, but can't always provide it. A big thank you to Assistance League of Omaha, NE for providing this service to children in need!
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	238200	4	/users/profile/323316	sylOmaha	Volunteer	5	02/18/2015	I heard about the Assistance League from a dear friend. She told me about all the projects that this organization was involved with in the Omaha area. Because I taught 30 years in an elementary classroom, clothing students in need through Operation School Bell touched my heart deeply. The first night I worked on this project was uplifting and emotional.  On this very cold windy, rainy evening, I assisted two young boys who were limited with English skills. They came in flip-flops, very thin shorts and a T-shirt. One of the boys had on a very ragged coat. As I interacted with them, I knew they needed jeans and some shirts. The question about a winter coat was answered after much probing. The boys came away with everything they needed for our cold Nebraska winters. At check out, they also received a book of their choice. The most important ending to this story was the smiles on their faces!
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	238100	6	/users/profile/323153	PublicEducator	General Member of the Public	5	02/16/2015	As a public school teacher, I have witnessed the need for adequate clothing for school children in need and warm coats to endure the Nebraska winters.  Operation School Bell, a philanthropic program of ALO, provides  clothing for needy area school children.  For many of these children, it is the first time they actually get to shop for new clothes.  ALO will also provide emergency clothing when contacted by various agencies that work with children in crisis.  Having family members and close friends that work with foster children makes me very aware of the need.  Many of these children arrive with the clothes on their backs or all of their worldly possessions in a paper bag.   ALO also provides teddy bears for first responders and hospitals to give as comfort to children.  The ALO  programs also help women recovering from addiction, provide clothing and toiletries for women that have been assaulted, support for a program that helps teen parents graduate from high school, and more.  The women in this organization volunteer many hours to raise the funds to support these programs and to carry out the goals of the organization.  They make our city a kinder and more loving place to live.
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	238058	4	/users/profile/323091	AMBM1	Volunteer	5	02/15/2015	I have been volunteering with Assistance League of Omaha for 5 years.  This organization gives one the opportunity to help others in our community who are less fortunate or who may be in difficult or crisis situations.  Our motto "Touching lives - Making a difference" inspires our members to take action, not merely talk, when seeing a need for assistance or support.  I see from the inside the many dedicated, admirable women who give their time unselfishly to improve the lives of others.
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	238056	5	/users/profile/323086	Rosemary12	Volunteer	5	02/15/2015	I have been a long time volunteer.  The fulfillment with ALO however has been optimum.  As a member, one can find many ways to meet the needs of children and adults in the greater Omaha area.  Seeing the joy on children's faces when they try on their new clothes provided by ALO's Operation School Bell is heartwarming.  I also love to see our Thrift Shop customers smile as they find treasures in our shop.  The simple fact is that ALO and its members provide a chance to serve others!
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	238054	5	/users/profile/323083	CharleneMarie	Volunteer	5	02/15/2015	I have been a member of Assistance League of Omaha since 2007.  I joined after retiring from 30 years of teaching; I met wonderful, dedicated, talented women who are passionate about helping others.  We work very hard to raise enough money to support our programs. Assistance League of Omaha has offered  many opportunities for growth both personally and professionally.  It's work feeds my soul.  Our signature program is Operation School Bell, which provides a shopping experience at a mall and new clothes for over 3400 children each year. Here is a thank you from a 6th grade English language learner: " My new clotes made me feel about how I shood be happyer about my life.  After I got my new clothes I felt happyer.  When I first try them on I felt like "Wow".  I was astonished by the new clothes. I wore them on the first day!" Here is another from a 5th grader:  "Thank you for your gift.  Now I have many clothing and thanks for the head phones that came with the shirt.  My mom was happy.  I got good clothes Because of you, I couldn't have done it without you.  Thanks for the shoes that you could by with the gift card.  Thanks for putting money for use and it is hurting to be cold so you needed a jacket so we don't miss school or be sick.  What should I say.  You guys thank you so much.  I wish I can set a party for you guys or I could make you guys the Best." Seeing the joy on the children's faces makes all of our work worthwhile.  Knowing that women who are assaulted can leave the hospital with some dignity feels good.  Helping women who are overcoming drug and/or alcohol dependency transition back into a productive life is gratifying.  Encouraging young teens who have become parents too early to stay in school and celebrating their achievement is heartwarming.  We do much good work.  Assistance League has changed my life.  I am thankful for it.
Assistance League of Omaha Nebraska Inc	237286	7	/users/profile/321743	SJeanneH	General Member of the Public	5	01/25/2015	Our daughter was sexually assaulted. One positive moment during that horrific evening was when she was handed a kit containing a change of clothing and a hygiene kit so she could shower, brush her teeth, etc. In the kit was a piece of paper that said, "Provided with caring concern form the Assistance League of Omaha."  When a woman is physically or sexually assaulted, law enforcement takes all her clothing as evidence.  We discovered that ALO provides Assault Survivor Kits to all Omaha area hospitals and, in fact, is the only nonprofit or agency who provides this wonderful service. Because of ALO's kindness, our daughter was able to walk out of the emergency room with some dignity.
Global Partners in Hope	271941		/users/profile/360863	Writer	Donor	5	11/12/2015	 I can imagine a better nonprofit. They are frugal in their expenditures for their team and generous to those served. They try very hard to do the best for everyone. They have a great vision and a great team.

I had the opportunity to go to Togo with them and really experience what GPiH's goal is. They really want to bring life into every part of the world. Whether that be energy, water, etc. Very, very cool organization. 
Global Partners in Hope	267521		/users/profile/356252	Writer	Donor	5	10/26/2015	Justin and the crew at GPiH have been a tremendous organization to work with for our school service project.  They have given presentations about the amazing work they do, worked with our students on renewable energy projects, and we even got to meet some of their partners from Mali and Togo.  We look forward to continuing our work with them to raise money for their projects in West Africa.
Global Partners in Hope	266755	1	/users/profile/355512	Writer	Former staff	5	10/23/2015	GPiH's mission is to bridge the gap between those who need help and those who can provide help.  As a former employee, I saw first hand the positive influence GPiH provided in training church and business leaders.  GPiH helps develop skills to handle personal habits, such as time management, financial management, and human resource.  Training is also centered on how to handle relationships in a variety of settings, such as business and church. This is accomplished through the use of biblical principles.  
Global Partners in Hope	266604		/users/profile/355365	Writer	Volunteer	3	10/22/2015	Global Partners in Hope was very  active in the conception and implementation of projects in West Africa ( Togo).By its commitment , GPIH installed a solar panel in a village in Togo called Wogba. The village of Wogba  is without electricity.This project will  help the school   and the  students  to benefit from electricity  for example   studying  at night time  or to use to the electricity to power computers.In addition GPIH is  currently working to install  a clean water well in the village of Agbelouve (TOGO).In summary GPIH is doing a pretty neat job helping communities around the world( TOgo; Mali , China ,Kenya ..etc)Thanks GPIH...

Additionally, Their staff is responsive to questions and driven to steadily increase their impact on the global stage. We're proud to support their work because we know our donations are used responsibly and that our help is truly appreciated.
Global Partners in Hope	265140		/users/profile/325258	KendallN	Volunteer	5	10/19/2015	I've been a volunteer project consultant as well as an event volunteer for this nonprofit, and they are fantastic. They're easy to work with, responsive, and welcoming, but most of all, Global Partners In Hope truly cares about their mission, and they've done so much good in the world already.  I highly recommend donating to, volunteering for, or working with this organization. You won't regret it! 
Global Partners in Hope	264992		/users/profile/353729	Clark Young	Volunteer	5	10/18/2015	Getting to team up and participate with Global Partners in Hope has been one of the greatest experiences of my life.  This past year I got to travel with them to Togo, West Africa and document some of the work they're doing.  My life is forever changed for the better!!
Global Partners in Hope	264700		/users/profile/275685	SteveSD	Client Served	5	10/16/2015	A very personal and engaged staff that efficiently use the resources at hand to accomplish the goal and mission for Global Partners in Hope.
Global Partners in Hope	212631		/users/profile/275685	SteveSD	Client Served	5	08/28/2014	As a church located in a university town - I have so appreciated the vision of GPiH in wanting to involve the university, town and community to impact Mali with wells and clinics. They are very encouraging and sensitive to our situation - not a "one size fits all" type of organization!
Global Partners in Hope	264613		/users/profile/353336	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/16/2015	The organization is committed to serving those who are the very most desperate, and then assuring that the work is self-sustaining, so that the benefits continue.  The provision of medical clinics and care where there is none, the training of locals to serve in the clinics, the provision of water wells where there is none, and the provision of solar electricity where there is none...all of these lead to life changing circumstances and hope for the hopeless.  Since I have supported this organization, I have seen it build a hospital and 6 medical clinics in one of the poorest countries in the world.  Amazing.    
Global Partners in Hope	264544		/users/profile/353265	Writer	Donor	5	10/16/2015	We've loved giving to and being a part of the GPiH mission in Africa and China, and seeing the great work being done in communities that truly need help! 
Global Partners in Hope	264532		/users/profile/353253	Writer	Donor	5	10/16/2015	My company helped sponsor a well in Togo with GPIH.  Originally, I personally had no real connection with the project.  However, in June, I was able to go with a GPIH crew to Togo to visit the site where the well is now being built and see first hand the project's impact.   I was very impressed by two things.  First, the impact that every dollar has in that region.  With a small contribution, you are able to effect major sustainable life difference to the people.  Second, the surgical precision and in which GPIH works.  With a small crew, GPIH goes directly to the heart of the matter and does what needs to be done without a lot of fluff.
Global Partners in Hope	264529		/users/profile/353250	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/16/2015	Have been a contributor for many years and they have helped many people in many different countries.  Wells and medical clinics and living water. God bless the work they do and to God be the glory forever and ever.  
Global Partners in Hope	264483		/users/profile/353208	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	GPiH is very personally invested in their areas of ministry. I appreciate their investment in all of their volunteers, and are wonderful to work with. I especially appreciate their commitment to sustainability in overseas ministry, aiming for not being reliant on ex-pat presence for their work to continue. 
Global Partners in Hope	264461		/users/profile/353183	Writer	Board Member	5	10/15/2015	One Christmas my family and I wanted to make a difference in the world. Knowing that GPiH worked building wells in Africa, my family and I sent money to help build a well so people in a village could have fresh water. With no delay, the well was built and people had water. This was a rewarding experience to me and my family. It was one way for our family to help others in need. GPiH is a wonderful nonprofit helping other around the world.
Global Partners in Hope	264426		/users/profile/353148	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/15/2015	I've had the pleasure of translating video footage and correspondance for GPiH on several occasions. I have read and heard firsthand testimony of the work this nonprofit has done in Mali, from people who have directly benefitted from the wells and medical centers funded by this nonprofit. It is truly overwhelming to consider how long rural communities have gone without these basic necessities--GPiH is actively meeting an incredible need, and having a huge, lasting impact on the lives of current and future generations. 
Global Partners in Hope	264413		/users/profile/353137	Andrew92	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/15/2015	GPIH is a young and energetic organization that already has a global scope. One of the most impressive aspects of their work is that they work through local people who have a vision to improve their own communities, rather than coming in as outsiders to impose solutions. They have been able to assist communities with practical projects in nutrition, healthcare, energy, and education in a way that is empowering rather than creating dependency. I highly recommend this organization.
Global Partners in Hope	214915		/users/profile/278237	Kyla2	General Member of the Public	5	09/12/2014	This past summer our church's Vacation Bible School had the pleasure of raising money for clean water relief. When we initially made the decision to do that, I knew that we should give that money to Global Partners in Hope.  They were somewhat local to us, & I trusted their philosophy & their own mission towards helping those in need. Through the entire summer, & on through VBS, Justin was always available to answer any questions we had, & also to get us any figures & stats that we needed to inform & encourage our congregation in their giving to our mission cause. We enjoyed being able to show the GPiH videos to our church & VBS. We know that our monies will be put to work in the best possible way in helping those less fortunate in Mali, Africa. 
Global Partners in Hope	213217		/users/profile/276372	marilyn88	Donor	5	09/03/2014	Global Partners in Hope is a nonprofit dedicated to meeting the needs of poverty stricken people in Mali West Africa and now expanding into Togo.  In Africa, GPIH is passionate about meeting the needs of the people, both physically and spiritually.  They raise funds to build water wells with a goal of making clean water accessible.  They provide reliable electricity to areas where electricity is very unreliable by installing solar panels, and they provide consistent medical care to people in areas where none is available.  They have done an amazing job of developing relationships with local leaders in the areas where they provide aid.  They are highly respected by those leaders and welcomed with open arms.  GPiH is doing a great job of engaging the communities of Omaha, Lincoln and surrounding areas.  Educating all ages of the needs is an important part of the work and I commend them for being very effective in doing this.  Churches, businesses, students, and schools are eager to help when they learn of the needs.  GPiH also provides leadership training to many in China.  At the request of Chinese leaders, seminars are held to provide training in ethical business practices, etc.  I'm very impressed with the team GPiH has assembled.  It's a pleasure to be a small part of such a fantastic group.  We who have so much are obligated to help those in need.  My dollars are put to great use by donating to Global Partners in Hope.    
Global Partners in Hope	212821		/users/profile/275911	Laura206	Volunteer	5	08/30/2014	    When I first found out about Global Partners in Hope, I sent them an email because I wanted to get involved with them.  I was impressed with all that they had accomplished, and how they put both thought and heart into what they do. I got a friendly response right away from Justin. Now me and my student organization are helping them fund-raise to build a well in Mali. Justin has gone to great lengths to support my organization in fundraising by helping us plan events, give detailed presentations on campus, and showing up to group meetings.    The best thing about GPiH is how they work with the people they are trying to help; talk to them and listen to them, to make sure that they getting what they need. For example, before installing a well or medical clinic in Mali, they ask local leaders where the need is greatest. GPiH also makes sure there are people in Mali who know how to maintain all structures, so they are not dependent on outside help. GPiH empowers people, and that is why I am proud to help them.
Global Partners in Hope	212731		/users/profile/275810	Cogua	Volunteer	5	08/29/2014	As an instructional leader at our school, I found partnership with GPiH an excellent way to give students service-learning opportunities with both local and global relevance.  The staff was highly visible and involved in partnering with us as we designed and implemented service-learning projects and community events to raise awareness and funds for our project.  For many students, these events were the highlight of their school year.  Not only were students able to give back to our global community, but they were also engaged in learning activities related to our learning standards.  Partnership with GPiH was a rewarding experience for students, their families, teachers and staff.  The project didn't stop when the funds were raised, GpIH is coming back to give students opportunity to see the impact they made through video and pictures of the installation of the solar panels for a school in Togo, Africa!
Global Partners in Hope	212646		/users/profile/275703	robertstoo	Volunteer	5	08/28/2014	Global Partners in Hope has dedicated members that go far beyond the call of duty.  Justin drives all the way from Lincoln, NE to Omaha just to make it to meetings. It's hard for me to make it from the painting studio down to the student center on time. He's never late?!  As a result, we have gained valuable leadership skills and have been exposed to a number of networking options that make our operations run a lot smoother.  Thank You Global Partners in Hope!
Global Partners in Hope	212641		/users/profile/275698	principal2014	Volunteer	5	08/28/2014	As the principal of a Global and International Studies and Dual Language Magnet Center, I appreciate the partnership that we have formed with Global Partners in Hope.  This partnership allows our students to be involved in hands on activities that show them that they can make a difference in the world, both locally and globally.  It has been an honor to work with GPiH and we look forward to continuing this partnership.
Global Partners in Hope	212635		/users/profile/275691	Jim_110	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/28/2014	I work as a missions pastor in a church that has worked with Global Partners for several years. They have provided us with information and inspiration to support their ministry in Mali. We look forward to another year partnering with them in 2015. 
Global Partners in Hope	212634		/users/profile/275690	Nees	Volunteer	5	08/28/2014	As the Director of Chldren's Ministries at  our church, I was looking for a mission project for our Vacation Bible School last summer.  Our pastor was familiar with Global Partners in Hope and suggested that I look into the possibility of working with them.  Their staff did a great job of sharing their passion for their ministry to children and families in Mali . . . and they did a great job of giving us support as we presented our mission project to the kids.  Because  of their help, the project went very well.  We not only surpassed our fundraising goal, but I felt that the kids' hearts for serving others grew as well.  It is obvious that Global Partners in Hope have a passion for what they do - - that they are very organized and professional about how they operate their organization - - and that they are planning carefully and prayerfully for its future.
Global Partners in Hope	212624		/users/profile/275679	ekeit	Volunteer	5	08/28/2014	They're an organization  with a good heart.  They work hard to better the lives of less fortunate  in different parts of Africa by providing fresh water wells,  medical clinics,  and reliable sources of energy.  They also work with  student organizations  at my university to help raise awareness and educate  the public on these issues that need attention. GPiH is a great nonprofit with a lot of caring people. 
Global Partners in Hope	187298		/users/profile/244292	Kristen LaMontia	Volunteer	5	11/01/2013	GPIH is a life changing experience for everyone involved!  As an educator, my eyes have been opened to inequalities around the world. How precious a drop of water truly is to a child, a parent, a friend!  Not only does GPIH educate the need for clean water, they assist even the youngest child to understand that helping others is essential!  Not only can we make a difference in our city but thousands of miles away!  My students are blessed to be a part of the GPIH organization and our heart strings are forever connected to our friends in Mali!
Global Partners in Hope	187074		/users/profile/244075	huangyinyan	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I have volunteered twice for GPiH in 2013. GPiH relies on His wisdom and provision for all its projects. GPiH's work in China is greatly impacting business leaders, families and society. Through various programs GPiH offers, Chinese people learn how to apply universal truths and biblical truths to their own lives and also get trained to train/lead others. This Lead the Leaders, Train the Trainers model is bringing lost ethnic value, family value and individuals true identity back to Chinese society. I enjoyed working with GPiH and I plan to work with this organization again in the near future.
Global Partners in Hope	186746		/users/profile/243751	Manuela2	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	Global Partners in Hope understands how necessary it is to engage with people and their suffering. That, I believe, is the key difference of their work, which they don't see only as public policy, but they see as a sigh of HOPE, something that is long gone in places such as Mali, China, and many others. As a volunteer, I felt that even my smallest contribution was granted as significant for the whole NGO. The network they have built is strong, well prepared, diverse, and that environment makes each action pretty valueable for the communities where they work.
Global Partners in Hope	183565		/users/profile/240477	heart4him	Donor	5	10/28/2013	Global Partners in Hope first caught my attention when I heard they were putting water wells and medical clinics into remote villages in Mali, West Africa. I learned the people had to travel 10 miles, sometimes more on foot to a medical facility, including in emergency situations. I heard stories of pregnant women having to walk during labor to give birth in a facility, and some even riding motorcycles while in labor. As a mother and as a doula, this broke my heart. Global Partners in Hope was doing something about this, and I wanted to be a part of that, and so I joined in.  I have wanted to be a missionary in Africa since I was 7 years old, and this seemed to be a good way to start helping there. I led fundraising efforts for our church, and GPiH came alongside me and supported me where they could, spreading the word and giving me access to information. After our fundraising goal as a church was met, GPiH personally thanked me for my work, and even invited me to meet a man who lives in Mali, and was helping to coordinate their work there. The highlight was that I was invited to join GPiH during the dedication ceremony in the village that we specifically raised money for! The most incredible story that I have heard from all of the work that GPiH has done is that in one village there was only 1 man that was a Christian. When GPiH announced that there would be raising funds for 3 water wells and medical clinics in their area, this man stood up and said, See! I told you they would come! I told you the Christians would come! And so, they have, and many of the villagers have heard the Good News of Jesus Christ, and have been saved! Not to mention now have access to clean water, medical care and pharmacies, something I take for granted daily. Global Partners in Hope is an amazing non-profit organization that I hope to be associated with for a very long time to come. Mali is not the only place they are working as the hands and feet of Jesus, and I plan to follow them and join them whenever I can in bringing hope and life to desperate people. 
Global Partners in Hope	183212		/users/profile/240115	koutiala08	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I first met Ian in 2007, when I worked as an intern in his department at Christ Community Church.  I've learned so much from him about cross-cultural communication, helping impoverished peoples by working with respected local leaders and engaging those around me in international development work.  It's largely due to his influence in my life that I am pursuing my own international development career.  Ian has decades of experience working and living abroad that give an inestimable advantage to Global Partners in Hope, allowing the organization to have the impact of an organization many times its size. I've enjoyed working alongside Global Partners in Hope since the summer of 2010, when I approached Ian Vickers about starting a university-student led organization, the World Energy Project.  Global Partners in Hope has since been our (the World Energy Project) parent non-profit, teaching us about everything from international communication and donor relations to fundraising and nonprofit finances. The World Energy Project wouldn't be able to carry out the work of designing and installing renewable energy systems in the developing world without the expertise of Global Partners in Hope.
Global Partners in Hope	182907		/users/profile/239789	cbayliss	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	I've been volunteering with GPiH since it began.  Through the years I've helped with the website, written the newsletter, traveled to China, and helped with other organizational tasks.  I love that the organization is relatively small in size but has such a big impact.  Because of this, I can see how the work I do makes an impact.  I also believe in the leadership of this organization - they have an amazing vision and are truly passionnate about the work they are doing.
Global Partners in Hope	182253		/users/profile/239022	ahalp	Volunteer	5	10/24/2013	I've had the privilege of providing communications support to Global Partners in Hope and have been very impressed with the way GPIH is impacting lives in unprecedented ways. Their founder and leader, Ian Vickers, brings lifelong experience in global outreach to the organization, casting a vision that has already resulted in the creation of medical clinics and clean water wells in Mali, West Africa. And through his network of connections, GPIH is partnering with Chinese leaders to open doors to minister to the needs of business leaders throughout China. This organization has everything you'd look for in a solid nonprofit -- vision, mission and passion. And they are making lasting and sustainable change.
Global Partners in Hope	182103		/users/profile/238864	Eric Maas	Donor	5	10/24/2013	I have worked with and given to this organization.  GPiH was able to provide Mali West Africa villages with wells and medical facilities not only because of their ability to raise money but because GPiH was able to bring together educational organizations, corporations, religious groups, and governments for the common good of those in need. They also host and provide educators monthly in Beijing China for business ethics and leadership classes that are now self-funded because GPiH wants their donors financial gifts to go farther. I can say with all confidence this is an organization that has its heart and, just as importantly, head in the right place for helping those in need. On a personal note: My wife went on a missions trip in the summer of 2007 hosted by GPiH where she met a 9 year old girl by the name of Gou Xing. She lived at an orphanage that GPiH helped support. One year later Gou Xing became our daughter Addison Maas, and that's what GPiH does so well bring people together for the common good of all of those involved.
Global Partners in Hope	181931		/users/profile/238686	jfsteele	Board Member	5	10/24/2013	I have known about GPiH for a number of years but became directly involved this past year.  On three occasions I taught classes for GPiH in Beijing, China.  These were life-changing experiences!  Working to fulfill the mission and vision of GPiH in China has taken me out of my comfort zone and broadened my view of business and ministry.  Now that I am a board member representing Crown College, I will have the opportunity to assist GPiH more directly not only in our work in China but in our work around the world.  I look forward to many years of serving this excellent ministry.
Global Partners in Hope	181731		/users/profile/238458	Gayle777	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	It has been such a privilege and honor to be part of several short-term mission trips to Beijing with Global Partners in Hope.  I have been able to see and experience firsthand the excitement and joy while interacting with these exceptional young Chinese Christians.  Their desire to learn and grow in their Christian faith is something I have never seen  here in the USA.  Our teams go to China to train and share our Christian faith and lifestyle, yet we come home far more blessed and humbled by how much they have taught us by their passion and love for Christ.  I have always been impressed that Global Partners in Hope is totally "above ground" in China, with full cooperation from the government.   I know Ian Vickers personally and greatly respect him for his heart and vision for the unsaved in China.  I am looking forward to returning to China with GPiH in 2014.
Global Partners in Hope	181574		/users/profile/238304	Larry Sharp	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	It has been a blessing and privilege to be involved with GPiH since the fall of 2010.  God has given favor to GPiH  and an open door in China that they have used  wisely.  I have made two trips to Beijing (my wife three) and it has been amazing  to see  how young believers  we have met from earlier visits continue to grow in their walk with the Lord.   Their sacrifices and desire to learn and grow more is an inspiration. GPiH has a solid team on ground in Beijing with great connections within  the Christian community.  God is doing amazing things in China and GPiH is part of His plan for China.  Ian Vickers, CEO of GPiH, continues to provide solid leadership working with the ever- changing times in China.   
Global Partners in Hope	181273		/users/profile/237987	mwaring	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	It has been a pleasure and privilege to have been associated with Global Partners in Hope since early 2010.  My church in the San Diego area has been in successful partnership with GPiH for several years.  Through this partnership, I have lead five teams to China that have changed many lives in both China and the U.S.  The people on our teams are forever changed by the warm loving welcome of the Chinese believers.  Witnessing their love and hunger to know more about our Lord is humbling and always inspires our own spiritual walk.  Our Chinese friends are eternally changed by the mature teaching and caring mentoring of our church members.  Our partnership is a perfect win - win!  It is with great joy and anticipation that we leave shortly for a sixth mission to Beijing.   The GPiH China team has consistently provided highly professional and competent services in a friendly and loving manner.  Ian Vickers, CEO of Global Partners in Hope, consistently displays the qualities of a godly servant leader in addition to being far sighted, intelligent, and hard working. It is a great honor to serve the people of China through Global Partners in Hope.   
Global Partners in Hope	181267		/users/profile/237979	JR Waring	Volunteer	5	10/23/2013	My involvement with Global Partners in Hope has been as a member of the Connecting with China ministry at my church in the San Diego, California area.  This ministry was begun as a direct result of the churchs partnership with GPiH. Through Connecting With China ministry, our church members have the opportunity to minister to house churches, pastors, and business professionals via numerous short term missions.  I was included on two of these mission trips and was able to see first-hand the energy and the servants hearts of the Global Partners in Hope staff in China.   The partnership between GPiH and Crown College is very exciting. Both the Business Track and the Pastor Track are excellent for reaching those groups most likely to be able to multiply the efforts to bring Gods Word into application in day-to-day life in China. It has been a pleasure to see the GPiH mission in China evolve as God has opened new doors there and I am looking forward toward greater involvement in the future.   Thank you again for providing the opportunity to serve the people of China through GPiH. Best regards,John Waring
Global Partners in Hope	180746		/users/profile/237439	dreynolds41	Donor	5	10/21/2013	I had the pleasure of working alongside of GPiH very intimately when my wife and I lived in Mali.  I was there as they began engaging with rural Mali to build water wells and clinics.  They entered the culture in a very respectful way that didn't undermine the authority nor disrespect the culture.  They do a nice job of empowering local leaders and dignity is preserved because of it
Global Partners in Hope	180048		/users/profile/236691	Jill51	General Member of the Public	5	10/19/2013	My husband and I were there in 2007 at the beginning of what is known now as GPIH in China. That first experience changed our lives forever.  I really enjoyed forming personal relationships with the Chinese people, young and old, and to see how they are so eager to learn about Jesus and were unafraid to worship freely.  This brought overwhelming joy to us. Visiting the huge city of Beijing, seeing all its history and knowing the Lord is opening doors for us to better serve the people is so exciting.  Come with GPIH and see for yourselves and experience this wonderful adveture God has given us.!
Global Partners in Hope	179954		/users/profile/236598	Don_23	Board Member	5	10/19/2013	I am very pleased to be involved with Global Partners in Hope.  This organization is involved with work in some of the poorest areas of West Africa, bringing health clinic services, water systems, related solar energy power and education to an area of the world that is desperately in need of such things!  This organization is also involved with leadership and family training in urban China, where a great deal of change is rapidly occurring for nearly everyone, where the traditional family structure is crumbling, where they are rapidly progressing into a capitilistic age without the underlying traditions upon which successful capitalistic societies have been based.  Accordingly, I believe that Global Partners in Hope is doing a huge amount of good in areas of the world that are in great need of such good.  
Global Partners in Hope	179811	1	/users/profile/236451	phuman	Client Served	5	10/18/2013	Global Partners gave us a chance to participate in the building of a medical clinic in the Bako Region of Mali, West Africa.  We raised money for a deep water well and to build a clinic and maternity ward.  The project was completed on time, and the team that traveled to Africa to dedicate the project was OVERWHELMED with the genuine gratitude of the village.  Our experience with Global Partners was excellent.  They are humble servants who more than delivered on their promises.  
Global Partners in Hope	177819	1	/users/profile/234409	erich.j.fiser	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	I have been affiliated with GPiH for nearly a year.  In that year, I have come to know the heart of the CEO and the quality of people he surrounds himself with - unparalleled.  One of the great things about GPiH is the fact that the work that they do (dig water wells and build medical clinics in the worlds poorest countires) is accomplished so efficiently - instead of paying for teams from the US to go out and do the work of digging and building, they use locals thus freeing up thousands of our dollars to serve the greater good.  I like seeing my money utilized in a manner that is effective and not wasteful.  The entire staff and board of directors are incredibly accomplished and so very humble, rest assured that you will do well to give to Global Partners in Hope.

The organization gives back to the community in many ways by assisting people that are homeless and near homeless to pay back money owed, gain skills to obtain employment and rebuild their lives.  The Executive Director and staff along with the Board of Directors consistently work to continue to make the organization better and to  further build upon the programs offered.

Hope Harbor	79615		/users/profile/86947	suep	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	I've been a board member for over six years and have volunteered many times when the help is needed, be it painting the renovated building, helping out in the office answering phone calls or helping out with donated items. The clients have been super and are great to work with. I've had a few times that I just needed to sit down with the clients and listen to their stories of how their life had been before they came to the shelter to seek the help they needed. They are very thankful for all the great things that they have experienced at the shelter be it the financial planning classes, paying off their bills, seeking a job, cooking classes, and just the day-to-day things they need to be responsible for and how to take care of themselves and/or their children. The clients appreciate that they have a place to call a temporary home, hot meals, clothing, and then moving on to be self sufficient and to find a place they can call home once they are back on their feet and feel they can make a real life for themselves.  Hope Harbor is a non-profit organization and depends greatly on community support with monatary donations, food, clothing, bedding, furniture, and other household items.  After working as co-chair on the Capital Campaign, we found that some of the community never heard about Hope Harbor. We got the word out about the great things Hope Harbor does and had a very successful campaign which has moved the shelter to be a well known place in our community and the support we receive it good, but there are always needs and with a full shelter and the bad economic times, help is always needed to keep the shelter open.  Hope Harbor is very dear to my heart and I will continue to be there for them in any way needed. 
Hope Harbor	79571	1	/users/profile/86901	jk0207	Board Member	5	02/28/2011	I have served on the Board at Hope Harbor for nearly three years and am currently serving as the Board Treasurer.  I chose to serve and continue to serve on this Board because of the essential and effective services it offers to women and children of our community.  Hope Harbor not only provides shelter for those families in immediate need, but then provides these women with training and resources to become self-sufficient, productive members of society.
Hope Harbor	79559		/users/profile/86887	Sean-Bigb B.	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2011	Just knowing a few of the people who work for Hope Harbor has opened my eyes to the immediate needs of Women in trouble. I cant imagine having to live in a car with a child, or out on the streets with a baby. The things Hope Harbor can provide for these women is nothing short of amazing and I am pretty sure most of the people they help feel the same way!! 
Hope Harbor	71197		/users/profile/77832	Becky	General Member of the Public	5	02/18/2011	As a health care provider, I have seen the effect that Hope Harbor has had on several families.  Single moms learn parenting and financial skills and get a boost in their self respect while living at Hope Harbor.  I appreciate the staff there helping to facilitate care while keeping the client ultimately responsible for themselves.  Hope Harbor's mission is needed and appreciated in our community!
Hope Harbor	70747		/users/profile/77331	Lynn Rathjen	Board Member	5	02/18/2011	I have served on the Board of Hope Harbor during this last year.  Prior ot that, I did volunteer work on the new building renovation.  I love this  program.  Besides offering shelter, Hope Harbor provides education and life changing programs to residents to help make them independent when they leave the shelter. Temporary help is often needed in any community but it is most important to offer the means to succeed beyond the temporary help, and Hope Harbor does that for those at the shelter.   Lynn Rathjen 
Hope Harbor	70591		/users/profile/77162	Jim T	Board Member	5	02/18/2011	When a woman is without a home and living with her children in a car, Hope Harbor provides a place of security, education and reahbilitation for those seeking assistance.  Commited to putting women and families back on their feet, it is one organization that looks at the individual needs of its clientel and provides a plan for them.  Not just housing, but training, support and a sense of worth.  Hope Harbor is not just a place to stay.  It is a place to grow.  The goals and actions of Hope Harbor are why I joined the Board and Volunteer when able.  The people in need come first, not the image of the organization.
Hope Harbor	69398		/users/profile/75834	jwgroff	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	My business has donated prizes for fundraisers and I and my wife try to donate household items that we no longer use to the shelter in hopes that someone else may find it useful again.I have seen first hand how the staff cares for the individuals and families by volunteering at the shelter. The staff knows they can call on me to help with any minor repairs and handyman work. The families that Hope Harbor serves seem to be genuinly happy and appreciative of the services that the organization provides to them.
Hope Harbor	68783		/users/profile/75165	EllenH	Board Member	5	02/15/2011	I have served on the Hope Harbor Board of Directors for over 4 years in addition to being a donor, and have seen tremendous growth in this organization.  We had a successful capital campaign with strong support from the community that allowed us to complete much needed renovations to the facility.  We have an incredible staff that is dedicated and compassionate, and works hard to assist their clients in reaching their goals.  We also have a strong and commited Board of Directors that does a great job of supporting the staff, and providing the resources and guidance needed to help us meet our mission of:  "Lifting those in need to lives of sustainable, self-sufficiency".  Hope Harbor is more than just a shelter.  It offers an opportunity for those falling on tough times to gain independence and self-confidence.  They work with a case manager on an individual case plan, take many classes that are offered, learn budgeting and personal finance, pay off debt and establish a savings, all in preparation of obtaining permanent affordable housing and self-sufficiency.  I have had a number of clients tell me that they don't know what they would have done without Hope Harbor, and that it truly made a difference in their lives.
Hope Harbor	68738		/users/profile/75107	Marv	Donor	5	02/15/2011	My first encounter with the Hope Harbor (HH) as a member of the funds distribution committee for the United Way. At the time, HH was servicing those in need out of an extremely old and cramped facility in north GI. The facilities however, did not deter HH from providing services to those in need. Since my first introduction to HH I have watched the organization garner community support to allow them purchase and relocate to a much need larger and more functional facility. Subsequently, HH conducted a successful fund drive to allow upgrades to their new facility to better serve those in need.           
Hope Harbor	67776		/users/profile/74084	Joni K.	General Member of the Public	5	02/14/2011	I have been the Social Work Intern supervisor for three students who chose to complete their internships at Hope Harbor. I recommended Hope Harbor as a Field Placement Agency to the Social Work Department at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Students at Hope Harbor get a wide spectrum of experience in the human service field, including hands-on case managment. It is always a tremendous learning experience for the students. They learn to set boundaries with clients and co-workers, to enforce rules, to celebrate client successes and to experience the consequences of client choices that result in expulsion from the program. Hope Harbor provides a balanced program for clients and a well-rounded education for students.
Hope Harbor	66006		/users/profile/72154	Donna	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/10/2011	As a service provider, I believe we are very fortunate to have Hope Harbor in Grand Island. Not only does it provide shelter, but also casemanagment and life skills for its residents. Hope Harbor also helps meet the needs of others by collaborating with other service providers for the good of the client.

Hope Harbor	65477		/users/profile/71568	canglemyer	Client Served	5	02/09/2011	My name is Carmon. I came to Hope Harbor in June of 2010. I lost my job at a large organization that decided to get rid of the team that i was on. I had no way to pay for my appartment and just before I lost my job, my youngest son wrecked my vehicle. So I had limited ways of getting to and from anywhere and didnt know for sure what I was going to do. I applied at jobs and it was tuff going. I was either over qualified or they wasnt hiring. Alot of businesses were going under in Lincoln at the time and alot of people were looking for work. So I talked to my mother about moving back to Loup City. I didnt have the money to store my stuff or to move it, so I divided it up between my married kids. I moved back home and talk about hitting bottom. Here I was in my 40's and living with Mom, couldn't find a job, didn't have a vehicle and having to ask to use hers, couldn't pay my way and couldn''t afford to drive her conversion van 45 miles to get a job. I was getting to feel pretty low. I was watching tv one night and heard about a shelter in Grand Island, so I called the State Patrol and asked if they knew of any shelters and they told me about Hope Harbor. I called the next day and they told me to come apply. So I did. I walked thru the door with my head down and crying. Deb, one of the ladies here, said it was going to be ok and told me they were here to help. I got accepted and moved in. I was terrified! I soon learned that everyone working here, was awesome and really cared about every individual here. I was starting to get my hopes up again! They was there for me, not only as a case manager, but also as someone to talk to, someone to bounce ideas off of and get ideas from, but also the support to get back on my feet. They gave me the resources for jobs, housing, schooling, food, transportation (before I got a job) and also the knowledge that I got from all the classes that you take here. I took classes on, healthy relations, first aid, bible, budgeting, cooking, corrective thinking, crisis center intervention and we also have people who come in and talk to us about different resources that are out there. I became the resident leader 2 months after I got here. I have learned so much from that. I am like the house Mom and I get to be here for the person  who just moves in and is scared like I was and to hug the kids at night before they go to bed, help the adult go thru the stuff that I have already been through and to be a someone to listen to them and be a shoulder to cry on if they need it, also to help some who dont know how to cook, learn how. I know have a good job, will be going to school soon to get my CDL, i have a car and through our point system here, I have gotten the stuff I need to set up a household from scratch. Thanks to the donations that are recieved here, whether it is food, clothing, household items, furniture, cleaning supplies, toiletries and over the counter medicine and personal hygeine items, I have what I need. I am very thankful for what I have learned, what I have been given help with, the friendships that I have made and the donations that made it so I had somewhere to go and get the help I needed. I will always be grateful!!! I'm whole again, Thanks to all that made it happen and continue to make it happen for everyone else!
Hope Harbor	64984		/users/profile/71044	Glenda	Donor	5	02/08/2011	Hope Harbor provides shelter, meals, and case management to homeless women, children, and families.   They have a step by step program for education and employment planning.  The staff is very competent and provide a structured environment to make these programs work.  A successful completion of the curriculum, under the guidance of the case managers, can be life changing for those involved and lead to purposeful independent living. Hope Harbor also provides general assistance for those with food, clothing, and furniture needs.  Hope Harbor's Emergency Shelter Program provides temporary shelter to the homeless.

They not only provide a safe place for them to live, but they provide help with many resources. They assist with helping prepare for jobs and how to go about looking for them, they have classes on budgeting, and the residents there help with everything to help Hope Harbor function on a daily basis. When I find a family that has come on hard times and they have no place to go, I know that Hope Harbor can help. They provide the residents with long term tools and supports to help them be successful in the future.

Hope Harbor	63525		/users/profile/69453	Heather	Volunteer	5	02/04/2011	I had an internship at Hope Harbor and worked extensively with both the staff and clients. The staff treat the clients with respect and definitey work to empower all who come through their doors. Hope Harbor is one of the few homeless shelters available to families in rural Nebraska and it has touched the lives of so many people. I remember in my experience there, witnessing a family with six children work their way to self-sufficiency. Hope Harbor helped them to find employment and housing. The family had searched for so long for housing that they were on the point of giving up. However, with the case manager's support, they finally found a house and are now doing quite well. Hope Harbor is greatly needed in the area it serves.
Hope Harbor	63493		/users/profile/69420	kenadee	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/04/2011	I am the Parish Nurse for St. Marys Cathedral, adjacent to Hope Harbor and I see those who have to walk a block to Pioneer Park tosmoke.  The families are well dressed, actually well groomed and seem to be healthy.  It is rare we see the same people every week and no doubt they are being placed in their own homes.  We have a Third city Clinic where these people are able to recieve free health care and I know they have.  I believe in Hope Harbor and because they have inhabited our  old convent they are continuing to give of themselves just like the old nuns did. They have been good neighbors, not affiliated with this church.  I take a calendar over occasionally, the building is well kept and people freindly.

I am continually amazed at the services they have for families in need, and the quality of care and support they provide. I especially appreciate the way the try and help these families get back on their feet and become self sufficient. There are rules the clients have to abide by, so its a structured environment, which I think helps the transition back to independency. One such way is that the residents have to help keep the facility clean. Hope Harbor is well received throughout the community as a place that provides just what it's name implies, hope. The facility is run very professionally and I appreciate that as well. You can see the caseworkers care about their jobs by the way the take care of the families and the facility.

Through my work, I have had the opportunity to tour, work with, and become familiar with Hope Harbor and their staff.  Their tireless work for homeless women and their families is exemplary.  They always are so responsive to the needs of my homeless clients.  Not only do they provide shelter to women and their children, but through their diverse programming, they move these families from homelessness to self sufficiency.  I have had countless clients tell me without Hope Harbor, I never would have made it.  The service they provide to the Grand Island community and surrounding area is invaluable.

They truly focus on a mission of assisting in emergencies and moving the individuals and families they care for to a higher level of independence.   They do so by modeling appropriate behaviors, and demonstrating kindness tempered with unwavering expectations of those who are afforded services.  Both of these are indications of commitment to the present and a brighter future for those in need of assistance, comfort and direction.

With the help of Hope Harbor, those women and children had a place to stay.  They were also helpful in finding clothing and supplies for those who we could not serve.  I had the opportunity to meet Melissa DeLaet during a Continuum of Care meeting in Grand Island, and she is nothing but the best.  Without Hope Harbor in Grand Island, there would be so many more people on the streets.  I hope for nothing but the best for HH.  It truly is a godsend to those in need in central Nebraska.

Many volunteers assist by raising and training puppies,  taking dogs on the weekend to continue their training, transporting dogs, assisting with fund raising events and so much more.  The lives of select Inmates in the Nebraska State Penitentiary and the Lincoln Correctional Center  are also enriched as they provide many months of training for the dogs that become service animals.

Not only do they turn out fabulously trained dogs they do their very best to ensure the best match. The volunteers who make this possible are so dedicated. One group of volunteers are incarcerated, Domesti-Pups is not only giving a new life to those who have disabilities, they are giving inmates the opportunity to improve their own lives through the dogs that they train. The bond I have with my service dog is incredible. The volunteer staff at Domesti-Pups remains in your life as long as you want them to, the connection with other service dog teams helps so much as well. Domesiti-Pups connects all recipients and we all learn and grow with one another. Making this experience one truly of community and empowerment.I would highly recommend Domesti-Pups whether you are a child, teen, or adult in need of the tasks and care a service dog can provide. The most worthy of causes and greatest of examples.
Domesti-Pups	214523	2	/users/profile/277795	Tonja P.	Client Served	5	09/10/2014	Domesti-PUPS has far exceeded my expectations.  I got my Service Dog Duke last year after having to go for two years with out an active Service Dog, as my former dog had retired.  I searched and searched to find a place that would train one for me.  I applied to MANY programs. Even sent money in with my application as these places requested. I NEVER heard back from them. Which is very troubling. Not only did I have to send in my personal medical information, income information, in many of the cases they had a fee for you to pay for them to review your application.  Domesti-PUPS not only did  not ask for a fee for my application to be reviewed, but they got back to me, as none of the other service dog training facilities did.  Additionally when I got accepted into the program they came and did a home visit. Asked me what my needs were, and helped me with ideas for fundraising.  I was pretty skeptical by this time, so I asked for confirmation in writing which they did, so that I had something tangible saying I was accepted into the program. They can't tell you what dog you will get, as things can change up until just before you get partnered with your dog.  The first dog they thought would be for me didn't make it through the program. They don't make promises that they can not keep. It feels very vulnerable to have the faith that things will work out that they should. My dog Duke and I were partnered at a two week training camp. We were in a great class with other new teams. The volunteer staff at Domesti-PUPS treated us the very best, worked with our needs and educated us in the very best ways to work with our new partner. We could ask questions, learn about others, and start getting more personal independence. The food was fantastic, our friendships with the other recipients and their families became very strong. The volunteer staff has become our friends, and they stay in touch with us regularly to help or talk if needed.   They really want you and your Service Dog to both have the best lives possible. They do not make excuses they provide solutions. Still to this day I have never heard back from any of the other places across the country that I applied.   In my book Domesti-PUPS is the VERY BEST!  They have my complete confidence, and I can't say enough good things about the new life that they have made possible for me. I now am looking forward to volunteering with them and the new service dog teams.  
Domesti-Pups	308437		/users/profile/399818	wolflvr29	Volunteer	5	10/06/2016	I am so thankful to be part of this wonderful organization.   Not only is my life enriched by having a dog as a companion, but then that dog goes on to make such an impact on someone else's life.    A teenager can take a shower alone for the first time, a child can get up in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom alone.   These organization literally saves lives by training dogs to get crucial medical care when needed.  This is one of the most worthy charities you will ever find.
Domesti-Pups	308298		/users/profile/399685	Shannon136	Client Served	5	10/06/2016	 Getting Nigel, my service dog from Domesti-PUPS, has been one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. Nigel is a Balance/Mobility and Panic/Anxiety Attack  Service Dog!   I have fibromyalgia, panic attacks, and anxiety attacks. So Nigel will help me with my mobility problems and my balance issues.   If I should have a panic or anxiety attack, I can just tell Nigel to take me out, and he will take me to the nearest exit.   Or I can use him as an excuse and tell people I need to take him out to do his business, and that will get me out of a group of people that I'm uncomfortable with.    Having fibromyalgia means living with pain 24/7 all over my body. Nigel will pick up things that I drop such as a remote for the TV, or the phone that's cordless, or my cell phone.  He will pick those up for me  so that I don't have to bend over to pick them up. I've also had a total knee replacement, and something didn't quite go the way it should in my rehab. So my knee doesn't bend all the way like it should  which makes it hard for me to bend down and pick things up. Nigel is invaluable for me in that department.  He keeps me steady as I'm walking.   My knee can give out at any time it chooses, and having Nigel to hold onto makes me confident that there will always be someone there  to hold onto as I'm walking around at a store, or wherever I am, and if I need to look at something on the bottom shelf he will be there to help me get up in a dignified way and not having to hold onto the shelves or to get up that's undignified for an adult.   Nigel goes wherever I go. He even goes to doctors appointments with me. I recently had to go to an urgent care, who then sent me to an orthopedic where I found out I had sprained my ligaments in my foot (which means I tore them).   I have to wear a boot on my foot all day, it's very uncomfortable, and it hurts, but Nigel is there to help me walk around.  He keeps me balanced while I'm walking.  He helps keep me mobile so that I can get out when I need to.  I am very, very honored to of been a recipient of the Domesti-PUPS Service Dog from this organization!  They will help you even after the two week training camp, all you have to do is call them, or instant message them, or text them!  However you need to get in touch with them, and they will talk to you.  You can also talk to other people in their alumni Association website and other people can give you their experiences on what they did if you want to do something with your dog that's different than what you were taught at camp.  The best support group to have after you leave camp as well as when you're there for the two weeks they will come to your room and work with you I think they are the best out there!!  Thank you so, so much Domesti-PUPS service dogs for life ,Shannon Frost

Domesti-Pups	252744	3	/users/profile/340852	cinderella	Board Member	5	08/12/2015	I had a significant stroke in May 5 years ago and Michelle found out from my husband.  She called and asked if I needed anything and in my broken speech I said a visit from "my boys" (who are my dogs) which I knew was not possible.  She brought her service dog at the time, Brutus and then had a lady who had Domesti-Pup therapy dogs bring her two Westie pups to my room as well.  This brought tears to my eyes and a sense of calm in the storm I was going through.  It gave me reason to fight also to get up and get out of there to see my own dogs.  I can't explain the true gratitude I have for this and the first hand experience of knowing the impact these type of programs have.  This caused me to be a much more involved Board Member and to tell others with physical challenges about the programs Domesti-Pups has to offer can help individuals in many settings and with physical and emotional challenges.
Domesti-Pups	251594	2	/users/profile/339553	Taters.mom	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	My husband and I are both retired with no children living nearby.  Training one of our dogs to be a petting pup has been a wonderful, heartwarming experience for both of us.  When you go to a nursing home and one of the residents there says "you have made my day" or you find they have had no visitors for a couple weeks or more and they smile and pet the dogs and reminisce about the dogs they had it really drives home how important these animals are in the lives of others.  When you go to a troubled youth camp or a college at finals, and see all the young faces there missing their own animals you thank God you have a pet for them to relate to.  When you see a child struggling at reading and week after week they slowly improve because the dog they are reading to doesn't care if they miss a word or two, you know why you do this.  When a patient in a facility reacts to your pet after reacting to no one or nothing else, you know why you do this.  I hope there is a therapy pet for me should I be in a situation like that.  I know why we do this and urge anyone who can to do the same.  There is no describing the feeling you get deep in your heart when your dog has touched someone so deeply.  Thank you doesn't seem strong enough, but you know they mean it from the bottom of their heart and you know it from the bottom of your own heart.  THANK YOU!!
Domesti-Pups	251538	2	/users/profile/339492	Sam1862	Client Served	4	08/04/2015	I am a special education teacher.  I had a dog I wanted to incorporate into my classroom and began looking at training.  Other therapy dog organizations offer a much shorter training requirement but don't require testing. I wanted a quality program that backed us when we were done.  Domestic-Pups is that organization! They are knowledgable, thorough and also require the therapy team to pass the AKC Canine Good Citizen test before validating you as a therapy team. It takes longer and a lot of hard work, but you as the trainer and your dog are very well trained once you are done. The director and trainers work out of passion for people and dogs.
Domesti-Pups	251499	2	/users/profile/339452	Smotsch	Volunteer	5	08/04/2015	A wonderful organization serving elderly, people with disabilities, our community, schools and much more.

I work in a small rural hospital and have seen first hand the impact that therapy dogs have on both  young and old.  Almost every day, I am amazed at the joy and calming effect that pet therapy brings to our patients.  I have observed how this organization develops and trains Service dogs.  They are very careful in pairing dogs to people and created a team that will work well together for several years.  This group of dedicated individuals have worked hard to develop a network that ensures continuous evaluation of all aspects of its operation.
Domesti-Pups	249712	4	/users/profile/231284	merrih	Volunteer	5	07/23/2015	I have volunteered for Domesti-pups for 5 years. Words cannot express the positive ways I have seen lives changed because of this organization and their dog programs. We work with inmates  from York, Lincoln, and Omaha. They give their time training dogs to give back to the community and to learn a skill many hope to use once they are released. It is all voluntary, they do not get paid. With them we train pets, therapy dogs, dogs for the classroom , and service dogs.We do presentations, seminars, classes, and workshops to educate the public.We work with shelters, rescues and many other groups saving dogs and changing their lives as well as the people who receive them.I am a better person because of the time I have spent with the Domesti-pups organization.

Domesti-Pups	249080	4	/users/profile/336914	KristineB	Client Served	5	07/22/2015	This organization is truly amazing. The dogs that come from this service dog organization are extremely trained and are tailored to your medical needs. Our seven year old daughter received her service dog from them. Domesti-Pups have an extensive screening process and they make sure that the dogs that make it through the service dog program are the highest quality. They also do an amazing job of making sure that the families and recipient understand what is expected of them with the service dog. The commitment that is involved after coming home ensuring the success of the team.  At camp, families are taught so much more than how to work with the service dog. The participant and service dog are taught how to be a team. Families are taught how to help their loved ones be independent. Even if that means letting go :). Not only do you get an amazing and highly trained service dog from this organization, you have a new family as well. When you leave and go home, the relationship between you and Domestic-Pups doesn't end. They are always there checking in on the continued training and bonding of the service dog team. They are always available to answer questions or to problem solve. They helped our school from the beginning by being present through phone conferences about how to incorporate my daughter's new service dog at school. They have helped with any issues that might have arise on trying to integrate my daughter and her new service dog in our daily lives. This is the best service dog organization hands down.  They are truly the best out there.

Watching the dogs in therapy, in schools, and as service dogs shows the dedication that countless volunteers and the hundreds of hours they donate to achieve the common goal of changing lives through fully trained and certified dogs.

I did complain but no apology was given....the kids went home crying and two of them never returned. It's sad that a non-profit organization that is supposed to help children would be so rude. There were other incidents where other volunteers from the organization were being rude and demeaning to several disabled adults.
Domesti-Pups	225255	5	/users/profile/289025	Shari9	Client Served	5	10/22/2014	Our family just returned from a 12 day all expense paid dog camp. We were at a nice hotel in Lincoln NE. Everyday we were treated to meals , field trips and classroom experience to learn everything we could about my daughters new service dog.  We were chauffeured around  in what was jokingly called the stretch limo (passenger van) with the other families and dogs in the 2014 graduating class. Everything you would need for your dog is provided including food, treats, collar, leash,  harness, grooming tools, toys and a manual w/ all the commands the dogs have been trained on. It is a life changing program for all involved. The dogs go through several tests before they are chosen as puppies for the best temperament as a service dog. Then they are trained by the inmates at 2 different correctional centers for a year or longer. On the weekends they have foster families who take the dogs with them out in the public to expose them to all the things you are likely to do like, shopping, restaurants, theaters, parks etc. During the camp you learn from the trainers who are very passionate about what they do. They teach you the proper way to execute commands and praise your dog with treats and affection which accelerates your bond with your dog. I can't express enough how well thought out and comprehensive this program is. They have been perfecting it for years and it is wonderful.  At the end of the 12 days you attend a graduation ceremony at the correctional facility with a symbolic handing over the leash ceremony from the inmate to the recipient. It was a lot of hard work but the pay off is tremendous. After taking your dog home the staff is available for any questions or suggestions you may need as you continue training at home.   I would highly recommend to anyone who has daily challenges. Thanks Domesti-pups,  Shari Moreland -Lawlor 
Domesti-Pups	215042	2	/users/profile/278368	TammyRonny	Volunteer	5	09/14/2014	My golden retriever Ronny and I have been Domesti-pup volunteers for two years now.  The Domesti-pup training program was laid out in a manner that left nothing to chance.  When you begin classes, you're given a step by step booklet guiding you through expectations for your team (you and your dog).  Your classes are taught by highly qualified trainers who have many years of experience.  Classes teach you hands on techniques which are necessary for your future as Domesti-pup volunteers.  Ronny and I serve as Edu-pups in my elementary school where his main job is as a reading pup for our Title Reading program.  In our spare time, he is a petting pup for our local hospital and nursing home where he has many friends that he visits weekly.   The impact of animal assisted therapy programs such as Domesti-pups cannot be measured, all you have to do is hear the joyous exclamations coming from the people your team comes into contact with.  You will hear tales of how people's  lives were changed/touched by even one single visit from a therapy dog team.  There are few ebullient experiences you will ever have to compare being a part of this experience.  Life changing!

We receive amazing support and training from the leaders of our local Domestipups group. It's a wonderful opportunity to share our mission with the public so they understand the importance of these service animals in the lives of their future owners.  It is also a wonderful opportunity for rehabilitation and future job attainment for the inmates that are providing the diligent training all week at the penitentiary. 
Domesti-Pups	214734	2	/users/profile/278027	Roxann H.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/11/2014	I have known of Domesti PUPS service to adults and children with disabilities for approximately 8-9 years. As a professional Advocate, Ombudsman, Educator for people with disabilities, I have closely watched this non-profit organization develop and expand services and programs to enhance disabled adults and children achieve their dreams in life, and educate the public about Service Dogs!  Domesti PUPS has consistently provided the support people with disabilities need to become independent, experience multi-level community inclusion, be able to attend and excell in public school education as well as having opportunities to attend colleges - universities - vocational training and be included in the traditional workforce as well as participate in volunteerism at the person's choice and dreams! Domesti PUPS leadership in enhancing the quality of life for so many adults and children with disabilities has long inspired me professionally to also enhance the quality of life for all people with disabilities through education and advocacy across the USA, particulary in the use of Service Dogs. Domesti PUPS also reaches out to community members who are disabled, but choose to not use a Service Dog, through ancillary programs utilizing highly trained certified Therapy Dog teams. This provides service to youth who are struggling with learning how to read, persons in hospice care, persons in residential settings, and much more! Another innovative best-practice initiative of Domesti PUPS is their partnerships with three State prisons in two cities in Nebraska! In this initiative, Domesti PUPS trains selected inmates to provide initial training of the dogs in their Service Dog training program. This is a life altering opportunity for female and male felons to learn and master skills that enhance their conduct, self-esteem and employability when released! To summarize my support of Domesti PUPS, I believe this non-profit organization to be a premier Service Dog training and placement program as they have enhanced the quality of life for scores of disabled adults and children in so many areas of need. They employ state of the art, innovative training for Service and Therapy Dogs - as well as their strong volunteer base -  implementing the best practices in the industry. Because of my long term admiration of and belief in this outstanding non-profit organization, when I recently retired from my career as a College Instructor and Curriculum Writer, I chose to volunteer my time and talents to Domesti PUPS. 
Domesti-Pups	214610	2	/users/profile/277885	jenlyons61	General Member of the Public	5	09/10/2014	We regularly have a great dog named, Tugger, who assists 4 teachers in a variety of classroom settings, within a Life Skills progam in a High School.  Tugger brings calm and motivation to many students.  Lots of students struggle with anxiety, and are uncomfortable during a 50 minute class period (perhaps all day, and as long as all the school week).  As an early doubter of the impact of dogs being in the classroom, Tugger and his care provider, Shawnie, have taught me the value of having a non-judgemental, accepting-to-all, dog in the classroom setting.  Tugger assists our students in validating themselves to themselves, to their peers, and beyond the classroom.  Jen Lyons

Scholars always respond in positive ways to the pup, and then to everyone around them, even if the scholar is having an issue. In addition, scholars always inquire about the pup, when she is not around.

Domesti-Pups	214580	1	/users/profile/277855	Angela100	Volunteer	5	09/10/2014	I have been an active volunteer within the Domesti-Pups organization for over 7 years.  During this time I have witnessed consistency in the mission and leadership.  The mission "to improve the quality of life for persons with special needs through the assistance of animals and to promote awareness through education" is seen every time I see one of the dogs doing their job with Domesti-Pups.  Those jobs might be visiting an elderly person in a nursing home, helping a person struggling with alzheimers remember their beloved dog, reading a book with a child and helping that child gain confidence and skill by being an non-judgemental and loving listener; or accompanying a child through their activities of daily living so that they no longer have to be afraid of being alone when they have a seizure.  There are many many stories I could tell of how these dogs make a difference in people's lives.  I am proud to be a Domesti-Pups volunteer!

I can't explain how thankful I am to them for training such an amazing dog but also for having such high standards for their dogs to train, when I recived my service dog I knew I was getting a new best friend but what I didn't know was I was getting a family too, in the time I went to go to the training camp to pick up my service dog there was not only a bond with my dog but with the people around me the trainers and the other recipients and they strive for that connection with you if there's something you need help in with your dog they are right there to help you! There's no need to worry they're just a phone call away, I've had a couple of my needs changed with Richteroo where I needed to be guided in training and the Domesti-Pups family was there to help via Skype, Phone calls and emails back and forth to help further our training. This is a great company to recive a service dog or to volenteer they are great people and do what I think is the best job in service dog training and at being there for you.

We have learned the value of always having a therapy pack, ways to control our dogs, and why the dogs need to complete the tasks in the Canine Good Citizen Test. These tasks are very important and teach the dog how to be polite while helping others. The instructor has provided many opportunities for us to understand the mission, training techniques, and how we can benefit from the suggestions offered. I am confident that upon completion of the program, the teams (dog and individual) will be very useful for those who may have special needs. In summary, the training program has been excellent and the instructor as well as other staff have been so helpful!

We longed for a way to protect her at night when the seizures racked her body. When my daughter at age 5 was granted a wish she wished for a service dog. Make a wish allowed us to choose any organization and we chose Domesti pups. We have not regretted that for a moment. From the compassion to the actual thorough training of the dogs, to the service they provide the inmates who work with the dogs to the accommodations for training camp to follow up after. Everything far exceeded our expectations. We can't thank them enough for giving us one more tool to keep our daughter safe.

We were pointed to Domesti-PUPS, when a friend, saw an article about them in the Lincoln paper. We have learned through our experience with Domesti-PUPS, everything that a service dog agency should be.  I cannot begin to tell you how blessed we were to not only apply but to be approved by Domesti-PUPS. We learned everything we needed to know about having, working with and maintaining a service dog AND found a new family in Domesti-PUPS staff and alumni. As thorough as training is with Domesti-PUPS, it is the intangibles that make them great. It is evident in everything that Michelle, Michele, Marri, Anne and a host of others do, they care not only for the dogs they spend 2 years training, but for each person who is training to handle their new friend. Thank you, all of the volunteers, trainers, puppy raisers and so many others for everything you do. Your tireless efforts DO make a difference!

It was such a great & positive memory we made as a family! When dealing PTSD & TBI I always say that my spouse isn't the only wounded warrior. My kids are too. They are the lil warriors in this battle that get left unheard or forgotten. They have been through a deployment and had to say goodbye to their daddy. The next they're welcoming a stranger. They've seen him at his worst and continue to walk on eggshells. I reluctantly applied for this trip. Crowds, noise, fireworks just doesn't work for us but this was different! We did rush through the parks, picked end seats in the stands at shows, just minor adjustments. This trip made our family seem whole again. It was worry free. Dealing with him is a lot and not having to worry about the finance part of it was even better! Seeing my husband smiling and posing with characters, enjoying rides with our kids was priceless! I can never  thank you enough for this opportunity. I hope to some day give back and help another family!!!!

They sent our family on a vacation to Florida that we would otherwise have not been able to afford to make. My husband is an Iraqi war veteran that sustained a spinal cord injury and neck injury. This July he had to go in for surgery again on his back and on his neck for the first time. Thanks to WWFS we were able to go on a family vacation to Florida the end of June, where our daughters were able to spend quality time with both of us prior to my husband going in for surgery again and once again being limited in how he can interact with them. The week vacation was amazing. WWFS took excellent care of our family and we could not have been happier. Thank you so much WWFS for everything that you have done for our family as well as for others. 
Wounded Warriors Family Support	162706	1	/users/profile/215960	jerimiah99	Client Served	5	07/16/2013	As told to me by my son, a 29 year old veteran who sustained major injuries to his head, face, and body during a vbied (vehicle born explosive device) attack while serving his country in Iraq: I've just been doing the best I can do to get better to be the best father to my daughter who knows me no other way than the man I am now since she was born shortly after my injuries. I'm just a country boy who wanted to serve my country. Sometimes it gets so hard to go through another surgery but I just have to because I want my daughter to know I'm doing my best and going to be my best so she'll strive to be the best she can be.  I missed so much of her life while I was in and out of hospitals and now I'm getting the chance to make up for some of that time I missed. That's where WOUNDED WARRIORS FAMILY SUPPORT helped me and my family so much. I wanted to take my daughter on a much needed time away to just focus anything not medically related, but I can't travel without the people that take care of me and her, my mom and dad. That wasn't a problem for Wounded Warriors Family Support.  They provided us with the time away we needed that gave my daughter time with her daddy instead of time with her daddy when I don't have to go to another medical appointment/treatment. And they provided my need to have my parents with me.

He lost his right leg below the knee and severely fractured his left ankle.  Since then, our family has been under a lot of stress, both emotionally and financially.  We have two children and hadn't ever been on a vacation.  We heard about Wounded Warriors Family Support through another veteran and his family and decided to put in an application for a family vacation.  We were so excited to see that one of the vacations offered was to Yellowstone National Park.  Yellowstone was my husband's dream vacation and had been his whole life.  Shortly after we put in the application we were contacted by the organization.  They set up everything from flights to hotels to money to help with trip expenses.  Our family's week in Yellowstone was the best week of our lives.  My husband was happier than I have seen him in a long time.  We have been back for about a month and he has been just as happy.  I think the vacation that Wounded Warriors Family Support was just what our family needed.  It provided us a week of stress free fun and we are forever grateful to this organization.
Wounded Warriors Family Support	156761		/users/profile/207932	Wendy64	Client Served	5	04/30/2013	WWFS has been a Godsend to my family.  I was introduced the organization from Hearts of Valor when I was invited to attend a conference to learn more about my husbands illnesses and how to better take care of myself.  WWFS has changed my life.  After 3 years of caring for my husband who requires more than 40 hours of care weekly, with no break, I was beginning to suffer from caregiver burnout.  WWFS provides me regularly scheduled respite care.  The VA pushes the necessity of respite care as part of self-care in their Caregiver training and certification but never advises on how to obtain it.  I called various organizations that could care for my husband so I could get a break here and there especially over the last year and honestly could not afford any of their rates.  They all charged double what the VA covers with the caregiver stipend.  Being a woman with so many demands already caring for my husband, I can't call a hundred places to find one that fit's in my budet.  WWFS worked diligently to meet every one of the character traits and qualities to find a caregiver that would be necessary to match the needs of my husband and children.  They were able to find someone that my husband is comfortable with and that my children feel loved, understood and encouraged by.  WWFS found someone that could come in and feel like family.  WWFS is meeting a huge and what I find neglected need for Veterans.  What they do is really lifesaving. It is saving marriages which is potentially saving the lives of our heroes by offering us women who love, respect and honor our husbands enough to stand by their sides through every trial room to breathe.  I can't thank them enough.
Wounded Warriors Family Support	156757		/users/profile/207926	unclesamsmiss	Client Served	5	04/30/2013	Impressive doesn't seem to be quite fit the word, nor does excellence, efficient and speedy! WWFS has been more than that to my family. It has become my rock when I had no where else to turn to. Not only did WWFS (Wendy) help me with education on some subjects such as TBI when trying to cope with new changes in my husband (wounded 06-07 Iraq), she immediately came in, took charge and helped me to ease some of the fears I had as a spouse, mother and caregiver. Realizing the stress I had, she helped me get my respite care and helped provide someone who could come in and take care of my family while I was gone. Wendy also helped me get through the application process for the flight costs and Air Compassion for Vets. She knew my biggest fear was being the only one carrying my family through all this and what a weight it can bear on the person doing everything for everyone at all times. She even made sure the night before my plane ride to respite, I didn't have to cook dinner for my brood. It had been soooo very long since someone just talked to me, helped me help myself which is something I hadn't quite learned just yet and because we are a little further back in years, they didn't mind at all because we didn't have to be judged just on "less than 24 months of injury".  WWFS is helping me with a care plan so I may have much needed surgeries, much needed time to myself and help me get myself back to me. WWFS has exceeded beyond my cynical view of some organizations that help Veterans and their families. I mean that, so many times we were turned away and I wasn't sure why when we were just like everyone else. They not only took us in when I needed a family but, they have continued to call me and check in and just chat. Sometimes that adult conversation is the highlight of my week! I haven't participated in the retreat yet or used any of their programs but, they have been offered to my family. I would bet my last dollar that they exceed anyone's expectations just like what they have done for us. It is very easy for a non--profit to take in a lot of money, shell out so many checks to veterans and their families and then their job is done. The reason WWFS has my recommendation and review is because they went above and beyond to make sure we felt like we mattered, they cared about my Veteran and his family members. Often we families get lost in the shuffle so it was nice to have someone ask ME how I am feeling or doing. Colonel and Wendy and all who help, have been nothing short of a small miracle for my family and look forward to working with them some more. I hope my review helps anyone willing to help this non-profit financially will look at all aspects that sometimes money isn't what we need all the time and often, we get what people think we need. WWFS asks what we need, then takes charge to make sure it gets done. They didn't leave us behind and to me, that says it all right there. Thank you so much Wendy, Colonel and WWFS for taking us into your family and organization. It's appreciated far more than you realize.

Wounded Warriors Family Support	156750		/users/profile/207893	Emily D	Client Served	5	04/30/2013	My husband is a OEF Combat Veteran. He has multiple injuries sustained in 2007, including PTDS (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury), as well as multiple physical injuries as well. I was introduced to WWFS in mid 2012 through Hearts of Valor (another organization for families of Wounded Warriors). I was given help through WWFS to attend a Caregivers Retreat for Hearts of Valor. Wendy Tatro has been so amazing from the very first conversation we had! Not only did I get respite care for the retreat, but she has also looked for help for our family to move (twice in 4 months) as well as getting our family on-going in home respite care! I have told quite a few of my fellow Wounded Warrior friends about WWFS, and I know they have received help as well! I believe this organization is one of the best for military/post-military families, because they have the families at heart, and not profit, not "getting a name" for themselves. They have proven to me and my family that they truly do care for our military and those who have served, and want to provide the very best for these families. I am looking forward to the on-going care that they provide for my family, as well as the help I know other families are getting as well. Thank you Wendy and WWFS!! You truly have changed our lives for the better, and have shown us, and our friends that there are still heart-filled people out there who truly want to give back to our military!

My husband did two tours in Iraq. He suffers with PTSD and has a Purple Heart. I am a mom of four girls and pregnant with a boy. Wendy Tatro from the WWFS, got in contact with me and invited me to lunch. I met with her and another wife of a disabled veteran. It was really great to go and meet this ladies. One, I never get out and do anything for just me. Two, it was nice to be around people that knew what I was going through. 3, WWFS treated us to getting our nails done. I haven't had my nails done in so long (years). It was nice to not feel overwhelmed and be able to just relax. WWFS helps me feel free of the everyday stress just through a lunch date and conversation. I am thankful for that alone. I do not have close friends, and often feel isolated. I often feel that people don't understand just how bad, war, has affected of lives. WWFS without judgment, understands and is there to listen when you need to vent. Thank you WWFS and thank you Wendy Tatro. 
Wounded Warriors Family Support	156736		/users/profile/207871	lizanight	Client Served	5	04/30/2013	Wendy Tatro from WWFS helped me to attend a Hearts of Valor retreat in San Diego this past March, 2013. To be selected to attend the retreat was such a blessing and when they told me that there was support to help me pay for child care I was floored. Life can be so overwhelming as the spouse of a disabled warrior and a mother of a one year old. The idea of leaving for a weekend seems out of reach most of the time. The last time I had left, the caregiver who was supposed to help out with my husband made a real disaster of the situation. This situation included care for my husband and son. I need to have people that I trust and I do but of coarse it gets very expensive for a weekend. Not only did WWFS make it possible for me to attend the retreat which was so helpful, but she talked to me about my role as a caregiver and validated my experiences of challenge. She gave me a lot of helpful advice as someone who has tremendous experience herself. She also gave me hope that maybe some day my family can get some support to go on vacation, where it would be connected to the military so my husband might be willing to go. He is still recovering from his time as a soldier, and it's hard to get him our of the house to do anything new. Well, to make a long story short, the really amazing part about the help I received from Wendy and WWFS is that it really touched my heart to feel that people care enough to make sure I get a little break from my tough job. I learned so many things that I really needed to know on the retreat. Things that I was having a hard time finding on my own. Wendy also enlightened me with information that really helped.  That weekend and the care I received from Hearts of Valor and WWSF strengthened me to continue to do my best to care for my husband. Slowly but surely, things are improving from the love and care that we have received from these groups.  So thank you! You do make a difference.  Best, Eliza Knight 
Wounded Warriors Family Support	156734		/users/profile/207869	Li__	Client Served	5	04/30/2013	My husband was injured initially in Afghanistan in 2009. Over the last few years he has had multiple surgeries and was in a coma last year that contributed to him developing ABI (Acquired Brain Injury) which is similar to TBI, he has multiple incomplete spinal injuries and a myriad of other health issues that all stem from his injury in Afghanistan and the subsequent treatment. My husband requires full time care due to his injuries/illnesses- and this falls to me as his wife. On top of being my husbands full time care giver I also have 2 of my 5 kids who live at home, and my youngest son has 2 behavioral disorders and my daughter has special needs and health issues of her own. I also work part time to help with the finances in supporting our family and I do some volunteer work with other wounded warrior families as well. I am telling you this because I want you to understand how full my life is,which means that there is no "me" time, or time for me to be able to regroup. Caregiver burnout is a very real threat to  myself and my family. Even though my journey in life the last few years has been very hard and very rough,  the Wounded Warriors Family Support team has contributed to making it so much more bearable in the last few months (since I enrolled with their program). I was able to go on a retreat for wounded warrior caregivers at the end of March because WWFS brought in a wonderful, professional caregiver to care for my soldier. For me to be able to go to the other side of the country and know that the love of my life, the light of my universe was in caring and competent hands was the biggest factor that allowed me to go on this weekend retreat. This retreat went a long ways in delaying caregiver burnout for me thus far. Not only has WWFS provided a caregiver for my retreat but at other extremely stressful times as well, and a few times just because I needed a day to myself. Being a full time caregiver of a wounded warrior is very hard, very very hard- regardless of how much you love your solider-your relationship with them is completely different then that of a couple who doesn't have this same kind of relationship. If I didn't have WWFS on my side and in my corner I wouldn't be able to cope as well as I do with my situation in life. Wendy Tatro-Walker and her team has provided so much support, emotionally, personally and physically (by providing a caregiver when I need a break) that if I won the lottery I would donate every penny to them to continue this project for the future and for other caregivers. I really can not stress how amazing and wonderful and supportive this organization is and how this organizations programs have enabled me to be a better, healthier,happier wife,mother and caregiver-by providing a professional caregiver that I can feel safe leaving my family with when I need one.Not only do they do this, but they are also sending our family on a trip at the end of August to Orlando,Fl for a family vacation. This is the very first time that we have been offered the opportunity to take a vacation as a family. Being the family of a wounded warrior affects not only my soldier and myself, but my children also. It guarantees that our children don't have the same kind of childhood that most parents dream for their children.Our families plans and goals for life have been changed so dramatically by the injuries/illnesses that my solider suffers from because he is not able to do the normal dad-kid things that other kids  get to do with their dads. So this trip to FL for a week, where they have the appropriate accommodations for my husband that will also allow us to make amazing and lifelong family memories is a blessing that we are very thankful for. Again, this wouldn't have been possible with out the WWFS and their volunteers.
Wounded Warriors Family Support	156732		/users/profile/207867	Dani L.	Client Served	5	04/30/2013	My husband is a two-time combat veteran.  As a result of his service, he now has multiple injuries,  including PTSD and a brain injury. Since his return in 2008, my day-to-day life has been one battle after another - fighting to get him the proper discharge, fighting to get him his VA benefits, fighting to get him proper care, and fighting against the self-loathing and apathy that pulled him down so low that he couldn't see the point in trying to recover. As his caregiver, and the mother of two small children,  it felt like I was all alone, that I had ceased to matter except in regards to the needs of others. While it was, in some ways, rewarding, it was also frustrating, depressing, and unbelievably stressful. A friend recommended me to WWFS. I balked at first; my experience with non-profits serving the veteran community had been nothing but negative,  and had never yielded any kind of measurable result. My husband does not have a Purple Heart. He declined it, for complicated reasons, and that has often led to organizations treating us as lesser or simply ignoring us altogether.  I wasn't up to another fight that was going to end in disappointment, especially when the beneficiary wasn't my husband or children, but me. As I said, in my mind, I had ceased to matter as a person. However, my friend persisted, and I finally agreed. From the very beginning, Wendy (the Respite Director) was wonderful to work with. She took the time to listen to my story - not just my husband's, but mine. She understood my stress, and asked the question : "What can I do to help you"? I'd heard it before. The difference is, this time, the person asking followed through. Wendy spent a lot of time screening potential childcare providers, looking for someone that would fit the criteria we set, while also understanding my family's unique situation. She never recommended somone just to get the job done. She kept searching until we found the perfect person. As a result, I can now tend to my own health and take part in the counseling that I so badly need to help me deal with the stress that comes from caring for a wounded veteran. For the first time in five years, I have the kind of help and support that actually *helps*. The relief I feel is incredible, and I am immensely grateful for WWFS. This is exactly the kind of support that families like mine need. It provides real support,  not lip-service or false promises. I feel incredibly blessed to have been helped this way. It means more than I can really say.

My son's traumatic brain injury has left him permanently in need of care which, I now provide. Having the brief respite with other mother's of wounded warriors allowed me to have time for myself to take in and digest my new role from afar yet surrounded by newly acquired friends that truly understand what it is to have to deal with the consequences of the war long after it has ended.

I was given bumper stickers, plastic cups and access to websites to read about how rough life is for the caregivers of disabled vets. Nothing that really helped me not feel so isolated and alone.  WWFS showed personal interest in my life issues and pulled me out of a depression that was heading for suicide. I have been given a better understanding of my husbands mental state and in the few short months that we have been in the program, our family is building strong happy accepting relationships again. I can laugh and smile again thanks to a special lady that works for this organization.  They have a wealth of knowledge of what disabled veteran's families go through - they tailor their program to you and what you need to get your life back on track.  WWFS even found a program where we could apply for a mortgage free home - we did and we got it. The point is that this non profit is not looking for all the glory - they are really trying to help these veterans whose lives are forever changed due to their sacrifice. These men will carry the price of freedom and democracy on their backs and in their minds to their graves.   WWFS understands that and is providing outlets and education for families like mine to enjoy life again.  Their level of personal involvement with the families in their program exceeds any expectation you would expect from an organization like this. You are not just signed up and put on a mailing list. They want to make sure you are given the skills you need to adjust. They want to inspire you to find solutions to issues you may be having and will help you solve them.  In short, they give you a foundation of hope for your future again. We could not be happier with WWFS.

We provide retreats & resources for wounded warrior families and the WWFS  donated monies to help sponsor 2 of our retreats.  Their generosity allowed 8 families to participate in 2 retreats we did in VA, 2012.  I have found that working in the non-profit community you often encounter  organizations that are unwilling to work together on projects or to help each other.  Our philosophy has always been that we can reach more people by helping each other and referring our families to those who provide resources we don't.  I am happy to be able to let our families know about other non-profits  available and WWFS is a good one.  Thank you for your support as we first started our organization and for your continued support.  I now have the pleasure of working with this organization and team personally as well.

The application process for a vacation was simple and straightforward, and within a couple of days we were scheduled for our first family vacation in years. I will never forget the smiles that my children had for seven days straight, the laughs and squeals that we shared together, and the look of contentment on my husband's face for being able to provide something to us that he thought he'd lost.  WWFS still continues to engage with us, always seeking further ways to give us the family support that they promise. I could list so many things that they have done in almost three years, but the overall picture is that they have focused on the well-being of  my injured husband, me, and both of our children as well. I truly believe their impact on us as a family has been emotionally critical and life changing.

I have seen Mary turn these poor babies into loving little dogs who beg for attention.  There are a few who never learn to trust fully so they stay with Mary until they go to Rainbow Bridge.

Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	185091	1	/users/profile/150227	PapillonOne	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I have been following Mary Stickney's Rescue for many, many  years now. One of the things I love about her and her organization is how transparent it is.  She shares all manner of information with her supporters and will always answer emailed questions as well as questions on her facebook page.   I feel that her page on facebook gives anyone an opportunity to look right in to her home and see how well she treats all the dogs she takes in.  She also has many supporters who actually come to her home and volunteer caring for and grooming the dogs.   She does often have high vet bills as the many dogs she takes in are mill dogs (and abandoned dogs) who have received little or no medical care their entire lives.  Mary doesn't skimp on a dog's  vet care needs even when they come to her in the worst possible condition which happens often. I have never heard her "brag" about such bills as they are often a source of anxiety if anything since her vet is good but he does not work for free and she incurs many other expenses caring for these dogs such as food, heartworm and flea meds, grooming supplies, etc.  She will let us know when she could use donations to help pay the bill down as the rescue/re-homing donation of $250 to adopt one of her dogs often does not reimburse her for the $600 to $1000 the vet may have charged to spay, do a dental, repair a hernia, or treat severe eye damage or fix broken legs!!  But as these are mill dogs and not championship dogs, requesting more dollars from an adopter for the re-homing fee will only keep these dogs from going to their forever homes.   I am in awe of the constant daily hard work that Mary does for these dogs and the commitment she has made to them.  She is the best, deserves a five star rating and definitely has earned those  five stars through her continued hard work giving these dogs a second chance at life and their first chance at loving homes!!  (P.S. If I lived anywhere close to this rescue I would be volunteering my time regularly but as it is I am too far away so I support Mary in as many other ways as I can.) 
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	184806	2	/users/profile/241742	mully	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	My family and I have been doing volunteer work at Mary's for the last 5 years and have been there when a load of puppy mill dogs come in (very sad and disgusting) and to be able to see what Mary has done for these dogs is priceless.  She loves them, grooms them, vets them, socializes them and they all love her back.  Thank God for people like Mary, she does what I only wish I could do.  We have adopted several of her dogs and they have made my family complete!  Although there is one she just got this weekend that I have fallen madly in love with but can't have and hope she can find the best home ever!!  Mary you know who I am talking about.  Love you and the work you do!!
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	184154	1	/users/profile/241095	candie	Donor	5	10/29/2013	I believe Mary is at least part Saint. I wish wish wish that I was in a position to do what she does. I always follow her rehab pictures and stories,  I don't know how she does what she does with what she has, but I am truly grateful for her rescue. She's the real thing.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	184124	1	/users/profile/241063	Silvie G.	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2013	Heart, soul, compassion and perseverance. That is my description for Mary.  I am involved in rescue, for Tidewater Bichon Frise Rescue.  I am well acquainted with the frustrations, limitations and emotional costs of doing rescue work.  Financial considerations aside, there is an emotional cost to bearing witness to the horrors and sadness of abuse. Mary is a front line soldier whose mission is fought from the trenches and yet she has managed to keep her vision intact and her mission focused without losing herself. That is rare.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	184044	1	/users/profile/240981	kimcronin	Professional with expertise in this field	4	10/29/2013	I am director of a small breed rescue in Missouri, so I understand living in a rescue home.  There is room in rescue for people to be individuals.  For the most part, we are all doing what we think is right, what is best with our resources.  Mary is doing a good job and has helped our rescue with hard to adopt dogs.  I have been to her home several times.  No complaints.  She's a rescuer in the trenches.  I applaud her.  I'd give anything to have her great, dog safe yard!
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	184001	1	/users/profile/240930	Lesa3	Donor	5	10/29/2013	I have transported dogs to Mary. I follow her on FB and make monthly donations thru her site, maryshouse.us  She is such a blessing to so many dogs who would be shot by farmers or breeders, who have never been touched in a kind way, and need to learn how to just be a good dog. Many come to her knowing nothing but the inside of a tiny cage and sore bodies, crusty eyes, and broken limbs. She and her Wizard (Vet) work miracles. Mary takes in cases that end up crossing the Rainbow Bridge but she tried everything to save them. I don't have the heart to be a rescuer because for every dog or puppy lost, because of breeders horrible treatment or uneducated dog owners who abuse or abandon dogs, my heart would break. It would not take long for my spirit to break along with it. Mary is an inspiration to us all. I am proud to make my donations to her and help her rescue.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183994	1	/users/profile/240916	Nelda R.	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	I adopted a sweet little Yorkie from Mary.  I would go through her again if I lived closer.  Mary does a lot of good and raises awareness of the rough life puppy mill dogs go through.  I am so glad she saved my Wendy so I could give her lots of love.  Mary is an angel to these dogs.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183804	1	/users/profile/240720	tkbuster123	Professional with expertise in this field	1	10/28/2013	Mary takes in more dogs than she has the resources to care for.  She often brags about having vet bills in excess of $1,000 (and seems to expect others to pay for these bills) while she continues to take in more dogs.  Perhaps she shouldn't take in so many dogs until she has the means to pay for them.  Recently one of her dogs almost died from pyometra yet she had the dog for months before it was spayed.  If anything had happened to the dog it would have been Mary's fault. Mary also talks about swatting dogs on the behind and "not tolerating" certain behaviors.  There is never a need to swat or harshly punish a dog, especially puppy mill dogs or shy/fearful dogs.  She should try positive reinforcement methods and counter conditioning to make the dogs more comfortable or extinguish the behavior. I never want to see dogs go into Mary's rescue, I feel so sorry for them.  I would also never adopt or support her rescue.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183780		/users/profile/240693	Joy_11	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2013	I have worked with and known Mary for many years. I personally did reference checks with the professionals she had contact with including some who had been to her physical rescue, and they were spotless. She has since proven over and over her priority's are for dogs best interest in providing the best health care that they need and a safe place to recover if physically or emotionally damaged.  She will take any dog in need if there is room regardless of age or condition.  The dedication and tireless commitment to the animals makes Mary's rescue one of the  most outstanding ones I have worked with. They are not warehoused  and problems passed on to others she works with the dogs to rehab them so they can become good companion animals and find their forever homes.  
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183779		/users/profile/240692	Bobbi4	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	Mary stickney has helped hundreds of formerly unadoptable dogs by acclimation and training in becoming a good and happy dog. She has fixed their spirits and arranged the medical care they need. She is an active opponent of puppy mills and has the dog's best interest at heart.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183719		/users/profile/240630	Judy93	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2013	Mary Stickney is an inspration and instructor for so many other dog rescuers, particularly mass breeder dogs (also known as 'puppy mill' dogs).   Her strength and determination are an example to many of us, and give confidence to those who adopt from her.  Every creature that comes in gets its own special attention, name, individualized care,and is put on the path to being a placeable pet. Poor condition and emotional problems don't stand in the way of animals having warm arms waiting, and if a sad little dog cannot be rehabilitated, it still has good food, warmth, medical care, and a place to live out its life.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183712		/users/profile/240624	Janice31	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	I have known Mary Stickney for many years.  She does wonderful work with the dogs.  She takes in dogs that no one else would even try.  Some of them are sick or hurt and she nurses them back to health and finds good homes for them.  Some are so unsocialized that no one can get near them.  She works with them and turns them around so that they can become someone's much loved pet.Of course, some of Mary's dogs are too ill, too old or too feral to rehabilitate.  To those she gives a safe haven to spend the rest of their lives in her home.  Mary works at 2 or 3 jobs sometimes to be able to afford medical care for her charges.  She provides each dog with plenty of food, a warm bed, any medical care that is needed and much, much love.  I admire Mary Stickney tremendously and it makes me feel better about this world to have her in it.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183645		/users/profile/240561	Le P.	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	I have known Mary for many many years through the Internet & a private chat group about small dog rescue & owners.   She has always been extremely helpful to all, but she is a savior to those doggies who do not have a voice or home of their own.   She takes the, in, makes sure that they get health care, and then performs miracles buy getting them their forever home.   If for some reason their re home doesn't work out, they can come back to Mary's.   she amazingly keeps her home and large yard clean and safe.   She is indeed an angel on earth!
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183572		/users/profile/240483	Rana M.	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	I have known Mary for some time via Facebook.  I can tell you, I have never seen a more dedicated woman.  She would give her left arm for these animals.  Their home is top notch, all of the dogs receive personal attention, they all receive expert health care, and they are happy.  Mary works very hard with dogs from all backgrounds to ensure that they are placed in the right home for them.  Mary is an asset to the shelter community.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183548		/users/profile/240460	4Dawgs	Volunteer	4	10/28/2013	I met Mary on line several years ago.  Mary does an amazing job and takes in many dogs that are old, ill or injured.  These are dogs that many rescues would not take.  Yet Mary does and because of this, she always has very high vet bills.  Yet she works hard to raise money and she also spends a large amount of her own money to make sure these dogs get good food and care.  Rescue is a hard job and many rescurers burn out after a few years.  Mary has not as she is and has been fully committed to rescue.  Mary also shares her knowlege of dogs, resources and her experience with many of us who have not been in resuce as long as she has.  I know that she also works to find good, permanent homes for all of her foster dogs.  Of course, her rescue is and always has been a no kill facility.  I feel qualified to recommend Mary's rescue although I have never been there.  She posts many photos and I am in touch with people who have been to Mary's rescue in Nebraska.  If I lived closer, I would definitely volunteer.   
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183530		/users/profile/240440	Dolores3	Donor	5	10/28/2013	I have known Mary and her rescue for many years. Being a rescue is a very difficult job. She takes in all the poor little and big furkids that have been dumped or caged for most of their lives and makes them whole again. Mary is the most loving warm person I know. She never says no, loves and worries about each and every furbaby. Her door is always open for them to come in battered and bruised and to walk out with head held high and tail wagging.   Stickney Toy Breed Rescue, Mary at times goes without so the dogs have what they need. She works to keep the rescue going. Her stats are so impressive-so many saved and rehomed in a year it is impossible to keep up with her. I know what rescuing is, l have been at it for 20 years myself. God Bless you Mary and everyone at Stickney Toy Breed Rescue. 
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183507	1	/users/profile/240418	Tommie H.	Donor	5	10/28/2013	Mary is one of those special people who help make this world a better place for our canine friends,  Mary is always willing to help with transport to other rescues if she can't take them at the time.  Those most in need of help and vetting seem to occupy a special place in her heart.   She works tirelessly to rehab and find new loving homes, spending many of her own dollars as well as striving to find sources of funds for her rescue.  You couldn't find a more deserving place to put your donations of time and other resources.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183485		/users/profile/240397	Claire20	Donor	5	10/28/2013	I met Mary Stickney on line several years ago and really fell for her ethics, her compassion, her straight forwardness and her honesty.  She has pretty much single handed started this rescue from her heart and her limited resources.  She has made very sure her home, her yard and her talents all are for the best of all things for the rescues that come in for her.  Basically Mary takes the ones that are damaged as in shyness, distrust, seniors that were turned or dropped somewhere and little ones that are sometimes disabled.  And no dog is ever sent away to make room for one that may be more adoptable.  If there is any dog that cannot be adopted for a particular reason, it lives a wonderful life with Mary and is given all the love and caring it needs. Mary's rescue is not spread all over with lines of fosters wanting to help.  Actually I find her to be a role model for what a true rescue is all about.  She makes sure a serious back ground check is made before any canine is released to that person for adoption plus, if something doesn't work out, her contract states the dog comes back to her and no where or to no one else.  I prefer to donate my limited resources to her rescue mainly because it's such personal rescue and I know that every dime goes right to the health and welfare of her charges.  Actually she is extremely close to reaching 1000 adoptions before the end of this year. Personally I feel she should be applauded for her care and consideration and her compassion for of these little ones.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183483		/users/profile/240394	Lisa305	Volunteer	5	10/28/2013	Mary takes in all types of dogs, blind ones, crippled ones, 'deformed' , skinny ones, fat ones and old ones. She doesn't cherry pick just the good ones that will be adopted fast. She takes retired puppymill production line workers and introduces them to a life outside the box. They get to see the outdoors, walk on grass instead of wire, can eat good food and drink all they want from real bowls and never have to have puppies again. The dogs learn what it is like to be a house dog and even sleep in bed with her. They get groomed, their nails cut and bathed when necessary. They are spayed and neutered, given shots and teeth cleaned before the go to their new home. The dogs are usually adopted out for less than their vet bills. The difference comes out of her pocket. The ones that are not adoptable stay until they die. They have paid their dues. 
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183482		/users/profile/240395	Ravenholz	General Member of the Public	5	10/28/2013	Mary took in a dog that was a dump off at my work.  Trooper was a puppy mill dog that was SO scared of everyone and everything. She has done some much for him and he has finially made the Adoption list after more than 6 months in her care,he has come so far because of the dedication she has to the puppies/dogs that she rescues. Thank you so much for being you and being there for the dogs when everyone else has turned their backs on them.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	183474		/users/profile/240387	Jodie2	Client Served	5	10/28/2013	I met Mary online. I adopted my Remmington from her. Mary is a great person with a heart of gold. She is there for these dogs no matter the cost or travel time. Mary always keeps people in the loop of knowing how and when she needs help for her dogs. Stickneys Toy Breed Rescue is amazing. They love and care for Mill and other rescues. Mary will step in even when she can't physically get somewhere to help she finds others to step in as she guides them on getting the job done.Mary loves these pets and puts their needs above her own. Mary is an example of LOVE and RESPECT for all dogs in her care and in need.Thank you Mary. I love Remmington he is a wonder little guy. I could not imagine life without him. Jodie De Hoek

Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	181450		/users/profile/238178	Molli S.	Donor	5	10/23/2013	Mary has never turned down a dog in need, regardless of what it would cost. She takes in the most vulnerable and needy, gets them healthy again and finds them great homes or keeps them with her for the rest of their lives. Being a small rescue she doesn't get the exposure the bigger ones do, but she does just as much if not MORE for the ones entrusted to her care.
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	181372		/users/profile/238094	Milla L.	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2013	Mary has a heart of gold but an empty wallet. She has taken in dogs that may not have had a life otherwise. She vets the dogs, socializes them and gets them ready for their forever homes. She works at a paying job and almost all of her wages go to care for the dogs. What can I say about Mary and Stickney Toy Breed Rescue except bless your heart for saving these babies!!!
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	181356		/users/profile/238079	Michelle183	General Member of the Public	5	10/23/2013	I met Mary online. I have dogs but she totally opened my eyes and my heart!!! Mary and Stickney Toy Breed Rescue are by far the most amazing people (yes, I see dogs as people) I have ever encountered! Constant updates, good and bad, make me feel like I'm a part of what's going on. When a fur baby is lost because the previous "owner" or back yard breeder/puppy mill owner was useless and took no care of the momma's, it's a devastating loss. I'm just grateful they were able to spend the last of their time here on earth in a loving, caring community with so much love and attention. I may never get to take a physical visit to Stickney Toy Breed Rescue and get lost in a pile of loving dogs, dogs who may have never known love before Mary but everyday I'm a part of their lives and I thank God for Mary and the babies (and those who help Mary) daily!
Stickney Toy Breed Rescue	181351		/users/profile/238074	bonpayne	Client Served	5	10/23/2013	My family has adopted two dogs from Stickney Toy Breed Rescue.  I find this organization to be incredible.  They take in dogs with such serious challenges due to abuse, neglect, or birth defect; dogs that many others would not give a chance, and do an amazing job rehabilitating them to prepare them for adoption.  There seem to be no deadlines.  They will keep and work with the dogs as long as necessary to nurse them back to physical health and an emotional state that makes them candidates for adoption.  Additionally, there is no limit to the dollars they will invest in medical procedures, medicines and such to restore their physical health.  Stickney's has a heart and a gift for loving and working with dogs who have come out of such difficult circumstances.

These people were forced to give up their land and freedom to the white people. I then had a dream to build houses some day with them. When I met my wife Esther some years ago she told about here experience as a volunteer in Guatemala. My dream came back and we decided to sponsor and volunteer building a house for a Maya family. It is incredable how easy it is to help the Maya people and give them a better life. They don't need much and are always proud and happy. They learned to survive in a beautiful country with almost nothing. People we helped were so greatful. It was hard to believe that we made the difference to become a better life by helping them.  A very important experience in my life which I can recommend everybody who wants to explore his own belief system and help other people in the mean time.Thanks to my wife who gave me this beautiful opportunity.
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	162648	1	/users/profile/215877	Esther5	Volunteer	5	07/15/2013	For almost 10 years now I volunteer for Constru Casa. I first met Carolina around 2002 when I was on sabbatical in Guatemala to study Spanish. Since than I've visited Guatamala about 10 times.  I was a volunteer in the office in Guatemala, went on honeymoon to Guatemala and we volunteered and donated a house with my husband. We came back in 2012 and took his children to volunteer at Constru Casa Site  (18 year and older). I learn so much from the Guatemalan people and it's an inspiring place to work and meet the local people. An unforgetable and for me lilfechanging experience! Because of the experience in Guatemala I changed my job 10 years ago from commercial company to non profit organisation (and  now I am stimulating corporate volunteering). I learned so much and it's relativating my life in Holland. The organization is very professional and I see the donated money comes right where it should come. I can recommand Constru Casa. Right now I am a (volunteer) boardmember of Constru Casa Holland.

I learned a bunch of very useful skills, I will need in my career as Civil Engineer ,while helping other people. The workers at the construction site were very friendly and patient. Constru Casas  staff was helpful, and organized. They made sure everything was working out fine. The homestay Constru Casa organized for me was excellent. The family was friendly and the food was good.  Constru Casa is making a huge difference on the lives of hundreds of Guatemalan families. I highly recommend them.
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	161371		/users/profile/214015	NPvanCHI	Volunteer	5	06/25/2013	A friend and I traveled to Antigua in 2012 to volunteer with Constru Casa and I could have never imagined  what a tremendous impact this organization would have on my life. Constru Casa has built an impressive network of team members, volunteers, local masons, and community organizations to support its mission of providing basic, dignified housing to families living in extreme poverty. Carolina Van Heerde and her team are right on the ball with their communication. From my initial contact I had with the volunteer coordinator to the final day of my trip, they ensured that everything ran smoothly. I met husband and fellow volunteer on this trip, and we plan to return to Antigua in the near future to join Constru Casa for another project. 
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	161317		/users/profile/213935	thille	Volunteer	5	06/24/2013	Constru Casa has become a big part of our lives.  My husband, Jim,  and I have moved to Antigua, Guatemala because of Constru Casa.  Jim has been volunteering with them for around six years doing construction of homes and raising money.  We have seen first hand how the homes built by Guatemalan masons, the family and volunteers can bring stability to a family as well as better health.  The solid construction helps keep the families safe from earthquakes, mudslides and rain saturating their home.

Unfortunately due to the weather we were not able to see it completed.

After completing my first, of hopefully many, partnerships with them I am very pleased with how on top of their game they are from everyone in the office to the workers out in the field. I always felt like everyone at ConstruCasa was looking after our needs and making sure our experience was a good as it could be. Up until now they have been very flexible, accommodating, pleasant, and in general a great pleasure to work with. I highly recommend ConstruCasa to anyone looking to do community service work with a group of high school aged students or any other group!
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	161305		/users/profile/213919	Randel H.	Volunteer	5	06/24/2013	In 2012 I helped build a house with Constru Casa near Antigua. I was so impressed with their work and professionalism that my wife and I decided to build a house for our Guatemalan housekeeper. In Feb 2013 they build a 3 bedroom house for our housekeeper in Tejutla near St Marcos. We went to see the house and stayed in it for one night. They did a brilliant job and we are very very happy.  Constru Casa build houses suitable for the Guatemalan conditions. The houses are fortified with steel rods as we have many tremors and quakes. 
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	160994		/users/profile/213439	Marco R.	Volunteer	5	06/19/2013	I read about Constru Casa, and got in touch with them to see how I could possibly help out. From the get go the communication with them was easy, straight forward and very helpful. They answered all my questions (and I had a lot) I organzied a big fundraiser that raised enough money for a house. Once I got to Guatemala to start my volunteering it was phenomenal. From the Homestay that was organized by them, to the wok site and the workers at the site and the people I met from the organization. Everyone was helpful and friendly. I can't wait to do it again next year and hopefully bring more people with me to share in this wonderful experience.

Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	160060		/users/profile/212291	Giorgio B.	Volunteer	5	06/08/2013	The volunteering experience at Constru Casa definitely changed my life and my point of view about real values. This has been my first volunteering experience and it couldn't go better!Constru Casa is doing a great job in helping people in Guatemala: I worked at the construction site of the school Tess Unlimited, but they have built (and still building) hundreds of houses for poor families around Antigua and in other cities in Guatemala. They also cooperate with other non-profit organizations, getting remarkable results in helping people that live under the poverty treshold.All the staff at the office runs Constru Casa in the best way, helping the volunteers to get the best out of this experience and allowing them to work efficiently. The staff is a group of cheerful and happy people, really committed to the cause, and really helpful and friendly with workers and volunteers.The workers at the construction site are amazing people, humble and open-hearted, always ready to share their knowledge, their stories and their delicious home-made food. They work hard and they do their job very well, but at the same time they're very patient and relaxed with the volunteers. They taught me all the secrets of their job, making me feel part of the group, giving me the funny nickname of "El Canche" and playing football all together in the lunch break.The experience at Constru Casa gave me the chance to live close to the local people, learning much about life and real values from them, changing forever my point of view about life. Getting to know the staff behind this organization made me understand that there are still amazing people out there, that put their resources at the service of families and people that live in poor conditions.I will never forget my experience at Constru Casa! Looking forward to going back to Antigua and volunteering for Constru Casa once again!
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	159905		/users/profile/212099	Hollow19	Volunteer	5	06/06/2013	Constru Casa was a great organization to volunteer with. Building a house can often be a good gesture, but does not always leave the area a better place. Through their partnership with Common Hope, however, I believe the organization is make a positive difference in the areas they are working. Couple that with a friendly staff, well organized schedule, and the opportunity to work with locals--- its a great organization to work with! On a personal note, the mason, the person at the site who coordinates the building process, for our was a group was amazing. He shared with us his touching past and really made the experience special. We also got the chance to grow close with the family we building their home fore, they kids frequently helped us move bricks and were always around to chat. Great time!

Our work with Constru Casa has been amazing and we are very proud to say our school has been a part of 12 of the houses that Contru Casa has built.  The organisation on their behalf has been perfect every time, not to mention the support we have received whilst we are there.  The opportunity to spend time with the families and really see what a difference you are making to their lives is priceless.  Also the Guatemala masons on site are fantastic at involving you in the entire process.  This is the most rewarding and valuable time I have ever spent overseas- and to have such a wonderful group there to set all of this up for us each time is invaluable- we could not do what we do without them!
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	158333		/users/profile/210060	Luv4Guate	Professional with expertise in this field	5	05/20/2013	I am familiar with many of the non-profit organizations in Antigua, Guatemala and Constru Casa is one of the best. They have established an excellent reputation for themselves having created on the ground partnerships with other non-profits in the community and include the local Guatemalans whenever possible. Their volunteers have PLENTY of work to do while they are down there, but there is always time for Spanish school and FUN. It's a great group and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to make sure that what they give back has a lasting effect on the people and culture!
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	158190		/users/profile/209834	Sarah121	Volunteer	4	05/17/2013	In March 2012 I took a group of 6 volunteers from Australia, some had never travelled to a developing country before. What an AMAZING experience! Contru Casa made things very easy for us, even from the initial email I sent they were always in contact with me. Meeting us on our first night to give us a plan for the rest of the trip, they also travelled with us on day 1 and introduced us to the families that we were building the houses for.I have volunteered in a number of countries and with numerous charities - Constru Casa is a very easy first step into volunteering and I would highly recommend it! Having the ability to build a house for a family within the small amount of time that you are there is the most rewarding!
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	158171		/users/profile/209803	LHarrisKent	Volunteer	5	05/17/2013	Six members of designers.in.service from Kent State University's College of Architecture and Environmental Design, volunteered their skills for a trip to Guatemala this past spring semester 2012. The students helped to build a home for a family in need through the Constru Casa organization.Constru Casa is a non-profit organization that works with partner organizations to build basic housing for residents living in extreme poverty. The families that receive housing give back to the organization by paying one fourth of the total cost over four years and by participating in building their own home.Although Constru Casa is funded through donations, the students, who are members of designers.in.service, had to raise money in order to travel to Guatemala to help build a home.We did a lot of fundraising to get the project off the ground, says architectural studies alumna.While in Guatemala, the designers.in.service had the opportunity to work with local master masons and residents. Through this opportunity, they learned how homes are built in different cultures.We worked side-by-side with the master masons on the project, says Harrison. They build really different than how we build here.The designers.in.service realized quickly how much work was involved in the project but knew how important their work was to the family.It is important to help countries as Guatemala in building and supplying their people with everyday needs in order to live a more comfortable life, says architectural studies senior. I see it as a win-win situation  they win by getting a better home in which to live and we win by gaining a great cultural experience.By the end of the week, the designers.in.service had not only finished the houses foundation, but also established their own foundation of knowledge for projects in the future.I learned a lot about construction techniques, actually getting to do things like hand-dig a foundation was really fun, says architectural studies senior. I have a new appreciation for hard work and sustainable design. Seeing how a smart design for the third world can be cheaply and rapidly constructed was very cool and puts into perspective a new dimension of design and service.  
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	157553		/users/profile/208941	Alex Raher	Volunteer	5	05/10/2013	I worked alongside Constru Casa as a volunteer for 2 weeks in February 2013, working one week on the construction of the Jardin de Amor in Santa Maria de Jesus and the second week helping build Amelia Esperanza's house in San Mateo. I was extremely impressed with the dedication, organisation and operational management from all the Constru Casa team and the professionalism of the masons. I really felt welcome and part of the team right from day 1 and there was always something to help out with on site - I even learnt block laying techniques and plaster rendering! I am a trainee architect, so the construction projects were particularly interesting to me and I was very impressed with the quality and professional construction of the houses - with basic tools and limited material supplies. All the masons we worked with were friendly, happy and very patient with us! There is a great energy about this charity and you will find your time with them highly rewarding. I would recommend Constru Casa as a fantastic volunteer opportunity and hope to stay in contact with them and perhaps return to Guatemala in the near future. Thanks!

The program is so much more than building homes: it is truly building families and helping achieve independence and a sense of pride. What a great organization to begin participating in the global effort to reduce poverty!
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	156999		/users/profile/208210	iamtonyb	Volunteer	5	05/02/2013	Everyone from the staff and masons were great to be around. Loads of positive energy and even the people with next to nothing shared their lunch with us. When you are around a group of people like this every ounce of sweat is worth the stain left on your clothes. Working with Constru Casa, you will get a chance to experience some cultural activity besides work. They have a lot of good relationships with other NGO's and make sure you get your play time as well. I really enjoy working with them.
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	156986		/users/profile/208196	devin.kehler	Volunteer	5	05/02/2013	I had a great time learning about the process of building a house. The masons were both friendly and helpful; I think I learned a lot from them. After just a few weeks it is such a great feeling of accomplishment to see a finished building that a family can live in. Thank you Constru Casa for this wonderful opportunity.
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	156779		/users/profile/207951	jewel1gdm	Donor	4	04/30/2013	Constru Casa was born from love and a true concern for those who have little from those who have much. Constru Casa is growing as a wheel-oiled wheel to better serve those in need of proper housing and shelter from the elements. Designed to engage recipients in the benefits of participating by repaying a loan for their housing, Constru Casa earns a unique place in today's non-profit organizations. 
Friends Of Constru Casa Usa	156755		/users/profile/207924	merritmanson	Volunteer	5	04/30/2013	One of my best experiences Volunteering with a nonprofit in Guatemala was working with Constru Casa.  For the last 10 years I have been traveling to Guatemala and have volunteered with many organizations but this is one of the few organizations I know working in Guatemala who gives 100percent of their time and money to helping the underprivileged  of Guatemala. These people are the poorest of Guatemala, who live in shacks, dirt floors, and have no chance of a better future.  It amazed me how much work and love they put into building a home, school, or a clinic.  And when it is all over, the project is complete, seeing the faces and happiness on that one family, the children, or the community makes one walk knowing they accomplished a good deed in life.  I cannot tell anyone what a wonderful feeling it is to see the changes in a family once their home is complete, you see hope, hope of a better future.  I will continue my volunteering with them as I continue my adventures to Guatemala.

TABLE GRACE MINISTRIES (Cafe)	269096		/users/profile/357826	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	Table Grace Ministries is located in downtown Omaha and offers delicious meals of soup, salad, and gourmet pizza for a free will donation.  My Dad has come to really enjoy supporting Table Grace and since he works downtown frequently lunches there.  Over the years I have joined him for lunch at Table Grace and have enjoyed the diverse customer base you can interact with in this casual dining environment, the doting service he receives, the delicious food, but mostly the time I get to spend with my Dad out to lunch in a great environment.  Over the years Table Grace's ministries have grown and I've experienced their heart for ministry of God, food, and music in various settings in our community and at our own church.  My favorite experience though is the time spent at Table Grace in meaningful conversation over a delicious meal that has nourished body and soul through time with my Dad and those that I have met that day.  Definitely worth stopping by and nourishing yourself.

TABLE GRACE MINISTRIES (Cafe)	269066		/users/profile/357796	Brenda94	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	Table Grace is a unique and creative ministry in downtown Omaha. They provide a great meal each day at lunchtime -- soups, salads and pizza -- to anyone who wants a meal. There are no prices, so you can pay what you can afford or what you want to share. You'll see business people in suits dining beside persons who might be sleeping on the streets. They offer the opportunity for those who cannot pay cash to work a shift in the kitchen, cleaning up, or helping in some other way. They also have trained people to pass their food handling certification which allows them to find gainful employment elsewhere in the community. Lastly, Table Grace is available to cater almost any size event. The profits from these events will go toward provide meals to those who can't afford them and toward training or other expenses for the cafe. I've spent two great New Years Eves having a wonderful Table Grace meal. I love love love this ministry.
TABLE GRACE MINISTRIES (Cafe)	269057		/users/profile/357787	Writer	Donor	5	10/29/2015	Table Grace is a spirit filled experience for all who walk through the door.  Providing theopportunity for anyone to enter and enjoy a delicious meal, with the added joy of live musicor a possible bible study (depending on the day),  makes them unique.  I witnessed homeless  individuals sitting next to those from the corporate world eating side by side without hesitation on anyone's part.  People in the kitchen are hired not just to put in a day's work but to be in active training.  They go on to be hired elsewhere and so the cycle continues, a cycle that starts with a meal and ,for some, ends up providing the wonderful event of feeling productive again.  I would be a frequent visitor if not for how far it is from my home but for the gift they provide..they are where they need to be.  The couple that began this cafe are filled purpose and message...."All are welcome..come as you are" and that's the feeling you leave with!"  Table Grace is worthy of being added to your charitable givings list!  The one recommendation I would give is...you must visit and enjoy!

For me, it is a quick and easy way to get a nice and tasty lunch.  And, they always greet me by name.  This ministry has opened my eyes to a set of people in our community that have less  economic resources than I have, but I have found them to be just like me.  A person with the same kinds of life challenges, cares and concerns.  What I appreciate the most about this ministry is their hiring of people who need an opportunity and helping them to be successful.  
TABLE GRACE MINISTRIES (Cafe)	268985		/users/profile/357715	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2015	First, as a Caf, this place is fantastic!  Gourmet pizza, salad, and soup.  I love that the daily options are different and unique.  The last time I ate there, I had a carrot and sweet potato salad, leek and vegetable beef soup, and mushroom pesto pizza on whole grain crust.  All delicious!!As a ministry, I love seeing the many people of the community coming in for lunch.  Every time I am there, there is a mix of white collar business people, blue collar workers, and by visual judgement only, no collar people as well - some appearing to not have homes.  The ministry is geared, of course, to those in "need" but I find that all are comfortable together at Table Grace and I am often the one "ministered" to as I watch a room full of broken people gather with an air of knowing they are accepted and welcomed.  I also watch as people jump in to help serve, or sing along to the live music, or just sit quietly for some rest.  It's amazing.  I also appreciate greatly that while this is a ministry, the goal is not to "save souls" through proselytizing them, but truly to just love the neighbor through a good meal and fellowship.

I was not a very good practicing Catholic before I started listening 15 years ago. Not only has it helped me but also my entire family. I am so grateful. My kids have grown-up in the faith and are wonderful adults. They are better Catholics than I am! It would not have happened without the radio on KVSS whenever the kids were around me. Then they started listening on their own. It gives me great peace of mind. The programming is solid Catholic teaching. The programs and guests are informative and fun to listen to. It is a great way to evangelize because the top personalities in the Catholic Faith do the preaching and teaching. I truly believe that God is working through the radio and I feel like I must support the station so that the Word can continue to be spread all across our country. Our country needs it now more than ever. Pat Ervin

Anyone interested in learning more about the Catholic Church or in deepening his/her relationship with Christ will benefit from listening to KVSS.  This has been my experience.   The programming is substantive, informative and entertaining.  Spirit Mornings is an exceptional program that is locally produced which features Catholic related news, events and interviews with an emphasis on Nebraska and western Iowa.  KVSS excels at spreading the Good News and introducing people to Catholicism because of the professionalism and the commitment of the people who work there.  This has inspired me to volunteer with the station.  More communities need radio stations like KVSS.

They have been able to recruit and maintain top notch people, and there is a high degree of transparency in all aspects of their operation  As a volunteer, I have had the opportunity to serve according to my talents.  I also have been lifted up when talking to others about the station, as it has a significant positive impact in their lives. This organization exemplifies the best profits of a not for profit 
VSS Catholic Communications Inc KVSS	227763	1	/users/profile/291490	Buzz80	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	Spirit Catholic Radio is a wonderful organization that brings Christ to the people. They are constantly trying to expand their reach and increase their listenership. You can tune in to Spirit Catholic Radio in most parts of Nebraska and even parts of Iowa. The programing offers a little bit of something for everyone, even non Catholics. It is just awesome knowing there is a station you can turn to to better strengthen your faith. It is a great change of pace from secular radio. Tune in and you just might get hooked. 
VSS Catholic Communications Inc KVSS	225598	1	/users/profile/289366	Joe_58	Advisor	5	10/23/2014	I've been an avid listener of KVSS the last 10 years or so.  I've benefited greatly from their message in how to treat others, how to handle being a father, best practices for dealing with kids and a greater understanding of my faith.  Over the years, I've become more involved from donating time during care-a-thons, donating money on an annual basis, to offering insights on how the station can reach and bring on new listeners; especially the youth.  It's a great time to be Catholic and a great time to help out nonprofits like KVSS,  who has a great staff of "saints in the making" and BIG heart as they dedicate their time to ensure God's message is revealed to all who are willing to listen! God bless,
VSS Catholic Communications Inc KVSS	221419	2	/users/profile/282124	anguyen	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	It's so great to have something like KVSS in Omaha. It's nice to have access to the popular Catholic Answers Live Q&A show. It's a great blessing to have the daily devotionals on the radio to follow along to. It's especially a wonderful way for people to discover these helpful prayers if they aren't already aware of it. Thanks for all you do!
VSS Catholic Communications Inc KVSS	221136	2	/users/profile/284839	JoyceL	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2014	I love to listen to Catholic Answers when it is on our KVSS radio station.  All the other guests and moderators are top notch and their fidelity to the Church is a source of comfort. I am drawn closer to God and have a relationship with out Lady and our Lord because of the content I find on KVSS Catholic radio. Thanks for all you do for people of our shared faith, those that are seeking truth, or those who are returning because of the work you do. 
VSS Catholic Communications Inc KVSS	218536	2	/users/profile/282113	SpiritCatholicRadio	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/30/2014	The following are testimonials VSS Catholic Communications INC KVSS has received from listeners: "The devotionals, daily prayers, saint of the day ... all these give me opportunities throughout the day to stop and reflect and pray. I love listening to Kris McGregor and Inside the Pages. Dr. Ray makes me laugh and gives me hope that I'm not insane as a busy mother of 7." "I love learning more about my faith and being able to keep my faith in my ears when I'm in my car or at work. It has been great listening to local on-air personalities, priests and bishops and really feeling more a part of not just the Lincoln Diocese, but all three dioceses in Nebraska." "I love hearing about my faith and building up this faith as I drive around town. It's nice to hear the truth coming through the radio and reminding me that I'm not alone, that there is a greater faith community that proclaims Jesus in the fullness of the Catholic faith." "When you have worries and troubles that go with life, the Holy Spirit has you turn on Spirit Catholic Radio and there is always a program especially for you, and it touches your heart profoundly and you are able to pick up and move in in faith this time." "The staff is filled with love for God and the work they do and you can't help but want to be a part of that energy to spread our faith with the world around us. We are all disciples! The regular opportunities for prayer and reflection probably hooked me first of all. Then the more I listened, the more I found other parts to the programming that were directed toward something either I or someone else was going through in their life." "I have the radio on at work sometimes and on occasion co-workers have come into my office when the Angelus or Rosary is being prayed and they will ask me about what they are hearing. My three favorite programs are Morning Prayer with Fr. Lewis - a wonderful way to begin the day and to ask God's blessing upon us and whatever concerns us; Reflections by Sr. Ann Shields, Deacon James Keating and Fr. Larry Richards; and Crossing the Goal." "I can set the dial to Spirit Catholic Radio, and leave it there because there is never a reason to change to another station. Before SCR, I would change the dial constantly to move away from commercials that were annoying or even sometimes a little offensive, however, with SCR, there's never anything offensive, so I even listen to business underwriting on SCR. Also the ability to continue to listen to SCR while driving on long trips is fantastic. As one signal begins to fade, I can find another signal and continue with the same program 50 percent of the time. and it's free. What hooked me on SCR? It's true, there's nothing fake, or for that matter political. It's just solid teaching of a solid universal faith." "I really like the Q&A programs. I have had a lot of my own questions answered by listening." "I can't tell you how much I've learned from Catholic Answers Live, and the Angelus at 6 p.m. that sounds like it is being sung by monks sends shivers up my spine." "This helped me understand what I already believe! I always trusted the church, but now I've learned so much as to why the church taught us the things of our faith." "It's funny - the more you listen, the more you listen. Other stations become harder to listen to after Spirit Catholic Radio." "I like praying the rosary along with the bishops or whoever is leading it. I enjoy hearing Fr. Ryan Lewis as he reads and gives a brief homily on Morning Prayer and I deeply appreciate praying the Holy Mass with whoever is saying Mass.I feel as if I am really participating." "Catholic radio is my primary source for good, solid, and faithful Catholic teaching. You helped me return to the church in an Orthodox manner, rather than on my own terms. Keep broadcasting the truth of the faith as a counterweight to all the foolishness and nonsense that exists out there. I like the teaching programs, especially apologetics, which is more and more important in a hostile world. Also the airwaves can always use more prayer and devotion." "When I am occasionally asked a general question about my Catholic faith, I attempt to answer and then encourage the person, they they are interested in the Catholic faith, to tune into Spirit Catholic Radio." "I love Catholic Answers. I am a cradle Catholic and I have learned so much about this faith I have had all my life. I am so happy to have the coverage area extend into Northeast Nebraska so that many more will be able to hear your wonderful programming." "It's so welcoming ... you don't admonish people for their sins, but rather show a spirit of forgiveness and happiness when people return to God. This has helped me to become more forgiving and understanding. I also appreciate the sense of humor - it reminds me I don't have to be serious all the time. I can have fun while enjoying my faith." "I did not get good catechesis as a child growing up and I find that I am learning something new every day. Catholic radio has deepened my desire to know more about my faith. One of my favorite things is when a priest or bishop is on and he gives a blessing at the end of the time slot. For some reason that just makes my day all the better." "It's truly Catholic. Years ago I heard Steve Ray talk about his book, 'Crossing the Tiber.' I bought the book and became an invigorated Catholic, my husband joined the church and I am a member of the RCIA team at my parish. I love Spirit Catholic Radio." "Catholic Answers Live hooked me and now I love all programming on Spirit Catholic Radio. I am Lutheran and am very likely to convert to Catholicism." "I appreciate that although it is Catholic-centric, it is not exclusive. It seeks to involve the entire Christian community." "I like not having to censor the information as my children are in the car. I like listening and learning as I drive. There is always a message I receive on the radio that addresses an issue I may be struggling with." "Being a teen, I really enjoy listening to music that gets me 'pumped for God!' This helps especially in the morning or long drives - it keeps my mind off the time and on God as well as starting my day out right and giving him praise." "I like how everything is scheduled with not too many of the same type of programs in a row. Good mixture of prayers in between national and local programs. I also like how the number of programs that talk apologetics has increased over the last couple years." "I love Catholic radio. It feels like family. I learn so much about our faith that I didn't know. It helps keep Jesus in my mind, keeps me connected to the church and helps me strive to be a better person." "I like the morning show, interviewing different people, the inspiration I receive. I also like the Care-a-thons and hearing different individuals' stories, their faith journeys. That's probably one of my favorite things - hearing people talk about their struggles and triumphs in light of God's grace." "The reason I like Catholic radio is because it provides a solid Catholic outlet where I can tune in at any time and hear something uplifting or enlightening, which makes me want to become a better Catholic and deepens my appreciation for my faith." "Local shows like the morning show with real people discussing real issues in a candid manner using the Catholic faith as a basis for a holier life."

Omaha is such a wonderful community filled with generous and committed people and it shows up in some really amazing ways.  One of those is the Spirit Catholic Radio station that expanded several years ago and now broadcasting a clear and powerful signal across most of the great state of Nebraska.  The message delivered is a true blessing in my life and the programming is some of the best you can find anywhere in the US.  It is run by a unique and faithful group of individuals who are fabulous stewards of the gifts given to them.  It is evident in the way others are called in many different ways to help them and the joy that is evident in the staff and volunteers.

Thank you so much HUA staff for being there to rescue her from the 3 bedroom home with 150 dogs, and for caring for her after the rescue.  And thank you for being there when my husband and I needed you, too, since Stella has started the process of mending our broken hearts after losing our little Gertie this past July.  I appreciated your e-mail correspondence, too, setting up home inspection, and arranging an appointment to visit.  Thanks for your recommendation to take a look at Sonja, Josh---she is everything we wanted and more!
Hearts United for Animals	206880	1	/users/profile/269369	Jennie Z.	Client Served	5	07/21/2014	After FINALLY moving from a small apartment into our house and settling in, we decided it was time to seriously consider getting a dog companion as we had always thought we would do. We have family members who had gotten puppies from professional breeders and had also looked at our local Humane Society, but we always returned to the HUA site and fawned over the photos and carefully-considered descriptions of the dogs there. After all the searching, we decided there were a few dogs at HUA that sounded like they would be a good fit for us and everyone throughout the application/approval process made things so simple! We ended up going home with a companion that is perfect for us and who made our lives better immediately. We love our Violet so much and can't imagine being without her! I wish I could donate so much more to the organization and all of the animals there, some of which will be cared for throughout the rest of their lives right at HUA. I recommend adopting from HUA to people I know every time I get the chance.
Hearts United for Animals	204673	1	/users/profile/266708	Purlie	Client Served	5	06/30/2014	My previous rescue dog was a difficult hated people-3 year old an American Eskimo. He passed away a few months ago at 14 years old.  I missed my dog so much and felt guilty when I started my search on Petfinders, just to "look" at Eskies. I came across HUA and it was the only site that had genuine Eskies with real personality and behavior descriptions as well as where and why the dog was rescued.   I immediately went to their website and was thrilled to know that HUA is a group of dedicated volunteers, pulling all their talents and knowledge to secure helpless animals from abusive and neglectful environments and lives.  I called, filled out an application, was approved and a month later had a Beautiful American Eskimo flown to LaGuardia airport.  Yes, flown.      Why didn't I adopt closer to home? Because I requested to adopt 2 American Eskimo brothers, and it was suggested I considered Pearl (she was house broken) and would be more suited to my work and lifestyle. Not only does HUA know their dogs, they Definitely read the adoption applications! Knowing they researched me and had trust in me to provide love and care was worth a plane ticket to Pearls forever home! It is heartwarming to know that the people at HUA work tirelessly to afford all of their Rescues safety, love and care and ensure they never have to endure the cruelties of abuse again.  Thank you HUA!

Hearts United for Animals	195961	3	/users/profile/256236	Criha	Client Served	5	03/20/2014	I first learned of HUA on Facebook,  and being the animal lover I am, I "liked" their site immediately.   I have a soft spot for Chihuahuas, so I checked their inventory.  ;)  I already had a Chihuahua and really wasn't in the market for another dog, however I was drawn to little Sarita in a instance.  An elderly little girl who spent way too many years in a puppy mill.  I fell in love with her and knew I had to have her.  I knew she needed to live with us and be spoiled beyond belief.The online application process was a breeze.  I was contacted within a few days and had a volunteer interview us at our house a few days later.  I think it's wonderful how concerned HUA is with making sure their dogs go to good, loving homes.My daughter and I made a trip to Auburn to get our new girl.  The volunteers were all so friendly and helpful.  We've had Sarita since November 2013, and she is such a sweetheart.  She learned to potty outside almost immediately.  Old dogs DO learn new tricks.  :)  We will definitely return to HUA for our future fur babies! 
Hearts United for Animals	194715	3	/users/profile/254472	RickdeOmaha	Client Served	5	02/22/2014	HUA always puts the animals first and that is why we were drawn to them when looking for a new family member.  We visited once and we weren't able to see many dogs because it was late on Saturday and they didn't have many volunteers around to help, which I understand because they rely on volunteers.  We did see a few wonderful dogs through the fences and came back the following week during hours that were better for them (around 11 am).  The volunteer was very personable and brought the German Shepherd we wanted to see to meet us in the obstacle course area.  She was very shy and they explained to us her story and everything they have noticed about her so far.  We fell in love and went home with our sweet Zoe (known as Constance at HUA).  We are so lucky to have found her and HUA was the match maker.  They do a good job and have a lot of animals who need homes!
Hearts United for Animals	193553	3	/users/profile/252801	jmosier78	Client Served	5	01/30/2014	I was looking for a dog, I found HUA through a friend and searched their website.  I was lured to the shelter by a cute little fluffy pup, however the little guy had already been adopted out.  I visited the shelter while in Nebraska for the holiday.  I was overwhelmed by the kindness of all the volunteers/staff.  They provided information about EVERY dog that was in the shelter and asked many questions of myself to help make the right fit between me and my potential new pup.  I was impressed with the cleanliness of the facility and the conditions in which the dogs were kept.  There were many staff and volunteers available to help facilitate all of the happenings between prospective adopters and dogs.  Due to traveling, I had to make arrangements to pick up my dog a few days later.  When arriving at the shelter, they had Jeremy all packed up with leash/harness, papers, and jacket (it was negative zero outside).  They all gave him hugs goodbye and you could feel the compassion in their hearts when they had to say farewell.  A few weeks after I had brought him home, an HUA rep contacted me to ensure that things were going well.  Jeremy has been a PERFECT fit in my home and I am truly blessed at the care they provided for him during his homelessness.  They are truly wonderful people providing a phenomenal service.  The animals adopted from HUA are well cared for and loved during the time they need it the most.  Each of those dogs/cats will be soon adopted and it is a reassuring feeling knowing that the time they were in HUA was spent being loved so their transition to a new home will be rewarding for the people as well as the pups!
Hearts United for Animals	192404	3	/users/profile/251216	Joyce36	Client Served	5	01/10/2014	We had been following Hearts United For Animals online for several years. Last year we visited there and were immediately impressed by the caring people. The animals all seemed to love them and you could tell that they were loved right back! A couple of months ago HUA posted a picture of a momma and her puppies that were found under a bush after a severe rainstorm. I IMMEDIATELY fell in love with a little black and tan female named, Skittles. We had lost two of our beloved pets within a year of each other and our little Schnauzer was lonely. I contacted HUA and they set up an in home interview with a local volunteer. We were approved and within a few weeks we went and got our little girl! She is a joy and the people at HUA were terrific. They are always helpful and will answer any questions you have. Their first and foremost concern is the welfare of the animals. I would highly recommend them to anyone wanting to adopt a pet or looking for a worthwhile organization to donate to.

Their mission to shut-down puppy mills and to educate is so important, and the care they take of each animal is so admirable. Their website is clear and easy to navigate, and they include lots of great photos of the animals, along with their stories. I found the adoption process very easy and thorough, the people I worked with are caring and professional, and when we were quickly approved, they were able to fly little Monty to us. I now follow their postings on Facebook, which are timely, and both heartbreaking and uplifting, and when the time comes to adopt another dog or cat, they will be the first place we will contact  but in the meantime, we will continue to support them as they continue to support the animals and animal rights  their Amazon Wish List is a very easy way to help!

Hearts United for Animals	177466	2	/users/profile/234025	jenchampion	Client Served	5	10/14/2013	It is with pleasure to provide a review of Hearts United for Animals.  I started following HUA on Facebook a  year ago.  I would see their postings, read the heartfelt stories of the animals coming into HUA and then being adopted into happy homes.  I would watch their frequent HUA contests they would have showcasing their dogs up for adoption and I would donate $10 as they posted in need, but it wasn't until recently I started seeing the work they do more closely.   I recently adopted a nine year old puppy mill survivor from them.  I was a new adoptee so I was put through their process of qualifying a good home for their dogs.  I was so impressed by their thoroughness and their attention to detail in making sure that the people who adopt their dogs are committed to spending a lifetime with their animals.  And I was even more confident in HUA when we signed the paperwork for my new dog that included an agreement that if for some reason I cannot care for the dog I adopted that I would agree to give the dog back to HUA.  HUA makes a lifetime commitment to their dogs they rescue.  HUA is beyond amazing and the people there are simply incredible!  I am beyond grateful for HUA and they will forever be in my thoughts and prayers for the work they do on behalf of animals.   
Hearts United for Animals	172687	1	/users/profile/228663	Evan and Jess	Donor	5	10/01/2013	A truly great charitable organization to both donate to and to adopt a pet from, we have done both.  They truly care about their cause and you can clearly see your dollars at work.  They have several ways to donate, one of which I thought was a great idea, it's a wish list on Amazon where you directly buy the supplies that they need and they ship to the facility, in this case you know exactly how your contributing.  I would encourage anyone in the area to make the drive and meet the staff and volunteers and see the open book that is this charity, something that seems to be harder to find these days.  For those that are further away rest assured your donations are being used wisely and don't let distance stop you from adopting, they arranged for our dog to be flown to NY for us to pick him up, it was a great experience from start to finish.
Hearts United for Animals	171709	1	/users/profile/227352	NES1	Donor	5	09/25/2013	I have been a long-time supporter of HUA.  They rescue dogs from puppymills. They take in dogs that have come from closed down shelters, hoarding situations and any other reason a dog may need their help. I have sponsored Sanctuary Sweethearts for many years. These are dogs that are very intimidated by people and often have to stay at HUA their whole lives. This is a wonderful NO-KILL shelter for dogs and I am proud to be a monthy donor and also a lifetime supporter of HUA. 
Hearts United for Animals	171062	1	/users/profile/226570	Eileen E.	Client Served	5	09/22/2013	Over the years, I have looked at and searched for a No Kill rescue organization for another dog for our family.  Though there were many acceptable organizations, none stood out the way Hearts United for Animals did.  Every dog has pictures and the story of their life before being rescued.  HUA knows every dog at their facility.  Their personalities, quirks and everything about them.  All get individual attention from the staff and scores of volunteers who come to help rehabilitate the dogs so they can go to their forever homes.  A call will come in to HUA, "can you rescue these puppy mill dogs?"  "No" is not in their vocabulary.  No matter the day or the hour, a director/volunteer/staff member will race to rescue these poor pups from filthy, miserable conditions in all weather.  All the babies are triaged and those needing immediate medical attention are taken to a clinic or hospital.  They are given baths, food, water and anything else they need physically.  But most of all, they are given love and the time to heal from their medical conditions and their mental state.  Every pup is either spayed or neutered and had a dental before being adopted.  You may think that with all the pups they have they cannot possibly know every one.  I have seen first hand how the staff works with every animal they have and they know every one by name.  Every single pup gets individual attention by the staff and by the countless volunteers.  The facility itself is impeccably clean.  Someone is always cleaning.  It is divided up into different areas.  Triage, Clinic, bath, condos for big dogs, small dogs, homeward bound section, the sunroom, play yards and Sanctuary Sweethearts-the place for pups so traumatized by their previous life that it is best for them to live at HUA forever.   I have 2 rescue dachshunds from HUA.  They are either mother and daughter or sisters.  They came from a horrible place.  I flew out to get them and was unable to fly both home with me.  The staff met my friend at a mutual location with the other doxy.  Both had little harnesses and leashes and food.  Both were healthy, both were happy and curious, wonderfully socialized and very gentle, but all dachshund! Over the last year, these little girls have brought laughter to our family everyday.  Had it not been for HUA giving these girls a second chance, they would have met a horrible, horrible fate.  Some say that animals don't feel.  When my doxies were reunited, tears poured from their eyes.  I have never seen anything like it.  HUA gave my girls life when noone else could.  It is likely the most unique facility I have ever seen and one to be recognized for the achievements of the staff and volunteers who put the well being of those they are charged with above their own needs, wants and desires.  A true model for rescue organizations around the world.  
Hearts United for Animals	170899	1	/users/profile/226352	MichLiz	Client Served	5	09/20/2013	My first adoption from HUA was in 1998 and I was wary of having a dog flown to me but couldn't drive all the way to Nebraska from Maryland. The HUA staff set up EVERYthing very, very carefully and explained everything to me in advance. When my little Schnauzer arrived, he was in great shape and happy to go "home". Since then, I've adopted 6 more dogs from HUA over the years. The last four were driven East by two of the most wonderful and caring volunteers/Directors of the organization, Josh and Tera. We set up a convenient place to meet on the road, and the transfer was made. In all cases, the dogs had been loved, loved, loved by Josh and Tera. Even before leaving HUA, the dogs were carefully bathed and accessorized before going to their new home. One of the things that is so obvious when I first meet my new companion is that the dog has been cared for in a gentle and kindly manner, with good socialization and plenty of affection and caring. The dogs are never kept in a cage there and the volunteers and staff spend so many hours and hours simply loving the animals - petting and rubbing bellies and cooing in their ears.HUA takes care of hundreds of dogs (and some cats) at a time, and each one gets focused, individual attention and care. They do a fabulous job of providing the love and care an animal needs to find its forever home.

Two of his rescue dogs went with us (he has 8 dogs) - I was in hopes that I would be able to find a dog to adopt to help fill the void I was feeling.  We arrived at the facility and I was introduced tot he director and founder of the shelter. She personally escorted us around to see the 400+ dogs who are sheltered there. And they are there without fear of a needle at the end.  For you see Hearts United is a No-kill shelter and animals who are not adopted become Sanctuary Sweethearts and are assured of a loving caring environment to live out their natural lives. There seem to be countless volunteers who come in to help socialize the puppy mill animals who have been rescued from puppy mills where they have lived all of their lives in intolerable substandard conditions.   Hearts United also has a spay/neuter program and an emergency medical program which helps families with medical expenses so that their friends can be healed and remain with their family.   I was escorted around to look at the dogs and there was one dog in particular who quietly sat looking at me.  Her story was that she was 4 years old and had been brought to the shelter by a person who worked for the railroad and dod not feel he could keep her.  We got a chance to meet and I brought her home.  Molly has enriched my life and I do not know what I did without her. Oh and one more thing. I know that if something happens to me Molly can return to Hearts United and there to be taken care of by loving, caring people who deserve all the praise I can give them.
Hearts United for Animals	169005	1	/users/profile/224017	dmsy	Client Served	5	09/11/2013	I came across Hearts United for Animals in January of 2011,  what blessing that I did.  My little girl Skye from Hearts United arrived a couple months later to me in San Diego.  Later that year during a visit to my parents in Nebraska I was able to visit Heats United.  I wanted to personally thank Carol Wheeler and Skye's other caretakers for her care until I was able to find her.  I am so impressed,  what an amazing organization.  Just a few months ago I adopted again,  Hearts United brought my precious little Danny to the Omaha Airport before my departure back to San Diego in May.  I can not image adopting from any other rescue,  Hearts United does so very much to help the once prisoners of puppy mills,  the value they place on life has a very special place in my heart. Dennis in San Diego,   proud Dad to Danny and Skye 
Hearts United for Animals	165934	1	/users/profile/220438	lbeau30	Client Served	5	08/23/2013	We came across HUA from a link from the Humane Society of Colorado Springs, browsed the site and was so impressed by the compassionate work they did for an overwhelming amount of animals!  What impressed me was not just the stories written about the dogs history but how each story was also explaining all the characteristics and personalities and cute little things the dogs did and each story was unique! It wasn't the same old stuff that was copied and pasted.  They really KNOW these dogs!  We found a beautiful 11 yo Malamute who needed a home and it was the words from the staff that touched our hearts so much about her.  We drove out and were so impressed with this facility. They have an amazing amount of dedicated volunteers that clearly love these animals and give whatever affection and attention they can spread out over 400 dogs!  They keep dogs with more serious medical needs in areas where they can be watched carefully and as Carol gave us a tour, she knew every dog by name, every dogs story, diagnosis and medications... WOW!  John greeted us late at night after our 10 hour drive and knew how much we wanted to meet our new family member and was willing to stop what he was doing to unite us.  Everyone who works there is incredible! They run a loving home, they exercise the dogs, thoughtfully decide on roommates for these lovely animals based on their personalities and care so much to make sure they are going to a good, safe, loving forever home. They even called our vet to make sure we take care of what we already have!  It's nice to see so much compassion and not just a housing unit that wants to ship them off to ANY home. They already have a home at HUA, they just need their forever home!  Now I volunteer to do home evaluations for them, it's hard not to get involved at some level.  If you want a well cared for pet from an place that will give you an honest assessment of the dog you might be giving a forever home to, this is the place!
Hearts United for Animals	164846	1	/users/profile/50175	farley123	Volunteer	5	08/13/2013	I came across Hearts United for Animals approximately eight years ago.  After reading the stories of the dogs that were up for adoption I felt the need to volunteer and help socialize the dogs and give them love. I have consistently been impressed with the care and compassion given to the dogs.  The welfare and care of the dogs is the priority of all the staff and volunteers.  The best part of my week  is when I am at HUA spending time with the dogs. It is truly the best organization I have ever been involved with.

East Point Horspice	282829		/users/profile/372999	Writer	Volunteer	5	03/18/2016	I started volunteering at EPH this summer and am highly impressed.  The horses are well-cared for (and many are advanced in years, so caring for these horses requires extra time, money, and effort in order to keep them healthy and fit enough to function as mounts for the program).   Brian and Charlene are wonderful people, and Charlene has been helpful in offering tips and training advice with my own horses.  I'm a horse owner and have had extensive experience under another trainer, and know what a healthy horses looks like--and all of the horses at EPH are healthy and are in the best possible condition.  If something were to happen that I couldn't take care of my horses anymore, I would be perfectly comfortable knowing he went to EPH for the remainder of their days (don't have any plans for that, but if circumstances ever made it impossible for me to care for my own horses, I'd have no problem with them going to EPH).  The special saddle has arrived and has been used very successfully, and it has been amazing to see how the summer program has helped the riders gain confidence and build social skills.  
East Point Horspice	225971	1	/users/profile/289721	Megan78	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	It is the complete and utter ridiculousness of people that write things like the first three comments here that make me lose faith in the human race. Then I am honored and blessed to have the opportunity to volunteer at a magical place like EPH in the summer. The people running it are salt of the earth good people. They reach out to people and horses with such love and commitment. They help me to see there is good in the world. The lives they change, both equine and human, are astounding. To see it in action is breath taking! Brian and Charlene know and love each horse as if they were their own children. They know their likes, dislikes, and all their personalities. The kids light up each time they come out to ride. They grow each week and there is a real and tangible connection between them and their horses.  I have thought about what to write here about EPH and I couldnt find the words. They are a very deserving charity that throws all they have and all they are into what they do at EPH. The lies and speculations I read before made me so livid I could hardly put into words how it makes me feel. Its taken me a few days to stop being mad enough to write a review. I stand 100% behind Brian and Charlene and their amazing horses, clients, and volunteers.  My name is Megan M.

Brian and Charlene are wonderful, caring people who go above and beyond to help everyone have an enjoyable and valuable learning experience.  They have the nicest horses to work with and obviously spend hours and hours of their time taking care of these beautiful animals.  Thank you EPH!!!  
East Point Horspice	224953	1	/users/profile/288725	k.powell	Volunteer	5	10/21/2014	I am a volunteer and client of EPH.   I have been going out there for three years.  Brian and Charlene have not only helped me and my kids in learning about a horse.  Ex. Parts of the horse, saddle, how to feel a horse when under saddle and always improving my seat.  They have also taught me the proper ways to side walk, lead and dismount when helping in therapy.  Charlene has the patience to teach the youngest of kids to the oldest of adults.  She knows each and every horse inside and out.  She always puts the best horse with the clients that she has.  She is so knowledgeable about training both in therapy and in general.  She will teach you as much as you personally want to learn.  She is so giving to any and everyone.   Any committed volunteer would know that this program is designed to help these children and adults to better their lives and bring joy.  Every year the same clients come back and every year she gets more and more interest.  Thus EPH is doing what it's set out to do.  A place where people and horses come together.  It's sad that people feel the need to hurt others in more than one way.  Those that don't have a true knowledge of what goes on should really keep it to themselves.   Ex.  Making 40,000 in donations and tons of money from United way.  I think my definition of "tons" is a heck of alot smaller than yours.  Maybe you should ask United way if EPH can get that "tons" because that sure would help with the extra feed,  medication and much more.  Next time you want to hurt someone, you should also have enough guts to say who you are.  This is a GREAT program.  Brian and Charlene do a wonderful job and are totally committed to each and every horse and person.I will stand behind and beside my friends and the horses and the program.  My name is Kristin P.

Brian and Charlene are dedicated to helping both the children and the horses in their care.  They have proven to be worthy recipients of my donation. 
East Point Horspice	224803	2	/users/profile/288564	jwelk	General Member of the Public	5	10/21/2014	Some of the kiddos I teach participate in this program.  The kids are so excited and proud of themselves with all the accomplishments they achieve.  The weekly activities are organized and fun.  I have toured the facility and each horse is well taken care of.  The riders tend to ride the same horse to generate a bond and feel like that is 'their horse'.  The energy out there is palpable and contagious!  
East Point Horspice	224689	2	/users/profile/288452	sitzmansm	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/21/2014	In the past several years, I have had students involved in this program.  What an amazing program!  The children and families have all returned each year because of the kindness, love, and benefits bestowed upon the children while participating.  The Stephenson's are wonderful people.  So kind, caring, and generous - to everyone that is fortunate enough to cross their paths and to the horses! They truly want to do things to help people (and animals!).  Not only at their Horspice program but in their everyday lives - to me that is a true testament of a loving spirit.  I would highly recommend Horspice to any of my students and would not hesitate to have my own family involved if needed.  Alliance is truly blessed to have the Stephenson family!  
East Point Horspice	224654	3	/users/profile/288411	Deb_39	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	I'm horrified at the first comments on here.....I have volunteered for many years at the Stephensons and they both care for these horses as part of the family...me and my husband helped build shelters from the money they received from a fund raiser....I have a horse of my own out there and they call me about every little thing to keep me updated on his situation.......we recently moved away from the area and I left my horse in their care because he is so happy there and well cared for......I personally think the person or persons that wrote the negitative comments are very immature and must not have gotten their way about something. It seems to be someone mad at Charleen by the very untrue comments....or they are after attention which they are getting, so let's not spend anymore time one them.......this is a wonderful place to go visit and I'm sure you are all welcome to check it out.......forever grateful!!!!!
East Point Horspice	224641	4	/users/profile/288395	Dan_Cheryl_L.	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	My husband and I have been volunteers at East Point Horspice for the last two years.  We have never participated in such a wonderful program as East Point!  Brian and Charlene are two of the most caring individuals that we have ever met.  They put their hearts and souls into the program.  The horses are taken care of 24/7.  We have 8 horses of our own and know first hand how expensive feed and medical care can be for a large group of horses!  The horses at East Point are given wonderful care.  In 2013 we boarded our 2 year filly at East Point while she was being trained by Chole H.  Beauty was given the best of care and was very well trained by Chole under the direction of Charlene.  All horses at East Point are trained by Charlene using the methods such as "Clinton Anderson".  These methods are very time consuming but the most loving way that anyone can train a horse.  Anyone who works with horses could recognize the time and dedication that Brian and Charlene have to be able to train these rescue horses to be used in the Therapy Riding Program!  We have seen first hand the difference that the Therapy Riding Program has in the lives of the riders.  Not only are the riders improving their muscle tone, balance, and motor skills, but they are also developing a good self esteem and self confidence!  The activities are fun and engaging.  As a volunteer, we see the improvement in our riders increase weekly.  The kids enjoy this program and are certainly benefiting from their participation.  As for the new building, this is NOT for the personal gain of Brian & Charlene.  This building is the future home of all of the tack, helmets, props for activities plus a classroom for lessons and a handicap bathroom facility and a vet care area for horses in need.  Large Building projects are indeed expensive.  We admire Brian & Charlene for taking the first step in a multi-year project.  As fund raising efforts have money coming in more of the project will be able to be completed.  As for the therapeutic saddle, it was OUR idea that we presented to Charlene after working with a young rider with cerebral palsy.  We asked if this saddle would benefit the Therapy Riding Program at East Point and offered to help lead the fundraising efforts.  With receiving a local grant, raffle, garage sales, and wagon rides at Harvest Moon Fall Festival in Hemingford the cost of the saddle was met.  The saddle HAS been ordered and will arrive before the 2015 Therapy Riding Program begins.  We can hardly wait for next year's Therapy Riding Program!  We will continue to support and recommend this wonderful program to everyone we meet!  Dan & Cheryl L.

What an amazing experience it has been!!  Brian and Charlene are two of  the most giving, caring, and supportive people I have ever known.  My son has made numerous emotional and social advances through the therapy sessions they have provided. The horses in the program are amazing, and dearly loved and cared for by the owners and the riders.  Anyone who would state different has never been a part of or spent anytime around East Point Horspice.  Brian, Charlene, the horses, the clients, and the volunteers of East Point Horspice are all like a supportive loving family, as evident from the positive reviews from the Clients Served.  It's unfortunate that the anonymous negative reviewer doesn't see that or ever get an opportunity to be a part of something so amazing.

He loves everything about it and we have had nothing but positive results from the sessions.  We are more than blessed to have such a program available in this area!  Brian and Charlene are a couple of the nicest, most genuine people we have ever met. They treat everyone like family, and we know they care deeply for the horses that they rescue. I am shocked that anyone would post a negative review about EPH! Deplorable conditions? Not true.  And anyone who knows Brian and Charlene would know they are not in this for the money.  This program benefits so many- horses, riders, volunteers, and anyone who has witnessed the results of equine therapy.

He is calmer and his attention span is better/longer. Being autistic, my son suffers from poor social skills, hyperactivity and sensory issues, to name a few. Participating in this program has allowed him to improve in all of these areas. The magic between the horse and rider is breathtaking but the magic that includes Brian and Charlene is priceless! EPH is a program that my son will continue to participate in each year and if you have a loved one with special needs, please reach out to Brian and Charlene. Thank you EPH, Charlene and Brian for the extraordinary opportunity you provide!
East Point Horspice	224600	3	/users/profile/288355	ChloeH	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	I have volunteered out at East Point Horspice for 6 years, and I practically grew up there. I had my first riding lesson out there, got my first horse out there, and trained my first filly out there. Shame on all of you who accuse such things about them! They are like family out there and many kids grow up there and are annual riders. The horses are all loved dearly and all the money that is donated is benefiting the horses or riders in one way or another. All who have volunteered out at EPH have seen the growth between both the horses and riders. An anybody who actually knows Charlene and Brian would know the truth about their horse rescue. Charlene is the most dedicated woman I know and she spends all her time out with her horses and others horses. They all have put so much in this and to have those awful reveiws break my heart cause they are nothing but lies. If you would really go out and volunteer and spend the time with all those amazing kids and horses then maybe you would realize what you are jeopardising. And to prove I am not a fake this is Chloe H. and I will stand beside the EPH group.

I don't know how someone can be so overly critical of a place that all I've ever seen is smiling faces. Brian and Charlene are 2 of the nicest folks I've ever met. Maybe the only mistake they've made is opening up their own personal house for everyone to see and critique. I didn't know they had a new deck! I guess I was more interested in seeing my son light up when he gets to see his old buddy Tex. I would strongly recommend this therapy to anyone that has a child that needs a little extra attention.
East Point Horspice	224580	2	/users/profile/288338	Debbie1957	Client Served	5	10/20/2014	My daughter has participant for seven years. I have seen much improvement in the horses and the area. I have seen horses they have rescued improve and in better condition after they cared for them. They take a horse people feel have no purpose and work with and care for  that horse so it can be used for therapy helping a child and the horse. My daughter has rode the same horse for seven years and he is better condition since he is in their care.  In the beginning my daughter could not go the whole time so they refunded me with out me even asking. They have even sponsor her when I was unable to pay for the therapy. They have always went the extra mile for everyone. Ever year I see how much work they have put in to the area making thing better for the horses. The area is always mowed and clean. The large building is much needed for storing all the supplies used to do  therapy.  The therapy saddle has been ordered and will be used next year. The changes you will witness from a child doing therapy is amazing ! They are wonderful people and have done so much for my daughter and her horse !
East Point Horspice	224571	3	/users/profile/288329	Lue N.	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2014	I am very impressed with this program.  My grandson has been participating for several years and we have never had a bad experience.  He has ridden the same horse from the beginning and his horse actually looks better now than when we first started with the program because of the care he is getting.  My grandson will do whatever they ask him to do on his horse such as: riding backwards, side saddle, no hands, shooting hoops, fishing, dancing and the list goes on.  He looks forward to going each week and would be lost without the program.   Charlene knows each rider and their families personally.  She will stop and talk to us where ever she sees us.  This has been an awesome program not only for my grandson but for all the participants, this program has been invaluable to a lot of families.  All the families stay each week and if there was abuse going on I think we would know.

East Point Horspice	224548	3	/users/profile/288310	DeeDee B.	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	I am amazed at the previous three reviews.  Daniels 736--how long did you volunteer??  If you spent any time out there you would see that these horses are very well taken care of.  These people work full time average income jobs and then come home and dedicate themselves to those horses.  If you thought it was so deplorable why didn't you say something to one of them to "save those poor abused" horses.  If what you say is true then you are just as guilty as they are!!!  Next AQHA--How long did you volunteer?  Same as the above reviewer?  Yes every year these people do a fundraiser to raise money for Horspice.  Where do you think the food, hay, medical treatment, supplies all that stuff gets paid for from??  Out of their own pockets??  That stuff isn't free! They both work average paying jobs and have 2 kids.   They are not using the raised money for their own benefit.  Yes there is a big building out there now.  It isn't even finished on the inside because they had to borrow money to even put up the building.  You should really get your facts straight before writing such a horrible review and jeopardizing future donations to this charity!.  Ask any of the parents who have their kids involved in Horspice!  It makes a HUGE difference in these kids lives.  Maybe if you went out there to volunteer instead of worry about where the money went you might have seen what a great service this is to those kids.  And as far as the therapeutic saddle is concerned, they had to do fundraisers for it and they just finished the last fundraiser.  Get your facts straight!  Once again do you want them to pay for everything out of pocket?   And tickledpink---do you know the woman who runs Horspice personally?  Or did you meet her one time.  I have volunteered at Horspice for 2 years and I work with the man that runs it.  When they receive money from United Way or other groups they have to account for what they spent it on!  Did you bother to ask either of them what they spend the money on or voice your concern about the "horrible living conditions" for the horses??  No you would rather bash them on a website behind a fake name.  Once again, ask any parent who has a child in Horspice.  These are repeat kids every year.  Their parents and volunteers see what happens and sees the magic with those kids.  Shame on all of you for your nasty reviews!!!!

East Point Horspice	205254		/users/profile/267383	AQHA	Volunteer	2	07/06/2014	I was a volunteer for east point horspice.  I am saddened so see how bad the living conditions have become for the horses they claim to rescue. Every year this organization does an annual fund raiser to help raise money for the care of neglected and unwanted horses an I have yet to see any of the profits/donations go to the well being of the animals. They have resided their house and bought a brand new deck for their house. They also just put up what looks like a very expensive large building that they claim is a volunteer center but really it's just an over sized garage for them to park their vehicles and other personal items in. This is truly very sad to see generosity from the community spent on something that will benefit them personally.  They told everyone the money was suppose to go towards a therapeutic saddle but clearly it did not. I will no longer volunteer with this organization.

Since birth I have had to deal with this disease with only the support of my mom who did her very best but couldn't understand why I never got better. In desperation we searched the internet for any kind of information on SBS and how to live with the symptoms, esp. the mental health aspects. Finding the Short Bowel Foundation's facebook support group for adults was a crucial turning point for myself and my family. Andy and the members of the group have provided me with the information and emotional support that I had been looking  for all my life! The day I found the SBSF was one of the best days of my life!

My name is Pilar and I am the mother of Albert, a seven year old boy who suffers from severe short bowel syndrome. We are from Barcelona (Spain). Albert is on TPN for 19 hours a day at the moment. He is a clever,active and happy guy who goes to school and does lots of things. Key, for us has always been what he eats orally. We control sugar in all its forms and carbs. His nutrition is based on healthy fats and vitamins plus a bit of fibre. For us SBSF has been great help and support through the years. I met Andy when Albert just left hospital after spending there 9 months (he got NEC at six days of birth) and he has always been there for us to give us advise and comfort. I think this foundation is an awesome project which helps lots of people from all around the world that get connected through it. Here, in Spain we don't have a foundation like this and I am dreaming someday we can work together and build a Spanish branch of this wonderful project.Thanks Andy!

I found plenty of information and support for having a stoma but little to none for an adult with SBS. I came across the Foundation through a FB friend and the advice and support has been invaluable. You realise you aren't on your own and regardless of how you came to have SBS there is always someone managing the issues you are struggling with. This is a wonderful group of people who share their greatest fears and the funniest toilet humour! 
Short Bowel Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	304324	2	/users/profile/395491	aria-2016...	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2016	My granddaughter Aria was born April the 9th 2016. 2 days after she was born she had surgery for a bowel obstruction. When the surgeon went to do her surgery he discovered that 95 percent of Aria's small intestine had died. She stayed in the hospital in Austin. When she was released from the hospital she went home with a central line for TPN, had a Stoma for her feedings and G button for bile output. In August she went to Omaha Nebraska for a bowel reconnection. Dr . Mercer was able to reconnect her with 8 cm of small intestine. She's back home now in Waco Texas. She has a G button and her central line for TPN and Omegaven. She's doing amazing. My daughter  (Aria's mama ) and myself have learned a lot from her journey. We are on the Short Bowel Support Foundation page and it's been a great support for our family. #SBSAWARENESS2016 
Short Bowel Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	304288	3	/users/profile/395455	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	09/13/2016	When I found out I had short bowel syndrome I felt so alone, I knew no one who had it. I had been through cancer, had chemo and radio therapy which caused radiation proctitis and my bowel kinked and melted together. So I was given an ileostomy bag and put on Iv fluids. I had so many questions. The short bowel foundation made it possible for me to have all those questions I had answered by people who knew exactly what I was going through. I don't feel alone any more because Iv made the kindest of people I now call friends, my rocks.

I've learned so much from everyone and don't feel alone anymore.  The extra help Andy puts into this foundation and keeping us fellow sbs people up to date is greatly appreciated.   He's very good at what he does.
Short Bowel Syndrome Foundation, Inc.	304184	3	/users/profile/395358	jchase	Donor	5	09/13/2016	We finally have an organization to create awareness and raise money for Short Bowel Syndrome. As a parent of a SBS child, I find having these organizations important to bring other grieving families together. These children have a "hidden illness", where this syndrome seems to go unnoticed. Thank you for helping the SBS community!

It's been about 3-5 yrs that I've been a member of the Facebook SBSF support group. It has been a true life saver. I've learned so much about SBS from this support group. I have made many many friends who share this illness. SBSF has shown me I'm not alone, it's helped me learn about SBS how to manage better. It has been there for me on bad days and on good days. I am so thankful to have this kind of support.

I came across this group by accident and it has helped me to learn about my illness and to know that I'm not alone. The group is my lifeline. We can talk to each other without fear and know that somebody in the group has probably been where you are. I don't know where I would be today without the help of this foundation.

Epona Horse Rescue Inc	254292		/users/profile/290051	rsoren3	Volunteer	5	08/28/2015	Epona is a home away from home for me while I'm attending college! It never ceases to brighten my day to volunteer out there. The transformation that you see in the horses that come into the rescue is remarkable from the first day when they are emaciated or terrified of people to healthy, loving horses. Epona truly is a haven for both horses and people.
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	226316	4	/users/profile/290051	rsoren3	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	Coming to Lincoln from a rural area to attend college was exciting, but I missed being able to be outside or in the barn, but most importantly, I missed horses.  Epona has become my favorite pastime as I'm able to work with horses that deserve a second chance at a good life.  Lin and Larry are magnificent people who have the biggest hearts when it comes to helping these horses.
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	253765	1	/users/profile/342006	JordanGr	Volunteer	5	08/23/2015	I am so so so grateful to Lin and Epona Horse Rescue.  I volunteered as a college student and this rescue helped to open my eyes to all of the wonderful horses in the world that just needed a little help tI get back on their feet. I watched Lin rehab horses with a variety of behavioral problems time and time again. She showed me that all they need is a little love, patience, and understanding to live up to their full potential. I watched horses come in completely terrified of humans and leave a few weeks later to their forever homes calm and happy to finally be loved.  I've seen horses come in looking like walking skeletons and Epona horse rescue nursed them back to health. The world can be an ugly place but places like Epona Horse Rescue provide a light and comfort for some of the suffering animals out there. Thank you thank you thank you Epona for all that you do.

To give so much of your life to the betterment of these animals with very little support stands out as a miracle.   My wish is that everyone could take just 5 minutes to see all they do and I know they would feel the same way I do and want to help Epona in anyway they can.Thank you Epona from all the horses you have saved. Julie C.Lincoln Nebraska

I am glad to call myself a volunteer of Epona Horse Rescue.
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	226683	3	/users/profile/290416	cowgirl40	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2014	It is remarkable to watch the transformation of these rescued horses. Plus it is so rewarding to see the wonderful adoption stories.  The love they give to these horses is remarkable not to mention the lengths they go to for the special vet care and surgeries that are done. You ROCK EPONA!!!!!
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	226572	4	/users/profile/290303	JanetJ	General Member of the Public	5	10/25/2014	I had an opportunity to visit this rescue and was totally impressed with all they do for horses! I was captivated by the horses I met and the caring staff and volunteers.  I enjoy reading about their new rescues and the adoption successes. I hope to volunteer there someday after retirement.

They squeeze the most opportunity for their rescues out of every communication and every dollar.  They are a great regional asset, and great educators to boot.  Thank God for Epona Horse Rescue.  I wish we had them in every region of the USA.

Epona Horse Rescue Inc	226304	4	/users/profile/290038	Brenda70	General Member of the Public	5	10/24/2014	Epona is very close to us, we've been there, we've seen the entire facility, and even helped with evening feeding. This is a top notch facility, the animals are first and foremost and very well cared for. We follow the happenings there, including what happens when the vet or farrier has visited. The Owner (Lin Beaune) is so compassionate when it concerns any animal it is heartwarming. To see her is amazing.  Epona started out as a dream and became a reality, a way of life. They are highly recommended in our area, and often take in animals from long distances, just to keep them safe. Epona has such a positive impact on anyone that has been involved in any way, because you can see the love. They can tell you the story of most every animal in their charge, how they came to live at Epona, and their personalities. Every horse on the property becomes a loved personality from the moment it is deemed they will become part of Epona, often before. I highly recommend Epona to anyone and everyone, looking for a sanctuary, or looking to adopt a rescue. The horses that are there know what being loved really means
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	226294	4	/users/profile/290030	hlombard	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I've been volunteering at Epona for about two years. I've adopted one horse from them and plan to adopt another, and hopefully keep volunteering for years to come. I've seen so many horses come in starving and abused, and leave fat and happy. Lin does a great job of making sure each horse has their unique needs met, and working with both adopters and the people giving up their horses to make sure that the animals are cared for. I've heard lots of rumor and gossip about the organization, but I guarantee that nobody who believes them has spent more than a day there. In my two years volunteering, I have never seen any horses neglected, have never seen any horses abused, have never seen any reason to stop supporting them - and trust me, I'm picky as hell, and if I suspected abuse, neglect, or irresponsibility I would leave. Things don't always run smoothly, because they have limited help (virtually all their help is from volunteers) and limited space, but they always do their absolute best.
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	226282	2	/users/profile/290018	mski13	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I have always had a love for horses, but attending school in Lincoln made it difficult to spend time with them. Volunteering at Epona has given me experience working with horses and people and allows me to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Lin and Larry truly care about each one of the horses and volunteers and are impacting many lives through Epona. The horses' lives as well as the humans that work with them or adopt them are changed for the better. I am proud to be a part of such an inspiring organization. 
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	226275	1	/users/profile/290010	meg201350	Volunteer	5	10/24/2014	I have been very involved with Epona Horse Rescue over the last couple years, and it has been nothing but a positive, wonderful experience. The staff of Epona Horse Rescue is both positive and encouraging. Everyone there presents a warm attitude and the safety of the horses and volunteers is of the utmost importance. The rescue has come a long way in the 10 years it has had its arms open to those who cannot speak. I look forward to the bright future the rescue has, and I can't wait for all of the exciting things that are happening in the near future!

They do an awesome job for unwanted, abused and neglected horses.  They facility is very clean and the horses are well feed and taken care of.  They work tirelessly to find homes for these horses.  They work in conjunction with Lusco Farms in Iowa, a donkey rescue, that also does amazing work.  It would not be possible without the amazing donations they receive and have just finished a beautiful barn to house mothers and their new foals, injured and other horses needing special attention.  Please check with them first if you are in the market for a horse (or 2) that need a loving home!
Epona Horse Rescue Inc	196722	1	/users/profile/257133	kozykaleidoscope	Client Served	5	03/30/2014	I came to the rescue as a volunteer, originally. After a rough week of learning that my beloved 26 year old OTTB needed to be retired, I spent the day with Lin, the director, and fellow volunteers meeting new horses. And after only a week, I became a client of Lin's. She agreed to help me retire my horse, and I fostered a lovely 13 year old Oldenburg mare named Kasbah. Lin was upfront, honest, and direct with dealing with the process of the horse swap and exchange. Red, along with every other horse out there, is fat, healthy, and well looked after. Kasbah came home and I knew exactly what I was dealing with - Lin's accurate portrayal of the horse made it very easy to start working with her.  A lot of what is online about Lin and the Epona Horse Rescue is all false. Lin does NOT run a breeding facility, Lin does NOT deal with slaughter houses, Lin does NOT hoard horses. She has a fantastic turn-over rate with horses staying in their forever homes. As a volunteer, friend, and adopter from the Epona Horse Rescue, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone!

Epona Horse Rescue Inc	54605	12	/users/profile/56151	lovemyhorse	General Member of the Public	1	10/07/2010	This "rescue" in my opinion is a sham. She is NOT a rescue but rather a hoarder. Animals mysteriously die, disappear, etc. She is even listed in the local yellow pages as a horse dealer. Horse dealers are brokers who broker horses mainly for slaughter to Canada and Mexico. Please do not donate to this person.

It was a terrific experience for me and the other volunteers.  The program was very organized and provides such a valuable service to families in the Omaha community.  I feel very fortunate to have been part of such a worthwhile program.  The Food Bank is definitely making a difference in our community.

In 2011, I upgraded their enterprise software and the staff makes maximum use of it so as to feed as many hungry people as possible.  Amongst my other food bank customers, I hold out the Food Bank for the Heartland as a model because they not only utilize all available functionality to fulfill their noble mission, but have also requested software changes to do so even more effectively.  It makes me proud to see so many smart people using the product I support to do so much good.  I might add that they are not only customers, but also wonderful friends. 
Food Bank for the Heartland	147863		/users/profile/195643	bcwgobuffs228	Volunteer	5	01/08/2013	Foodbank for the Heartland does a great job collecting and distributing food and supplies to those in need.  They act kind of like a wholesale company -- many of their clients are the groups actually feeding the hungry -- soup kitchens, churches and so on -- most of their work comes through collecting the food -- thus the word "bank" in the title. Some of the programs go toward feeding the hungry directly too. All in all, a great place to help out, a great cause to support.
Food Bank for the Heartland	147851		/users/profile/195628	carolwill	Board Member	5	01/08/2013	The Food Bank for the Heartland is passionate about their mission to eliminate hunger in Nebraska and western Iowa.  Then need is greater than most of us know -- seniors having to chose between paying utilities or buying groceries, kids without enough food at home on the weekends, working parents struggling to make ends meet and feed a hungry family.  Approximately 21,900 people receive emergency food assistance every week in the Food Bank's service area.  As a board member, I have been deeply moved by stories of the lives touched by a helping hand from the Food Bank.  In addition to their own programs, the Food Bank distributed over nine million pounds of food to local non-profit agencies, who then provide it directly to those in need.  The Food Bank staff is committed to making every donation count -- three meals can be distributed for every $1 donated.  I am so proud to be associated with this organization and the life-changing assistance they provide.
Food Bank for the Heartland	147815		/users/profile/195582	board member tara	Board Member	5	01/08/2013	The Food Bank of the Heartland is one of the most committed, well-organized, and passionate charitable organizations in our state and the Midwest.  Its role in distributing food to needy families and individuals in Nebraska and western Iowa cannot be overstated.  It does more with less, making its dollars and effort go farther.  Some of its most significant programs include the Kids Cafe, which provides evening meals to low-income children in the community at risk of going hungry, the BackPack Program, which provides backpacks of food to hungry children to get them through the weekend, and providing weekly food deliveries for senior citizens with limited financial resources.  The Food Bank's drive to providing food to people in need and to eliminating hunger make it a vital member of our community and state. 
Food Bank for the Heartland	58063		/users/profile/61652	steve	Board Member	5	11/29/2010	I've been on the board for 19 years. It has grown from a small food bank to a very significant participant in food distribution to the hungry in all of Nebraska and the western third of Iowa.  Among its fine programs are its Kids Cafes and Bank Pack initiatives which insure that school children begin to have enough to eat. When kids are hungry, they do not learn.  I think the staff and leadership are outstanding and very much understand about feeding the hungry. I'm proud to be a part.

We have many students that benefit greatly from the program, and would be without food on the weekends if this program didn't exist.    The food provided in the weekly packets, is food that the kids enjoy and they say that it is good.  Our families are very thankful that this program is there to help them out at home when they need it.

They are so passionate about their mission and so grateful to those who catch any glimpse of the passion and help in any way.  Their effort to not only collect money for food, but to inform the entire region about the growing problem of hunger in the region is tireless, relentless and inspring.  They always have personel on hand at our events to thank and inform the public.  If anyone asks me where they can make a difference, The Foodband for the Heartland is one of the places I would suggest first.
Food Bank for the Heartland	57680		/users/profile/61054	AnniesDoodlebugz.com	Donor	5	11/23/2010	Food Bank for the heartland is making such a HUGE difference not only in it's home base city of Omaha Nebraska, but they serve most of Nebraska and western Iowa! They have grown with so many great programs. They serve around 300 food pantries and distribute around seven MILLION pounds of food annually! That is why I donate the profit from my online store to them. it is not much money, but EVERY dollar counts. They can turn $1.00 donated into 3 meals.

When I took the Tour of Agencies in the Spring I was amazed at how many organizations the United Way helps, and I could tell from their brief presentations how many great things are made possible by the United Way.  The staff is very helpful and positive and work together very well to assist all of the agencies that we support.  Finally, they are very good stewards of the money they receive and make sure all agencies are accountable for what they do with the funds they receive.  It is a great organization to be a part of and makes our local communities a much better place!

The Heartland United Way is committed.  They match a challenge with its solution -  all day, every day.  They're always on.  They care, they're driven, they're focused and they're extremely accountable.  They are fiscally responsible and are very conscientious stewards of donor dollars.

Heartland United Way, Inc.	224514		/users/profile/288278	fifeman26	Volunteer	5	10/20/2014	What an amazing organization.  I first became exposed to the Heartland United Way when I moved to this area and experienced my first workplace campain a little over 15 years ago.  I was so impressed by their community investment process that uses volunteers to hold agencies accountable that I got involved myself.  Not only does this process of community fundraising allow me to give with confidence knowing agenices are being required to use my charitable dollars effectively and efficiently, it also frees up agency time to focus more on their mission and less on raising money.  This means they get to help and give hope to more of my neighbors, friends or family members when they need it.  This makes the whole community where I raise my family a better place to live.  Talk about a Win, Win, Win!
Heartland United Way, Inc.	224511		/users/profile/288275	dfargo	Board Member	5	10/20/2014	The Heartland United Way does an excellent job raising funds and an even more impressive job of getting the most out of the funds raised. I have never seen a harder working group than their staff.

Not only do I see this from the leadership of Tabitha, but also from its employees and team members. I believe that is a true testament to the type of high quality care and experience they pride themselves on.

My experience with Tabitha is that they have a "culture of caring" and it runs through every level of its staff.  Everyone I have encountered promotes this culture . . . they live it, and they practice it.  Whatever level of service that is needed in elder care, my experience is that Tabitha will provide it with great competency.  Suzanne Mahel Tyrrell

Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	104065		/users/profile/65761	JimM	Volunteer	5	01/21/2012	I have particularly enjoyed some of the wonderful activities hosted by GPWHP over the year.  The Welsh Heritage Festival in October attracted visitors from all over the country, with professional quality music and historical presentations.  Other events have highlighted talent and resources from the Nebraska area, including a student Harpist performing Welsh love tunes.  The Welsh Heritage Centre in Wymore, NE continues to offer a tremendous opportunity to mark the contributions of the local Welsh community.
Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	60462		/users/profile/65761	JimM	Volunteer	5	01/20/2011	A wealth of cultural and family history is often lost without the dedicated work of organizations like the Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project.  Dedicated volunteers commit countless hours to the painstaking preservation of  historic records and memorabilia.  But this rich history comes alive in many Welsh celebrations and community activities held by the Welsh Heritage Centre in Wymore, NE.  These wonderful events draw people from far and wide, and join neighbors around a shared history... even those not of Welsh descent.  This is a well-managed and creative program in our community.
Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	99035	1	/users/profile/118410	edbethui	General Member of the Public	5	10/06/2011	I have been greatly impressed by the energy, enthusiasm, innovation, and attention to detail that has characterized the development of this multifaceted resource. These qualities are a reflection of its outstanding leadership team that includes two people who had a similar impact on the Welsh Society of Western New England, where I am active as board member and webmaster.  Berwyn E. Jones (president; grants writer, and researcher) and Martha Davies (secretary; Welsh translator, researcher, and columnist) have kept me informed of their vision for new initiatives and have frequently sought ideas and support of their grant funded projects. Thus, even though I have not had the opportunity to travel there from my home in Massachusetts, I have come to greatly admire what the Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project has achieved in its mission to discover, preserve, interpret and celebrate the history of Welsh immigrants on the prairies of North America.
Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	62315		/users/profile/68113	IOWA	Board Member	5	02/01/2011	This is a group I have been privileged to work with for a few years, now.  The are all top notch, work hard and focus on the common goal to produce a level of work product that should be envied by other non-profits.  Doing long range planning and checking on accomplishments of established goals keep a unified and steady path to achieve them.  The Welsh-American community recognized their accomplishments when the National Welsh American Foundation awarded 2 of the Board members with the NWAF Heritage Medallion in 2010.   The memorial path in the garden attests to the honor bestowed on the Welsh ancestors of Welsh-Americans.
Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	62148		/users/profile/67930	mrsbedbug	General Member of the Public	5	02/01/2011	What a great place!  It is so nice to have places in the community that can teach us about our history.  There was a Welsh immigrant community in Wymore, Nebraska years ago and many of the residents of the area have roots in Wales.  This museum reminds us of our history.  Some even learn about their own family histories here!  There are many exhibits of interest to children, this would be a perfect place for a family, school, or Scout field trip.  There is a little movie theatre as well.   Places that we can go to learn about our own or our community's history are few and far between, this place is a gem!  
Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	60455		/users/profile/65743	Shirley-Ohio	General Member of the Public	5	01/20/2011	Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project brings together people and resources.

Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	60393		/users/profile/65655	julie	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	I was fortunate enough to become involved with GPWHP from the onset. At that time I became a board member, volunteer and anything else I could do to further this group. Also at that time I was the mayor of Wymore. I not only realized what this group could do to further Welsh heritage but the great economic value it would be for Wymore, as well as, Gage County and SE Nebraska. Since its inception there has been nothing but volunteers who have very worked hard, truly care about perserving heritage, the community in which their museums and operations are based and retain a positive, forward thinking attitude to take this non-profit into the future. The volunteers put in many many hours to make sure they follow their mission statement and are above board in its operation. I have since moved from my hometown of Wymore to Washington state. I am currently on the Advisory Board which I am thankful for. I know from personal experience how this organization has brought very positive outcomes to a community that is struggling. They are the shining star in the City of Wymore. They have done a lot with a little and is an organization that other non-profits could gleem from. I could really go on and on but would be redundent in stating how wonderful the GPWHP. Keep on Keepin' On GPWHP
Great Plains Welsh Heritage Project	60390		/users/profile/65652	Carolyn Strother	Board Member	5	01/19/2011	What a wonderful project to honor our Welsh Heritage!

Voices of Omaha	232960		/users/profile/296607	ASLady	Volunteer	5	11/05/2014	 It is wonderful to see so many young singers joining us this year - 37 high school singers! I first sang in the Messiah with the Voices of Omaha when I was 12. It is an experience I will never forget! Learning to love and sing such a deep and complex work of music has benefits that last a lifetime!
Voices of Omaha	197572	3	/users/profile/258275	peterslaurak	General Member of the Public	4	04/13/2014	Attending the Messiah performance was absolutely lovely.  What a great opportunity to attend a FREE concert at a great Omaha location!  I enjoyed all the musical aspects of the performance - solos, choir, and instruments as well.  Knowing a singer and violist made the experience even more enjoyable.
Voices of Omaha	197570	3	/users/profile/258272	Lynne19	General Member of the Public	5	04/13/2014	Voices of Omaha raises money to pay for a venue and gives a FREE performance of the Messiah for the people of Omaha and surrounding areas. We come up from Nebraska City and this past year friends of ours from Independence came with us and are planning to drive up again next year. It is a wonderful performance and the volunteers who do this every year deserve the highest praise for their effort
Voices of Omaha	197489	2	/users/profile/258170	Antoni	General Member of the Public	5	04/11/2014	I have attended Handel's Messiah as performed by the Voices of Omaha for the past four years.  Every year the performance is breathtaking!  The venue where the performance is held is easy to get to with plenty of available parking.  Once inside the building there are many people there to help guide you to open seats and provide you with a pamphlet.  The soloists combined with the Voices of Omaha put on a wonderful performance.  When they perform the Halleluiah Chorus, I literally get goosebumps.   I think that it is wonderful that the Voices of Omaha put on this performance, with that venue, and with an amazing level of professionalism, for free!  This concert provides people without the means to normally attend such an event, the allowance to enjoy this historic piece of music, performed by magnificent artists. I highly recommend this performance. 
Voices of Omaha	196941	2	/users/profile/257443	Jd.rydberg	Board Member	5	04/02/2014	I grew up watching the free performance of Messiah each holiday season with my family. I never dreamed one day I'd step out of the audience and into the show.  I hadn't done much singing in several years, so I was a bit rusty & doubting my ability to sing such a challenging piece. But the fantastic people with Voices of Omaha welcomed me with open arms. Not only was I happy to sing with a group again, but I expanded my social network and made some lasting friendships. 
Voices of Omaha	195505	3	/users/profile/255582	CPAsinger	Board Member	5	03/11/2014	I have been involved with the Voices of Omaha for the past several years as both a singer and a board member.  In that time, the organization has made great strides in reaching education and diversity goals, improving its transparency, and updating its look with a new website, logo, and social media outreach.  Members work hard to produce a musical performance of a high caliber that is free to the public.  
Voices of Omaha	195409	3	/users/profile/255434	Mary250	Volunteer	5	03/08/2014	I have sung Messiah for seventy years.  In 1944 Dr. Noel J. Logan began a group called the Apollo Club.  We rehearsed in the old Omaha YWCA until its demise, after which we moved to the First Baptist Church, then First Christian Church.  It was at some time when we were rehearsing at First Christian that Voices of Omaha assumed responsibility for the annual Messiah.   I have sung Messiah at the Orpheum Theater in Omaha; at the Broadway Methodist Church in Coincil Bluffs, Iolwa; at Avery Fischer Hall in New York City; at the Congregational Church in Neligh, Nebraska; and The Holland Center in Omaha. I've sung the Hallelujah for seven years with senior high family students at Green Va,lley High School in Las Vegas Nevada. It is truly a relief to know that Voices of Omaha, that celebrated its forty-fifth annual sponsorship of Messiah, now has this event on firm footing and that we can expect another forty-five years of Messiah. Mary Mahoney
Voices of Omaha	195301	3	/users/profile/255296	Handel-Fan	General Member of the Public	4	03/06/2014	Voices of Omaha's annual performances are always of the highest musical quality.  Their choice of performance venue is without equal in the state of Nebraska! The fact that they also raise all the funds to finance this annual concert is amazing to me.  And they've been at it for 45 years (and counting)!
Voices of Omaha	195291	2	/users/profile/255281	normo1935	Volunteer	4	03/06/2014	I sang in the Voices of Omaha's production of the Messiah last year for the first time. I have lived in Omaha for over 30 years and have always wanted to participate. My schedule didn't allow this until last year.  I sing bass and was privileged to sit beside dedicated singers who had sung from 5 to 28 years and loved the experience as much as I did for the first time.  It was great to meet new 'singer's and enjoy the fellowship with like minded people.I sing in the First Christian Church choir on Dodge Street and several of our choir members hope to join me, the Lord willing,  in this years presentation. Looking forward to renewing friendships this fall. Norm Huber, Omaha, NE
Voices of Omaha	195289	3	/users/profile/255276	gdtaber	General Member of the Public	5	03/06/2014	Voices of Omaha is a wonderful organization. As an original member, I have  enjoyed immensely my participaione in this organization since its beginnings. Voices welcomes anyone who loves to sing, and there is no audition required. That can be a big encouragement for singers who don't audition well. The whole purpose, first, is to bring The Messiah to the people of Omaha and thte surrounding area as a free gift. Secondly, it provides an excellent large choral experience for singers and a training ground for singers who might not otherwise have access to any type of vocal training.  I would encourage anyone to come and sing with us and also support this wonderful organization.

Montessori International School of the Plains	159006		/users/profile/211087	dldrn2000	Client Served	5	05/30/2013	I have had two children, and this fall, 2013, will have all three of my children attending MISP. Tim and Alice apply child development prinicples with the needs their generation will face in college and the workforce; those of critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, independence, and reflection. The school grows every year to now include foreign language and art. I highly recommend this school for any parent or student seeking education and not a college prep or 'teaching to the test' designed curriculum.  MISP is a true non-secular jr. and senior high that refreshingly strays from the traditional choice between public or religious based Omaha schools, making this a jewel for a growing city like Omaha.
Montessori International School of the Plains	157743		/users/profile/209194	Dawn122	Client Served	5	05/13/2013	My son attends MISP and we couldn't be happier! Entry to middle school is often challenging for students, but the teachers and students at MISP are wonderful and have made the transition to secondary school effortless. The teachers differentiate for the needs of each and every student, make them feel welcome, and have created an amazing community of learners. The curriculum is challenging and motivating, with connections to life-long learning. The students have pride and ownership in their school and will be beyond prepared for life after high school. I highly recommend MISP!

The impact that this school makes on the kids that attend is immeasurable.  They are given an education that while focusing on their skills and interest demands that students understand the influence they have within the community and world. MISP creates an environment for young adults to look beyond themselves and make positive moves to serve others.  I think that this environment brings out the best in the students and helps create people that will positively impact their communities.
Montessori International School of the Plains	156144		/users/profile/207179	Ruth Kruse	Board Member	5	04/25/2013	So many of our kids say school is "boring!"     MISP is not...because it challenges every kid to use his/her natural talents to their best possible use.  It is hopefully the wave of the future.    Having outstanding teacher/facilitators is why MISP is so vital.
Montessori International School of the Plains	156020		/users/profile/207034	cindycc	Client Served	5	04/24/2013	My son has attended MISP for several years. It has been an amazing experience for him. The teaching is beyond anything I have seen in public schools (with any of my three kids). The curriculum is incredible, and they somehow do amazing work with students of all different levels and abilities. My son is challenged, continues to learn to be more creative, loves to argue about issues (something I attribute to the school and the work they do in teaching students how to dissect issues and arguments). He will definitely be ready for College. After dealing with [good] schools in the public school system in Omaha and environs for over 14 years, I have been very pleased with MISP. My only wish is that we had found it earlier! After experiencing it, I cannot imagine why a parent would put their kids in public school. I am a University professor, and so have a good idea of what the output of the K-12 system should be  - and MISP education fills the bill. 
Montessori International School of the Plains	155979		/users/profile/206991	michelb	Client Served	5	04/24/2013	This was my son's first year at MISP--actually, at any school--we homeschooled until this year.   I was nervous about the transition, but as soon as I met the teachers and toured the school, I knew MISP was where my son should be.  The teachers respect the students--that is evident from the emails I receive and the interactions I observe.  The students have freedom within framework:  they are free to make choices, mess up, figure out what works and what doesn't.  They are learning HOW to learn.  I am thrilled that my son has the opportunity to attend this Montessori high school, to develop relationships with all the great students, and receive guidance from our dedicated teachers.
Montessori International School of the Plains	155923		/users/profile/206929	Tricia17	Client Served	5	04/24/2013	My son is a student at Montessori International School of the Plains and we couldn't be happier.  We have experience in montessori; both in public school as well as private and moving into the junior high/high school years with Montessori has been a great decision for us.  MISP's strengths are the teachers.  They have years of experience teaching Montessori students as well as gifted and special education.  They allow the children to think for themselves and celebrate differences instead of trying to make each child fit into the same box.  They learn to think at a deeper level than straight memorizing and cramming for tests and have also learned many life skills.  The best thing is that my son LOVES school and loves learning.  He is excited to go each day and we have no stress at our house to finish random projects full of busy work.  Their goal is on learning; not teaching to a test and the kids are thriving.  I highly recommend this school.

Public school was a stifling oppressive experience for him. He has become an independent, broad minded thinker!  His creativity was encouraged, rather than muted and killed!  He's becoming a confident, empathetic, happy young man.
The Hidden Front	34308	7	/users/profile/35127	dd1	Donor	5	03/31/2010	We have been friends with Aneita, Megan, and their family for years.  Their pain as they struggled through the effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with their son/brother became our pain.     But in their faith-filled choices, they've turned tragedy into passion to be used for the good of others.  These two are very intelligent women who are not afraid to research, study, call, ask questions.  In other words they have become self-educated experts on PTSD.  I have actually seen the files they've compiled.  This knowledge has been recognized as they were invited to be Consumer Reviewers in Washington D.C. and online for Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs alongside top scientists from across the country.  This committee reviews research proposals for military health issues to determine their qualification for further funding.  Upon discovering the depth of Aneita and Megan's research they were singled out as experts in the area of PTSD.      Aneita and Megan's hearts to better prepare homecoming soldiers and their families through The Hidden Front have been tireless. But in addition they are reaching back to those affected by wars-past whose struggles have never been acknowledged.   I am convinced the work of the Hidden Front is not a passing phase, but as long as there is resource, Aneita and Megan will be on the front line.
The Hidden Front	34101	4	/users/profile/34926	sally3	Board Member	5	03/29/2010	I have helped with the Hidden Front in several ways since it was first began.  It's founders, Aneita and Megan are very energetic and devoted to helping our veterans and their families who are dealing with PTSD.  They have turned a personal tragedy into a positive by helping others.  The Hidden Front has had informational conferences, awareness days, media appearances, and many personal contacts with veterans and families, providing information and resouces as needed.
The Hidden Front	33285	9	/users/profile/34098	niki0109	Volunteer	5	03/16/2010	I have been able to help at some of their fundraisers and it has been uplifting to see the helpful effect this organization has had in people's lives. I think they provide a vitally important service for some very deserving Americans. Whenever I have shared the existence of this organization with others, especially military families, they are relieved to hear that such an organization exists.
The Hidden Front	33055	6	/users/profile/33881	ed-steele	Volunteer	4	03/12/2010	We personally know the founders of The Hidden Front and we know about their passion to help our soldiers who are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan and other war fronts with post traumatic stress syndrome - PTSS.  One of their family members suffered PTSS before it was recognized as a problem of those involved in fighting for our country.  Because that family member did not get the help he needed when he needed it, he is now serving time in a prison.  The Hidden Front will hopefully help others in a way that their relative was not helped when he needed help.

They have turned their own family experience into something positive, The Hidden Front.  The Hidden Front helps our veterans, soldiers, their families, and anyone suffering with PTSD.  It brings awareness about PTSD and teaches and helps you to understand what PTSD is.  They have a heart for our veterans and their families and are doing all they can to help them.
The Hidden Front	32945	1	/users/profile/33772	dlasalle	Board Member	5	03/10/2010	This organization was formed under painful circumstances with the goal of helping others avoid such pain in their own lives and the lives of their returning veterans.  I have seen first-hand the drive and dedication the founder of this organization possess and her dream to help others is awe inspiring.  I believe this organization will continue to grow and make an impact in more veterans lives as awareness about The Hidden Front grows.   I myself am a veteran and would encourage any veteran suffering from the scares of war to reach out and contact The Hidden Front for information regarding their circumstance.   It is an honor to know the people who created this veterans group.  Their dedication to helping others will never waiver and they will provide veterans with the answers they need regardless  of the situation.

I seen the pain that they suffered because they had no idea of what was happening to son who had came home from the war so hurt. Out of the tragidty that they have suffer they have worked hard at helping other families to recognize what is happening to their loved one so that they can get help. Also the hidden front has brought this help to one place to make it easier for them to fine what they need.I wish everyone could turn such a tragidty into something so good.
The Hidden Front	32851	1	/users/profile/33679	tb	Volunteer	5	03/10/2010	Aneita Strasburg is a friend of mine.  I have seen her pain and the pain that her family has been through the last few years and it tears at my heart. But through all the pain a strong UNITED front was built, in her family and friends.  I am so proud to call her friend.  Aneita and Megan have turned their personal family tragidty into something positive, The Hidden Front, it is bringing awareness to those who may have otherwise never been able to get help.  They also are the prime example of what people can do for the good of others.  With the time, love, and passion that Aneita and Megan have for The Hidden Front the word is getting out that there is help out there and they will go to any lengths to help!!  For me personally I have seen a strength and kindness in these two that I respect and admire.

Dir. of THE VETERANS MUSIC MINISTRY, I have been in contact with Aneita from before it existed, during the crisis and grief which served as the catalyst for the program, the development, and have seen the program grow.  I've provided resources, encouragement, entrepreneurial tips, etc during the development.  I've been privileged to attend a Seminar she hosted, using her pain, using Therapists, a Vietnam Veteran to help reach out to other Blue/Silver Star families....to help them identify red flags in their returning family member from Iraq/Afghanistan....those tips that were not provided to her when her son returned.She is using her knowledge and research to reach out to other parents to fix what makes her sad, not only for our community but beyond.  In her mission to help others, she is finding healing for herself.  I'm proud of her enthusiasm, the proof she listened to my ideas, and the fact that she cares because she is one of the secondary victims to PTSD of the War on Terror.

National Arbor Day Foundation	191781	7	/users/profile/250292	brooks1875	General Member of the Public	5	12/28/2013	I read some of the comments about the 2013 survey. Yes, it is a bit simple and so on, but it is an opportunity to start the conversation off rather that simply saying "give us some money". They do offer some small trees that might be valuable to contributors.  Instead of "bad mouthing" the organization, I consulted Guidestar that offers in-depth information about a million charitable organizations. Based on the 2012 IRS Form 990 The National Arbor Day Foundation supports many good causes, their officers are not overpaid and their administrative costs are reasonable. The total administrative and fund raising expenses total about 10%, which is reasonable. I have seen instances of what appear to be worthwhile organizations with great sounding titles, yet they spend 25%-30% or more of their total expense budget with a contract service to solicit funds.  The description of the worthwhile contributions this organization supports are well worth public support.   Enough said! 
National Arbor Day Foundation	164733	1	/users/profile/218962	Chris_Riemer	General Member of the Public	1	08/13/2013	I recently received a mailing labeled as the 2013 New Jersey Tree Survey. Seriously packaged, complete with a "Participant Number" on the front. But the survey itself was just 16 silly questions... things like "Have you ever climbed a tree?" It was obviously an attempt to tug the heart strings and package a fund-raising pitch as something else. That duplicity bothered me enough to consult GuideStar. I might have responded well to something more direct and honest, and seeing that others felt the same way, I decided to write this review. There's more than a little irony when an organization dedicated to saving trees sends such a paper-intense communication, which included a calendar, various coupons and personalized return address labels. Please!
National Arbor Day Foundation	151155	7	/users/profile/201716	Neal Miller	General Member of the Public	2	03/16/2013	I was a former donor to National Arbor Day Foundation and still believe that it serves a worthy cause.  However, I was a bit disappointed in their recent mailing to me (2013 Forest Survey - Texas) that indicated that I had "been selected as part of a representative sampling of Texas residents to participate in this year's survey."  Additionally, to "thank me" I would receive 4 free gifts.  The survey was very shallow and was important to their donation marketing, I suppose (my demographics, whether I visited forests or National Parks, whether I thought the pecan was a good choice as Texas' state tree, etc.).   I expected questions about how Texas was affected by the current drought, or whether I noticed signs of recovery from recent wildfires throughout the state.  But, apparently it was mostly about the ten dollars that I would need to donate to get my "free gifts".  I would rather have been asked to donate without the marketing survey disguised as a "forest survey,"  or at least, indicate clearly that their purpose is to survey to improve their marketing outreach.  A forthright approach would have been much better.  Their approach cost them my donation.
National Arbor Day Foundation	120137	2	/users/profile/163371	phil_gee	General Member of the Public	1	08/07/2012	Duplicitous marketing.  The net takeaway from their recent mailing was that it was somehow sanctioned by New York State; they used the state logo in their return address.  They were also giving away "free" trees and plants, but they were available only if a donation was made.  A legitimate organization wouldn't resort to such sleaze, in my opinion.

Their research, compilation of data and constant updates on treatment strategies truly saves lives and reduces suffering.   It takes a great deal of work to explain elusive celiac disease, to dispel the misconceptions of what CD is and what causes it.

The thing that first drew me to the organization was that it was truly a grassroots organization which grew out of someones personal experience, that knew the financial hardships families with children being treated for cancer face.  At the time I joined the board, Angels was helping 4 families.  Since that time the organization has grown, become more financially stable and now helps approximately 30 families at any one time.  The ability to ease their financial burden a little bit and focus their minds and hearts on their children is priceless.  Unfortunately the need for our help never goes away and we always have a waiting list of families to assist.

I have seen the impact this organization makes on families and am thankful to be a part of it and look forward a bright future for Angels Among Us.
Angels Among Us	147282		/users/profile/194579	Katie1981	Board Member	5	12/26/2012	I have been fortunate enough to serve as a member of the board for Angels Among Us for the past four years and I couldn't think of a better organization to be involved with.  The overall goal of Angels is to financially assist families who have a child battling cancer being treated in Nebraska and throughout the past few years I've seen Angels change from a very small local organization to one that is now assisting families in many states. Being able to see that every bit of money that is raised by Angels is positively making an impact on a family's life in their time of need is inspiring. Oftentimes, these families have to go from being dual income families down to just one or no income due to the child's rigorous treatment schedule, so everything helps.  Experiencing a child with cancer is something no parent should have to go through, but to be able to help these families when it does happen is an amazing thing...and Angels Among Us' main goal is to do just that.
Angels Among Us	146853		/users/profile/193878	Kevinomara	Board Member	5	12/17/2012	I have had a pleasure of serving on the board of directors for this great organization who helps financially support families of children being treated for cancer in Nebraska.  The organization pays bills directly to the families creditors and makes a major impact in their lives.  These are families who are struggling financially.  While still a very young organization (formed in 2006), the organization has already help support over 130 families and paid out over $650,000 in financial assistant.  The future looks very good for continued growth and sustainability for Angels Among Us as they look to reduce some of the financial burden so parents can focus more of their attention on their child.

I understand their passion and expertise in what they do and the population they serve whereas they are second to none in the Omaha or Lincoln, NE area. I make referrals to their program regularly and they are always efficient and flexible with the high traffic and case management. Excellent program, great staff, and definitely meeting needs in the community.

CAR ALLIANCE FOR SAFER TEEN DRIVING	310834		/users/profile/402172	savingteenlives	Board Member	5	10/14/2016	Not only is this organization run with heart but with purpose. The compelling story of the death of Cady Reynolds should convince anyone to drive undistracted. Rob speaks with passion and understanding. It is wonderful how he reaches teens in a way that few adults could. Kudos to this organization for the work that they have done to reduce traffic deaths.

He addresses our entire Sophomore class and dies an excellent job of explaining the dangers of distracted driving. I know that he has made a huge impact on the lives of our students. I would highly recommend him to any group!
CAR ALLIANCE FOR SAFER TEEN DRIVING	287953		/users/profile/378141	Jeff120	Advisor	5	05/02/2016	Rob presented to our high school of 530 students and 50 teachers.  Through his presentation Rob was able to captivate the audience by using history, real life examples, and understandable comparisons.  We have many different speakers here to talk about distracted driving and Rob's presentation drove the point home better than the rest.  Rob's story is definitely worth hearing and seeing and as a principal it is easy to build upon.  Thank you Rob for your dedication to helping save lives.
CAR ALLIANCE FOR SAFER TEEN DRIVING	285766		/users/profile/375792	Writer	Advisor	5	04/13/2016	Rob Reynolds of C.A.R. spoke at our H.S. to about 220 kids and 20 adults.  His presentation was very polished and held your attention.  The students talked about how they didn't know how dangerous distracted driving could be and hopefully will think before they talk or text while driving.  They all gasped when he said he lost his daughter to a distracted driver and many wiped a tear from their eyes as they saw pictures of her and her family and then her tomb stone where he now visits her.  A very impressive presentation and well worth his fee.
CAR ALLIANCE FOR SAFER TEEN DRIVING	285727		/users/profile/375742	Writer	Board Member	5	04/12/2016	This is an awesome non profit that is aimed at reducing distracted driving crashes and deaths by talking to teen and adult drivers about the facts, and about loss from this very thing.  The approach touches the head and hearts of the audience making a compelling argument against cellphone use by the driver, and how this practice affects all drivers and pedestrians in a negative way. Very powerful.

We provide them with a safe place to go where they can find out if they are pregnant.  We provide information so they can make an informed decision about the outcome of their pregnancy.  We provide parenting classes, cooking classes, Bible Study, clothing, and referrals for other immediate needs that they might have.  We are a group of women who want to show Christ's love through everything we do and we have a heart for these women and their unborn babies.  I've volunteered at the center for around 7 years and each time I meet with a women I know there is a reason I was matched up with that particular individual. God is working though each of us in His special way.

The moment you walk in the door you are welcomed with a sense of respect and self worth by, not only the furnishings rarely seen in a free clinic, but the caring staff and volunteers.  It is also great that they go beyond pregnancy related issues to offering parenting classes and a boutique full of needed items for those women who choose to parent their child or already have children.
Assure Women's Center	43219	1	/users/profile/44025	missy3	Volunteer	4	06/07/2010	I love the ministry that I get to do with the AAA CPC. I first got involved just because I have a heart for the unborn. I also got involved because when I was fifteen I was told that I could never have children of my own. I have always loved babies especially. That news as devistating as it was made me think of the millions of unborn babies lost to abortion. Knowing the pain that people go through who cant have a child of thier own made me think that if I through this ministry can help not only the moms and babies but also those who have to become parents through adoption I would be part of something huge in all three lives. The moms, the babies,and in a round about way adoptive parents. I love that I get to present the gosple and minister to girls who are scared,overwhelmed,and unsure of what to do. I let them know that God not only loves and forgives them but they are precious to Him and so are thier babies.

I've participated in a few of the online fundraisers they've created for homes around the city that are in need of repair (listed on indiegogo.com). Funding requested for these homes is applied directly to the repairs they list on the website; simple concept, but kind of extraordinary. I think OHKA's transparency is inspiring.

When she first started working for OHKA there were a couple times she came home in tears because of the conditions of some of our community members homes and she was so passionate about helping them and making the conditions better for them and their families.  Now she has the opportunity to go into the schools and read to the children and tell them about childhood lead poisoning and educate the children how to be safe at home while at the same time offering their parents the opportunity to get in contact with a Healthy Home Specialist and have their home checked for hazards.  I am a proud supporter of the work that is done through this organization!!

He loves his blanket and it has been a source of comfort for him. I cannot begin to express how incredible this organization is. Not only are they fighting for their own son but they are fighting for all of our children. We love Sammy's Superheroes!

While fighting Sammy's own fight and praying for his miracle, this amazing mother and her team of rockstar volunteers are raising money to fund research for all types of pediatric cancer research.  I am honored and privileged to call Erin my friend.  I don't remember when exactly we met, in the fall of 2012, for weeks we were next door to each other in separate hospital rooms with our young sons who are both battling pediatric cancers.   Sammy's Superheros knows better than anyone how crucial research funding is.....without funding; there is no research.....without research; there is no cure.  And no child should ever have to go thru the harsh medicines that these kids are subjected to.   Research teams are so dedicated to finding cures for these fighters, and since a very small fraction of cancer research funding is actually dedicated for pediatric cancer research; it has become Sammy's Superheros mission to raise money to support research efforts for all types of pediatric cancer research.

During a personal visit to his room, we were able to speak with Sammy and get a feel for this young boy's strength, determination and especially experience his unforgettable smile.   As a follow-up to that meeting, Omaha Magazine published an article sharing some of the details of Sammy's fight and the impact that Sammy's Superheroes (the non-profit his mother founded) was making on research for Neuroblastoma.  We then became more aware of that impact, followed the progress made by this organization.  We have been amazed by the great work, the money raised, the reach Sammy Superheroes has made over the last year.  We find it so remarkable that a family can get so much accomplished for all children fighting this dreadful cancer while managing the day to day needs of their own son at the same time.   In a world full of legitimate  reasons to sit on the sidelines, Sammy's Superheroes has chosen to stand up and lead an effort to make lives better for all children fighting neuroblastoma.  Simply put, we are inspired by Sammy Superheroes and wholeheartedly support their work.

From my first contact with Stephen McBee he was helpful in planning our event and answer my many questions as we planned this event.  Stephen came to Michigan for our event and did a great job running the event as well as making sure people felt part of the event.  We packed 40,000 meals in less then 2 hours and it was a party the whole time.  I highly recommend working with Kids Against Hunger and Stephen McBee for any food packing events you may want to do.  One of the biggest benefits of this event was that the food we packed stayed in our local community and helped those people who are in our community!

They provide a service both to the needy and to those packing the food. We all yern to belong to something bigger than ourselves and when you pack food with Kids Against Hunger...You do just that. I HIGHLY recommend any business, school or church divert their fiscal and man power resources to hosting a packing event. It will make a difference in our communities and it will make a difference to our own people.

Every year gets better and better. The heart of the people working here is beyond anyone I have ever met. They work so hard to feed as many people as possible. A lot of times you donate to a company and you have no idea where your money goes, this nonprofit is so different. You are hands on with the process of packing the food and seeing exactly the location where it is sent to. The network is so large and corporate office can make sure if you want to pack, you WILL package food. The food LITERALLY saves lives, not just keeps peoples bellies full for a couple days, the food keeps people alive and changes not only their lives but the lives of the people packing food. I would not want to work or volunteer with any other company.

My wife and I have supported many non-profits over the years and each one of those organizations has done good. My experience with Kids Against Hunger is different in the fact that they don't just want my money...they want me and my time as well if I want to give it. I get to see hands on where my money goes and see the impact of the work they do in feeding children locally and around the world. I truly feel I am helping fulfill one of the greatest commands...to feed the hungry!

We loved the experience!  It was something that met the needs of my children ages 4, 6, 8 and 10!  The hands on opportunity to pour the ingredients into the bags and put them in boxes that we knew were going to feed those half way around the world was so rewarding.  Our family has continued to stay involved all these years --and my kids are adults now! We have traveled all over the US to disaster areas to share the food with those in need.   I had the opportunity to meet the founder, Richard Proudfit a few years back and what a legacy this man has left!

It has been a project that has brought many of our agents and staff into a team building, competitive environment of fun and personal satisfaction. Realtors by nature are very competitive as is our management team and high in spirit with a reward at the end of their day. Be it selling a property, working with a new buyer or assisting in getting the transaction completed.  The understanding that such a large need (of food) for something we take for granted is present within our Metro area and elsewhere around the world in the the USA is important and paramount to why we have reached  out and teamed up with Kids Against Hunger Freedom Food organization.  For the dollars raised and donated by the company and the participants we have packaged over 120,000 meals which goes to feed a family that lives not that far away from you.  Knowing that we are bringing a smile to someones face is all the reward we need.  I encourage all that this may reach to sign up and allow your organization to give and receive back by participating with this fantastic organization.  You will cherish the experience.

They always help those in need, and if they have no room, they work tirelessly to help find another rescue for the animal.  They are great with doing due diligence and keep the animals needs as the focus at all times.  I have fostered for this group for years and have nothing but positive experiences with all animals and people involved.   In reading the previous review I am shocked that the posting is riddled with inaccuracies and misinformation.  While I recognize all are entitled to their opinion, I am certainly surprised that one responsible for the escape of an animal would place blame elsewhere.  It's always sad to see people acting in this manner rather than keeping the best interest of the animals at heart.

HBH not only helps animals in need of foster and forever homes, but it also helps animals stay in their current homes by assisting families and individuals with veterinary expenses and food. The executive director has been known to answer a call for an animal only to recognize other issues the family is facing and direct people to social services unrelated to their animal needs.  HBH has a good reputation with many of the area's most respected veterinarians. The organization does not shy away from animals with special needs and its donations go directly toward the health and wellbeing of the animals in its care.  I do not sing HBH's praises because I am a volunteer, I volunteer because I sing its praises.

I was fostering a dog and had to suddenly move, they were unable to find a foster home for the dog until the day of my move when a friend of mine stepped up to foster. The dog was let outside at the new foster without a leash despite many warnings that he woudl try to escape. The dog escaped, has been missing now for 21 days. They are unable to devise a plan on their own to capture the dog. I had to come up with a plan for them. One of the helpers could not follow 2 simple rules...stay in the car...dont chase the dog. This dog is timid, wont come to anyone and no one, including myself has been able to come within 50 feet of the dog since he has been gone. He is a runner. Because of something someone else did after the plan was messed up by their helper who by the way later that evening jumped out of his car and was coming toward my nephew as if to fight him. I was asked not to help anymore and then a couple days later when I was visiting a friend in that same neighborhood I was in my car on the phone when a guy approached the car window. Keep in mind I am a lady in her 30's sitting in a car by myself when you approaches the car by himself and begins to verbally threaten me and swear at me. He tried to tell me I was not allowed in the neighborhood. I could have thrown down my choice of accusations regarding what happened during that altercation as no one was around. They strong arm and bully people. The head lady is mentally and emotionally unstable and the husband is a bully who obviously sees no harm in verbally assulting a female who is minding her own business. Yes, the guy that approached me come to find out was the HUSBAND of the president/director of this place. This place is a joke. The people in charge have no business running an animal rescue when the only plan they can come up with to capture a dog at large is to drive around aimlessly for 21 days trying to capture a dog who runs away when he sees anyone. 
Brain Injury Association Of Nebraska Inc	235810		/users/profile/319529	jecox	Board Member	5	12/23/2014	I have been active with the BIA-NE since it was started in Nebraska.  I have seen so many great things accomplished in this time.  Most of all Ive seen so many people helped!!  Thanks to the many efforts of the BIA-NE, awareness and support has grown throughout the state.  Ive heard great things about trainings and conferences.  I work with several people who practically live for the conference every year for the sense of connectedness and family as well as learning more and more about brain injury.  Ive heard several stories about how the BIA-NE has changed someones life.  I tend to hear two things the most.  First that they are grateful to have a family who understand and accepts them as who they are, regardless of their challenges or situation in life and secondly that they used to think they were just crazy, but now they know they arent!  It makes me so proud to see how much the BIA-NE has helped Nebraska accomplish in the area of Brain Injury, and I am so excited to see what additional great things will be coming! 
Brain Injury Association Of Nebraska Inc	235703		/users/profile/319377	rkinney	Board Member	5	12/19/2014	As a member of the BIA-NE Board of Directors, I am proud of the accomplishments of its small but mighty staff.

Brain Injury Association Of Nebraska Inc	234839	2	/users/profile/304488	gsimanek	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/03/2014	The Brain Injury Association of Nebraska (BIA-NE) is a vital component to the state of Nebraska. They are serving many individuals and families that incur a brain injury ranging in all ages including the elderly population (e.g., falls, strokes, aneurysms); adults (e.g., car wrecks, meningitis, encephalitis, anoxia); veterans (e.g., blast injuries); young athletes (e.g., concussions, motor vehicle accidents); and young children (e.g., falls; shaken baby syndrome). It has been said that the survivors of brain injury pass rehabilitation, but fail at life because they do not have adequate support to meet long-term medical, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, financial, and social needs.  Although many survivors often receive hospitalization and rehabilitation services, they and their families subsequently emerge from acute care with limited insight and knowledge on how to overcome the obstacles they face in the years to come. Many individuals throughout the state of Nebraska are not diagnosed with brain injury after a car accident or fall, which again results in many lost abilities throughout their lifetime and lasting negative outcomes since brain injury often results in long-term disabilities.  The BIA-NE provides support, structure, a sense of direction and purpose for these individuals and their families by: ensuring access to care; improving concussion management; responding to Veterans with brain injury by educating Nebraska's community of providers and families about the impact of BI and PTSD as Veterans return home; educating professionals, families and survivors about brain injuries; advocacy for those afflicted with brain injury; and getting awareness about brain injury to the community so that everyone can be better protected as well as educated when a brain injury is incurred with someone they love and they can get the proper help and resources. Without the BIA-NE, many Nebraskans will go without assistance and the injuries sustained will likely devastate their lives and negatively impact those around them. I have worked and volunteered in the field of brain injury now for over 22 years and have seen so many success stories of Nebraskans, both young and old, gradually recovering their lives after a brain injury with the assistance of the BIA-NE and giving back to their communities in return. We all need to find ways to keep this organization going because of its selfless staff who are working many long hours to keep it sustained and continue its mission for so many. In working with the BIA-NE, I have found much comfort and peace in knowing that I have found a great group of people who are compassionate in assisting those who need their help.
Open Door Mission	134595	2	/users/profile/180444	daddieish	Client Served	1	11/07/2012	My homelessness  came when I was divorced, left with two children one mentally handcapped and another has sickle cell anemia...lost my job then lost my house I wound up in a homeless shelter, Open Door Mission. The employees treat the clients like door mats. The clients some are battered mothers victims of domesic violence; those mothers tell horror stories of ill treatment. They are threatened with expulsion and off course they have no where to go they have to choose which is a better hell...I'm suprised that not even this site rate service delivery rather than how the money is spent. The accountabilty should also look at the quality of the product...the product being the service. Well my story is I went to dining hall and our group had 45minutes to eat, and at 30 minutes in the workers begin to yell hurry up....my daughter mentally hand capped eats very slowly i begged for some special consideration for her at least to allow her take her food with her they said it is not allowed. Next day I tried to have her eat faster, she vomited the little she had in her stomach, the next day same thing and next day...I went and lamented and they allowed me to take food o my children in the room. For saying something I begin to create lots of enemies fast and they had to break me down...that day they saw me come out of the room left my kids in there and they send two men janitors, they opened the door and just went in there...my other daughter was so frightened she stopped showering thinking there might be cameras in the rooms...back to that day I went in the dining had to get permission every time so this time there were many volunteers in the building I had to wait longer to be allowed to take food but after the incident of the janitors entering the room without notice I was afraid to leave them kids by themselves for too long. I got impentient and I spoke to a olunteer about the ills of Open Door Mission, the CEO over heard me and said to people, this man is mentally ill so disregard anything he says. She asked her staff to escort me outside she followed me and three other guys start pushing me around telling me how I would loose my children I should never say anything about open door mission. They followed me outside their campus threatening beating and at some point the one guy sprayed pepper in my face they pushed me to the ground and they started laughing as they kicked. They went and yanked my children brought them to the front the cops came and they dragged me into a cruiser drove me back the entire time my children were watching. The children at open door mission were watching...fire fighters came to put out the fire in my eyes. My children thought I was killed..way before I called APS to report the crime and APS said homeless people are not valunarable so there is no law that protects them...The clients are not allowed TV nor any access to current affairs. One girl a staffer said to me "oh you like the Huskers? You are lucky on Thanks Giving I will work and I like the Husker so I will turn the TV on so yeah you come watch"....internet can be monitored definately hotels have wifi and they control what content they want and dont want to the net work....Someone need to investigate this racket...

Father Flanagans Boys Home dba Boys Town	255317	9	/users/profile/343703	Natalie1799	Client Served	1	09/08/2015	I guess I can say that I was an at-risk youth who was forced to live here. It really didn't help me. We only were provided with therapy once a month, which is far below what would have been needed to help me. I was forced to take a religion class, where whenever I spoke up about homophobia or sexism that was actually being taught in the classroom, I was sent to the office and told to write an apology to the teacher I "disrespected." Their sex education class was also a religion class, so it was based on being anti- contraception and pro-abstinence, (which statistically, is not effective in reducing pregnancy in teenagers. One time I had to eat dinner at the leader 's (not sure what else to call him) house on campus and I was told to not say I was a vegetarian and to "eat around the meat," which was unacceptable to me because I had been vegetarian for a few years and I was very repulsed by meat. Apparently the leader had, in the past, argued with a kid about vegetarianism, which is disrespectful and just not okay. Also I was not supposed to bring up that I was an atheist, as not to get on the leader's "bad side." I did not have a voice at this place. And neither will any child who goes here, whether they are very religious and agree with everything Boys Town has to say. So, If you are considering privately placing your child here for reasons such as mental health issues, depression, anxiety, or poor schoolwork, think again. Consider a therapeutic boarding school or therapeutic wilderness program. Boys Town is based on punishment and reward, not rehabilitation and therapy. I know this from experience. I would say, personally, Boys Town made me more depressed and anxious. Please consider other options, if you have a choice and want a therapeutic environment for your child.

However, tonight my husband told me about a scandal involving Boys Town and their involvement and complicity in abuse of the children in their care. Google "Franklin" and "Boys Town" for various articles. Some artidcles I found: http://franklinscandal.com/franklinscandal_boystown.html and http://news-now.org/2011/05/flashback-boys-town-abuse-franklin-coverup/ This was from the 1980s, not the 1880s. It horrified me that this could have occurred with the knowledge and participation of the organization. At this point, hopefully things have changed dramatically at the organization, but I will be looking at other organizationsto donate my hard earned dollars.

I've read that as many as 16 percent of the total injured American warriors in Iraq and Afghanistan have experienced eye injury.  inSight4Vets says thank you for their sacrifice with an audio gift for blinded veterans.  CRSB has developed and produced a special pocket-size solar-powered player to share with these who have served our country at great loss the inspiration, hope, and encouragement found in great books . . . audio books carefully selected for them. As a board member blessed with sight, I would invite others to join me in thanking blinded veterans by supporting this unique program.

As a professional writer, I have visited about 20 of its specialized summer and winter camps and interviewed hundreds of campers. So I am well acquainted with the amazing way it meets specific needs of blind children, teens, and adults.  Besides its strong camping program, the nonprofit also produces interesting, inspirational, and educational audio, braille, and large-print reading materials for a wide range of ages and interests.  Actually, its name, Christian Record, comes from its first magazine, started in 1899, The Christian Record, and today the longest continuously published braille periodical. I am happy to support Christian Record Services and National Camps for Blind Children as a donor and with this review.
Dodge County Humane Society	206023		/users/profile/268319	Maxigal1	Donor	1	07/14/2014	I have 2 cats that got out at different times.  The first one, her name was fluffy, kitty 3 months old, I went around neighborhood and put signs out, put an ad in newspaper.  Callled down there on Monday morning asking them if someone brought in a orange fluffy female kitten.  They said no....later on that day, a lady saw my sign and told me she took the cat down at the HS and told them it belonged to some one, very tame.  By the time I got this message, dchs was closed, first thing Tuesday morning I went down there and told them that someone contacted me and my cat was in fact brought in Monday morning.  They would not let me go see the stray cats.........so I left, then I had to go back and insist that they show me my cat, one lady said, we had a GOLD fluffy cat, but he was nasty and mean, then she took me in the back room and showed me the cage he was in...all the newspaper was shreddred, she said the cat was already put down...and she said...there is a different between gold and orange, so next time make sure you have your colors correct.  I tried to talk to CLem...he would never look me in my eyes....now I wonder if my cat was put to death by the hammer, like so many others. The second cat my neighbor took her down because he would sit on her car making her dogs bark, I went down there the same day, they told me it was put down already, again I wonder if he was put to death by hammer.

Dodge County Humane Society	205239		/users/profile/267368	HAVEAHART	Volunteer	1	07/06/2014	This animal shelter is under suspician of euthanizing healthy animals for no good reason and not keeping record of those euthanizations. It's been said that they only have 2 employees and the rest are volunteers that are not always available to help out for a facility with a capacity of up to at least 80 animals. They have money in the bank, but are constantly asking for donations of food, laundry soap, dish soap, cleaners, etc from the public on top of donations and they haven't had an audit for the past 10 years. The board members will not answer questions that are asked by the citizens of Fremont who just happen to be the ones who are donating all the things that they ask for.  The board members act as if we do not have a right to know anything and are hush-hush in their decision making for the shelter. They abolished memberships, so it's impossible to even become a member now.  They are like a closed club.
JOSHUA COLLINGSWORTH MEMORIAL FOUNDATION	89321		/users/profile/8021	mary ann	Volunteer	5	05/31/2011	The Joshua Collingsworth Foundation began with the tragic death of 2 year old Joshua Collingsworth as the result of a water mishap.  Joshua's parents began the Foundation and the "Josh the Otter" program in the hope of preventing parents and families for having to bear the sadness that they have.  As a result, the "josh the Otter" water safety program was developed.  A book, signs, educational materials and events bring the water safety message to everyone reinforcing the idea that NO child goes near water without an adult.  The program further educates parents to teach their toddlers to "float first".  Teaching toddlers to float even before they are taught to swim will give them one more survival skill in the event that they do go near water.
JOSHUA COLLINGSWORTH MEMORIAL FOUNDATION	6220	8	/users/profile/8021	mary ann	Volunteer	5	07/06/2009	As a traffic safety professional that has worked with the not for profit community for many years, I can attest to the fact that the Joshua Collingsworth Memorial Foundation is a well run organization.  With a primary mission of water safety for young children, I have seen first hand the benefits that toddlers are getting not only from the "Josh the Baby Otter" book, but the Float First classes that are being funded by the Foundation.  The couple that began and run the organization after the loss of their own toddler, have shown remarkable dedication, commitment and passion in the hope of preventing any more tragic losses like theirs.  As far as fiscal responsibility, it is excellent.  Any donations or funding received is used to off- set production costs so that books can be given away to many communities that could not afford to purchase them.  No funding is used for overhead or administrative fees, so 100% goes directly to services or educational purposes.I would recommend supporting this Foundation to anyone-it works!

I recently had the opportunity to learn more about the history, mission of the organization and was impressed to learn that they have improved the lives of so many youth and families over the past 90+ years.  They have recently revised their governance and leadership sturcture and are really attempting to make some progressive changes to improve the quality of service they provide to their clients, and become better community partners.
Greater Omaha Alliance For Business Ethics At Creighton University	209067		/users/profile/271835	LoriJo	Volunteer	4	08/07/2014	Speaker: 'Business is a human endeavor,' developing employees leads to successBy Steve Jordon / World-Herald staff writerMarch 19. 2014 1:00AM Business executives who focus only on profit are missing the point, a consultant on leadership said Tuesday in Omaha. Calling business the most powerful institution in the world, Cleve W. Stevens, president of Owl Sight Intentions Inc. of Irvine, Calif., said that for capitalism to survive, its leaders must focus on improving people and not simply making money. Business is a human endeavor, Stevens told a breakfast meeting of the Omaha Business Ethics Alliance, attended by about 175 people at the Holland Performing Arts Center.Socialism has lost the contest to be the worlds dominant economic system, he told The World-Herald after the meeting, and capitalism has won, but free enterprise that forgets about people in the pursuit of profit cannot fulfill its potential. Leaders who focus on developing their employees can transform their businesses into new organizations that are more successful, Stevens said. Profit then becomes a measure of that success rather than the goal. Transformative leaders begin by imagining a world that does not exist but is better than the world today, he said. If you like the outcome, then you pull back and decide how to get there, and the vital steps include developing people willing and able to take that journey. It may be obvious, Stevens said, but happy people are more productive in their jobs, and people are happiest when they love the workplace and are loved there; when they are growing and developing; when they are contributing to the business; and when their work has meaning or purpose. When people work under those four conditions, theyre ready to go, said Stevens, who wrote a book on leadership titled The Best in U.S.: People, Profit and the Remaking of Modern Leadership, published by Beaufort Books. Stevens was asked how to improve a business like Kiewit Corp., which the questioner said already is one of the countrys top construction companies. Stevens said even great companies can do things better, and outstanding companies usually pursue improvement. Ill send you a list of my problems, quipped Kiewit CEO Bruce Grewcock, who also is chairman of the ethics group.Stevens said the biggest obstacle to developing transformative leadership is usually executives unwillingness to closely and honestly look at themselves. Its not easy, he said, but its essential to beginning the process of improving the company.Businesses also find that community involvement by their people is important not only for the company but also for the individuals who do the volunteer work, he said, because it helps them become better on the job, as parents and in other aspects of their lives.
Greater Omaha Alliance For Business Ethics At Creighton University	209056		/users/profile/271821	ReedMorgan	Board Member	4	08/07/2014	Consumer Watch: "Enough of the bad guys in business; lets talk do-gooders" By Jim Hegarty / Better Business Bureau 	___________________ Omaha World-HeraldMay 27, 2014 I spend a lot of time concentrating on the bad guys, on the schemers and the thieves, but in recent weeks, Ive had the privilege of attending three events where the themes seemed to be built around Omahans doing the right thing. I had opportunities to celebrate that concept and to witness the legacy that integrity creates as I sat at an event sponsored by the Omaha Ethics Alliance, participated in the Downtown Rotarys Eighth-Grade Honor Roll Luncheon and attended the funeral of my brother-in-law, a local teacher. At the quarterly Ethics Alliance Dialogue, which is held in the early morning at the marvelous Gallup campus, more than 100 area business leaders discussed marketing ethics and the importance of truth in advertising.  It was a lively discussion and just another in whats becoming a long line of events that shows how wide awake Omaha is when it comes to the subject of ethics  even at 7:30 a.m.... ....The Business Ethics Alliance is a one-of-a-kind partnership among Creighton University, the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce and the Better Business Bureau, forged as an organized effort to make Omaha the epicenter of ethical business conduct. To date, more than 200 of Omahas top businesses and business leaders have joined the effort to prove that doing the right thing works, as Trustees of the Alliance. Recently, the Alliance used information from interviews and focus groups to help community business leaders pin down Greater Omahas core business values. The values they identified were accountability, integrity, moral courage, financial vitality and community responsibility. Chamber President David Brown thought those findings were so wonderful he suggested the BBB partner with the chamber to fund the production of gigantic posters proclaiming these business values as being major contributors to Omahas greatness. But even before the posters were delivered it was evident that Omaha is getting noticed. Last year a contingency of business and community leaders from Akron, Ohio, visited Omaha to learn what makes us so successful. Weve since learned that the thing that may have excited them most is our ethics partnership. So much so that theyve now formed a task force to determine if they can duplicate our Ethics Alliance in their community. The word is out that its good to be like Omaha. Business leaders from around the country are beginning to wonder whats in the water here. They often want to know why one of the largest and most successful chambers of commerce in America is based in Omaha and why one of the largest and most successful BBBs in America is right here, too. They want to know our secret, and our secret isnt our water  its our people. Its a sort of goodness that probably exists elsewhere but that certainly comes to life in a unique way, an exceptional way, here in the Omaha area....We know integrity is worth it. Jim Hegarty is president of the Better Business Bureau representing Nebraska and southwest Iowa.

Project Kindle, Inc.	140760		/users/profile/186970	redheadHB	Volunteer	5	11/17/2012	I agree with the previous review from wombat 100%  I first came in contact with Project Kindle in 2007.  I was attending UCLA, and there is a annual fundraiser called Dance Marathon in which students, teachers, and community members dance for 26 hours straight in order to raise money for Pediatric HIV/AIDS.  One of the beneficiaries of the proceeds from that event is Project Kindle.   Project Kindle holds week long camps for children affected and infected with HIV/AIDS.  They also hold SpeakOut conferences throughout America at high schools in order to educate and eradicate the stigma against HIV/AIDS.   In 2007 I participated in Dance Marathon at UCLA and met some of the children and volunteers at Project Kindle.  After listening to the stories of the children, their daily lives and their positive experiences at camp, I decided to volunteer that summer.   Camp Kindle was a life changing experience. The children that attend are so uplifting, empowering, and surprising.  They are so grateful for the chance to attend camp during the summer.  I remember thinking, that my own sibling was the same ages as the children attending Camp Kindle, yet these children were so much more grateful and understanding for the world around them.  It really amazed me. After that summer, I helped volunteer at a SpeakOut event at a local high school in Los Angeles.  Many of the children whom I met at camp in the summer, had decided to become SpeakOut Ambassadors and share their stories with the students.  When I first arrived at the high school, all the students were yelling, screaming, and throwing paper balls in the auditorium.  Then, the Kindle children, many around the same age as the students in the audience, entered the stage and began to talk about their lives.I vividly remember the first time one of the kids on-stage announced that they had HIV.  The students in the auditorium became silent.  They had no idea.These Kindle speakers did not "look like" they were "sick".The Kindle children went on to explain their lives, the similar passions and interest as the students listening, and they to explain some of the difficulties they have living with HIV.  The medicines they have to take, the stigma and judgment they have had to deal with at school, and even in their families.  At the end of the presentation, the students left the auditorium in silence.  You could tell that they have really been moved by what they had heard. The stigma was changing.Some students even went up to the Kindle kids afterwards to ask questions, and thank them for their courage and honesty. The entire experience was really emotional and moving. If you ever have a change to volunteer for this organization, and meet these amazing children, do not hesitate. Do it. You will not regret it.  
Project Kindle, Inc.	69588		/users/profile/76044	WOMBAT	Volunteer	5	02/16/2011	I have been volunteering with Project Kindle for over 5 years. I learned about Kindle when I went with my sister to a fundraiser in Nebraska. I was immediately impacted by all the people who were involved and the cause they stood for. I submitted my application to be a counselor for the next summer in the California session and was accepted. I was excited and nervous. I had been to camp as a kid but I had never been a counselor. I arrived at camp and was immediately flooded with emotions from the the memories of when I had been to camp as a kid. I was so excited to be a counselor just like the ones I had looked up to so many years before. Camp was rustic and we started with two days of staff training and learning about all the fun activities and events we would be putting on for the kids. We also spent a lot of time learning about the disease HIV/AIDS that infects and affects our campers and their families. I don't think i realized until these two days that I would be working with kids infected with HIV/AIDS. I knew that this was the reason for camp but it hadn't really hit me until we started learning the truth about HIV/AIDS. People would think these kids would be too sick to attend summer camp.  Through my own experiences with spreading the word about Kindle I have encountered many people who thought this way. If it weren't for places like Kindle I may have gone through my whole life misinformed. The first day of camp I was taken aback seeing all of these normal children with their bright shining faces ecstatic for the week ahead of them. Some of the campers are infected with HIV/AIDS and some are affected because someone in their family is infected. You could never tell the difference between who is infected and who is not. Only until you become a part of their world and learn their struggles, their statuses and the hardships they have over come do you understand the courageousness of the children surrounding you . I had a cabin that was filled with the 10 and 11 year old girls.  I lived in amazement at their bravery and all they could teach me at their young age, me being 21 at the time. Hearing all the campers stories made me laugh, cry and feel overwhelmed. I wanted to do more. But they didn't need me to do more. They just needed the love and nonjudgmental care of everyone at camp for one week of their lives. For this one week they were normal surrounded by kids who faced the same struggles and stigma they did. I heard stories that kids were asked to leave school, asked not to use the water fountain, and worst of all never being able to tall anyone before this week.  I had fallen in love with camp and was living in an alternate world of compassion and togetherness. I wondered how I would go back to my normal life. Even though I prayed for camp not to end at the end of the week it did and i was faced with reality. I was so sad but felt comforted knowing the love I had experienced and the fact that I would be changed forever for the better. Over the years I have seen many of the campers grow into wonderful young adults and gotten a glimpse into their futures and how they will change the world. Camp sparked something inside of me that made me always want to do more. Five years later I have run a marathon, Danced for 26 hours straight at 2 dance marathons and walked 3 AIDS walks along with volunteering every summer for camp. I recommend camp for anyone that has a heart and wants to be changed indefinitely for the better. Thank you and VIVA CAMP KINDLE!

I've been involved for many years and befitted much from the Jewish services, classes and community services they provide on a constant basis. One day I realized it was time to give back.  I began giving small donations once a month as a token of my appreciation. I hope to be able to contribute more in the future. I know they do whatever they can for others, whether or not they have the funds. I hope to make it easier by donating my time and money. After all, G-d blessed me with what I have to share!

More than 20 years ago I was referred to them after a significant stay in the state hospital for a serious mental health issue. I grew up in a family where drugs and alcohol were the norm. Their approach to treat BOTH my mental health and substance issues at the same time really helped me turn my life around. I'm the first person in my family to have a college degree and that's thanks to a referral by CenterPointe. I still live with mental health issues - it's a chronic disease - but now I'm stable and doing well. I'm so proud to say I was a CenterPointe client.

Heartland Equine Therapeutic Riding Academy Inc	93760		/users/profile/108078	Lindsay F.	Volunteer	4	07/12/2011	I thought since there was a review of HETRA from a parent's perspective I would add one from a volunteer/student. I have been volunteering for several years now. I have always loved kids and horses so putting the two together has been perfect for me. HETRA has been not only a great way for me to give to the community, but a fun way to exercise along with so many other benefits I can't name them all. Volunteering at HETRA has been therapy for me as I know it has been for so many other volunteers too! I will never forget the times I have been having a horrible day and I get to the barn and within minutes literallyl I have forgotten about it and am just plain happy. Growing up with special needs of my own this was one place that I felt I could be open and not be judged or limited. In fact I think it has given me a special insight to a small piece of what some of the students and their families are going through. I can't say how many friends I have made through going to the barn. HETRA has been such a big part of my life and I don't plan to change that any time soon. In fact HETRA has been a big reason for me to try to find a job close by. Others have told me there are other therapeutic riding places around which is true, but I know it wouldn't be the same. I can't say thank you enough to those at HETRA who have taught me along the way about riding, horses, people, and life!
Heartland Equine Therapeutic Riding Academy Inc	88812		/users/profile/100317	jteal	Client Served	5	05/17/2011	HETRA instructors, volunteers, and the generous donors, you complete our lives.  You give our children joy, confidence and the feeling of control. My daughter and I cannot imagine life without you.  My daughter has been involved with therapeutic riding for over 18 years.  When we relocated back home to Omaha in 1999 we were fortunate to find HETRA. Skippy and Lady were two of the first horses my daughter rode and a bond was immediately formed.  She then rode Rowdy, Lucky and Rodie just to name a few. The relationship that she and Skippy have cannot be described in words.  Only seeing the two together would one truly understand.  In simple terms, Skippy is the love of her life! Over the past 11 years I believe she has riden every session only missing due to bad weather or illness. So with that being said, the heart of this program comes from the therapy horses.  Hundreds and hundreds of hours go into training before they are even ready to perform their duties.  With so much heart and compassion that comes from these gentle giants, that put out the muscle that give our children the freedom to soar.  Their strong bodies that move smoothly around the arena giving the student the independence and feeling of control for that moment in time when they are on their horse.  My daughter faces many challenges on a daily basis, but has the attitude and desire to live life to its fullest.  For those of you that know my family I hope she has touched your life as much as all of you have touched ours. Please know from the bottom of my heart how much we appreciate HETRA for all they have given to our children.  Theres never a doubt that each and every one of the staff and volunteers love what they are doing and it shows through their commitment and compassion of what this whole program is about.  Its always about the students, from the comfortable atmosphere, to the goals that are set and the concern for each individual in the program. HETRA has been a time for her to bust out of the confines of her chair and be her soccer, her softball, her tennis, her golf, her aerobics, an activity she can do that gives her freedom, all the while the gentle horse being her guide and support.  A time of achievement, winning, striving and conquering.  She can do it all, but not without the assistance of the therapy horses and the supporters.  
CASA For York County	193734		/users/profile/253054	Tom011	Volunteer	5	02/03/2014	 I have  been a CASA volunteer for one year.  There are too many children that are in difficult and unsafesituations of abuse and neglect. Situations range from drug involvement, mental illness, poverty, and all of the above.  Parents in these situations are often unable or unwilling to provide a safe and secure home.  All reasonable efforts are made to keep families together. CASA is interested in the best interest of the child being provided.   CASA volunteers take the time to observe and find facts of the situations in order to makerecommendations to the court about what is in the child's best interest.  It is a serious task, and oftendifficult to determine.  We are the eyes and ears of the court.  The court system has many players, whocan have their own agendas.  Our only concern is what is best for the child. It is important to remind the court what is in the best interests of the child, as sometimes the legal process drags on to the detriment of the child obtaining a safe and secure home. .
CASA For York County	165711		/users/profile/220212	Mike and Della	Volunteer	5	08/21/2013	As a CASA Vol I have had the opportunity to help children in ways that I never dreamed. I will say that when I was growing up I should have never been with either of my parents but had no one to help me or speak up for me. I feel I am giving the children we serve a chance that I wish I would have had. This organization is one of the most important in my mind because the children of our time are the adults of our future and for everyone we can help and be there for it betters society and strengthens our future. We are the ones sometimes the only ones that are constant in their lives. To be there for them with all the changes that may take place in their lives. We listen, we are important, we teach, we learn, we believe. We are CASA Volunteers and I am very proud to say that I am a part of this wonderful organization!

Ymca Of Greater Omaha	145986	6	/users/profile/192613	Never Again	Donor	1	12/05/2012	I have been donating to charities for most of my adult life.   Not life changing amounts, but a good support level.  I have donated to the strong kids campaign for many recent years, but I found out this year some disturbing information.  I guess I never looked at it this way before, but this campaign and how it's run in Omaha seems very fishy.  They get general citizens like me to donate to them, so that they can "provide" a membership to someone of less means.  On the surface that appears charitable.  However, when you look closer, aren't they really just getting more memberships paid by people other than the person using it?   This would be the equivalent of a clothing manufacturer saying that they will provide clothes to the needy as long as I pay for them at the full cost.  Shouldn't the YMCA be donating something?  I know the easy answer is that they are a non profit, but the reality is that their management is very highly paid for this area and nearly 10% of each donation goes right to management expenses, not to mention the extra expenses that are associated with the membership. Shouldn't we be giving to charities that provide basic life needs.  Last time I checked, a family membership to a gym was not a basic life need. I admit they had me fooled for a while with the name, but more money is spent on family "scholarships" which are nothing more than memberships than any other program.  Check out their 990 for yourself.  Oh. That's right, they don't break out this major campaign so you can't follow the breadcrumbs.  If it were a good program, they wouldn't be afraid to be transparent about how the money is used.

No longer are we a church that wants to patronize the poor; we see them as our friends.  To me, this is the hallmark of InCommon - building healthy friendships. There have been many church members who have told me how awkaward they felt to simply sit down and share a meal, a story, a game, and some of life with a friend in poverty.  They couldn't hide behind a serving line, passing out food.  Each time I hear the story, I smile because I know InCommon is accomplishing their goal.

Grace Mission Inc	286811		/users/profile/376881	Josie_U	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I give to be a light. By Josie Uecker, in support of Grace Missions, Inc. gracemissionskc.orgAfrica. The dark continent. A place of stark poverty, and for many, little hope. I traveled to this place that would appear, for most of us, to be uninhabitable- where such basic needs as food, water, and education, are scarce and often unmet.  It was here, in this dark place, that my eyes were opened.  Perhaps it was because of the bleak darkness that any glimmer of light- the stars in the night sky, a dim bulb powered by a humming generator, or the smile of bright white teeth on an ebony face, shone even brighter.  In a country of nearly 15 million, 95% are non-Christians, people live on less than $1.25 per day, and the literacy rate is only 33%. I realized my purpose while serving on a medical mission to Mali, West Africa, a few years ago, and I give now to remind myself what I witnessed while I was there.  I give to keep a light shining somewhere deep within me, a light that I hope others will see.  I hold it high, and hopefully it will be so bright they wont be able to look away.  Traveling to Africa allowed me to see a world that I never knew existed.  Ironically, the greatest burden of witnessing such poverty and extreme darkness, is returning home to life in the United States, attempting to reconcile the two worlds within my own mind.  I have struggled to find words to describe the experience to my family and friends.  Im reminded often when I turn on the faucet and clean water is at my fingertips- knowing that at the same moment in Mali a woman is spending her day searching for water. Im reminded of it when I see a beautiful school building and a bus that effortlessly delivers my child curbside, while in Mali a 9-year-old girl is willing to walk for miles to go to school, often without a meal in her tummy.  I see advertisements for things I will never need but am persuaded in gluttony to desire.  On my side of the world, there are warehouses full of food, endless electronics, giant stuffed teddy bears, pills to make me skinnier and better looking, and gadgets to think for me, all the while blinding me to pursuing anything beyond securing my own ridiculous comfort. From time to time, I wonder why so many Americans are enthralled with all of this shallow hype, why I, myself, am sometimes taken by it, and how it goes on and on, while others suffer in a world of darkness and poverty.  But then I wonder which place, here or there, is blinder than the other.  And I wonder what I can do to make a difference. Now that I have seen it, I cant look away.  Id be a fool to look away.  My eyes have miraculously been opened. I want to help others recognize what they are missing- both here, in this land of numbing comforts and unappreciated indulgences, and in Mali, where even a small donation towards a Christian school can provide life-changing hope for children and families in need.  It is this eye-opening experience that has made me realize Gods plan and why Jesus came to this world for us.  He IS GOD, He IS LIGHT, He IS LOVE, and he knows and sees ALL.  Yet He left the comfort of Heaven to come to us in this dark world and be a light so that we might be cured from our blindness.  He came to share, to lovingly give Himself for us, so that we might also see Gods GLORY and praise His name.  I want to GIVE to be a light to the nations and to give glory to God in heaven.  Along with our family and precious friends, we founded Grace Missions, Inc. to support Ibrahima Kodio, an indigenous Christian missionary and his school in Mali.

Spouse Abuse Sexual Assault Crisis Center	7072	9	/users/profile/8939	safevictim	Client Served	5	07/23/2009	I had been in an abusive relationship for five years. I had tried leaving many times...he always found me. He would break in and leave my dead pets in my sink, gifts he had previously given me in the middle of a cleaned off table, and on several occasions a large sharp knife stabbed into the middle of my bed or pillow. I was hospitalized with broken bones, larynx damage from strangulation, and injuries sustained during marital rape. I am bipolar and because he would hide or throw out my medication, he was able to have me committed to a psychiatric hospital twice. He would break into my house while I was sleeping (or hide in it while I was gone) and viciously rape and beat me. He said it was to "teach me a lesson". The lesson was that he could do whatever he wanted and no one would help me or believe me. I called the police at least 30 times, no help there; they thought I was being paranoid. I moved fourteen times (three different states) in two years trying to hide from him. Each time he would quickly get custody of my kids. I was afraid of them being alone with him and would eventually go back. The last time I went back, Child Protective Services took my children. They charged me with child abuse for 'failure to protect'. Failure to protect means that they blamed me for 'letting my children watch when he would beat me because I didnt just leave. I couldnt get a Protection Order signed by a Judge because he thought I was trying to use it to get custody of my kids. The Judge gave my abuser custody of my kids and ordered us to go to mediation services before he would consider signing my Protection Order. I would make arrangements to go and my abuser wouldnt show up. The mediator would reschedule. The first time I went to SASAs office I talked to the shelter manager. She listened as I told her about what had been happening. I told her about the police thinking I was crazy, I told her no one believed me. Then she said something that no one ever had..."I believe you". With SASA's help I found out how he found me. He was using technology. She told me about ways he may be using the GPS on my cars navigation system, my own cell phone, and computer IP address to track me. I disabled the GPS on my car but, six simple GPS devices were found (over five months) on the car I drove. Because we were married, his name was on the Blazer too, so it wasn't illegal. We discovered he was using the GPS on my phone to locate me and the phones speaker to listen to me (even when I wasn't using the phone) and intercept my incoming calls. I got a new phone and removed the battery when I wasnt using it. He had a key stroke tracker on my computer as well as using the camera to watch me in my house. A computer person disabled them and installed anti-bugging software. She helped me to find a program that helped me to get my bipolar medications. Unfortunately, they couldnt prove he did anything to me. The one event they could charge him with was plea bargained down to disturbing the peace. Together we called the mediator, who actually listened. She told me about the Victims Advocate at the courthouse, who listened and believed me. She continued working with me, the Victims Advocate, and Child Protective Services. Finally people were beginning to realize I wasnt crazy or paranoid. After eleven months, I finally got full custody of my children. She helped us get safe by coordinating with agencies and churches to relocate us. We obtained all the paperwork to apply for housing and assistance programs so that I would be able to relocate safely. We found a job placement agency and I got a job so I could provide for myself and my children once we got there. She even helped me to get a Secretary of State Secure Address so that my current location is not available to anyone. We are finally starting to feel safe in our new home. My kids love their new school, have found new friends, and are active in church and school activities. They are no longer afraid for me and I am no longer afraid of losing them. None of this would have been possible without her believing in me until I could believe in myself.

Uniquely Yours Stability Support	298445		/users/profile/389309	Writer	General Member of the Public	1	07/28/2016	It seems like there were endless hurdles to jump through.  For instance, they asked that I  attend day-time classes for things like improving self-esteem...personally, I'd feel better about myself if I could just get caught up with rent...but I worked during the day.  They asked me to meet with someone individually to help with budgeting and he bluntly insulted me and my situation, THEN told me that I needed to have a "positive cash flow" in order to qualify for financial assistance (?so if it was positive, why would I be there??) Also, it was very humbling  but also humiliating to have him talk down to me while sitting at their gigantic, expensive conference table surrounded by very expensive office equipment and water fountain (?).  I had to turn in seemingly endless financial paperwork even though they supposedly do not have "income guidelines."  I'm not really sure what they do besides offer clothing for job interviews.  Actually, I did better at finding something presentable at the local Goodwill.  The volunteer staff first told me she didn't have time to go downstairs where the better clothes were and look for clothes in my size but then, when the boss showed up, she had time.  She then hee-hawed around so that she didn't have time.  She told me she would call me that Saturday and have me come and take a look but she never called on that day.  When she did finally call me (about 10 days later), she blamed it on me for not coming to look at the clothes (?).  I guess if you're not paying the help, it doesn't really matter.  They always mention their "limited funds" but honestly, who do they help?  I have talked to other people in the area and no one has had a positive experience.  Why are they allowed tax-exempt status?

Llaves De Restauracion	233049	1	/users/profile/296704	Truth8494	Volunteer	1	11/06/2014	Where do I begin my tale? This so called church is run by hypocrites I had the misfortune of knowing. Their pastor, if I can even address him by that title, would preach about following the will of God, but he would never take this advise himself. It was eventually uncovered that Adolfo, or Adolf as he was rightly named by his parents, was an adulterer who would hit on various married women in the church. He eventually "succeeded" and ended up being the catalyst to the end of a marriage and leaving children without their mother. If anyone reading this is considering helping this organization at all, please don't. Adolf has enough people drinking his Kool-aid  already.  Sadly, this man had me fooled for years. Don't help this organization at all that would only be continuing the vicious cycle. Helping this non-profit only ensures that more people are led astray by this evil man who uses his position to cheat on his wife. He is sick and sadistic and does not deserve your attention.

United Cerebral Palsy Of Nebraska Inc	7959	1	/users/profile/8043	nicben	General Member of the Public	1	07/30/2009	As a parent of a child with cerebral palsy,I am greatly disappointed in this organization. Over the years we have attempted to contact this organization via phone & email only to never have received any kind of response. We tried again a few months ago when we applied for a grant that this oraganization supposedly gives out to disabled individuals & their families for a computed device for our daughter. We took the time to fill out a lenghty application & provided all the additional paperwork as requested in the application. We have not heard ONE word! Not even acknowledgement that it was received. I don't know about other UCPs across the country, but this one certainly does not live up to its mission. Very, very sad for a program supposedly out there to help the disabled.

Coordinating Committee Of The Christian Family Movement	58670		/users/profile/62672	CFMUSA	Board Member	5	12/10/2010	How to help families connect with each other, build faith at home, and not start another costly parish program? I know about good programs a parish can buy and put on, but here is an idea that families can do for themselves, with your encouragement:I have had success with helping young families gather by inviting them to join the Christian Family Movement, one of the first Catholic family organizations. The U.S. Bishops praise CFM in their family documents. Learn more about CFM at www.cfm.org. You can see a sample CFM lesson here http://www.cfm.org/ttmadch1.pdf  Heres how CFM works in the parish or neighborhood: The families, in groups of 5-6 families,  meet monthly. Adults use a program book provided by CFM as part of their membership ($40/family annually). The cost to the parish is $0. The children can join their parents for the opening prayer and then play nearby.  The groups can meet in homes or in the parish facilities, whichever works. The group reflects on Scripture, looks at situations in family and community life, decides how a Christian should respond, and chooses an action to make a difference. The actions can be simple family-centered activities or service to others that includes the children in the action. CFM has a Starter Kit with a program book, Taking the Time to Make a Difference, for the reduced price of $10/family (includes 4 books). The Starter Kit includes free instructions on how one motivated couple can invite others to try CFM for 6 meetings. If they like it, they become members of CFM and each family gets a program book with 10 meetings. Members receive a monthly newsletter ACT that shows actions other CFM groups around the country are doing to enrich their family life and build faith. A new program is produced annually by CFM. Some recent titles: Homemade Disciples; Intentional Christian Families; Discovering Jesus; Love Still Happens in Families. My husband and I are the local contact couple in Baltimore and I am the program chair. CFM has been important in our family life. If you would like to invite families for an information night in the Baltmore/Washington area, we can come and tell about CFM. View a short video introduction here http://www.cfm.org/cfmvideo.html  
Back To The Bible	97348		/users/profile/114198	Laurel Henschel	Donor	4	09/10/2011	I have been listening to Back to the Bible on radio for several years and have found the teaching to be true to the Bible.  Dr. Kroll has a way of teaching that is very easy to understand. Even though I have been a Christian for many years, I find that I learn something new or have something clarified quite frequently. The only negative thing I have to say is that they send out too many mailings per month - 3, 4 or more. To me this is a waste of money.  I only need 1 mailing per month since I am a regular contributor.

Many come from very troubled backgrounds and before coming to New Life did not think there was any hope.

Mr Cummings illegally took over a neighbor hood association that is tasked with the management of an green space within a neighborhood. He wrote new bylaws and appointed himself as president with an indefinite term. He also appointed the rest of the board of directors with indefinite terms.

HIMANCHAL EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION	23101	4	/users/profile/24170	Fred	Volunteer	5	11/29/2009	I actually came to know of the dream back of the formation of the Himanchal Educational Foundation when I was a professor at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, NE.  A young man named Mahabir Pun gave a presentation at a lunch for selected faculty members and other community citizens.  He detailed his dream to expand education in the village of his birth -- Nangi village, in the Myagdi district in Nepal.  His story is found on the website mentioned in this listing.  If you are reading this review you need to know that Nepal is a country that supports education in its principal cities primarily; the rural areas are less well supported beyond grade 7.  Mahabir's efforts to convince village members that education was an important key to progress paid off.  They first added 3 more grades to those supported by the government.  The Himanchal Education Foundation, run by volunteer board members, dedicates itself to supporting education in Nangi and, since its inception, two additional grades beyond high school have been added.  Meanwhile Mahabir has continued to be active and has worked to expose volunteers to the community he serves.  It was my good fortune, after retiring in 1997, to go to Nangi in 1998 and to teach English to the upper grade prior to their graduation tests.All 6 students passed that year and got their "School-leaving Certificate", a remarkable feat since, at that time, only about 38% of those attempting that test passed nationwide!When I was in Nangi there was only radio telephone; now the village is connected wirelessly to the world.  Additionally, the Himanchal Education Foundation has expanded to include professional volunteers who support nurse's training in the village, who encourage the development of the hand-made paper industry in Nangi, and, of course, continue to partially fund the salaries of teachers in those grades that have been added.  The beautiful thing about my volunteer efforts was the wonderful contact with the people of Nangi village and the joy of learning that the students showed.  Please consider making this little village continue to come true.  Support it financially or, better yet, if you can offer a service that they can use, take the 9 hour trek up the mountain to the village and donate your time and skill.  You will be changed by the experience in this little village and the people who live there.I also served as a Himanchal Education Foundation Chairman of the Board for a number of years, so I am technically more that a volunteer.  I continue to support their work financially.

The receptionist at the welcome desk was very pleasant and helpful. I was greeted at the door and given directions to where I needed to be. The intake staff were very helpful, they clearly provided the instruction I needed as a first-time patient. The paperwork was simple. I found it interesting that they provided a behavioral health screening survey for my medical visit but that was fine; it was simple and to the point as well.   My wait was about 20minutes, I waited longer in my specialists office only four months ago about 45 minutes as the only person in the waiting room. I think the best experience was in the room with the provider.  Dr. Montegut is hands-down one of the best providers in the city. His knowledge, professionalism and patience was remarkable--all of my questions were answered (there were a lot of them), through the process I never felt rushed; it was a great experience. I had a labs drawn in late October and it took over a week to get back but at Charles Drew I received my results prior to the end of my visit--that was amazing.    I really appreciate the visit summary from Dr. Montegut, with all of my lab results numbers and conversation points that had been discussed--It resides on my pantry as a constant reminder of the things that were, and are still important. Overall this was a great experience. I don't know what I expected; but my experience exceeded my expectations.   Thanks,  RM

The Channel 8 News was doing a segment on a support group for children who had lost a parent.  Although my husband had not passed yet I called and talked to Bev for hours about what I was going through.  She advised the group is also for parents as well as kids.  I asked if it would be wrong to sow up before he died.  She said no it might even help the kids understand more what is going to happen to their dad.  I don't remember how many years we continued to attend Charlie brown's but I do know it was after I was remarried.  It is so sad to see that this group is not longer going to exist.

Our Lady Of Lourdes Hospital	102346		/users/profile/66583	Carol Caruthers	Client Served	5	12/15/2011	Back in the summer of 2007, I suffered a stroke and was rushed to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Burlington, NJ.  I am told - and from hospital records and hospital prsonnel - that I was in a coma for several days, and that there was some question about what permanent physical damage there migh be to my ability to walk, talk, and the like - needing physical rehabilitation to recover.There was a Nurse at my side almost throughout.  Her name is Bernadette Jackson - the Parish Nurse at Assumption Church [now Christ the Redeemer-Assumption Parish] here in Atco, Camden County, NJ, as well as a Nursing Supervisor at Lourdes Hospital.  When I woke up, Bernadette was there - standing at my feet and smiling down at my bedside.  She asked me whether I knew who she was, and I replied - 'Of course I do.  Your the Nurse from Assumption Church in Atco.'  That did it.  She smiled even more and said that I would be alright.  Then she touched my toes to see if there was any reaction, and there was.  I owe my survival for the last 4 1/2 years to Our Lady of Lourdes Hosputal and to Bernadette Jackson, MSN.  In fact, I  did subsequently nominated her for a March of Dimes [NJ] Nurse of the Year Award.  She received what amounts to an Honorable Mention in November, 2011 for all this.  She is now at Kennedy Hospital, Cherry Hill, Camden County, NJ.  Thank you one and all.

Although not officially open for tours a special private inspection was made possible and it was a highlight of my visit to Nebraska City, Nebraska.  The amazing part of the insection tour was the rare opportunity to see a factory that had been started in the eariy 1900's and then left with everyting intact when closed. There hadn't been a windmill manufactured in the building in over 40 years yet a team of workers could go into the building and start work on a windmill today. All the machines and parts are just s they were when last used to produce the famous Eli Windmill. It was a truly wonderful opportunity to see the building and old machinery. The neat part was knowing that everything had been left in place and the doors simply locked all those long years ago.
Christian Heritage Childrens Home	231509		/users/profile/276163	Vincent_G	Volunteer	5	10/31/2014	Christian Heritage Childrens Home is focused on establishing and supporting high quality foster homes for the large number of kids in the Nebraska foster care system. The Family Finding unit also has great success in finding previously unknown family members who can become vital in helping a lonely child who is yearning for connection with real family. The challenge is huge. Each year Christian Heritage must turn away needy children due to financial constraints and the limited number of qualified foster parents. Another facet of Christian Heritage is their efforts in Nebraska Prisons to educate and equip incarcerated parents to focus on their own children in order to preserve families and reduce the cycle of children following their parent(s) into the prison system. Classes on Fatherhood, Healthy Relationships and Parenting Skills using evidence based curriculum are taught to each participating inmate. Follow on training and in home help for the families of incarcerated parents is also being offered. Christian Heritage staff are expanding the vision as time goes on hoping to expand their programs into other states to keep families together and reduce recidivism rates in participating prisons. Ongoing research is being done to measure and refine their efforts in order to show state and local institutions the veracity of the programs in meeting the intended goals and outcomes.
Bone Creek Art Museum	127793		/users/profile/172894	Bone Creek Board Member	Board Member	5	10/22/2012	Let me tell you about a little museum in a little town in the middle of nowhere.  A group of charitable people got together one day and decided that their city needed not only an art gallery but a learning center for art.  In a very short time this organization has grown from just a handful of volunteers, to having full-time paid staff, a curator and an executive director.  The community has responded well to this idea.  The nation has responded to this idea with support from nearly have the states in the U.S. and visitors from three other countries!  Bone Creek has won numerous awards for their publications, website and art exhibits.  We can't thank everyone enough for their support of the past 5 years and hope we continue to grow, but we do need continued support so please visit our website, visit our gallery and enjoy all that Bone Creek Museum of Agrarian Art has to offer!

CASA is a great organization to work with. I was not sure what they did until we took on the project, but now after meeting the people and hearing the stories this organization does some amazing things. It was a privilege to work with CASA and to help their cause.
Friends Of Fort Hartsuff	194247		/users/profile/253795	Friend-of-Fort-Hartsuff	Board Member	4	02/13/2014	This organization exists to preserve, protect and promote Fort Hartsuff State Historical Park.  Fort Hartsuff is an 1870's Indian Wars period infantry post in the Loup Valley between Ord and Burwell, Nebraska.  A small, but complete, post,  Fort Hartsuff features nine original grout buildings.  The Friends sponsors events at the Fort, including the Spring Muster, which brings reactors from several states to man the garrison for a weekend.  In 2014 the Muster will be Saturday May 17.  It is an event worth seeing or better yet, for civil war buffs, an event worth participating in.

Inclusive Communities	40847	12	/users/profile/41736	ann9	Board Member	5	05/26/2010	This is a tremendous organization that has been in existence since the 1930's.   The mission is "Confronting prejudice, bigotry and discrimination through educational programs that raise awareness, foster leadership and encourage advocacy for a just and inclusive society." The majority of the programs are offered through schools, from elementary to university, but some are also delivered through the workplace.   These are not your mother's diversity programs - these are long-lasting, impactful programs that change participants' lives.   I cannot think of a better way to positively influence our next generation than to support this organization.

Heartland Family Service	307272		/users/profile/398602	Ralob	Client Served	1	09/30/2016	As an honorably discharged service-connected decorated disabled African American female veteran of the United States Air Force and a non-paid registered lobbyist with both Houses of the United States Congress, having successfully lobbied on behalf of the military and veterans community of the U S Armed Forces, as well as the President of a national veterans service association/organization, having recently sought the services of Heartland Family Service; I can say beyond any reasonable doubt, that Heartland and its staff, which purports to give veterans first priority in rental housing and utility assistance, in addition to being a racially-discriminatory organization - is a scam agency, extraordinaire, despite receiving tens of millions of dollars, each year in both federal, state and private funding and financial assistance.
