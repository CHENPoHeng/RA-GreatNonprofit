Unbound	309390	1	/users/profile/400758	Writer	Donor	5	10/10/2016	We sponsored a young girl in Kenya for many years and heard from her regularly.  She aged out of the program and we are now sponsoring her younger brother.  Our first child just got married!  More importantly, she got a job working in Nairobi and is fulfilling the dream she set for herself.  We are hoping her brother can do the same.  He works very hard on his grades and is very passionate about the environment and saving the animals of Africa.  His letters bring joy to our lives.  Both he and his sister confirm our contributions have made difference in their lives.
Unbound	306777		/users/profile/398074	MonicaD	Donor	5	09/27/2016	I have been a sponsor through Unbound for 11 years and currently have 3 sponsored friends in 3 continents. I have also been fortunate enough to have traveled on 4 awareness trips to meet my sponsored friends and to Unbound's headquarters in Kansas City. This is a tremendous organization impassioned about making a sustainable difference in the lives of the oppressed by empowering them and their talents. Every Unbound staff member I have worked with truly impresses and inspires me. Their system of sponsorship connects people of various walks of life in a truly unique bond that is life altering. Finally, I will continue to sponsor and encourage others to do so after witnessing the extent that the monthly contribution goes.
Unbound	300655	4	/users/profile/391531	Writer	Donor	5	08/16/2016	15 years ago, I began sponsoring  an 11-year old girl named Reyna.  Since then, that relationship has changed my life and led me on an amazing journey with Unbound.  I have had the great pleasure of meeting Reyna in Honduras on three separate occasions and each visit not only strengthened my relationship with her but also gave me a first-hand opportunity to witness the incredible work the Unbound staff does with regard to loving and caring for all of those sponsored friends whom they serve in Honduras.  I am, without a doubt, a lifelong supporter of Unbound and today I am happy to say that I have the privilege of sponsoring an Unbound child in every country where Unbound serves.   I would never have been willing to make such a commitment if not for the confidence that I have in the leadership of Unbound and in the staff teams that work all around the world.  They are all simply incredible  and inspirational!  Sponsorship through Unbound makes an incredibly positive difference in the lives of those being sponsored, but equally so for all those who shoes to become active sponsors.  
Unbound	300637	5	/users/profile/391509	Sharon191	General Member of the Public	5	08/16/2016	At Mass one Sunday, a Priest from Unbound gave a Homily about his Ministry at Unbound. I've always wanted to be a sponsor, but until then wasn't able to make the financial commitment. I was orphaned at 15, when my mother was killed in a car accident. My family was split up, and I was on my own - literally.I so wanted to help someone not to have to suffer the way I did. No body wants the responsibility of a teenager.When I got to the table where all the children's flyers were, on the left - all by herself was a young teenage girl. All the others had been chosen, except for this teenager.I noticed her name was April. My mother's birthday was in April, I picked her flyer up and began reading, her birthdate and my mothers were the same. She was mine! She always thanked me for "all" I did, but she didn't realize all she had actually did for me. She has graduated college now and I have finished my commitment with her, but I miss her and her family.Thank you Unbound for this beautiful opportunity!!!
Unbound	299949		/users/profile/390768	faithlovehope1	Donor	5	08/09/2016	Key word missing from my prior review, so adding my correction:I cannot thank God ENOUGH for guiding me to Unbound and Unbound for providing me with the opportunity to sponsor my fellow man and woman. I am so very grateful. To all the wonderful people I sponsor, THANK YOU for changing my world!!!
Unbound	299614	1	/users/profile/390536	faithlovehope	Donor	5	08/08/2016	"To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world." Unknown.  This quote describes what Unbound sponsorship is all about.I am currently sponsoring 20 children, youth and elderly throughout the world.  When Unbound says, "You change their world; they change your world," this is the TRUTH.  These 20 INCREDIBLE people have changed me in soooo many ways.  I went from wondering whether I would ever find my purpose in life (I'm 57 years old) to knowing exactly how to change my heart and my life.  And, I have.  I cannot thank God for guiding me to Unbound and Unbound for providing me with the opportunity to sponsor my fellow man and woman.  I am so very grateful.  To all the wonderful people I sponsor, THANK YOU for changing my world!!!
Unbound	293801	2	/users/profile/384458	rraspo	Donor	5	06/24/2016	I was always called Uncle by the boy I supported in India. We were together until he graduated from professional school  in computer engineering and began working. He can now help his siblings out of poverty.  I now have a little girl in Africa and hope her life and her families lives will prosper, with Gods help and what monies I can provide. May God bless this charity.
Unbound	293760	3	/users/profile/384416	irishgirl_09	Donor	5	06/23/2016	Unbound is amazing! I've sponsored a little girl in El Salvador for the past 4 1/2 years. I even went on a trip to El Salvador with other Unbound sponsors to meet her and her family. The work that Unbound does to support children and the elderly around the world is truly awe inspiring.  Thank God for Unbound!
Unbound	293732	3	/users/profile/384379	Writer	Donor	5	06/23/2016	My last sponsored child was with me from age 9 to age 24.  I kept urging him to stay in school and he was able to do so.  He recently found employment and I am so touched that I was able to help him, hopefully, step out of poverty.   I now have a little girl for a pen-pal and to encourage and help to stay in school.  It is wonderful to be able to  reach across the world to others through CFCA/UNBOUND.  
Unbound	293727	2	/users/profile/384372	tjk3146	Donor	5	06/23/2016	I sponsor an elderly woman.  Her nephew writes to me regularly to tell me how she is doing and I write to her in return.  I am grateful to have a way to share my blessings with someone so far away.  Unbound makes that possible and keeps me personally involved with my foreign friend. 
Unbound	293712	3	/users/profile/384351	Sharon186	General Member of the Public	5	06/23/2016	I have been involved with Unbound for so many years, I can't recall when it started. I know it was called CFCA at the time. I went on a mission awareness trip (and then a second) to check them out. There are so many scams out there that one worries. I don't have that much money but was willing to share with less fortunate. I was overwhelmed at the level of poverty these children live in and the amazing work of such kind, underpaid staff do. Their caring level is beyond imagining. I read in another review that the person was unhappy that the Christmas and Birthday money was pooled. I saw first hand what happens with this money. I was at a birthday celebrating at an area they run for the children of lepers. They are so abandoned by their society that they are worse off than the other deeply poor. These children mostly didn't have sponsors but all were given the same birthday gift of a metal dish and cup and a piece of cake. That's how poor. Being excited about a metal plate. And a piece of cake. And a loving touch from the few people on the awareness trip. How can one not want to share that birthday money rather than see their "better off" sponsored child get a special something. Every single employee I met along my 2 week stay was loving, kind, and gracious and seriously underpaid. Doing this because of the desperate need of the children. This organization is so needed in this world. We Americans have no idea of poverty. We have food pantries, clean water, no polio or leprosy. I am not a letter writer so I feel guilty that my 2 children, I have had 3 others over the years also, do not get encouraging letters, but I know that they have the basics and their families are being taught "to fish" not just being given "fish to eat". They may not hear from me often but I love my children, worry about them and wish I was a better sponsor. 
Unbound	293707	2	/users/profile/327774	Believer2	Donor	5	06/23/2016	I have been a sponsor for over 8 years.  Initially I took on one young girl in Guatemala.  After visiting her thru an awareness trip I came to realize how important well managed Unbound was.   Slowly I took on more youth and elders.  I had the privilege of meeting my teen girl in India on another awareness trip.  I love corresponding with my friends and learn more about their lives.  I am impressed that each sponsored person is visited regularly to insure funds are being used correctly.  I am also impressed the who,e family benefits from the support.  My initial girl has left the program since the family is now better off.  She attends school no helped her mom learn to read.  I cannot recommend this organization enough.  I believe we change one life at. Time through support in Unbound.
Unbound	241266	6	/users/profile/327774	Believer2	Volunteer	5	04/16/2015	I sponsor thru Unbound and have taken 2 awareness trips. First one I went on to see if they really are as good as they say.  Actually I found they are better.  90+% of the donation goes to support the sponsored and their family.  This group has shown me how to change one life at a time and make a difference thru education, health care and support of the whole family.  I highly recommend it.
Unbound	293682	2	/users/profile/384316	jagelhar	Donor	5	06/22/2016	We have been involved with Unbound for 9 years. We sponsor a teenaged boy and an older lady. I cannot say enough positive things about this organization! We receive regular pictures and letters. They work really hard to keep us in touch with them. It is a privilege to be involved with Unbound.
Unbound	293612	2	/users/profile/384231	Kerry E.	Volunteer	5	06/22/2016	My husband and I became involved with Unbound when it was CFCA nearly ten years ago when we sponsored two children from Costa Rica.  We delighted in the letters and pictures from them and finally were able to meet them during a Mission Awareness Trip to Costa Rica.  I must say that visit is one of the highlights of my life.  I will never forget the experience.  I have been so impressed with the mission of Unbound and the high percentage of contributions that actually make it to the children.  I later decided to sponsor another child, this time one from the Philippines.  I have also supported Unbound by being a sponsor advocate and bringing the message to local parishes.  I even offered to help during a visit to Branson while on vacation.  The two children I originally supported are now approaching adulthood and I will continue to support them as long as they continue their education.  I highly recommend this non-profit organization for anyone wanting to reach out and help a child.  
Unbound	293601	1	/users/profile/384220	MarleneLove1	Volunteer	5	06/22/2016	My WIfe Marlene and I have been sponsors with Unbound for 4 years now.  We have been Blessed by God in so many ways.  We have a house, 2 cars that run, food in our refrigerator and plenty of  fresh drinking water, money in our pockets and in the bank, 9 grandchildren, we have our health, and most importantly we have our Faith in our Lord and Savior Jesus. In the past history of the Bible they talked about tithing which is giving 10 percent of the first fruits of the field and flock.  No where in the New testament does it still refer to this 10 percent of giving but Marlene and I want to give even more back to God by sharing the abundance with his less advantaged children and not only the physical gifts but that of our Spiritual gifts through our actions and prayer.God has given us many many gifts and we will share these gifts with others because we don't need them all just for ourselves.  We may not have millions of dollars but will share what extra we have with others.  Erma Bombeck once said;  When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single but of talent left, and could say to God, I used everything you gave me.  Thats the motto of the Clark family.Unbound has given us the opportunity to help others that are not in our neighborhood or even our own country.  There are people all over the world who need the help of those that God has given more and we intend on doing just that.Unbound has allowed us to sponsor a child in Uganda.  We write letters and send photos and receive letters and photos.  We even get our 9 grandchildren involved in writing too. Its a Clark family effort all 17 of us.Life is like a test.  God gives us many gifts and watches what we do  with them.   Do we keep them all to ourselves or do we share as Jesus taught us.God Bless Unbound for their efforts in allowing us to share our gifts with others.Bob & Marlene Clark and Family  ,   All 17 of us.
Unbound	292722	3	/users/profile/383273	kalibee	General Member of the Public	5	06/11/2016	Unbound is very transparent and forthcoming with information regarding how your contributions are spent.  People giving lower ratings because the organization has taken its Christian roots out of it's name are being silly.  The Christian foundation is still there but you don't have to be Christian to help and I think the rebranded name, Unbound, is very fitting.  I scrutinized Unbound before sponsoring to see if I could find any negatives.  I couldn't find any and now sponsor four friends.  We also contribute to Unbound through Amazon Smile because every little bit helps.
Unbound	291408	3	/users/profile/381818	ParishNurse37	Donor	2	05/30/2016	We have been sponsors to CFCA/Unbound for over a decade and for the most of those years had been well pleased with how the organization and its programs had been run, but that was until the significant name change and corresponding mission drift.  The practice  of 'deliverance'  -- freeing those who are bound -- is a serious work of the Christian community that cannot occur without reliance on God in the name of Christ!  (See Luke 10:17). We had been well impressed with the agency in years past, because it had appeared that the organization was faithfully following the Biblical ideal of providing practical assistance along with the Gospel. Now it appears that their friendship with the world, the lure of riches, etc. (James 4:4; Mark 4:19) have choked out the genuine Gospel message, in that the organization has transformed itself into a "humanitarian organization" rather than a Christian "ministry." Jesus rebuked followers who cared little for his teachings but wanted only to receive bread (John 6:26); then as now He urges us to "not work for food that perishes, but food that endures unto eternal life" (John 6:27).  We feel  very disappointed by Unbound, because it appears that the organization is emphasizing the food that perishes rather than the food that endures to eternal life. Furthermore, although the organization has received high marks from non-profit rating agencies, there is a small detail we've discovered recently, one which brought a twinge of sadness to our family. We have always sent donations for birthdays and Christmas to our sponsored elder, believing that these donations would be hers (perhaps minus some small administrative fee?). However, the donations that are supposed to be personal gifts to the sponsored are the donations which are POOLED and used however.  Think about that business tactic for a moment. How would you feel if a friend sent you a personal gift and you found out that your 'family' took that money and did whatever they wanted to with it, and that maybe you received very little or none of it? How would that make you feel?  There is something about that policy that seems terribly unjust and disingenuous.  The organization claims that all basic sponsorship monies go directly to support of the sponsored, yet ironically, those are the funds that would most reasonably be expected to serve ALL the participants. At this point we are still sponsors, but having observed  all the organizational changes during the previous decade have caused us to reconsider our level of support. 
Unbound	291196	5	/users/profile/381576	flentie	Donor	5	05/27/2016	The selection process was a dichotomy of emotions from heartwarming to be able to make a difference for one child, and heartbreaking to leave others with huge needs unsponsored.  I finally selected a six year old boy who shared our daughter's birthday.   It has been over two years, and Unbound's Mother's Council overseas his ongoing needs. This personal connection is the biggest difference among sponsoring agencies and non profits. The Unbound community of paid staffers treat everyone with kindness and compassion. This feeling permeates the organization from the top to the bottom.  Whenever we receive a letter or write a letter it gives my family a warm feeling. 
Unbound	291193	6	/users/profile/381573	Jenny96	Donor	5	05/27/2016	Three children are in our family because of Unbound.  The small amount of money that goes to our overseas children is not missed by us, but means a world of difference to them.  We are so grateful for these beautiful souls, and are so grateful for Unbound who brought us together.  It is a well-managed and well-run charity that does everyone good, sponsors and sponsees especially.
Unbound	291187	6	/users/profile/381566	writer2003	Volunteer	5	05/26/2016	This organization is the real deal!!! Starting with their founder, the entire employee staff's main focus is the betterment of mankind, among the poorest of the poor. They emphasize empowering families towards self sufficiency. I've seen first hand how the donated funds are utilized and their integrity is superior. If you only had one organization to choose from and your desire is to connect with another human being in need through donation and letter....you will not be disappointed. I've sponsored my child for four years now. He is thriving and bettering himself for a better future for himself and his family. 
Unbound	291167	4	/users/profile/381547	Timothy35	Donor	5	05/26/2016	This is a wonderful organization that helps not only the child but the entire family.  We have been able to follow the man we sponsor from being a small boy to the young man he is becoming.  His letters have kept us up to date not only with his school work but how his family is doing.  My boys have enjoyed sending letters back comparing how their daily life is with his (school/sports/hobbies).  We will definitely sponsor another child or maybe even a senior when this young man no longer needs our support.
Unbound	281202	5	/users/profile/371236	_colorado	Donor	5	02/29/2016	I've supported CFCA/Unbound for over ten years.  I have sponsored three elderly persons during those years.  I receive a letter from the sponsored person about once per quarter, encouragement to write to the sponsored person, and minimal extraneous mail other than tax receipts.  More charities should adopt this model. I was recently asked to increase my monthly donation for only the second time in over ten years.  I GLADLY increased this donation.  Please support Unbound! 
Unbound	278407	10	/users/profile/368346	Writer	Donor	3	01/30/2016	Our family were sponsors for many years, but a few years ago they 'cleansed' much of their public image of the words  Christian and Christ, starting with their name. Since they are uncomfortable identifying themselves with Christ, we found someone else to donate to who helps families in need and is not embarrassed to be seen as Christian. 
Unbound	274835	13	/users/profile/364340	Falhawk	Donor	5	12/22/2015	My Wife and I have been sponsors for almost 30 years. We love to receive letters and photos of the children we sponsor. Unbound does an amazing job. God Bless you. 
Unbound	265933	15	/users/profile/354683	Beth152	Donor	5	10/20/2015	Words can't describe the joy I had when I received my first handwritten letter from  the child I sponsored. This is such a great non profit organization. Everything is organized and easy to maintain a connection with your sponsored child. 
Unbound	259709	17	/users/profile/348228	UnboundMom1	Donor	5	09/25/2015	This is an amazing program!! where you not only will change the life of a child but you get to become part of their family for life and them part of yours.  I picked an age of child to sponsor, that was the same as my own son, so they can grow up as friends in very different parts of the world; and for a graduation gift, I will take my son to meet our sponsored child that we have exchanged letters with for so long. In addition, each year at my annual raise time- I plan to sponsor another child adding to my Unbound Family, hopefully easing some of the burden from their lives & change a childs future. 
Unbound	258626	12	/users/profile/347130	Eric81	Donor	5	09/21/2015	My wife and I have been Unbound sponsors for 15 years.  Unbound empowers the sponsors to live out the Gospel message by serving those most in need.  The personal contact we have with our sponsored children and aging and the Unbound staff makes us an integral part of the worldwide Unbound family. Through their mission awareness trips we have had the opportunity to meet our sponsored children and see the Unbound staff at work in the local communities.  Their openness at every level has given me full confidence that the resources we provide are used wisely. Meeting our sponsored children and aging in their community and in their homes is an experience that cannot be measured.  The Unbound staff has been very prompt at meeting all our requests for information and specific help for our individual sponsored needs. With the creation of the mothers groups in the local communities the Unbound staff has provided a family atmosphere for the sponsored children and their parents, many of whom are single mothers.  This bonding helps the mothers pull together to help provide for their children in a way that would not be possible on their own. Eric and Mary Baker, Unbound sponsors
Unbound	258605	17	/users/profile/347110	KateH	Volunteer	5	09/20/2015	I have been a sponsor of Unbound (formerly CFCA) for over 10 years.   I have also volunteered by visiting local parishes and helping sign up sponsors.  My experience has been wholeheartedly positive and extremely rewarding.   They have always been very responsive to any questions I've had, and considering the challenges in dealing with often rural communities in foreign countries, it has always surprised me just how responsive they have been.   I'm fortunate enough to work for a company that matches my donations 2:1, which results in a sizable year-end lump sum.  I've received phone calls asking how I'd like the funds utilized, and even helped purchase land and build a house for a family once.   I received copies of invoices, photos, letters, it was absolutely extraordinary!   If there's another charity that does this, I've yet to experience it.  So to conclude, I would recommend this charity, they are getting donations directly to the sponsored child/elder person and improving lives! 
Unbound	258420	19	/users/profile/346912	Writer	Donor	5	09/19/2015	My husband and I have 4 sons who are now all grown men. But we also sponsor 8 children through UNBOUND. We began with one girl from Mexico in 1983.  For many years we wrote and received letters and pictures from our sponsored children. Then, in 2008, we went on our first MISSION AWARENESS TRIP. It changed our lives because we saw how much good was being done in the communities. We continue to encourage our friends and relatives to sponsor children through your wonderful organization, UNBOUND. Love, Elsa
Unbound	243481	20	/users/profile/330239	Jackie57	Donor	5	05/23/2015	Since my family began sponsoring a child through Unbound a few years ago, the letters from her family have provided a tangible connection to people from a whole different life style. Their thankfulness for health and consistent prayers for us serve as a reminder of what is truly important in life. Supporting Unbound's work will not only change your perspective on poverty, but open your eyes to the worth in all life. I am grateful for all they do!
Unbound	242897	14	/users/profile/329476	George42	Donor	5	05/12/2015	I've been involved with Unbound for 15 years as a sponsor and as an advocate.  It is very effective in promoting a mutually enriching relationship between sponsors and sponsored persons.  Some sponsors receive letters that are so sweetly sincere that they feel they are receiving more than they are giving.  I do not hesitate to encourage members of parishes where I preach and members of my own family to become sponsors in order to help the children of the very poor to break free of the bonds of poverty and fulfill their dreams.
Unbound	242419	11	/users/profile/329134	Tormey	Donor	5	05/07/2015	Sponsoring children for 13 years through this great organization has been one of the most gratifying things we have ever done. The personal contact with the children through letters and pictures is inspiring.  Unbound is very efficiently managed, with extremely low overhead and it is very convenient and easy to work with them.Our children and grandchildren have also learned to appreciate their secure lives and be inspired to help others to achieve a better life.We highly recommend Unbound to our friends and everyone.
Unbound	241865	12	/users/profile/328546	Janet109	Donor	5	04/29/2015	We have been sponsoring children and youth through Unbound for about 18 years.  Having now been on three Mission Awareness Trips, we continue to be impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff on the ground.  They know their people, and the culture and Unbound respects that, giving the people autonomy while holding them accountable.  The results are evident.  Children from the hardest backgrounds go to College, and we met doctors, accountants, social workers, hotel staff that have come successfully through the program and now give back to their family and/or community.  It is truly inspiring what can be achieved from our donations.  Highly recommend this program.
Unbound	241847	11	/users/profile/101406	Louise S.	Donor	5	04/29/2015	I have been a donor for over 14 years, and was able to sponsor a young man from grade school to independence. I currently sponsor 2 children and 1 aging lady. I love this group's openness in facilitating sponsor travel to meet their sponsored friends. Card and letter exchanges are nice; but it's even better to meet these people face-to-face, to look in their eyes and see for yourself what an effective organization this is and how your contributions are changing these peoples lives.
Unbound	241704	7	/users/profile/328334	LorJane	Volunteer	5	04/25/2015	I have been blessed to be a part of the Unbound experience for several years.  We currently sponsor 3 children and 2 elderly in the Philippines, Costa Rica and Ecuador.  We have established a very heartwarming bond with these individuals through letters, photos and personal visits in their homes through Awareness Trips sponsored by Unbound.  The close bond we have been able to establish with these families is truly humbling.    One of our elderly told me in a recent visit with her that because of our help, she can face each day a little better knowing that someone cares for her; and the children are always eager to do well in school and they work hard to achieve good grades so that we will be proud of them.  The faith these families have in our Lord Jesus Christ in spite of their extreme hardships is truly inspiring.  We give a small monetary amount to help to these people, but what we receive in return is a life-altering experience no amount of money can buy.   We also include our grandchildren in this experience and they are looking forward to accompanying us on an Awareness Trip in the near future.   The Unbound staff truly care for each and every one of these people, and they are a wonderful organization to work with.  
Unbound	241685	7	/users/profile/94370	Tom Zidon	Volunteer	5	04/25/2015	I have been a sponsor through Unbound for 17 years.  Unbound has given me the chance to actually see how much good my donations do.  I have  visited with the people who receive my help and see how much good it does.  Before my visits to these children I got letters from them telling me what they felt from my caring for them.  Without Unbound I would be giving my donations to an unnamed person somewhere in the world.   I cannot say enough good about Unbound and the work they do for many, many people in a large part of the world of the poor.  
Unbound	109958	8	/users/profile/94370	Tom Zidon	Volunteer	5	04/16/2012	I have been a sponcer of a little girl, now a young woman, in Bluefields, Nicaragua.  I have been able to correspond with her on a regular basis.  Through my relationship with her I have developed a need, if you will, to sponcer several more young people.  I have seen how dramaitcally the life of my first "Goddaughter" has changed and have wished to be able to give more childern this chance.     CFCA has given me the chance to help these childern as well as helping me to give myself a sence of accomplishment by helping some one in desperate need!    I do encourage anyone with the "need'" to help to use CFCA as a vehicle to accomplish their charity!
Unbound	84918	13	/users/profile/94370	Tom Zidon	Board Member	5	04/06/2011	I have been a sponcer for 15 years.  The past 3 years I have traveled to see the Kids I am sponcering.  By visiting the kids and their homes I have seem all the good that can come of a sponcership through CFCA.  After visiting my first sponcered child I realized that I need to do more.  Thus began a relationship with 4 more kids.  After visiting the homes of those additional kids I was able to funnel some of my donation dollars to their needs in the likes of beds, education, cooking stoves and a house that stays dry during a rain.
Unbound	241645	6	/users/profile/328248	Robin122	Donor	5	04/24/2015	I can highly recommend this organization because I have seen what they accomplish.  Members of my family sponsor 6 children in Central America,  India, and Africa.   We have bridged the  miles through exchange of letters and photos.   My daughter-in-law and I visited our family in India and saw the work Unbound does meeting the needs of children.  There are also mom's programs to help families out of poverty.   Unbound changes the lives of many people throughout the world and I am grateful to be a part of it.
Unbound	241643	4	/users/profile/328246	fcrosby	Donor	5	04/24/2015	Unbound is simply an amazing organization in every way imaginable.  My wife and I have been sponsors of children and elderly over the past 20 years.  Through the years we have learned so much about the children and their families and seen them grow.  Our elderly sponsored friends have shared their experiences as well.  Each letter brings us closer together and Unbound personnel faithfully assure that the children and elderly receive educational and other assistance.  We have been fortunate to participate in Awareness trips to the places where our sponsored friends live and seen firsthand the wonderful work that Unbound representatives do in each area project.  Unbound really assists not only the sponsored children and elderly, but also their families and communities to help themselves.  We have received so much more from the sponsored children, the elderly and their families than we could ever have given.
Unbound	241356	3	/users/profile/254596	stanblackburn	Donor	5	04/18/2015	Unbound reaches those who are in desperate need in our world. Through sponsorship, we have been able to make a difference in a little girl's life, and she has become a part of our spiritual family.  Unbound has been excellent in their communication and management.  This is such a worthy charity.  Please sponsor a needy child today; it is so easy, affordable, and rewarding.  She or he will teach you to love in a way you never know you could. God bless. 
Unbound	194802	6	/users/profile/254596	stanblackburn	Donor	5	02/25/2014	God brought the little girl from Columbia into our lives.  Through prayer and the desire to do God's will, we discovered CFCA (Unbound Intl.), and began sponsoring a child.  Our life has been so rich knowing that the little we do can mean so much to a struggling child.  Unbound has been faithful in their personal responses and management of our sponsorship.  Hearing from our sponsored child, watching her grow up, and knowing the Holy Spirit connects us in charity is so comforting. May God bless Unbound, and I thank them, through the opportunity of sponsorship, for helping bring Christ into our lives. 
Unbound	241268	2	/users/profile/327778	Kristen54	Donor	5	04/16/2015	Being a part of Unbound has been the greatest experience! I absolutely love having the opportunity to make a difference while also learning more about different places and cultures, and sending and receiving letters from my sponsored friends just lights up my day! If you're looking for a great way to make a difference in someone's life, you should definitely check out UNBOUND!!!
Unbound	241265	4	/users/profile/327773	paulakiger	Donor	5	04/16/2015	I have been involved with Unbound for many years now (approximately 12). I have traveled to two countries (Guatemala and El Salvador) and met the children I sponsor. I also volunteer at church "Unbound weekends" so I have met many of the priests involved. Visiting the countries confirmed that my money is very carefully stewarded, and I saw firsthand how thoroughly the staff works to support the children and aging people who are sponsored, and to help them retain their independence and dignity while getting the help they need.  
Unbound	219249	5	/users/profile/193974	kateliz	Donor	5	10/02/2014	I have sponsored a child through Unbound since 2011.  It is a wonderful organization.  The emphasis is on the children and elderly served - not on the staff and employees of Unbound.  I highly recommend this charity for anyone who truly wants to help the poor and disadvantaged.
Unbound	184792	3	/users/profile/193974	kateliz	Donor	5	10/29/2013	I have been sponsoring a little boy in Honduras for two years.  While I am sure my money is going to help him and his family, the blessing he has given me is just as wonderful.  We exchange letters regularly.  I would like to sponsor more children through CFCA in the future.
Unbound	146920	2	/users/profile/193974	kateliz	Donor	5	12/18/2012	I sponsor a little boy in Honduras.  It is a very rewarding experience.  CFCA is a very caring organization.  The relationship which builds between sponsor and sponsored is truly rewarding.  I would highly recommend CFCA.
Unbound	212401	5	/users/profile/275401	scottishrose	Donor	5	08/27/2014	I highly recommend this wonderful charity. It is the most professional and ethically responsible sponsorship program I have come across. Sponsoring a child through this program has been very rewarding for my family, especially for my children. It teaches them so much about the world and our place in it. They will be better people because of this organization. Best of all, we know that we are helping another child achieve his dreams. 
Unbound	211744	4	/users/profile/274678	mplevyak22	Donor	5	08/21/2014	Sponsoring a child through Unbound has been a totally rewarding experience. My wife and I enjoy exchanging letters with our sponsored child. We really feel connected to him, his family and his community and we learn how our encouragement and support are helping him. We are very impressed with the positive and personal impact Unbound is able to accomplish with our modest contributions - so impressed that we also contribute to a number of special Unbound funds which provide supplemental support to the communities or people it serves. Most impressive about Unbound is that it conducts "mission awareness" trips, so sponsors can travel to meet their sponsored child and observe first-hand how effectively their contributions are being used. 
Unbound	211526	5	/users/profile/274454	bkph	Donor	5	08/21/2014	Marie is an elderly woman participating in Unbound.  We visited Maria in Guatemala and gave her a simple blanket. She later wrote that when she prays for us or is in pain she wraps herself in this blanket. This relationship brings great joy to each of us and to our world.
Unbound	211476	2	/users/profile/274403	Anne100	Volunteer	5	08/20/2014	I have previously written reviews for Unbound.  You are free to use them in any of your PR and advertising efforts. Anne F. Kriz, sponsor  
Unbound	211462	2	/users/profile/274389	Theresa45	Donor	5	08/20/2014	I am very happy to be a part of the Unbound family.  The connection which is encouraged between sponsors and individuals makes for a personal relationship and a deeper understanding of other cultures.      
Unbound	211304	4	/users/profile/274211	Ted Z.	Donor	5	08/20/2014	Older children don't seem to be as attractive to sponsor. After reading his story,I choose a 24 year old in India who wants to become a policeman. I plan to help him finish his education and make a difference on the other side of the world which normally we really can't influence. In our high tech world,exchanging old fashion letters with Nicholas has grown into a true friendship.
Unbound	211272	7	/users/profile/274168	Steve113	Volunteer	5	08/20/2014	My wife and I have been sponsors with UNBOUND (formerly known as CFCA) since 1998.  Between 1998 and 2004 we sponsored two young girls in Mexico.  Each of these sponsored children, for one reason or another, dropped out of the program.  While this was initially disappointing, there can be many reasons for this - failure to co-operate with the program, moving to a different location where services cannot be provided, etc.  In each case we were notified by CFCA/UNBOUND and given the option of suspending our contributions or selecting another child.  We are so glad that we selected another child as that is when Sofia came into our lives; she was eight years old at the time.  In 2008, after having corresponded for four years, we went on a mission awareness trip (MAT) to Mexico to meet Sofia and to see firsthand how this organization operated and how our funds were used.  During our week in Mexico we met our adorable, shy Sofia (then 12 years old), and we have been forever changed.  Over the next four years, as Sofia matured, her correspondence matured as well.  Our relationship deepened, and we were so proud to call her our Godchild.  We looked forward to another trip to visit her, but violence in the area of her project forced CFCA to suspend trips to that area of Mexico.  Unfortunately in 2012, after 8 years of sponsorship, complications made it impossible for Sofia to continue in the program.  We shed more than a few tears over that, but we know that we are better off for having known her, and she us.  Sofia is still our Godchild; her picture still graces our home; she is still in our prayers.  We know that God is looking after her. Since that first MAT to Mexico in 2008, we have since made MAT's to Guatemala (4), Costa Rica (2), and Chile where we sponsor or have sponsored one or more children/youth.  In both Guatemala and Costa Rica (because of our return trips) we have been able to see the changes in the lives of those we sponsor.  It is gratifying to see that we can make a difference, and it is humbling to realize that we are receiving more than we can possibly give. We encourage you to join us as sponsors through UNBOUND.   Steve
Unbound	203461	4	/users/profile/265397	jjsimas	Donor	5	06/22/2014	A priest came to our church and spoke about this way to help others.  I was able to choose someone with a learning disability to honor my father who has a special desire to help those with learning challenges.  I am glad unbound provides such detail about people we can help.  I was also impressed that less than 7% of the donation goes toward administration and fund raising.  I am very happy there are people in this world that dedicate their lives to help others while living modestly so that the donated funds may go to help those most in need in our world.
Unbound	203365	5	/users/profile/265265	Steve108	Volunteer	5	06/20/2014	My wife and I have been a sponsors for 6 years and the experience has lead us to sponsor 6 children at this time. While participating in Mission Awareness Trips in the Philippines and India, I have seen first hand Unbound's amazing work which provides the children and their families a hand-up and not a hand-out. Unbound focuses on keeping the children in school and assisting the mothers, through mother's groups, to be confident in helping improve their environment developing small businesses which brings in more income. While in India, I met at least 20 alumni who were former sponsored children who now college graduates. There was a lawyer, several nurses (one with a Master's degree) engineers software developers, a priest, a motivational speaker and other good careers. I readily endorse Unbound and encourage others to sponsor child, youth or aging who are in need of a hand-up. 
Unbound	203344	5	/users/profile/264133	Jeri4	Donor	5	06/20/2014	Unbound has changed my life. I was in need of a spiritual awakening, a need to show gratitude, a need to do good for others. I found all of this with Unbound. At first I sponsored a lovely elderly woman, Juliana. She lives in Nicaragua in a small village. $30 a month and many letters exchanged between us. I went on a week long Awareness trip to visit her. Imagine being able to personally meet those you sponsor. It was profoundly life changing. I was able to see where the money goes. It's amazing how far $30 will go in Nicaragua. Since then I have sponsored 3 little girls too. I visit every year and it is a highlight.   The mission, vision and values of this organization are strong. We walk with the poor. It's a beautiful thing. I can highly recommend Unbound.  14 of my friends now sponsor those in need. I'm so proud of that. 
Unbound	203218	9	/users/profile/265055	David230	Donor	2	06/18/2014	While I still sponsor three children, and have been a sponsor for over 15 years, I am very disappointed in CFCAs change in direction. Good solid leadership should know that growth would come from additional marketing. However, they were obviously swayed by maintaining the deceptive statistic of what % goes to charity. I am not saying ignore it, but you cannot grow without investment. So apparently the decision was made to pursue those fickle people who would not donate because Christian was in the name. Really? Let's allienate the majority of our donors for people who aren't historically strong donors. Let's pray....if that is still allowed....for better leadership.  R
Unbound	203216	1	/users/profile/265053	BillieB	Donor	5	06/18/2014	I became a proud sponsor of a beautiful little girl in Honduras in 2013.  It has changed my life knowing that $30 a month is substantially making a difference in her and her family's life.   She is directly benefiting by getting to go to school, seeing a doctor, improving her living conditions and many other things.  My family and I benefit by getting to create a bond with her and her family through our letters and pictures.   God has opened my heart to help this girl and I hope others hear their calling to help those in need through Unbound.  What a wonderful organization with great people.
Unbound	203193	1	/users/profile/265031	Leila K.	Donor	5	06/18/2014	Giving a monthly donation for a particular child is very rewarding.  I enjoy receiving letters and photos from her and learning about her life in Honduras.  Her family is extremely appreciative for all the benefits they receive from Unbound.
Unbound	203192	4	/users/profile/265030	alisonavayu	Board Member	5	06/18/2014	I started sponsoring through Unbound in 2009 and have been moved beyond belief!  I was able to meet my sponsor child on my first trip to Guatemala, also in 2009 (one of the reasons I decided to sponsor).  Then after 3 years in a row traveling to Guatemala and meeting different people  I was able to sponsor an elderly gentleman who needed assistance.  Through the generosity of others and Unbound, we were able to get him a wheelchair and fix his roof!  How incredible!  Then just recently I started sponsoring a young woman in the Philippines that is trying to earn a college degree.  The work that Unbound does is truly amazing and one of a kind.  The one on one relationships that are formed and the distinct ways lives are changed through Unbound is remarkable.    If you are looking for an authentic way to help others in need, this organization is the way to do it.  For sponsors, the monthly donation may not "amount to much" but for the sponsored children and elderly - that donation changes their world.  It offers hope, love, support and encouragement to stand strong and know that they too are worthy and capable of succeeding in life.  I feel honored and blessed to be a part of such a wonderful organization.  Since 2012 I have served on the Board of Directors and look forward a future without bounds!
Unbound	203190	2	/users/profile/265028	sarahdela	Donor	5	06/18/2014	This organization has been a fantastic way to contribute to people in need. I love contributing each month and knowing exactly where my money is going and why! They have low operational costs, so I know that the majority of my donation is going to the families who need it.
Unbound	203186	1	/users/profile/265024	rdc01	Donor	5	06/18/2014	Fantastic organization run by wonderful people who care about helping the poor in the world. 
Unbound	203183	2	/users/profile/265022	Stellamaris	Donor	5	06/18/2014	I love feeling that I'm making  a direct difference in someone's life. I have been supporting a little girl for more than 2 years now. Her mother is usually the one who writes me and sends me pictures. I look forward to when the little girl will be able to do it by herself!
Unbound	197785	12	/users/profile/258502	MisterStink	Donor	1	04/15/2014	We have heard some unfortunate news regarding the new Unbound.  We have been told the purpose of Unbound was to invite other faiths to sponsor children.  Nice concept.  We understand the real purpose was because of no growth.  CFCA had no growth because this country/world has been in a recession for the past 10 plus years.  Hasn't KC watched the news or read the newspapers. We also heard Unbound wants to eliminate the history of the founder Roberto Hentzen.  Roberto never eliminated any person who helped found CFCA.  Why can't Unbound just add to the history. We feel this is an act of an egotist who wants power and credit for it all.  We have museums, history books, archaeologiests, historic films so we can understand how we evolved.  We have the bible.  If we eliminated Jesus from the New Testament we wouldn't have the New Testament.  We also understand Unbound in order to accomodate other faiths wants to remove the Christian traditions.  Yet they ask us to go to our churches and request a day to invite our Christian friends to sponsor a child. We have seen what has happened in this country to accomodate all faiths.  It started with no praying in public schools and has progressed to where mangers can't be displayed at Christmas and children can't even have a simple Halloween or Valentines party anymore because they could offend 1 child.  Lets create a network to all the sponsors we have met to spread the word and ask them to continue the network.  We want our founders and faiths preserved.  It Unbound can't do that, then what is really going on.
Unbound	192752	3	/users/profile/251713	bendanglin	Donor	5	01/17/2014	Can you sustain a human being for the price of a cup of coffee a day?  No... because you can't get a cup of coffee for a dollar anymore.  As a sponsor of Unbound/CFCA, I feel that the most important part of my day is not my work or my interests, but helping a few people across the world get by for another day. My struggles are ridiculous in comparison to theirs.  The Unbound people also deal with hardships...just do a Google street-view of their location. It's a rough industrial building with absolutely no frills attached and a lot of broken windows. A sponsorship costs nothing compared to the returns. 
Unbound	189142	3	/users/profile/246891	workhardplayhard	Donor	5	11/23/2013	I have been a sponsor for 5 years and can say that CFCA is the most organized, effective and efficient charity that I have ever seen.
Unbound	188676	5	/users/profile/246232	Kristi2015	Volunteer	5	11/15/2013	I have been a sponsor through CFCA since 1999 and have found it to be a very rewarding experience. Through the years, I got to know my girls through letter writing and the exchange of photos, and then in July of 2011, I took my first trip to Nicaragua (on a CFCA Mission Awareness Trip) to meet them in person!  I saw firsthand how my small donation each month is making a difference in the lives of these girls, their families, and their communities. Sponsored friends and their families are so grateful! When I returned from that trip, I was passionate about increasing my commitment to CFCA and to my girls. I began returning their letters more faithfully and frequently, and I signed up as a volunteer in order to get the word out and give others the wonderful opportunity to sponsor a child, teenager, or elderly person.  I have an outreach page on the CFCA website, where I can direct family & friends to, so that they can browse profiles of those who are awaiting sponsorship. I am the contact person in my parish for those interested in sponsorship, and have begun hosting a sponsorship table at our annual ministry fair. I also arranged for CFCA to send one of their priest volunteers for a sponsorship weekend at my church, where he was the main celebrant and was able to tie sponsorship into the homily. We signed up more than 50 new sponsors that weekend!  For these kinds of events, CFCA sends nice picture profiles of those awaiting sponsorship, along with brochures, and everything needed for an attractive display. The staff at the Kansas City office are most helpful, and have bent over backward to help me accomplish the above, and are always courteous and available to assist me with any questions. On several occasions, they have communicated with my girls' projects and social workers, in order to determine the families' greatest needs or to answer any question or concern. They are responsive to the needs of both sponsors and those who are sponsored, and are passionate about what they are doing and the people they serve. I saw this same kind of passion and commitment among the staff in Nicaragua.  CFCA also offers a translation service in order to aid communication between those of us who sponsor and our friends around the globe. I would recommend sponsorship, and specifically CFCA to anybody, and am honored to be a part of the CFCA family.
Unbound	188192	2	/users/profile/245474	Brad14	Donor	5	11/08/2013	I sponsor 2 children in the Philippines. God brought them to me to help. Although I have concerns with the typhoon that hit today, I know that the CFCA is going to be there throughout the entire time to help. This is the best charity I have EVER been a part of and the connections you feel with just knowing you are helping a child in need is unbelievable. This is such a great organization and I will do whatever I can to help. I wish I could sponsor all them. But the 2 I got right now are a blessing to my life thanks to the CFCA :)
Unbound	187533	4	/users/profile/244554	Ann_74	Donor	5	11/01/2013	I learned about CFCA from my father who has several sponsored children in Guatemala and Bolivia.  I also had the pleasure of going on two Mission Awareness trips to Bolivia, once to meet my fathers sponsored children and then the second time to meet mine.  My first MAT was the most incredible experience I have ever had, I not only got to meet the two children my father sponsors but also their families.  I got to see first hand how CFCA works and what they do for these children, young adults and aging.  My husband and I now sponsor two children, one in Bolivia and one in Mexico.This organization not only ensures that our sponsored friends get the tools they need to attend school, they also get some food to help the family, medical supplies and many other necessities.  One of the many things I found very wonderful and inspiring is how the children are held accountable to stay in school and not only that but the parents are also involved in a group where they meet with other parents and help each other to become self sufficient.  I was awestruck at the overwhelming gratefulness of all of these people, sponsored and not sponsored.  It was actually depressing leaving this country and going back to our way of life.  CFCA does amazing, wonderful work in these countries and they give hope to people that have no other resources.   It is amazing and wonderful what such a small contribution does for all of these people. I also had the pleasure of meeting the late Bob Hentzen who was the President and Co-founder of CFCA and I can't describe what a pleasure he was to be around, he and his wife Christina are so loved by all of these people and with very good reason.  I wish I could express to everyone how being a sponsor makes me feel, it is one of the best things I have ever done! 
Unbound	186618	2	/users/profile/243629	dbrisnehan	Donor	5	10/31/2013	Our family has been sponsoring CFCA children for nearly 10 years.  It has been a wonderful experience for us.  My wife and I thought it would be a good experience for our two teenage girls to gain a larger perspective of the challenges children of the third world countries face; so we let them select children they would like to sponsor.  One selected a young boy from Guatemala; the other selected a teen girl from Liberia.  As a family we would write letters and always enjoyed receiving letters and seeing the growth in our sponsored children.  One daughter and I were able to go on a Mission Awareness Trip to Guatemala and we were able to meet our sponsored boy.  It was an unforgettable life event, and we really saw the life-changing affect that sponsorship has on the children and their whole families.  We have been so impressed with CFCA that our family now sponsors five children in three different countries.
Unbound	186529	5	/users/profile/243538	Dorothy9	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	My husband and I have been sponsors with CFCA for over 9 years.  We currently sponsor 8 children and 2 aging in Nicaragua and Kenya. The CFCA website says "Sponsor a child, change a Life". They should add "there's a potential to change your life as well".  We have had the opportunity to meet all of our sponsored friends in both Nicaragua and Kenya and have seen CFCA in action. They are the "real deal."  We share letters and photos and learn about each others family, friends, school, hopes and dreams for the future. They have become part of our extended family.  I love that in Nicaragua they refer to us as their padrinos.  Our greatest success story to share is about our dear Ruth. At age 9 she was the oldest child of 8 siblings and relatives being raised by a sickly grandmother.  When we met her, Ruth was the surrogate mother due to the grandmother's health.  She told us that she wanted to be a doctor.  However, she had missed so much school to care for the younger children that it was doubtful that she would get beyond the 3rd grade.  Sponsorship gave her the determination she needed.  And despite multiple hardships including the death of her grandmother and losing her home in 2010 due to the flooding of Lake Managua Ruth never gave up on her dream.  She was accepted at a private Catholic high school on scholarship and for the past two years has been 2nd in her class.  We are pleased to say that my husband and I will be traveling to Managua in November, 2013 to be in attendance when our Ruth will be the first in her family to graduate high school.  She has also been accepted at the University of Managua.  The principal of her high school believes that she has the drive and determination to continue on to medical school.  
Unbound	186501	3	/users/profile/243511	Shirley Foley	Volunteer	5	10/31/2013	I have been sponsoring a child in Bolivia with CFCA  since 2007 and visited my child in 2009 with a group of sponsors  on a Mission Awareness trip.  This trip coincided with my birthday and it was the best gift that I have ever received.  Meeting my child, Kevin, was a very beautiful and moving experience.  When we hugged, my eyes filled with  tears of joy and thanksgiving for the gift of sponsorship of this beautiful child.  We spent three days together with the group visiting homes and the different projects funded by CFCA. We could see the wonderful work and results of CFCAs sponsorship everywhere and we felt the effects that sponsorship had on us.   The people touched our hearts and we learned from their love and generosity.   Everywhere we went, we were met with welcoming banners, music and dances, handmade gifts and flowers, and the wonderful warmth and love of the people.  My child and my Bolivian friends have a very special place in my heart.  Their faith, love, and hope inspired me during my visit and continue to inspire me.   Because I believe in the mission and goals of CFCA and have seen first hand  the difference that CFCA sponsorship is making in the lives of our sponsored friends and in our own lives,  I am helping to do outreach for more sponsors to share in this wonderful work. Shirley Foley Click here to Reply or Forward
Unbound	186305	5	/users/profile/94648	Charles Proesel	Donor	5	10/31/2013	I have been sponsoring through CFCA for about fifteen years. Currently my wife and I sponsor six children and one aged person.   There are several areas that, in my mind, set CFCA apart from other nonprofit organizations.  The first is the percentage of each dollar contributed that goes into programs rather than administrative costs.  CFCA has one of the lowest overhead percentages of any nonprofit.   Another area that sets CFCA apart is that it is a sponsorship organization.  The money I contribute goes to support the people I sponsor.  I get letters and pictures from my sponsored children.  The letters are individual letters, handwritten by those I sponsor and translated for me by CFCA.  We also write to our sponsored friends.  We get to know them and they get to know us.  We  know each other as individuals and families.    Another thing that sets CFCA apart is that the sponsored child, if of school age, must be in school to receive benefits.  A core belief of CFCA is that education is essential to help lift people out of poverty.  Part of the benefits for many children is tuition, uniforms, a new pair of shoes each year and school supplies.  If the child drops out of school, they are dropped from the program.  That is a very strong incentive to stay in school. The final aspect of CFCA that really impresses me  is that CFCA has MATs (Mission Awareness Trips).  These MATs  allow you to go to many of the countries that CFCA works in.  While on these trips you get to learn about the culture of the country along with the conditions that many of the poor live in.  But best of all, you get to meet your sponsored friend.  I just got back last week, October 2013, from a MAT to El Salvador.  While there I met with the three children I sponsor there along with their mothers and siblings and the elderly woman I sponsor.  I have seen them and listened to their  mothers express to my wife and I  how having a child sponsored  has made a difference in the lives of everyone in the family.
Unbound	186119	3	/users/profile/243099	Heather126	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Our family began sponsoring a child just over 4 years ago.  We love to send and receive letters and pictures and know that we are praying for the other.  This year will be our first time volunteering at a parish to encourage other people to say YES to sponsoring other children around the world.  At some point (hopefully not too far in the future), we would love to take our young boys on a trip to one of the countries where children are served by CFCA.
Unbound	186057	2	/users/profile/243039	kbn2013	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	My husband and I sponsor three children, two in Kenya and one in Honduras.  We have been sponsoring for four years and love receiving letters and pictures from all of them! We hope to have the opportunity to go on a Mission Awareness trip sometime in the near future to see the work happening in communities first hand.  This year we hosted a "sponsorship weekend" at our church in Houston. The staff at CFCA was very easy to work with and helpful in preparing for the event. At the end of the weekend, 84 children and aging were sponsored! The 84 people who were sponsored that weekend have had their life changed!
Unbound	185911	6	/users/profile/242881	Michael212	Donor	5	10/30/2013	I have been a CFCA sponsor for about 16 years. I have sponsored many children from several different countires. What led me to continue donating to CFCA year after year was the way CFCA handles the contributions, the impact they have helping many in need through out the world and the way they treat sponsors ( like a close family member). Like many people that give to charities I like that CFCA uses a very high percentage of the money contributed in direct benefits for the person (and family) being sponsored. The 93 to 95 percent range is very pleasing to me as a sponsor. I trust them 105 percent!!! Also, any time that I have had a question, concern or maybe wanting to give additional assistance to those that I sponsor CFCA was very quick in giving me a response. I also like that CFCA works with the mother and father of the sponsored child and will organize activities or training programs to help them improve their lives also. I like that CFCA is concerned about the elderly and has sponsorship of the elderly also. CFCA offers trips for the sponsors to meet the person/family that they are helping. The trips are typically with a group of 15-30 other sponsors, some translators and local staff members. What an amazing trip they are! CFCA also will organize an individual trip for a sponsor, that is helpful for those with only a few days of vacation available. I have use both formats and they are both great trips. I was impressed with CFCA that I became an advocate and volunteer for them about 6 or 7 years ago. I've enjoyed every minute of that time. Being involved with CFCA has brought me much happiness and joy in my life. I cannot imagine how my life would be different now if I never had decided to sponsor. I learned several things about the wonderful co-founder Bob Hentzen and for me it changed my outlook on life in general, how I view those in poverty and that we walk with them and not ahead of them.

My family has been sponsoring a child from the Philippines for the last four years. My daughter loves corresponding with this child and hearing news from her life there. CFCA is an easy and trustworthy way to contribute to the Christian global community. For a dollar a day, you transform the life of a child and family in need.  
Unbound	185823	2	/users/profile/242795	mrsbeeline	Volunteer	5	10/30/2013	WE have sponsored 12 children/and seniors in the past 8 years.  We have had the opportunity to visit our sponsored friends in Guatemala, Bolivia, Kenya, India, and Honduras.  That was a wonderful way to connect.  We were also able to see first hand how the projects work and meet the staff who are doing the "boots on the ground" work in these communities.  We support many non-profits, but feel that CFCA gives us the best opportunity to connect directly with those we support.  We have also been able to "tell our story" by assisting priests at weekend presentations at parishes in Wisconsin. The staff and volunteers at CFCA could not be more helpful@
Unbound	185714	2	/users/profile/242680	errnccrn	Volunteer	4	10/30/2013	I have been a CFCA sponsor for 13 years. I have sponsored 4 children in Venezuela and 1 in Guatemala. I have traveled on 6 trips with CFCA to visit my sponsored children. The trips are very affordable and a wonderful way to be immersed in the culture of the country. The CFCA staff in Kansas City and in visited country are very available and attentive to any needs. I really discovered how far the money I pay each months goes when I visited the countries and saw the programs that CFCA has put in place to help the sponsored children and elderly and also the families. In addition to the benefits the sponsored person receives I saw how they work with mothers groups to empower them in their communities to have a voice in making a better life for the family. Families are encouraged to become self sustainable through programs and also with help to get projects going such as receiving a sewing machine and other means by which they might be able to receive income for their families.I specifically remember one mother who had received assistance from her chllds sponsors to build a liveable home. She said that she felt like it was a gift from God and she needed to give back. She opened up her home for after school tutoring since so many of the children get a late start in school. I cite this as an example of the principles of CFCA of encouraging families to also give back as they become able.I meet young adults who grew up as a sponsored child and are now giving back some of what they received by working for CFCA . Sponsored teenagers are volunteering their time to work with CFCA programs.I feel like my life has been immensely enriched by being able to be part of CFCA.I cherish the letters and pictures I received from my sponsored children.I have great respect for the privacy policies of CFCA. I feel the children and families receive the same privacy as I do since all communications go through the CFCA office
Unbound	185355	2	/users/profile/242317	AbbyC	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Sponsoring a child through CFCA has been a life transformer for the entire family.  We have sponsored a boy in the Philippines for almost 5 years now through CFCA and have realized how giving to this nonprofit transforms not only his life, but ours as well.  We have become more generous with our time, talent, and treasure because of this experience.  My children have learned to Love God by loving others---especially those less fortunate.  It has been amazing to see my kids live their faith through their actions to pray daily for our sponsored friend and his family, to communicate with him about his life, and to be more giving by helping to spread the Good News about CFCA.
Unbound	185350	3	/users/profile/242312	Shelby V.	Donor	5	10/30/2013	My first experience with CFCA was when I traveled to San Lucas Toliman, Guatemala in 2007.  Our group was able to meet the CFCA director of the local project, Fr. John Goggin.  Fr. John gave us a tour of the local CFCA office and told us how child sponsorship works.  I was so impressed by the humble office setting. It was very obvious that the donations that CFCA receives are not used for overhead!   Our group was given a set of bios of children who were waiting sponsorship.  As we read through them we were moved to tears, reading of their families' financial situations and difficulties.  I chose to sponsor a young boy named Eddy, which was my father's name.  The next day we met with Eddy and his family.  As more members of our group chose sponsors, more meetings were set up.  We all agreed that sponsoring children was the highlight of our trip.   As the years have gone by I have made more trips to Guatemala and each time I have met with Eddy and his family.  It is like having another child in our family.  We also sponsor two other children whom I have never met.  They share photos and letters with our family, allowing us to be part of their lives.  I hope everyone has a chance to take part in this wonderful program.

I have also recruited one thousand families to join our mission in helping the poor of the world.  We have been sposoring for 10 years and sponsored a second family 8 years ago after I travelled to Nicaragua and see the good works this organization does.  I even volunteered in Mexico on my last trip.

I looked at my husband and said she is the one.  We have been a sponsor for10+ years and have sponsored another since.  We have a boy and a girl and my husband has been able to go on four different trips to meet with our children.  He was able to spend time with our sponsored child.  You hear about these other organizations and you never get to meet your child.  Not CFCA, we have been blessed with a girl from Nicaragua and a boy from Mexico.  We receive great letters and send letters and they are translated for us so we can communicate with them.   Great organization and we also have helped in promoting sponsoring kids at other local churches besides our own.  Kyle StackTrenton, Michigan    
Unbound	185243		/users/profile/242198	Michelle192	Donor	5	10/30/2013	Sponsoring a child through CFCA has been one of the most rewarding things I have done in my life. Building a relationship with a child in the developing world has been a humbling experience and has helped put my own life in perspective. I constantly look forward to the next letter that will come from my little boy in Bolivia. I feel proud to help him meet his basic needs and I encourage him through my letters to strive to accomplish great things in his life through his education and hard work. I know I would not have the opportunity to do this for him without CFCA's dedication to the poor across the world. 
Unbound	184985	1	/users/profile/201133	Lj I.	General Member of the Public	5	10/29/2013	Our family became sponsors ten years ago when we were introduced to CFCA during an outreach at our church.  We have watched Miguel grow from a shy, sickly, sad, little boy of 5 into a dynamic, healthy, studious, motivated, young man of 15 who is devoted to his family and is an active participant in his school and community.CFCA has exceeded our expectations from the start. We were inspired by the amount of effort the staff takes in writing letters for the children that are too young to do so themselves, the individual attention each family gets and the respect and dignity that is afforded the families and their communities. Anytime we have a question or a special request we have been greeted with enthusiasm and professionalism in every way. As this was our tenth year sponsoring Miguel and his 15th birthday we wanted to coordinate a very special gift for him. CFCA staff in the USA worked with Miguel's sub project in Guatemala and  the gift was arranged !!   I love the changes to the CFCA website over the years. The newest feature of being able to write your sponsored child or adult and include a photograph through an E-letter is fantastic. I particularly enjoy the newsletter we receive with stories and updates from CFCA communities around the globe. I am amazed at  how CFCA manages donations and is able to provide so many resources and opportunities to the families they serve in a way that creates an atmosphere of hope, dignity and love!  On Miguel's birthday,  I began sponsoring a smiling, lanky, curly-haired, 6 year old named Cristopher who lives in Ecuador under the supervision of older siblings as he is without his father and his mother has recently passed away. I look forward to sending him small, age appropriate books in spanish, cards and personal letters as I do for Miguel. I have never had a problem with the children receiving these small packages. In fact, in letters we receive we are thanked for the specific items so we always know they receive them.  Several years ago we had begun sponsoring a child in Nigeria and after about a year we were contacted by CFCA to tell us we would no longer be able to sponsor this fine young man...the reason...CFCA hands-on audits of their programs around the globe indicated that due to civil and political unrest and corruption Nigeria could no longer coordinate sponsorships effectively.  Our family was saddened by this turn of events of course, though we were at the same time thinking WOW CFCA is AWESOME in that they have the sponsors and the sponsored's best interests at the forefront of all they do !!  Join me and my family and become a member of the CFCA today !! 
Unbound	184924		/users/profile/241861	Polly D.	Donor	5	10/29/2013	I sponsor 4 children across Africa.  I love getting letters telling me how they are doing in school.  They all seem to be doing well and have goals. They make me feel like I am part of their families.  It is as exciting for me to watch them grow up as it is watching my grandchildren grow up. I have their pictures all over my refrigerator. I would recommend CFCA to anyone that wants to show Christs love to others.
Unbound	184594		/users/profile/241531	LadyRissa211	Donor	4	10/29/2013	I have been a sponsor of a little girl in India for over a year now, and I am so glad that I decided to sponsor through CFCA! Although I am not Christian, I appreciated this organization's mission and their option to let you select a specific child. While there's a lot to be said for donating money and letting it be distributed according to need, there's something profoundly moving and important about adding a HUMAN element to the transaction, and letting the sponsor and the sponsored form a bond. Getting to look through all of the bios and photographs really drives home the point that these are real children and real families, and gives you the opportunity to select one whose experience (or name, or birthday, or hobbies, or goals) resonate with yours. I think that this makes the letter-writing more genuine and less forced, and it makes the sponsor (me!) more likely to continue sponsoring, and to sponsor more people in the future. I didn't want to just be *assigned* someone to help, and CFCA let me search through a selection of faces and stories to find someone I really, truly, wanted to get to know and make her life just a little bit better. I have enjoyed every letter I've received, I love writing back, and CFCA posts great updates online - and created an awesome musical documentary, too! Although I've never taken a trip or researched too much into the program beyond my own surface-level experiences (and therefore am not well-informed enough to leave 5 stars instead of 4), I have no complaints whatsoever about this organization, and will go through them again when I am able to sponsor a second or third friend in the months or years to come.

This organization has been a great blessing for me and has really opened my eyes to the people of other countries.  There are those who would call these people poor but, I have learned that they may not have lots of money and "stuff" but, they have an abundance of love for family and for what they do have.  During 2012 and 2013 I was blessed to be able to visit all of my sponsored friends and it was such a blessing.

The one-to-one connection is truly the best part because you know where your money is going...This is a top-notch nonprofit. You'd be susprised how many nonprofits put a lot of money towards overhead, but this nonprofit gives most of the money to the sponsored people. More than 93% of your money helps the program - very few dollars for advertising and administrative. You will be impressed. I recommend this charity to anyone looking to help families living in poverty.
Unbound	177694	2	/users/profile/234275	KSMom	Volunteer	5	10/15/2013	We have sponsored an 11 year old girl in India for more than a year. My 10 year old daughter has developed a wonderful connection with her through the regular exchange of letters. These letters have not only enabled us to see how our money is changing a child in India's life, but also the life of our own daughter. Her previously numerous "I want..." requests have transformed into "I need..." as she has realized how different those two notions are when you live in poverty. She has gained an understanding of how fortunate she is. I know about 95 cents of every dollar I give go directly to supporting this child. I volunteer also at the KC offices and the staff are the most dedicated and honest you can ever meet. I know my money and the education of my sponsored child are secure in their hands.  
Unbound	166204	3	/users/profile/220788	onemomlady	Donor	5	08/26/2013	I'm writing to tell those who might consider donating to this program, to please do so.  We are now sponsoring our 3rd child, the first boy we sponsored in India lasted a few months, it seemed that the family did not choose to continue in the program, and our second sponsored child, a boy also in India, remained in the program for several years, and we always received letters and pictures from him.  We recently received a letter, stating that he was married and no longer eligible to remain in CFCA and thanked us for helping him and his family.  I then chose to go online to sponsor another child and now we are the sponsors of a very young girl in Honduras.  CFCA is a credible and worthy charity from what my husband and I have seen for the last 10 years.

I sponsor an elderly woman in Nicaragua through CFCA. $30 a month goes towards caring for her medical, food, housing and social needs. I met Juliana last July on a Mission Awareness Trip.  I was able to see first hand where my donation goes.  I was also able to donate to a special fund to provide Juliana with additional basic necessities such as dentures, eye glasses, and basic household furnishings. What a delight it was to receive her photographs with all that I provided.  The letters that she and I exchange are priceless...and the relationship we have developed is a true and loving bond. CFCA has done more for me, I think, than I have done for the foundation.  I cannot say enough wonderful things about this charity.

Last year we attended the Mission Awareness trip in Honduras and visited with our sponsored child and with many other people in various communities in Honduras.  I can tell you that I have never, in my lifetime, witnessed such gratitude nor experienced something more rewarding.  CFCA is a professional, well run organization and it is my understanding that it doesn't sit on received donations and build a giant nest egg to win a five star financial rating, but instead utilizes donations to help the impoverished.  I witnessed first hand faith, hope, love and charity through the actions of CFCA working to better the world .  I will never be able to put into words the good that I witnessed CFCA perform in Honduras, but based on my experience I am forever committed to helping this charity.  Thank you CFCA for contributing absolutely to the greater good.

I am also the primary coorespondent to a 10 year-old boy in India, that our church sponsors. I am overwhelmed on a daily basis as I visit the CFCA website and their associated blog page to read about the heartfelt experiences of the sponsors, staff, and the sponsored friends. My Mission Awareness Trip (MAT) to the Philippines intensified my admiration for CFCA's efforts. You can not go on a MAT and not be emotionally effected when you visit your sponsored friend's family and home and they show you the letters and pictures you have sent over the years. While there is great joy in meeting your friend(s) there is also the reality of their situations...it is eye-opening. The good news is our monthly contributions go a long way to improving their situation. I also learned CFCA will assist sponsors, if they are willing to contribute in other ways to assist their friends. My wife and I donated money to our sponsored friend in India to buy a sewing machine so the family had another way to generate income.  They also helped us buy a guitar for our kids in the Philippines.  My church just began sponsoring a boy in India and I'll be going on the Oct Mission Awareness Trip to visit him and our family's sponsored girl. I am so pleased that CFCA arranges these trips which enables our relationship with our kids to blossum.  God bless the children and aging helped by CFCA and God bless the CFCA staff around the world.

Rita and I were both overwhelmed at the way we were recieved, never have I recieved so many hugs and kisses of love out poured just for being a sponsor. I pray that some one will se this reveiw and be apart of this great mission. We had met our child that we had sponsored for 6 yrs' and when we got back a year or so later the mission informed us that they could no longer sponsor in this area because of crime, we" lost" this child but we know that our sponsor ship had greatly impacted this childs life this is not the first one we had "lost" but we had visited this one in her home and met her family and knew she was a part of us.  we are currently sponsoring 2 children and we will continue to sponsor as long as we have some form of income.

Unbound	136614	4	/users/profile/182545	jane1000	Donor	2	11/10/2012	Oh boy, where do I start. I thought this charity was fine until a few days ago.  I was sent a letter informing me that the child that I had been sponsoring for the last 5 years has now moved, is out of the program and that I should select a new child. Just like that, gone forever. I have maybe 30 letters and pictures from this boy, his picture is on our mantle, I pray for him every day. CFCA let me know that I could send a "farewell" letter and they would "attempt" to get it to him, but any other communication is not allowed. Are you kidding me? I cannot even send a card to his relatives who are in the same program for them to forward. It just has made me sick, I cannot stop crying about it, and my sons are devastated.  We had diligently been saving money in a vacation fund to visit Nairobi to finally meet the boy and now nothing. What do I tell my kids? I will always worry and wonder about my foster son. Always. When I tried to contact CFCA about this, they couldn't have been more robotic and cold. It is a big, big company with a big big budget and a cold cold heart. I am sure the money we send does wonderful things for so many people, but I was looking for a personal connection with a child and after years of a lovely relationship it is just ripped away. Beware before you love someone here. I am going to sponsor someone through my local church that does outreach in Africa, I hope the connection will be honored as well as the contribution.

Unbound	118704	4	/users/profile/161415	Ken Z.	Donor	5	07/17/2012	I began sponsoring a child back in the early 1980's, almost at the beginning of the program.  He was an Ecuadorean boy who I supported until he turned 18 and joined the army.  At that time I began to sponsor an Indian boy and that became one of the joyous occasions of my life.  When he left the program several years ago, he had become a nurse and works today in an Indian hospital.  His letter of thanks upon leavng the program was so heartfelt that I will treasure until my last day.  My wife and I now sponsor two Indian boys and recently an 82 year old Dominican Republic man.  I know everyone tends to want to support the young, but I am happy to be involved in helping someone at the end of life.    We have so much and they so little.  How can we say "no"?  This is a wonderful program which keeps up in contact with our charges.  We highly recommend it.
Unbound	118355	2	/users/profile/160979	janew	Donor	5	07/13/2012	For over 20 years I have sponsored children through CFCA.  They are an excellent organization, manage their finances well and keep you in touch with your sponsored child.  Our current young man has epilepsy and may not have to leave the program so we have been able to watch him grow from a youth to a young man.  Without CFCA's help he would surely not receive the medication he needs.  I would highly recommend this organization to anyone who wants to change our world one child at a time.  If you are considering CFCA, my recommendation is that you proceed with complete confidence that your contribution is going directly to benefit a child and his/her family.

I am even more impressed than I was before, with CFCA's efficient management, seemingly "multiplication of the loaves ability", and with the numerous checks and balances all across the system to account for everything.  By everything I mean not only the funds we send but sponsorship communications and social worker visits, small mothers groups formation and micro-loan implementation, etc...Every detail is managed well.  They are able to transform my $30 a month into something so much more valuable, and I in turn am learning how to live on the ground, with a grateful and generous heart, walking with my human family half way around the world.  I love that they consider themselves to be ever evolving, not static, to create new and better ways to address needs.  Their model of social justice is one written on our hearts-- it is revealed to us through the formation of our relationships with our beneficiaries.  As others have said, now it's up to me to make CFCA better known by sharing their invitation with others, to give hope to our brothers and sisters in desperate need around the globe.  And now, I'm ready to add a few more sponsorships to my own account - join me!!
Unbound	105590	2	/users/profile/141902	Eric Cody	Donor	5	02/02/2012	My wife and I have been sponsoring children through CFCA for ten years now. We currently sponsor 11 kids in 7 countries. We've been on CFCA Mission Awareness Trips to Guatemala, Costa Rica and India, where we met a number of our sponsored children, and have also done volunteer time in Honduras. I spent a day visiting CFCA headquarters in Kansas City, KS once when I was in the Midwest on a business trip. Based on the deep experience we've had with CFCA over these years, I consider it our best choice for charitable investment. The greatest strength of this organization, in my opinion, is the quality and integrity of the in-country people CFCA finds to staff its projects. Honestly, we've never met better, more caring people. And they have guts - they have to in some of the settings they work in, as we've seen firsthand. Believe me when I say you can trust CFCA to apply the funds you donate in ways that really matter to lifting up the poor and giving them a shot at a better life. I'll confess I'm not terribly religious but I'm pretty sure God works through these people. I've seen it in the eyes of the children we sponsor.

That was over 10 years ago, and we have seen this shy little girl who never had enough to eat and wouldn't have had the opportunity to finish school now go on to college.  We were able to continue sponsoring her through college, and this coming year our sponsored "child" will be graduating with her teaching certificate.  We get the most beautiful hand-written letters from Abby, and she has been a wonderful example to our entire family of hope, happiness, gratitude and hard work.  This has been such a positive experience that we have begun sponsoring another child and an older youth through CFCA.
Unbound	97815	10	/users/profile/115434	Jim C	Donor	2	09/20/2011	As a +20 year donor  and a sponsor of a child in the Philipines, I was EXTREMELY upset when my sponsored child left the program and CFCA refused to forward my address to him.  In fact, I was shocked to learn that all these years, CFCA had blacked out my address so my child couldn't see it.   Did they ever give him my real name?   Did they confiscate the pictures I sent?   I was never able to visit the Philippines due to health problems and finances, but I wonder how CFCA handled visits to the missions.  Did they muzzle the sponsors to keep them from telling the children where they lived?   My child has now supposedly graduated from school and gone to work for a living.  He's old enough and mature enough to decide if he ever wants to contact me again, but he won't be able to, because CFCA won't give him my address.    And I can't contact him, because they won't give me his address.   CFCA encourages sponsors to get involved in the lives of the children, then they cut the strings cold turkey and expect sponsors to be happy about it!   I think if other sponsors knew this was going on, they wouldn't be too happy either.

Currently, my family and I sponsor 3 children through CFCA.  I am so amazed by how lives and places are being transformed through the work of CFCA.  Everyone involved carries out the mission in a loving Christlike manner.

We have had the good fortune to visit our sponsored children and see first hand, the work of CFCA. They are excellent stewards of our donation, using every penny wisely. I can's say enough about this terrific organization that has done so much for families in the developing world. 
Unbound	93333	1	/users/profile/107273	emmie thomas	Donor	5	07/02/2011	I have just returned from a Mission Awareness Trip in Guatemala, having traveled as an adult sponsor with 15 members of our church youth group.  Currently, our church sponsors 33 children and we had the opportunity to meet many of them and their families.  During the visit, we had the privilege of being helping hands and distributing the monthly benefits to a group of families whose greatest need this month was food and cleaning supplies.  We saw this process first hand, meeting the families and the social workers who were with each family.  It is an incredibly purposeful and committed organization.  Personally, we have sponsored 2 children since 2006.  We have met them, and  we have developed a relationship that is very special.  It is a blessing to my family and now my church to be involved with such an amazing organization.  We have received much more than we have given and we know, without a doubt, that this is working in the lives of many.
Unbound	92694	2	/users/profile/106370	Katrina O.	Donor	5	06/28/2011	I am currently a college student and I sponsor one child in Guatemala. I have benefited from sponsorship because it has made me more aware of the issue of poverty throughout the globe. I enjoy writing letters to the little girl and hearing back from her about how her family is doing, her friends and the games they play, and what she wants to be when she grows up. She has told me that because of my sponsorship she believes she will be able to attend higher education and wants to become a teacher. With sponsorship her family receives food, clothes and other basic necessities that otherwise they would have much trouble providing because her father is a seasonal worker - he works only during harvest season.

Donor	5	06/07/2011	It is an eye-opener to see how many do-good organizations are in these 3rd world countries and yet CFCA is able to make one-on-one positive changes.  Their programs with the elderly and children is phenomenal.  If you see Bob out and about - you would think that he buys clothes from the salvation army too and not the head of a $106M+ charity.  I admire his humble attitude and full-on desire to do the best for others.  I sponsor 2 kids and other relatives of mine sponsor others.  A worthwhile & effective organization getting results and keeping admin costs to frugal standards.  thumbs up!

Whether it be writing and receiving letters, traveling abroad to meet them face to face, volunteering at an informational booth, or knowing that very honest, thoughtful and frugal people are distributing the funds, I highly recommend to anyone that is interested to become a sponsor.
Unbound	89597	1	/users/profile/101913	Karen Pioch	Donor	5	06/04/2011	We have been donating to this organization since 2001 by sponsoring one child in Guatemala.  In 2007 we made a mission trip and met the child and his family, toured the facilities and saw first hand the works done by CFCA.  we promptly went home and sponsored another child.  We will make our seconf mission trip this fall.  We cannot say enough good things about the organization, their dedication to the children and aging and their vision for those sponsored.  The families truly are humbled by our sponsorship and our small amounts truly assists these very hard working people's by making dreams for their children come through.

My sister and I have personally visited their programs in Cuernavaca and in Guatemala. It is impossible to overstate my admiration for this organization. They train, enable, employ local people to build communities based on the solidest humanitarian principles. They are THE BEST!  Sheila C. Cullen

The work of CFCA has been impressive and is making a real difference in the lives of these individuals.
Unbound	88946	1	/users/profile/100655	Cindy T.	Donor	4	05/19/2011	Sponsoring the two children in Guatemala through CFCA is one of the most important things we do. The days we receive letters are the best days. It is so personal to write to our sponsored children and hear from them. It is easy to know that they receive what we send as they write to thank us. We recently had the priveledge to meet the children on a Mission Awareness Trip to Guatemala. How cool is that? To actually meet the children you are helping!!!
Unbound	88668	1	/users/profile/100007	Barth Wolf	Volunteer	5	05/12/2011	We sponsor a girl in Guatemala and one in Honduras and also sponsor two boys in Guetamala on behalf or our two daughters (they each have a sponsored friend to write to).  The relationship developed through our letters has been great, but it was magnified many times over when our whole family went to Guatemala on a mission awareness trip and met our three Guatemalan children.  I can't desrcirbe the feelings encountered when meeting our sponsored children and their families.  Suffice it to say that  they are memories and emoitions that will stay with us for the rest of our lives.  The sense of connection between different cultures and different families  reinforces our belief how we are all God's children and we can all help each other.  Our sponsored children and their families gave us great gifts - the gift of their spirit of family, their smiles and hugs, and of the lovethey showed for strangers they had never met.  Our lives are better because of the relationships we have developeed through CFCA.  Plus, we were able to be with Bob Hentzen when he started his amazing 8,000 mile walk from Guatemala to Chile to visit hs CFCA projects and sponsored children and aging.  Since then we have been volunteering at churches in hopes of encouraging others to join the CFCA family.

They are truly committed to helping others.  I have even been able to visit their location in San Lucas Guatemala to meet my sponsor child.  What a blessed experience that was!!!  
Unbound	85509	1	/users/profile/95435	Erica Zinger	Donor	5	04/13/2011	CFCA was recommended to me by my mother, who had wonderful experiences with them, however I needed to do my own research before making a decision regarding which organizaion was best for our family to connect with.  After MUCH research and talking with others, we joined CFCA almost 10 years ago!  It has been such a blessing to our family to be able to help provide for the needs of others in a manner that's efficient, honest and trustworthy.  We have been able to sponsor 2 children, one of which we've had since the beginning, so it's been AMAZING to watch him grow, as our family grows also, now with 2 children of our own.  To learn of their struggling environments, and to hear how much they (sponsored children) appreciate simple things like medical treatment, school supplys, an education, etc, has been very humbling to us, and makes us realize how much we are needed.  As Americans, it's so easy to take simple things like those for granted. Receiving letters and updated pictures of our sponsored children is wonderful and I believe whole heartedly in CFCA and their integrity.  They've always been enourmously helpful and easy to work with.  They enable people like you and I to get involved and be Jesus to those in need.  Thank you CFCA for all that you do to help others!!!  
Unbound	85156	1	/users/profile/94817	Katie Brady	Volunteer	5	04/11/2011	I had an incredible experience on a mission trip in El Salvador through the Christian Foundation for Children and Aging.  It was difficult to see some of the extreme situations of poverty that these people lived in, but serving them and building new houses for them brought a lot of joy as well.  In all of the communities we visited during our trip, we were constantly surrounded by so much joy and love!  I loved playing with the children because they are very cute and so open to strangers.  It is not like it is in the US, where kids are afraid to go up to people they don't know.  the children and adults alike are just so ready to love others even though they may not know them at all.  Also, I was impressed by how simply the people in El Salvador live their lives.  They are not as attached to material things as many people are in the US.  They are not caught up in technology all the time and many do not even know all these little gadgets and gizmos exist!  Even the simplest device like a digital camera, is fascinating to them.  Once they figured out that their face showed up on the screen they wanted a million pictures taken of each one of them.  Those children are precious and I miss their happiness, joy, love, and laughter! I learned so much more than I expected to while on this trip and I am so glad I took the steps to be able to attend!  It was an absolutely life changing adventure and I would recommended it to anyone who truly wants to serve those in need.

I am currently sponsoring 2 children, in Guatemala and Honduras.   Besides the original  folder and annual pictures  (and of course, wonderful letters), I received a picture of the family of the boy in Guatemala for Christmas.  It was so special to meet his family that way!  CFCA hosts optional Mission Awareness Trips for sponsors to visit the country, learn about CFCA's work in that area and the local culture, and meet the sponsored child and some of his/her family, spending a day with them.    I have been on 2 of these trips, taking each of my sons.   They were awesome!        Bob Hentzen, the CFCA president, lives in Guatemala.   He knows and loves the people in all of the countries CFCA serves, and is immersed in the work of the organization, as evidenced by his current walking pilgrimage from Guatemala to Chile in solidarity with the people they help  (a total of over 8000 miles, in about 17 months).

Unbound	84997	1	/users/profile/94535	Brady Sutton	Volunteer	5	04/07/2011	For years I dragged my feet when considering sponsoring a child.  A lot of the charities doing that seemed manipulative to me.  Then, a priest came to my church to describe CFCA and his experience with it.  I was sold.  My family and I sponsored a child immediately.Although my first sponsored child had to leave the programs for reasons of his own, we took on another child with no hesitation.  My family and I look forward to the letters from our sponsored child.  I also enjoy the email updates I get.  They come fairly often, but don't overwhelm me like some email lists I belong to.
Unbound	84936	1	/users/profile/94407	Bobbie Mehler	Donor	5	04/06/2011	CFCA allows me to see what my donation is acutally doing. I have been sponsoring a boy in India for 7 years.  I receive at least 3 letters from him per year and one picture.  The first 3 years there were no smiles on the pictures, now he smiles so big and is dressed so nice with clothes provided by the hostel, were he lives and goes to school, due to living so far from the hostel.  Because of my sponsorship his room and board, his clothing, his schooling and a compensation for his family is taken care of. He also gets to celebrate his birthday and Christmas through my sponsorship.  He and his family are so very greatful, as he mentions in his letters.  He tells me about his schoolwork, and how he is doing.  He promises me he will work very hard in shcool to show me how happy he is to be there.  He tells me about his sisters and brother and mom and dad, what their home is like, that they now raise a few pigs, and when he goes home he helps his father work in their small field.  They live in a grass hut, with a dirt floor, no electricily or running water.  His letters are signed "Your loving friend."  He draws a beautiful picture on everyone of his letters.  I am so excited when one of his letters comes. His letters, and those to him from me are all translated by on of the staff at the hostel.. I am so amazed that CFCA can organize all the corespondence that travels between the sponors and their child or adult, and send out the yearly pictures.  This is why CFCA is the best charity.  You can form a bond with the person you are helping and actually see what your donation is doing. Hundreds of dedicated volunteers work at the CFCA headquarters in Kansas City, and one of it's founders,  80 year old Bob Hentzen, is now walking 8,000 miles across Latin America to encourage sponsorship.

We were extremely impressed by the professionalism, enthusiasm, and dedication of the CFCA staff in making a difference in the lives of the children and aging who are beneficiaries.  Children receive an edication and have their basic needs met for only $30 a month.  After high school they may attend a university or a trade school, whichever is more appropriate.  They become self-sustaining.  During this time, a relative (usually a mother) is involved in a Mothers' Group providing support to each other and re-inforcing the importance of education.  The mothers are also taught a marketable skill to increase their financial independence.  This foundation provides hope to those who most need it and helps them plan to change their futures.

It has been a very, very rewarding experience and we receive regular letters and photos from the children telling us how they are doing, what is happening in their studies and in their lives in general, how they are benefiting from the sponsorship and even how it helps their families, too.  We display their photos in our home like we do of our own children.  They call us their "parents" and they are definitely our children and we are proud of the accomplishments they report to us!

We were totally appalled with the the good work being done by CFCA.  We visited senior citizens who were helped with their daily living expenses as well as having a picnic sponsored by CFCA where the seniorswere treated to a chicken dinner, games and entertainment supplied by the local police dept. One blind senior came to me with a friend to ask if she could hug a sponsor. That is all she could return to us for the good work of CFCA.  Everyone knew Bob Hentzen, President  of CFCA who was with us and much love was expressed for him, in his hand me down clothes and old boots. We visited a rural childrens school for their monthly birthday party for all the children where they enjoyed cake and soda as well as games.  Bob sat on the floor and sang songs with the kids while playing a borrowed guitar. Parents expressed great thanks for the sponsors and one little fellow gave each of the sponsors a marble to show his appreciation.  The parents of our child insisted we vist their tiny home on a hillside where they gave us cake and coffee.  They expressed their many thanks for the help we had given them in allowing their son to attend school and prepare for a trade.  We visited the workshop  for mothers where they were taught personal coping skills, sewing, hairdressing, etc. while their children were attended to in a day care room. we visited a hospital for children where first level medical care was provided as needed. As we left to return home we were showered with hugs and goodbyes.  A wonderful experience I have never seen before.
Unbound	84770	2	/users/profile/94142	Marilyn Catlin	Donor	5	04/04/2011	I was always skeptical about charities that said they would give you a picture of the child you could sponsor.  I thought to myself "Oh sure, this child's photo is probably in every city."   But that's so not true with CFCA!   I became a believer of the power of the one-on-one match when I started getting letters and pictures from my boy in the Merida, Mexico project.  But the real impact that this most wonderful organization has on changing the world one person at a time came totally to light to me when I went on a Mission Awareness trip to Merida.  I got to experience first hand what life changing work this organization is doing.  I got to hug my little boy and his whole family.  I cried with his mother as she told me what a difference my sponsorship has made in their lives.  I am no longer a skeptic but a whole-hearted believer!!   The idea of each of us lighting one little candle to make this world a brighter place is so true with this program - my hope is that thousand more will light a candle too!

I have been blessed with great support from the offices in Kansas City.  Their call centers have always supplied me with answers if I didn't know something.

Unbound	59041	4	/users/profile/63490	Amy K.	Donor	4	12/23/2010	Christian Foundation for Children and Aging is an amazing charity.  It is a charity to which you truly have to be dedicated and in whose mission you must really believe. Although I occasionally give $10 or $25 donations, most of my donations come from the $30 I give every month. This provides for:-essential benefits such as food, clothing, home repairs and health care.-educational needs such as school supplies, uniforms, tuition and other school fees.-recreational activities and Christmas and birthday celebrations.-literacy training and livelihood programs for parents.My sponsor child is able to receive all of these for a relatively low cost on my part.  At least twice a year, I receive a letter from my sponsor child, who lives in Guatemala. I recently received a Christmas card, and well as a letter thanking me for a birthday gift I sent her. She is always very polite and grateful, which makes me feel like I'm actually making a difference in her life. I also receive a photo of her annually.  I know that there are many many more people out there living in poverty than my sponsor child, but CFCA does a great job putting a face and name to a child or elderly person who is living in poverty. This strengthens the connection between the donor and the organization because the donor feels like the organization is doing real work that helps real people. Overall, Christian Foundation for Children and Aging is a charity I would highly recommend.
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	188594		/users/profile/246119	Cicichen	Volunteer	5	11/14/2013	SASEF is a great non-profit foundation that promotes education of children safety in the world.  My daughter is helping the SASEF to edit and proof-reading the V-sign document that SASEF is promoting.  We  were reading the documentaries/stories in the SASE website and we were deeply touched by the work they are doing.  As a parent, I absolutely applaud the efforts of SASEF to raise the awareness of child safety and to promote the V-sign as a world language to recognize potential child victims. It is a great foundation for HUMANITY! 
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	186384		/users/profile/243389	JeffMcQ	Board Member	5	10/31/2013	The loss of a child is something no parent should have to go through; but it is not only the parents that are hurting. Sometime a parents grief is so deep they do not see the other people in their childs life that are also touched. Immediate family is the easiest to see, brothers and your spouse or step-parent; then aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents. Then the childrens friends, some of whom the parent may not even know. The Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation thought TMMAF, has helped this family extend the memory, love and positive outgoing attitude of one lost child and extend the reach to over 5000 other children around the world so that they may know love, music, education, hope and optimism.  The joy from giving, knowing that this lost child would be thrilled to see the positive impact SASEF has  in many other lives is outstanding and refreshing beyond words. I believe that you dont have an impact on only the one person you see, because behind every individual are many others that also feel your actions and words. Thank you SASEF and The Todd McQuillan Memorial Arts foundation for making a difference in over 5000 lives directly and thousands more indirectly.

A child's safety is probably one of the most important needs in the world today.  The "V Sign" is so significant to children's safety world wide and will ultimately save hundreds if not thousands of kids lives.  I applaud the determination and tenacity which SASEF has displayed in order to achieve world wide recognition to assist others with education, safety and a better quality of life.  I met the director of SASEF, Rhonda Staudt, in Liberia, West Africa where she was actively involved with helping many people not only there but throughout the world.  She is truly a gift from God for so many people.

Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	184362		/users/profile/116795	Raquel Oberst	Volunteer	5	10/29/2013	Since 2006 SASEF has definitely been transforming the way I feel about the world around me as a volunteer. It has made me a stronger person and allowed me to explore new concepts and build long-lasting friendships. SASEF has taught me about so many different subjects, cultures and people.I have met so many inspirational people and learned so many life lessons that helped me to contribute more to my community.Through the donation of books, televisions, dvd players and computers for the International Reading Corners Project in poor neighborhoods in Porto Alegre, in the south of Brazil, SASEF has given children and students the opportunity to explore so many different fields and opened new doors for their lives and futures.Through projects, workshops and weekend trips SASEF has given a lot of children, teenagers and students a different view about the world and its possibilities to have a better chance in life and the opportunity to discover new things, like as new ideas and conceptions of who they want to be and how they want to go about achieving that and facing opportunities in obstacles.Our projects have not only made them aware of their human potential, intellectual and social abilities but also indicated and revealed them a better idea of their future career path. The new project Stop Trafficking Children and Youth The V Sign, a Universal Hand Sign was created specifically for children and youth. The V Sign equips children and youth with a real tool to self protect and possibly prevent their being stolen or trafficked.  The V Sign can also used as an SOS alert for a child or youth who has been stolen or trafficked. I am very grateful to SASEF for all those opportunities, indescribable feelings and extremely valuable experiences!
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	155227		/users/profile/116795	Raquel Oberst	Volunteer	5	04/17/2013	Since 2006 I have been taking part in Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation  projects in Porto Alegre, Brazil, Our goal is provide safe spaces for reading and encourage children and young people to go further in their lives through education. SASEFis giving children and youth a chance to go to school, find a job and create a better future for themselves, their families, future generations and the global community. We built around 3 libraries and one  computer center, like at YACM-Vila Restinga Olmpica, at Vila Novo Chocolato and at Vila Cruzeiro in Porto Alegre, Brazil and are developing youth employment workshops.  Being part on SASEF's projects makes me understand and respect all the cultural differences and opinions and fight prejudices. I do believe that only through education we can make a difference and put an end on poverty and social gap. Nowadays I do not imagine myself without taking part on SASEF's projects. I meet a lot of great people and have the chance to kwon new projects and take part in it.To help more and more children in my country,  Brazil, where the criminality is very intense and the number of drug addicts is extremely high is a big challenge, but I'm sure supporting and providing educationis the onlyt way to make a better world for children and youth.  When I see children reading books for the first time in their lives In the libraries we arranged,  I feel really happy and satisfied, because we can change their lives with books!!! SASEF is a great nonprofit organization and is developing wonderful social projects around the globe. I'm happy to have the chance to make a difference in the world - maybe small, but really from the heart!

Coming from Liberia, one of the poorest countries in the world, I am today living my life long dream of having a better education in the United States because of SAEF. SAEF is an organization of wonderful and amazing people whose only objectives are helping others and I am proud and honored to be part of the SAEF family.
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	184019		/users/profile/54350	daniely	Board Member	5	10/29/2013	I have always wanted to work as a volunteer, but until I join SASEF, I couldnt find a NGO in which I could really help children and be part of a such life changing experiences! With the International Reading Corners Project, we saw children from very disavantaged districts have their first contact  with books and movies, feeling more loved, working them on their self-steem and how they deserve the best in life.SASEF helped so many children in my hometown, doing a remarkable work in Porto Alegre. In addition to the International Reading Corner, SASEF helped also teenagers to find their first job as trainees.The SASEF Family is all over the world, and we are always in touch with each other and we exchange lots and lots of experiences which also helps us doing t better work on site.  Due to all this, I truly believe SASEF is a great non profit organization and has been doing a wonderful job!!! 
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	53266		/users/profile/54350	daniely	Board Member	5	09/24/2010	I started at SASEF helping a little bit to connect his nonprofit to other NGOs in my hometown. The work developed by SASEF was so prefessional and seirous that I decided to help it more and more.When we wrote together the Library Project and brought partners like Germany Consulate, UNESCO and YMCA I felt really happy. But the greatest moment was to see the 1st library opened, with over 500 books, DVDs, toys and love:the children reading and getting excited with the books was breathtaking to me. Until today I remember the look on their faces. Now we are building another one and I think the feeling will be the same. One of the more inspirational moment we had these past days was the news that one of our boys was hired in a great Hotel:his first job and we are part of this for we helped him with workshops and curriculum. Working for SASEF has been quite a journey: the love we feel for avery single member and volunteer are very strong, although we do not know each other in person, but we know by heart. I truly belive in SASEF's mission to erradicate poverty, one child at a time.

Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	183203		/users/profile/240107	martavoelcker	Client Served	5	10/28/2013	Sasef has been of a great help to our social center. Through the donation of computers, TV and books they have strengthened the centers' library and supported the creation of a media center and computers room for the teenagersn from Vila Cruzeiro, a poor neighborhood in the south area of  Brazil. These equipments enable our work to empower youth at risk through after school courses and activities fundamented in authorship, communication and collaboration.We are  happy that SASEF had the vision to support  such initiative that we consider of extreme importance for youth at risck.
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	183094		/users/profile/116009	Gwenilize	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/28/2013	SASEF has been very supportive to the growth and development of Messengers of Peace-Liberia(MOP), a Non Profit, Voluntary Organization working with youth in promoting peace and development through Volunteerism since 2011. MOP-Liberias vision is to become one of the great Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) movement in Liberia and the sub-region which stands for key peace values and is not afraid or reluctant to stand up for peace and non-violence. MOP-Liberia is a conscientious objector to any form of violence anywhere in the world. During its embryonic phase, SASEF provided the impetus for the growth of Messengers of Peace-Liberia through various capacity building programs for Peace Messengers(volunteers) including the Executives and Board Members. SASEF also assisted greatly in hoisting MOP website and provided resource linkages to organizations whose mandates were in sic with that of Messengers of Peace-Liberia. Consequently,raised the profile of the organization to international standard. SASEF assisted in the promotion of MOP's three(3) online proposals on strengthening peace  clubs in Liberian schools and communities, Mentorship and Coaching Program for Adolescent Girls in Peacebuilding and Advocacy for Peace Project. Moreover, I've been greatly touched and inspired in my professional journey by the work and programmes of SASEF as  Executive Director of Messengers of Peace-Liberia(MOP). 
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	98574		/users/profile/116009	Gwenilize	Volunteer	5	09/29/2011	My first time  coming across Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation(SASEF) or knowing about this unique organization was through it's founding chair . SASEF has been working tirelessly with its support through Educational empowerment for youth in Liberia.  One major example is a one day intensive traning on organizational skills called "Raising the Bar" organized by SASEF for a Non-Governmental and Non-political Organization called Messengers of Peace Liberia(MOP Liberia), a youth group dedicated to preaching message of peace and development in Liberia. As part of SASEF's mandate as it relates to Educational empowerment, this organization has been providing support to other youth organizations in Liberia aimed at achieving the Millenium Development Goals(MDGS) for Liberia, such support was also given during the celebration of the Global Youth Service Day(GYSD 2011) in Liberia where youths of Liberia were educated on the Millenium Development Goals(Goals 2, 6 & 7) which has to do with ACHIVING UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATION ,COMBATING HIV/AIDS, MALARIA AND OTHER DISEASESand lastly ENSURING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. 
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	182015		/users/profile/238769	Sarah-Jane	Board Member	5	10/24/2013	I am so inspired by the work SASEF has been doing and continues to do. For a non-profit to consistently deliver high-quality programmes is a feat that SASEF seems to achieve with ease. This is primarily due to the great leadership provided by the Founding Chair Mrs Rhonda Staudt and the dedication of the entire Board of Directors of SASEF and SASEF volunteers around the world. I am honored to be a part of the Team.  The SASEF created initiative the V-Sign (launched in MAy 2013)  which seeks to help stop child trafficking by providing children and young people with a sign that they can use to signal that they are being trafficked, is particularly important and is gaining momentum internationally. I am 100% in support of this initiative as it is timely and goes directly to the heart of the matter by giving the intended victim of child trafficking an simple but instantly recognizable tool that can aid in their rescue. Once again SASEF is leading from in front and a number of noteworthy organizations like SOS Kinderdof are lining up in support.

Also I was well trained by them and started to attend trainings, workshop at regional and global level. SASEF is part of my life. Jacques Nginga Luanda-Angola

Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	179297		/users/profile/52408	sasef	Board Member	5	10/18/2013	For 13 years SASEF has been working to provide education and educational resources for children and youth and YES we have been extremely successful.  Last year we built two children's digital libraries which provided a safe space for hundreds of children to sit down and read a book, do homework, get help with computers, have someone to talk to and share information on what's going on in the neighborhood. Plus we provided scholarships to send six young people to college!  This year we introduced The V Sign (www.thevsign.org) a self help sign for a child who has been kidnapped or stolen.   Yes its new and we know it will take time but The V Sign will become the universal hand signal for anyone who is in trouble.   To date we have never paid a salary and continue to work via volunteers - this means every cent or every donation goes to helping children. 
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	52792	1	/users/profile/52408	sasef	Board Member	5	09/18/2010	The Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation (SASEF) is a not for profit organization and has been implementing innovative educational projects for nearly ten years.  As a grass roots organization, SASEF works very hard to raise money to facilitate our youth serving projects on four continents.  SASEF education for employment conference and workshops has literally made the way for hundreds of young people to learn what is necessary to get and keep a real job.  The project requires youth to belong to a youth led or youth serving organization or to join a youth led or youth serving organization and implement a community service project using the framework of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  To date many of our hard working young people have been hired at hotels, nonprofit institutions and in the private sector.  In partnership with the YMCA in Brazil our International Reading Corners - Safe Spaces to Discover the World has provided a FREE children's and youth library.  The library is open 6 days a week; there are volunteer tutors on site to help children with their homework.  The space also provides second language lessons and many of the students have been identified by the City of Porto Alegre as translation Ambassadors for the 2014 games.  SASEFs Todd McQuillan Memorial Arts Fund (TMMAF) has made it possible for students to receive scholarships to study art, purchased a piano thus creating a music program in a public school. This year TMMAF in support of the United Nations International Year of Youth is the sole supporter of our Making a Difference Photography Contest where young people are asked to photograph what total social inclusion looks like to them.  The contest will end August 2011 with a photography exhibition highlighting our contestants work in Brazil, Hungary, Germany, and Liberia. SASEFs Alvalon Scholarship has built schools and paid tuition for children and youth to attend primary, secondary and vocational school.  All scholarship youth who attend secondary and vocational school have a mentor working with them throughout the entire scholarship period.  SASEF is a wonderful organization building better communities by providing education and opportunity for children and youth who otherwise might not have a chance to go to school, visit a library, have a free after school tutor to help with homework, or learn the valuable job skills allowing them to become self-sustaining human beings.

Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	99598		/users/profile/29373	Julie_Dunn	Board Member	5	10/22/2011	SASEF did a really great program for TMMAF this year for kids who survived the war.  In a village called Kakata in Liberia they had the kids draw the challenges they faced in day to day life.   Because of all the violence in Liberia this workshop was a way to help these kids deal with this issue.      The project was a success and with the help of the Ministry of Gender, Ministry of Education and Save the Children to coordinate the kids, SASEF helped educate more children around the world.

Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	126973		/users/profile/54912	bedelia	Volunteer	5	10/18/2012	I know that this charity was born out of a sincere desire to see things that were wrong and turn them around.  Children from around the world need strong advocates to help them out of dire circumstances.  In this instance, SASEF concentrates on education.  So many children are not afforded the one escape route that can free them from poverty...i.e. education.  I learned a great deal about this charity when I volunteered to help run a silent auction in the Atlanta, Ga. area.  The event included many photographs taken by SASEF founder, Rhonda Staudt.  The photos were of children in an area of Africa where SASEF made a huge difference.  An idea was born shortly after that.  The idea was to get colleges and universities to allow students that were worthy of furthering their studies, but, absolutely not able to pay, to have jobs within the school that ultimately paid for their tuition, room and board.  A brilliant idea that caught on with the United Nations.  This is one of the purest organizations I have come across in a lifetime.  A donation to SASEF is money well spent.  I changed my strategy of gift giving after discovering SASEF.  I now give a donation in the name of the recipient of a gift from me, instead of a trinket.  It seems to be much appreciated by those receiving that notification.
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	53764		/users/profile/54912	bedelia	Donor	5	09/28/2010	Knowing the founder of this marvelous organization was all the impetus I needed to want to help educate the masses about the potential miracles SASEF can bring to underprivileged children around the world.Rhonda Staudt and I worked together for many years. She was amazingly skilled in finding resources and using them effectively.  She had a dream about creating something that might change the world for the better. I instituted a new policy in my family.  Instead of multiple gifts for birthdays, anniversaries, etc., I now will donate funds in their names to SASEF.  That is a gift we can all feel good about, and, best of all, they don't have to pretend to love it, all the while planning on returning it to the store. I'm a proud contributor to the look and sound of SASEF as well as adding to the fiscal needs.

In Liberia alone they have given higher education scholarships to several young people underscoring SASEF's  committment to providing educational opportunbities for young people whenever and wherever possible.The organisation, has been, and continues to, mentor and advise a number of youth baased organisationsin Liberia, inclunding Messengrs of Peace- Liberia (MOP), Calvary Empowerment Team (CET) and YOCADS, to name a few. The opening of the chilren's libary in Bazil earlier this year further underscores SASEF's committment to providing tandible educcation support facilities to youth all over the world. The unwavering drive and energy of Founding Chair, Rhonda Staudt -with the support of the Board- to ensure that the organization stays true to its madate is to be commended and clearly demonstrates that focused intent can move mountains.

Thus with development commitments established by the various agencies, both UN and Governments SASEF is also proposed to contribute  working engaged with its partners and volunteers to provide ways and catalyze attention to this fringe of society with much needs and deserves support from various accounts (Health, Education, Leisure, technical training, work and welfare etc). In this particular SASEF has been working hard in Education health, technical education by giving scholarships (Hope School of the Future 45 children from 1st to 8th grade, the 9th University), health education in terms of basic health care (Pediatric Hospital of Luanda), as technical training and preparing young people for their first job with the SASEF its partners have created the YES-Angola that serves as a database of young people with technical skills, establishing institutional contacts for sponsorship for jobs at various youth projects and develop autonomously Community scope for personal development and family."If that who do not live to serve does not meant to live" so soon I realized that it is necessary to serve so that my existence serve for something ... so influenced by the noble cause of SASEF and so I had been in a day a needed one, so I needed support from someone so that I can stand on myself in society, so as a gratitude I share the same work a bit and giving my best to an ever better world...

The work they do is a lifeline to the children they help, help that wouldn't have found them any other way, due to their socioeconomic and geographic challenges.  The drive and determination of Ms. Staudt and the members of SASEF, to see the progress they have made and the goals they have achieved, is truly inspiring!

I that especific moment SASEF had supported the criation of YES-Angola, a youth NGO that works in advocacy of youth Economic Rights in Angola, now it is a very solid NGO but all this is becouse SASEF always was there in many aspects. Still in 2003-2004 SASEF started a project with an other association, MUNDO DO Amor at Luanda Pediatric Center to raise wealth werness in wich I personally was engaged in teaching volunteerly the parents who came to see the doctor while they are in waiting rooms and corredor. Also in 2004 SASEF started supporting a group of 45 kids in Luanda sending the to school paying their scholarships for the all basical stadies which now 34 of this kid are about to finish the high school away to Universities. In the some stage SASEF bigan helping a group of 2 disabled youngs who had never had a chance to go to School becouse of their disablit but now of them is in 2nd year of College studing computer Engineering. This are only some of several examples that SASEF did and is still doing for people in Angola-Africa. For SASEF Education is the most important way out of poverty!... Through education a person is able to know the world aroung him and more important his rights and fight for them. Thanks.Luis

Snice that initial introduction I have been truly amazed at the amount of work the organisation has done for youth in Liberia and other parts of the world.  SASEF is an organisation truly committed to the impowerment of youth, no lip-service here they are the real deal. The passion of Founding Chair Rhonda Sullivan is immeasurable and I feel highly honoured to have worked with her and SASEF. A dynamic organisation that strongly focuses on holistoic youth development, SASEF's recent leadership seminar held for the youth leaders of  Messengers of Peace-Liberia was so well recieved that the young people have asked for a follow-up. The workshop was designed and facilitated by Mrs. Staudt supported by Mr Kimmie Weeks, Executive Director of Youth Action International (YAI) and Ms. Sarah-Jane Mungo, Executive Director of The Development Resource. SASEF has also formed critical alliances with key organisations that promote education and employable skills development for youth. 
Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	98636		/users/profile/117171	Mimi Ziegenfuss	Volunteer	5	09/29/2011	The purpose of education ideally is to prepare students to create themselves as fulfilled individuals who are also effective contributors to the society in which they live. Education must provide them with both written and spoken communication skills, analytical skills, basic knowledge of their world and society, social skills, responsibility, and skills that enable them to be self-directed learners. Once a student has acquired these skills, he or she can more or less teach himself or herself... Children have to be educated, but they have also to be left to educate themselves. ~Abb Dimnet, Art of Thinking, 1928

Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation	98536		/users/profile/117040	Staudtie	Board Member	5	09/29/2011	We have been volunteering for Shirley Ann Sullivan Educational Foundation for ten years.  The education opportunity this organization provides to children and youth is life changing.  Because of SASEF many children have had an opportunity to go to school, get an education and go on to get a job and even become a volunteer themselves.  SASEF is an inspiring organization made up of 100% volunteers.  Its amazing how much is accomplished with no paid staff.  This is innovative because ALL monies donated go directly to helping kids go to school, participate in workshops, attend art related activities and learn how to get and keep a job.  We salute SASEF for the great work you are doing to make a difference in so many people's lives.

This was the first time I was introduced to volunteerism as a whole. For the past twelve (12) months, I have been a member and active volunteer for this organization. During this time, I have been involved for my first time in many activities like workshops, youth meetings with other organizations, celebrations of important youth and peace days (eg. Day of the African Child), etc. During the celebration of Global Youth Service Day in April, another SASEF Youth Volunteer and I were to assign to the kids at St. Pius Catholic High School, a high school located outside Monrovia. We were tasked by our foundation to investigate the day to day challenges those children are faced with that can affect the way they perform in school. Amazingly, this school happened to be the same school I attended junior high. It felt so great giving back to my old school so early. I have also been able to travel to different parts of Liberia to carry out other initiatives.  My days of volunteering with SASEF are the greatest days of my life despite the challenges that we are sometimes faced with.

But my intention was also to get in touch with children in need, specifically in poor areas in Porto Alegre, my home town. So I got to know SASEF's projects. Since then, I did decide to take part on this NGO - which have brought me so much happiness and good experiences. I've met really nice people that are also deeply engaged in social projects. My activity as a volunteer has several facets: I help to promote SASEF's activities, I ask for donations (books), I collect the material and help to transport them to its final destination and I also take part on the library's arrangement. I try to raise awareness among people to get involved in social projects. Being part on SASEF's projects makes me understand and respect all the cultural differences. I do believe that only through education we can make a difference and put an end on poverty and social gap. Nowadays I do not imagine myself without taking part on SASEF's projects.

SASEF offered a hand of partnership that touched the lives of staffs, volunteers and participants of CET's program. As an institution looking for partnership, funding and technical assistance, SASEF provided us the technical assistance in organizational development, project development, networking, and social marketing. Our experience with SASEF leaves CET in a network of governmental, non governmental agencies, public and privite institutions and a sound and vibrant organizational structure. Our kids experience with SASEF as reflected in an evaluation questionaire at the end of a six weeks basketball and psycho-social camp, shows that the SASEF sponsored 16 children had life changing encounters ranging from lacked of idea about youth involvement community service, causes of malaria, hygiene to learning how to play basketball. More than 83 children in Firestone and Monrovia were touched through SASEF facilitation during our training sessions on some of the above listed issues. Two of the SASEf sponsored children are still under going counseling which is greatly impacting their lives. CET as an organization is really benefiting from SASEF partnership. Currently, SASEF and CET are working on a joint program to launch massive awareness in Harbel on the MDGs, focusing on MDGs 3,4,5,6,&7,8. CET staff experience with SASEF cannot be over emphasized. SASEF is currently grooming three staffs of CET through its education for employment program which is making significant impact on the lives of these staffs. As a result of SASEF, one of CET's staff was enlisted for a workshop with ChildFund Liberia as a social worker and certificated at the end of this training.My experience as Executive Director of CET in relations to SASEF is a big one. SASEF offices has been opened to me as a place of reference, coaching, mentoring and above all research. SASEF has helped me as a person identified major weaknesses in my leadership career and has provided me guidiance in dealing with these issues.

Fundamental Learning Center Inc	213025	2	/users/profile/276149	Marietta2	Client Served	5	09/02/2014	They know their stuff! Our son was identified by his 2nd grade teacher as possibly being dyslexic.  She suggested we have our son tested at the Fundamental Learning Center to confirm/deny her suspicions.  He was tested by Dr. Brian Stone at the Center.  He was found to be severly dyslexic and dysgraphic.  Dr. Stone's report, though, was a true turning point for our child's self-esteem.  Dr. Stone identified our son's learning differences but he also identified the brilliant spacial awareness and problem-solving skills our son posesses (these traits aren't measured on standardized testing.)  We feel so fortunate that our son's teacher was trained to identify dyslexia after taking classes at the Center.   I can't imagine where he would be now self-esteem-wise and academically if we would have continued down the traditional learning road.  Our son has benefitted from summer sessions with the Center (he refers to it as the "Fun Center" because he had such a great experience at the Center) and several years of after-school help by tutors trained through the Center.   We've also taken advantage of seminars such as the "Dyslexic Techies" series which helped to make us aware of technological helps for dyslexic students.  Our son is now a 7th grader with nearly all A's in a traditional school setting.  I want to stress the critical roll the Center has played in our son's academic success and improved self-esteem.  Thank you.

Without this level of commitment by the FLC, our lives as parents and our child's life would be materially less independent than they now are.   The FLC commitment to expand the potential and vision of families and teachers who are impacted by individuals with dyslexia continues to "reach for the sky" to improve, teach, and bring value to our society.

Last year I took a teacher training course and applied all I learned to my three children plus seven others.   This summer I came back to Wichita to continue my training and I learned so much!   Because of the training I have received at Fundamental Learning Center, I am the dyslexia expert in the country I live.  The classes I have taken at FLC have not only impacted our family, but the way people view this learning difference in our host culture.  The gift of helping kids reach their potential keeps on giving.  Thank you for touching countless lives!

Being a native Kansan, we return occasionally for family visits and even a semester of American school. Three of my four children were not "natural readers", but I had attributed it to growing up surrounded by a different alphabet and language.  The problem however, did not go away and I was determined to get to the bottom of their issues while we were Stateside.  I kept hearing about the Fundamental Learning Center and finally stopped by one day to see for myself what all the talk was about.  After a twenty minute chat, I learned that the Center assessed, held classes and trained parents and teachers to help children with reading and related problems.  This was the start of a journey for our entire family.  My children enrolled in summer school the summer before we moved back overseas and I took a training course to help my kids on my own.  Upon our return, I was offered a job at the International school where my children attend.  After working a year, I realized how much more I needed to learn, so I flew back to Kansas for more training!  I have wished many times that I could bring the staff of FLC over here.  The people of Kansas and surrounding States have an incredible resource available to them!

She has grown in amazing ways. Before she went she could barely read any words at all and was very frustrated and disappointed in herself. Now she can read a lot and has so much self confidence that it is a complete change. She goes to school every day eagerly and excited to learn. The environment at her school is just amazing. The teachers are kind and thoughtful and teach to the kids abilities and talents, in addition to helping them with what they struggle with, which is generally reading, math, spelling and other things that are language- related. Before finding the Fundamental Learning Center, my daughter was constantly frustrated and disappointed and had very low self- esteem. Now she has done a complete 180. She is happy, excited, and loves to learn. She loves math and is good at reading at her level. She has made friends that are peers that understand her struggles and vice versa. It is the very best learning environment possible for my child, & I am ever grateful to have found them. in addition, they also offer free parent classes to educate parents about their child's disorder and how to help and support and advocate for them. They also teach teachers how to teach children with dyslexia, which only improves our city's ability to help these children to learn. They are creating a web of people who are supportive and understand the disability and gift that dyslexia brings to all children and how these children are special and will change the world.

I had very little knowledge of the work of the corporation but after learning of their mission, I agreed to a 3 year term on the Board. I was informed that I would need to serve on one committee. After three months, I found myself on four committees, Executive, Finance, Governance, and Facilities Development. I chair the Facilities Development Committee.  During this short period of time, I have found that Jeanine Phillips, Executive Director has an enormous passion to serve the 5-8 year old children that are dyslexic and have a severe problem of reading, writing, and spelling. That passion has been very addictive to her staff as they too are highly committed to serve these young people. The teaching staff also are committed to training teachers, from the public and private schools, to teach young children in their own classrooms.  The majority of the Board of Directors are Mothers or Fathers of dyslexic children. I bring a different prospective to the Board in that I was Vice President for Administration and Finance at Wichita State University for 45 years and Senior Vice President for another 5 years prior to my retirement. Given my 50 years as an administrator I have experienced various degrees of passion for individual performances and I would place the FLC staff at the top of the class for the passion that is shown for their respective assignments. Without reservation, I would request the highest rating possible for this organization.  Roger D.

Fundamental Learning Center Inc	209842		/users/profile/272588	Plato	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/09/2014	My son was always a good student but struggled with English classes and writing assignments  I was aware that he had tracking problems, dysgraphia, and  ADD since I have a degree in education.  Each year the battle for accommodations in public school got harder.  One counselor in middle school even told me to stop asking for accommodations if I  expected my son to go to college because he wouldn't get accommodations there.  Particularly, some English teachers either did not want to grant  accommodations or provide them once the IEP was signed.  I truly felt like the educational cards were stacked against us. Initially,  I turned to the Fundamental Learning Center, Inc. to ask if they could help me advocate for my sons rights for accommodations.  The staff members I spoke with gave me the information and encouragement I needed to persevere in the IEP gauntlet.  It was also suggested that it might be helpful to have my son formally evaluated. I was shocked when the results revealed he had dyslexia.  How did I, an education major, not recognize he had dyslexia!  The answer is, highly intelligent children compensate so well that many educators miss the signs of dyslexia. Also, public school doesn't want to accommodate students who aren't failing. That's why it is imperative that parents with educational concerns seek the kind of qualified, professional help offered by the Fundamental Learning Center, Inc.  With their assistance, documentation, and encouragement,I was armed with irrefutable information that enabled me to fight for the necessary accommodations my son was entitled to. Also, the master's level course on teaching language skills  that I took at the learning center enabled me to bring him up to grade level and beyond even though I was told he would probably never be able to have the same language skills as his peers.  When my son enrolled in college, he was granted every single accommodation we asked for.  This would not have happened without the help we received from the learning center. My  son made straight A's the last two years of high school. He is now a senior at KU and still making straight A's in engineering.  It's a good thing I didn't pay any attention to the idiot public school teacher who said my son was just too lazy to do his assignments.  I know many other parents who got tired of fighting the system so they just gave up on I.E.P.s for their child. Without the help of the Fundamental Learning Center, Inc., I might have been one of them.

We signed her up for the Right Lab Academy school this summer, and we saw a dramatic difference in her attitude toward school immediately.  "It is FUN!" she would say when I would pick her up each day.  She is involved in multi-sensory learning all day--which means that she is not sitting at a desk doing worksheets, but moving about and learning with all of her senses.  She has had a lot of trouble learning to read, which is why we signed her up, but I feel that the total experience of the school is going to be much more suited to her learning style.  We have only had six weeks or so of experience so far, but I am excited to see where the rest of the school year goes and how much she begins to learn and grow with her "peers", of which she sees as her equals.  She no longer fears learning or being made fun of because she does not "understand".  The other children are learning just like her, and it is difficult for all of them.  This makes it a better experience for each of them, as they can grow together in a safe learning place where they are nourished and not put down.

Fundamental Learning Center Inc	155789		/users/profile/206748	LSRanch	General Member of the Public	5	04/23/2013	I had the opportunity to work in the same organization with Jeanine Phillips over 10 years ago.  Little did I know how it would be a life changing opportunity for me personally.  As I continued to admire Jeanine's dedication and persistence to educating parents and the public about dyslexia, I soon found myself seeking, at the time, her newly founded organizations expertise for our own daughter.  After successfully attending two years of Montessori Preschool and a year in Montessori Kindergarten in a private school, our daughter entered a traditional setting in First Grade.  Within six months of First Grade she began having behavorial and non-compliant issues.  We were advised it may be in our best interest to have our daughter tested for learning challenges.  Fundamental Learning Center recommended Dr. Brian Stone for testing and our journey began with diagnosis of dyslexia, dysgraphia, and auditory processing issues.  We transfered to our hometown public edcuation system in Andover, Kansas and immediately began early intervention as suggested by Dr. Brian Stone and Fundamental Learning Center.  Having been exposed to Jeanine Phillips passion and attending various presentations of hers over the years, we probably had a better understanding of what we were faced with than most parents would have had at that time.  From putting an R & L on our daughters respective hands as she learned to play basketball; to using coffee beans, sand, markers and paper to make visual props for learning to read and recognize letters; to labeling everything in the house so she could visually see how to spell the object; trace it with her finger; see it; touch it; read it; whatever it took to stimulate her love of learning; we embraced her creative learning style.  Today our daughter is a successful 16 year old who enjoys life; embraces others and their differences and loves encouraging her friends to be the best they can be.  Our fondest memory of this journey thus far will forever be finding various objects around our farm labeled in magic marker Mom's or Dad's as she determined what belonged to whom.  Someone now owns a Dixon lawnmower we sold labeled "Dad's".  Thank you Jeanine Phillips and Fundamental Learning Center for pushing for education and understanding of the creative and fascinating ability; Dyslexia.  MichelleS

Fundamental Learning Center Inc	140541	1	/users/profile/186738	SPED	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/16/2012	I have always had an interest in reading difficulties for students that I taught.  There are many different programs that try to address this issue and during my career it seems I may have tried them all.  However, it was not until I went to teach overseas that I could see teaching English reading and writing to Arabic students demanded a thorough knowledge of phonics.  When I returned for a summer vacation I took a course in Alphabetic Phonics with what is now the Fundamental Learning Center.  Oh, wow, I was totally lost when I first used this method of teaching students.  I cannot tell you how helpful and patient the staff at FLC were with me!  Since working there as one of their first therapists, I have taken a job working with students who have behavior and emotional issues in a special education setting.  I have also done tutoring with other students not in my classroom.  I cannot tell you how rewarding it is to see students make huge strides in reading and I always feel like I have performed this little "miracle".  I have such faith in this program and regret that more students in regular education settings are not receiving this method of instruction.  I am retiring from teaching this year and feel badly as I have a treasure trove of knowledge now that I wish I had had earlier in my career.  It has been such a pleasure to use Alphabetic Phonics and see the growth of students.  Donate and help others achieve that "miracle" work.

I thought my daughter's school issues were due to large class rooms in the public schools so I switched her to a Christian School where I was paying a ridiculous amount of tuition. After she was not improving even after being in the private school environment for 4 years, I had her tested. She was diagnosed with Dysgraphia and ADHD. When I went to the private school for help, they wanted to charge me $280 per month (on top of tuition already paid) to help her. Being a single mother, I was already making a HUGE sacrifice paying private school tuition, so the additional cost was not possible for me. I did some digging around and a good friend told me about Fundamental Learning Center (FUN LC). When I called them, they were helpful and were able to enroll her in their classes quickly. They are so good, in fact, that the private school I had my daughter in didn't even mention Fundamental LC's services to me even though they had trained all their own special education teachers at FUN LC!! They wanted all the money for themselves, of course. But when I got to FUN LC, I was notified of all the different ways I could pay and the cost was less than half what the private school wanted to charge me! I have since pulled my daughter from that greedy private school. She attends a public school and goes to FUN LC everyday after school for one hour. She has massively improved. Now that I don't have to spend half my paycheck on a greedy private school, I pay FUN LC their full tutoring fee...because I can now afford it AND because they deserve every penny of it.

I'm truly grateful this agency exists and that there's a program/agency dedicated to help.  It's very disturbing that the state or the Wichita school district refuses to acknowledge that dyslexia is a problem for so many kids.  Its also a blessing that the FLC offers summer tutoring to help the kids from becoming dormant over the summer months!  My hopes are this agency expands and offers an office on the west side too!
Fundamental Learning Center Inc	140499		/users/profile/186685	Jennifer177	Client Served	5	11/16/2012	After several year of searching and struggling to find the cause of my son's extreme difficulties in school, we finally were given the diagnosis of severe dyslexia and dysgraphia. With that diagnosis came the recommendation to go to the Fundamental Learning Center (FLC). Our decision to go there was one of the best decisions we ever made. From the beginning, they have been a steady rock in the turbulent seas of helping a child with a learning difference. When, as a mother full of fears and questions for her child, I first called them, they were compassionate and helpful, taking the time to talk with me and answer my questions. When I decided to take the Literacy Intervention Specialist Training that the Center offers so I could work with my son, I received top-rate training. Even now, as I work full-time helping learning different children, I continue to receive encouragement and support from the FLC. I know that I can take any question that I have about my teaching to them and I will receive the help that I need. My son is now in 5th grade and is reading at grade level. I credit his success to the Fundamental Learning Center. They gave me the encouragement and skills I needed to help him.

Had I not gotten her tested per his suggestion, she would be failing miserably in school. Her medical diagnosis has provided her a 504 accommodation plan for schooling and I am proud to say that in 2011 she passed the KS State Reading Assessment with a score of 100%.  All children deserve the opportunity to be successful in school, but many go undiagnosed. Brianna hopes all children can get the assistance they need to be as successful as her.

We did an event there called Artists helping Artists.  I made a promise to myself to stay in touch with the staff.  They have greatly helped me with art shows and taught me as well.  I have attended arts and crafts classes and attended my fellow artists shows.  What I love about Alcott is how they help the community.  The kids get a wide range of activities that can help throughout life.  I try to volunteer as much as possible.  Owning a graphic design company I am able to help out with plays, craft events and shows.  I highly recommend Alcott to uplift and imagine all your possibilities!

They are always willing to help with the different projects that we are working on in our community and with our PTA Council in KCK. When we needed help with our float for our parade entry, Chris was right there helping out.  They were so helpful when we needed a backdrop for our youth committee at our state convention booth.  When I needed a phone booth for our superhero installation at our neighboring PTA council, the Alcott center was once again available to us to help out with supplies, expertise and a place to work.  We also have used the Alcott center for the last 5 years to hold some of our monthly PTA Council meeting at.  They are just a great asset to our community and its families.

I would come for rehearsals for plays I was in, and then eventually began to come to hold auditions, to share my writing, and see what other artists and performers were doing.  I find myself very fortunate to have developed a relationship with an organization that encouraged art for the youth as well as for the community. It is a great place to explore, learn, and savor art. I am thankful for the time I have worked with this foundation, and hope they can continue to be a beacon in the community.

I performed in a few of their Shakespeare productions and the Alcott team treats their performers like family. I am always welcome and I enjoy coming up to the other events throughout the year. It's a safe place and I've met some amazing fellow volunteers, artists, and performers that I otherwise may not have met. There is a great balance of events for children, teens, and adults. On a more personal level, I met my husband through one of the productions we were both performing in. My stepson was able to perform in his first two real theatrical productions thanks to the generosity and open opportunities provided. He now wants to pursue theater and art thanks to the positive influences he has experienced at the Alcott. My husband and I also have a young son who loves visiting the Alcott. Chris always opens up creative art projects or play for him whenever we visit.  The Alcott also serves my neighborhood. I'm very proud that a positive and artistic institution is a part of my area. It is a great example of Wyandotte residents working hard to make their home a better and friendlier area. Due to this organization, I am more aware of being involved in local programs. They are always partnering with schools, the area food pantry, and artists to make our world better.

The husband and wife team of Chuck and Chris Green have given their heart and soul to keeping this urban arts center alive and vibrant - and it shows! The Alcott is a truly grassroots effort, which does creates challenges, but it also makes it very authentic. The Alcott is always finding new ways to bring arts to our downtown Kansas City, Kansas area. Where they find the time and energy to continue this pace, I do not know. But I do know that our community would suffer if Alcott was not open and available to all walks of life in our town. They support our neighborhoods, and those who live in them. They support youth employment opportunities; they look for leadership development opportunities; they provide holiday events for young people - so that they might enjoy safe activities; they engage their supporters in helping them with major projects. These are faithful, loyal people who love the arts and love their community. The L.M. Alcott Arts Center is a gem and a blessing!

My first exhibit at the Alcott in 2009 was a great experience.  Chris and Chuck are so enthusiastic and spend many, many hours keeping this venue alive.  The Alcott Center is a very positive aspect of the neighborhood.  Not only are they restoring life to the once empty, deteriorating, school building, but they bring in a variety of artists, performers, and neighborhood youth to participate in activities.  My mother, artist Marijana Grisnik has given presentations of her historic paintings of Strawberry Hill neighborhood of KC, KS to the youth at the center.  The youth took pride in their own neighborhoods and were inspired to do paintings .   In 2010, I underwent brain surgery for a tumor.  I could not paint after that.  I visited the center to view a Second Saturday exhibit and was encouraged by Chris and Chuck to have another exhibit of paintings.  By July, 2011 I had my first exhibit of paintings after brain surgery at the Alcott!    The Alcott Center has been a very positive influence in my life and deserves recognition.  They truly change people's lives.

The Green's are both active and involved in the local community, and their level of caring shows in the way they treat everyone who walks through the center's doors.   A couple of years ago the Alcott submitted a funding request to our local utility company. I am an elected board member, and head of the committee which reviews these requests. Our board saw the merit in the Alcott's activiteis and voted unanimously to approve the funds. These dollars have been wisely spent to offer additional classes which are open to all applicants.

L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	182919	2	/users/profile/239803	Chuck Green	Board Member	5	10/28/2013	My Name is Chuck Green. I am proud to say that I am one of the co-founders and current President of the Board of Directors of the L. M. Alcott Art Center Foundation. It gives my life purpose. My wife and I have been involved with this organization even before it was an organization. Here's our story.The L.M. Alcott Art Center or Alcott Arts Center as most know us was started in an effort to save a neighborhood school (Our building first opened in 1923 as the Louisa May Alcott Grade School, serving the Kansas City, Kansas public school system in that capacity until 1976 after which it was used as an Alternative High School and Curriculum Building) from becoming a minimum-security prison in 1999 in our mostly residential area. At the time our area was troubled with old abandoned truck stop buildings across the street from our school building and a less than desirable motel that rented rooms 15 minutes at a time.  Our community needed some hope! The founders (a group of local neighbors who lived close to the building and some other local business people) were given an opportunity to help create a positive environment in our own neighborhood. The Board of Education agreed to sell the building to an area NBR, the Central Avenue Betterment Association in that effort to bring about a positive change. This group had the building a little over a year when the original neighborhood people who petitioned the BOE to stop the sell to the prison were called upon to come back and help define a direction for this historic old school building.  We joined in and organized a fact finding committee to make sure that what ever was in the school would be something positive, that it would benefit a large variety of people and bring opportunities to the local KCK area, as well as preserve and restore our wonderful historic old building. Our committee, after a few months of searching for the best solution decided on the concept of something different for our area altogether, an Arts Center.  The Alcott Arts Center was designated as an all Arts facility in October of 2001.  The Central Avenue Betterment Association in early 2002 decided to sell the building to the Alcott steering committee (under the condition that the committee become a Kansas not for profit charity) and move back to the Central Avenue area. The committee filed for state not for profit incorporation with the help of one of Alcotts past alumnas and the attorney she worked for helped us file and receive not for profit status (approved in March of 2002) and has been know formally as the L.M. Alcott Art Center Foundation ever since. LMAACF is a non-profit 501(c)(3), 509(a)(2) Public Charity dedicated to the appreciation, understanding, and production of the arts, with an emphasis on exploring and sharing the cultural diversity within our community.  We have been in existence now for twelve years as an Arts Organization. We have awarded grants and scholarships, taught classes and workshops in several areas of the Arts, curated over three hundred Art Exhibits in the three Alcott Galleries, produced several plays at the Alcott including an annual Shakespeare in the Parking Lot series of plays and have provided space for other Arts organizations to rehearse and produce and perform in the Alcott Theater. We have partnered with several groups at public functions and have even been involved with national Arts programs including the National Endowment of the Arts' "the Big Read" program. We make sure that everyone has the opportunity to participate regardless of social or financial status.  Alcott has become a regional Arts Organization due to interaction with artists, actors, teachers, filmmakers, poets, musicians and many other artistic and down right good people from all over the area and beyond. It has been a unique challenge to start something from scratch (without any experience in this field) but it has been a great experience to be thrown into the world of the Arts in an endeavor to help save a community. Our biggest drawback is that we have a building without a working heat source. We close at the end of October each year right after our annual Halloween Trick or Treat event for all of the area children, and we open back up at the beginning of March. If we were open year round we would thrive!Thanks to all of the positive reviews from friends in the past Alcott was within the top thirty top rated not for profits organizations listed on this website (great nonprofits.org) in 2011.The area around the Alcott Arts Center has since changed from the old scary rundown place to something we can all be proud of. The city has given much needed attention to the blight and brought economic redevelopment our way. The run down truck stop buildings and motel are gone, replaced by a multi-million dollar retail development. It is nice after enduring years of the looking at the sad state of the community to be able to drive up the street and see people get out of their vehicles and move around the area safely and enjoying the new look. While we are sure that they did not bring the improvements to the area because of the Alcott Arts Center's existence, we are hopeful that they saw that we were a benefit to the greater community and that if we could make it work here, then they could too. We are looking forward to a great future knowing that we are making life a little better for some and a lot better for many. There are so many first time artists and performers that have been provided the artistic opportunities through Alcott, which has been one of the biggest blessings.  Maybe, just maybe they will go on to be world renowned Artists in one form or another, and to think it would all have been made possible because people wanted to take ownership of their neighborhood and work hard to make sure something positive happened there. Oh and by the way not only is The LMAACF self-sustaining but it has been operated and ran by unpaid/volunteer staff for all of the twelve years in service. There have been well over 40,500 hours of donated time given to this unique organization. We have dedicated the past thirteen years of our lives to help make sure that Alcott continues to serve the greater community for another 90 years (hopefully more) and help bring a Positive Cultural Arts environment to the Kansas City, Kansas area. My personnel history with the building goes back to my childhood. I went to grade school in this great old school building back in the 1960's, as did all of my siblings and my mother and her siblings back in the late 1920's, 30s and 40s. When the school was put up for sale it had been vacant for a few years with over a hundred broken windows, which had been boarded up. It looked terrible and unfortunately fit right in with the area across the street. We (the neighborhood people) actually helped organized a neighborhood watch group (ironically named the Concerned Citizens Committee of Kansas City, Kansas) back in the 1990's after many issues with drug dealers and a hooker that tried to climb in the cab of my pick-up truck with me and my two young daughters. It was at that point that we realized that if anyone was to make things in our community better, it had to start with the people most affected by the downturn, the neighbors.As you have read things are much better these days but it has been a long journey. I have been proud to have Great Nonprofits give Alcott this platform for exposure. Everyone has had good things to say about the Alcott save one. A couple of years ago some anonymously wrote a scathing review that I was floored by when I read it. I wasn't sure how to respond to something that volatile. It wasn't so much an attack on the Alcott I guess, as it was more of an attack on me and my wife Chris. If you read the other reviews on the Alcott part of this site, as I hope you will. You will see the negative review by a very hurtful and of course anonymous reviewer. It referred to an article in the Kansas City Star that was done about Alcott back in 2011.Just to clarify my position with Alcott and life as a disabled person.I have never been paid a single penny nor received any compensation from the L. M. Alcott Art Center Foundation/ Alcott Arts Center.First off, I am a retired/disabled Journeyman Electrical Lineman and was injured in a fall while climbing a power pole in 1989 on my birthday; this was unfortunately an injury that has lead to lumbar spinal fusion with irreversible spinal cord damage resulting in what they call spinal arachnoiditis. In 1993 I suffered from acute shingles attack in my eyes and across the right side of my head, unfortunately it is something that affects me to this day with severe nerve damage to my eyes, hearing and facial area over the years. The last diagnosis of my spine in 2005 was that I needed emergency surgery because the disk above the lumbar fusion was totally gone and the vertebra were grinding against each other splintering out into my spinal cord. The doctor told me at that point that he could do the lumbar surgery to fix me but that there was a 80 percent chance that he would paralyze or kill me in the process. I opted not to have that surgery. I was also diagnosed at that time with herniated disks in my cervical spine from an injury in 2003 which required emergency surgery to fuse the vertebra together in an attempt to keep me from becoming paralyzed. I havent been able to work for several years due to incredible pain associated with the damage and what I do for Alcott is the only things I do for anyone, including myself. It is a challenge to do anything physical and mentally, but Alcott is my therapy. I am not depressed because I have lost my livelihood (while I am not happy about it); I dont see a shrink and do not take anti-depression medicine.  Dont drink nor do drugs and I try to be the best person I can be. All because Alcott distracts me from my life as a person who has lost almost all of the basic abilities to live and enjoy life as a mobile person. I had to make a conscious decision many years ago, that if Im going to hurt my body any worse it would be doing things for Alcott. I dont often mow but if I have to I get on the zero radius mower, I chug along at a severely reduced speed in order keep from crying out in pain when hitting the smallest of bumps.  I get up and talk to people for a few minutes here and there because there may not be someone else that is available to speak. Im proud to do it but it comes at a price, as it is hard to talk and be able to understand what I am saying due to the nerve damage to my ears. I believe that Alcott actually helps keep me from sitting or lying around all of the time, thus keeping my muscles from deteriorating any more than they already have. We have always done our best to make sure that Alcott is a place of integrity and one that gives back more than it is given.

They told me of a place they have and there ideas of what they wanted to do to help the community. I have attended plays, art shows, speciality events and even "Trick or Trunk" nights. I have asked them to let us use the building for another not for profit and they always tell me yes. My youngest daughter has been to many of these events with me and has gotten to experience different types of plays, she was part of an art show, and loves to dress up and volunteer for trick or trunk. They have faced many challanges and always rise above and come out on top. I love there motto, my favorite part is "everything positive". I try and help when I can, I have printed off flyers for events and put them up in various places, I have donated candy and time for the Trick or Trunk nights. I also try and help to promote events when I can. I really enjoy the events that I have attended and will continue to get to them when I can. I love that they are trying to promote a love of the arts and support local artist's at the same time. 
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61611	1	/users/profile/67287	Monica C.	Volunteer	5	01/28/2011	I am the PTA Council President for our school district. We started working together three years ago. It has been a great partnership. They have let us use the building a couple of times for our meetings, we had an art show together, they did the displays and we provided the food. We try and help provide information about the plays and programs they provide for our community on our website and thru our schools. My daughter's and I have gone to radios shows, and some of the plays they have done. one of my daughter's took part in some of the art shows. My daughters attended one of the trick or trunk events and this year my 11year old and I worked the trick or trunk event. The Alcott Arts Center is a jewell that has only been discovered by a few, but should be shared by all. If you have the chance to visit this place, please do.

The Alcott Art Center was one of my first exhibitions in undergrad at Kansas City Art Institute. They couldn't be any nicer people then the people at the Alcott Art Center.
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	103288	1	/users/profile/137460	bhbarr	Volunteer	5	01/12/2012	I once took part in a New Media Art show there and the staff at Alcott Arts were incredibly kind and helpful, especially the owner Chuck. They gave us the room and respect to express ourselves creatively within a rich historical environment. This show was a really good resume builder too. I have been in many non profit art shows around the world and the support that the Alcott Arts Center gave surpassed many of those experiences. They provide great cultural events that are a necessity to any community, especially during a time where there is little support for the arts. Alcott Art Center deserves any support that they can get because they are the ones that keep hope alive for the arts.
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	103286	1	/users/profile/137451	Daniel22	Volunteer	5	01/12/2012	My first experience working with Alcott Art Center was helping my friend install his a new media art project in the building for his Senior Thesis for the Kansas City Art Institute.  The building was great, and Chuck and Chris were the most helpful and nicest people you could ever meet.  You could tell from the moment you meet them that they genuinely LOVE art, LOVE theIr building, and, most importantly, LOVE the people in their lives.  Chuck will happily tell you all about how he went to school in the building as a kid and how he has lived right up the street his whole life.  I was so impressed by the center and their eagerness to work with young artists that I had my senior thesis show at the building as well and even helped curate two different shows in the space.  After that I was eager to Help Chuck and Chris in any capacity I could including computers and video taping some events for them.  I have been involved with the arts and art centers in different states and countries my entire life so I can say with a small bit of authority that a place like the Alcott Arts Center is rare and amazing and should be supported in any and all ways possible.  I am sorry to hear about the break in, the last people in the world who deserved this were Chuck and Chris.  Thank you for everything!
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	103018		/users/profile/136550	kcmetroconcernedcitizen	General Member of the Public	1	01/07/2012	The following information is also being forwarded to the Secretary of the State and the Social Security Administration for their review and investigation into the following matters.I am writing in response to a story recently reported regarding Alcott Arts Center in Kansas City, KS.  Following an incident of supposed copper wire theft, Alcott Arts Center has now launched a campaign seeking at least $5,000 in donations from the Kansas City community in order to assist in repairs.  As a concerned citizen and taxpayer, I wish to caution any individual in our community from offering financial support to an organization wrought with unethical business practices and financial dealings.  Alcott Arts Center is a nonprofit organization.  The entire foundation of their ideology is fraudulent; while they claim to serve Kansas City, they have exploited the goodwill of patrons, partnering artists, and the community, while violating federal regulations and the publics trust.  	Chuck Green, President and Authoring Co-Founder, uses Social Security Disability benefits to assist in funding the operations of Alcott Arts Center.  Furthermore, while Mr. Green has been rendered disabled by the government, our community has witnessed his ability to contribute many working hours at the organization.  Mr. Green can regularly be seen mowing the lawn, manning events, and acting as the spokesperson for Alcott Arts Center.  This can be verified by the following attached documents resulting from a simple internet search of letters of support, some of which are from quite respectable organizations in the Kansas City community:    o	Letter of Support, 2004, Faye Greenwoodhttp://www.alcottartscenter.org/letterfromfayegreenwood.pdfo	Letter of Support, 2004, United Way of Wyandotte Countyhttp://www.alcottartscenter.org/letterfromunitedway.pdfo	Letter of Support, 2004, Minds Eye Theatrehttp://www.alcottartscenter.org/letterfromjeffmace.pdfo	IRS Determination Letter, 2007http://www.alcottartscenter.org/irsfinaldetermination.pdfFurthermore, Alcott Arts Center has claimed affiliations on their website with KC Stage and Kansas City Kansas Council PTAUSD 500, among others, and I wonder if all these organizations are aware of and support the business practices that have kept Alcott Arts Center in operation.  As a taxpayer, I am ardently against my taxes going to fund an organization when those dollars are intended and very much needed for the truly disabled in our community.  	Alcott Arts Center stated in a recent interview on television that the building was and is uninsured; yet, they host educational classes and events in the arts for both children and adults in the community.  I take that to understand should an accident or medical emergency occur in the building, there would be no coverage for the individuals involved.  This would seem an unacceptable and foolish existence for any organization, especially one serving our community.	Alcott Arts Center seems to have engaged in nepotism.  My research indicates that Chuck Green, President of the Board of Directors, and Chris Green, Executive Director, are indeed married.  If that is the case, then how can a Husband President govern a Wife Executive Director objectively and ethically?  Not to mention this opens up a world of opportunity for faulty business practices.	Alcott Arts Centers financial dealings have been questionable.  Having received $10,000+ in donations several years ago to replace a much needed boiler, the organization still has yet to make the purchase according to the news interview mentioned above.  I can only assume that money has been appropriated elsewhere, since Mr. Green is requesting yet another round of donations in the amount of $5,000 to fix the recent copper wire theft.Kansas City has a plethora of sustainable, respected arts organizations devoted to serving our community.  I would encourage those interested in donating to Alcott Arts Center to rethink their choice and seek a more established and accredited entity in the community.  Perhaps those artists seeking to donate energy, time, and talent to raise funds for Alcott Arts Center may put their gifts to better use and recognition elsewhere.  I would ask that an investigation be launched into Alcott Arts Centers operations, complete with a determination as to the veracity of its financials.  Our community deserves better than what Alcott Arts Center offers.

The people were friendly & polite; the set up was awesome & my son really enjoyed it. I think it's great that they do the trunk or treat as well as all the other activities etc. they do. I think it's important to keep the arts alive & that the arts are a great outlet for many young & troubled people. This review is my way of showing my support & love for organization & what they do. I am more than proud to have them as a part of my community; A community my family has been a part of for many many generations. Kudos to The Alcott Arts Center! Keep up the wonderful work! :D
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	97416	2	/users/profile/114343	haleycatie	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/13/2011	My daughter has had the grand opportunity to perfom at the Alcott Arts Center for Shakespeare in the Parking Lot V 2011, "As You Like It".   The experience has been great for us as a family and individually for my daugther.  What the founders are doing for the community is to  be commended and I can only hope that they are able to continue receiving donations to keep this great center going for many, many years to come.  My daughter has had the fortune to work with Director,  Dr. Susan Proctor who has first of all taught my 13 year the appreciation of Shakespeare and provided her with the experience to work beside several talented actors in the community.  Thanks to everyone at Alcott for the experience and we hope to work with you again in the future.  Sincerely,Jenny Wolff

L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	82083	1	/users/profile/90080	cskippy2000	Donor	5	03/13/2011	I first encountered the Alcott Art Center while working on a play they produced in 2004. Their positive attitude and willingness to support the arts community in every way possible was why I decided to support the organization as much as I could.  I have been a supporter and friend to them ever since. The Alcott has an open-mindedness that is becoming more and more scarce as our culture becomes more and more reserved, and the work that they display and support reflects that. They push at the boundaries of our comfort zone and make us better people because of it. When my friend, an actor and director, was horribly disfigured in a brutal attack, he needed some money to cover medical expenses. I decided to throw a fundraiser for him, and within minutes of soliciting a venue, they offered their theater space, and did everything they could to help me help my friend, who is now recovered and doing well. I don't know of any other organization that would have gone to such lengths to help a fellow artist like that. It was amazing. I look forward to continued and expanded involvement in the organization as I believe that with all they do for their community, they deserve as much support as possible. I will continue to headquarter my film club there, and I will always look to them first when planning events and shows. They deserve your support!Curtis SmithActor, Musician, President of the Kansas City Horror Club
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	62023	1	/users/profile/67788	ChrisG.	Board Member	5	01/31/2011	Im the Executive Director and Co-Founder of the L. M. Alcott Arts Center Foundation and the Alcott Arts Center. The Foundation and Arts Center came about by organizing our community to come together to save our building from being sold to an outside interest. The community wanted the building to stay a teaching institution thus the Foundation and Arts Center was formed.My involvement is; Im the go-to person, you need it, I have it, I will find it or make it happen for you. I teach classes at the Arts Center and at local schools and events, along with all of the office responsibilities and organizing events. I have been a working volunteer since we started ten years ago and I strongly believe in working and giving freely of myself to make things happen. I love working with children giving them the chance for a hands on experience in the Arts. I feel strongly about keeping the arts available to all who love or want to experience it. Putting on productions of Classics like Little Women and the Works of William Shakespeare are rewarding. To see it them evolve from a raw form to pulling off a stellar production. I enjoy the fact that we are an Outside the Box organization taking risks with controversial art and Theater productions, to show you can produce them in good taste and spot light some very talented people.Working with all the Artists, Actors, Musicians and Performers has enriched my life. Ive made many lasting friendships with some very interesting and talented people. I feel this organization is very important to the Arts Community with all we have to offer.I love doing what I do, being able to offer Art to the community. It would be great to be open year round and have the chance to offer so much more to so many more.
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61980	1	/users/profile/67737	valbaul	Client Served	5	01/31/2011	As a performing artist in Kansas City, there are not many places for someone without a lot of experience to perform.  Furthermore, there are not a lot of opportunities for a family to experience the arts together.  I have really enjoyed the Alcott's focus on the family and children and providing a community place for us to experience and enjoy art together.  Without the Alcott, my son would not have seen Shakespeare, because they have Shakespeare in the Parking Lot every summer which we attend.  Also, the Arts-travaganza every May, gives my son an opportunity to get on stage in the annual talent show.  The Alcott supports many local artists and helps them to develop shows that serve our community.  
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61917	1	/users/profile/67666	ahakc	Donor	5	01/31/2011	My organization is a new partner of the Alcott. I chose to do this because the Alcott embodies what all great art charities should be: For the people, by the people, and for the sake of art. It is run by citizens who are dedicated to bettering their community and keeping the arts alive in the process and relies solely on donations. Everyone is always made feel welcome and all art is accepted. This is a great organization and is the reason why my own organization has raised almost $2000 for the Alcott in order to keep it going.

L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61726	1	/users/profile/67432	zweaver88	Volunteer	5	01/30/2011	My first experience with the L. M. Alcott Arts Center was in the February of 2008. I was an actor in their spring play, Little Women. It was my first time doing community theatre, and I found the Alcott to be a very welcoming, encouraging environment. The only unfortunate thing is that it was frigidly cold. The Alcott has no heat source, so they only open their doors April through October. But since the play opened in April, we had to bundle up and start our rehearsals in February.      This was just the beginning of my history with the Alcott Arts Center, though. I have since directed one of their plays, and in 2010 I volunteered at most of their events. One thing I really appreciate about the Alcott is that they truly believe in giving opportunities to first time artists. I had only just turned 17 when they selected me to direct their spring play in 2009.      Another incredible thing about the Alcott Arts Center is that it is run almost entirely by two people, Chuck and Chris Green. I am nearly certain that these two people have donated more time and energy to the Alcott than all of the volunteers combined. And they are now entering their tenth year of operation. Their perseverance to keep this opportunity alive for artists of all kinds is inspiring.      I plan to be very involved with the Alcott, as a volunteer and an artist, in 2011.
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61679	1	/users/profile/67369	Jen M.	Volunteer	4	01/29/2011	I have volunteered for the Alcott Center for a year and half now. I keep returning because of the great programs available for local performing and visual artists. They put focus community and reach out to local schools. I also enjoy as an actor having a place to be a part of a production aimed at families. The Center truely cares about the people in Wyandotte County and creating access to the arts for those who otherwise would not have it.

Alcott is important to me for personal reasons... I was a student at L.M. Alcott when it was originally an elementary school and I've know Chuck Green - a co-founder, all of my life.  It is truly remarkable all that they have accomplished with so few resources.  Alcott is a true labor of love and a wonderful asset to the community.  The monthly "Second Saturday" is a wonderful event for new artists to gain exposure and experience showing their works/talents.

Not only did we enjoy the fun we had that day, but the fact that we were supporting such an amazing place made the experience that much more rewarding.  I feel honored to have been a part of it. I also have attened a play at the Alcott center that I thouroughly enjoyed.

I have performed at many locations from the barebones to the elaborate stage.   The Alcott is pretty high on my list even without the air conditioning or heat.   It's a space that absolutely welcomes in creative expression. They have top notch artists, poets, and actors there.  It's a true haven It would have a perfect rating from me if we could use it year round.
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61380	1	/users/profile/66999	Dave M.	General Member of the Public	4	01/27/2011	I became acquainted with the Alcott  Art's Center by attending an evening or art exhibits and perfrmance art during a weekend show billed as "The Flying Asbinis Traveling Sideshow Arts-Travaganza!"  It was definitely an extravaganza.  It is located in an old public school building and I started by touring numerous classrooms that had been turned into galleries full of creations by very talented local artists. After viewing the visual art I moved on to the auditorium where one after another an eclectic collection of performance artists entertained me and a room full of others with stirring acts including performance poets, dancers, musicians, a jugler and even a standup comic.  It was a variety show of a sort not commonly seen these days. Best of all the performers were not hidden away before and after their appearances.  They were available for contact with the public that had come to see them.  When acts were not performing they were part of the audience.  I made a number of new acquaintaces who not only entertained and inspired me for one night, but some have become friends who continue to encourage and inspire me in my own  artistic endeavors. The Alcott Arts Center provices opportunities for creative people in the Kansas City, KS community to showcase their talents, and it offers classes for students of all ages thereby fostering creativity and artistic growth. I would highly recommend the Alcott Arts Center to anyone who is either interested in furthering their own creative endeavors or who just wants to observe and be entertained by others. For more about my experience with this wonderful organization check out this article on my blog at:  http://aardvarkdude.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/an-evening-at-alcott-center-with-the-flying-asbinis-traveling-sideshow-arts-travaganza/

L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61368	1	/users/profile/66983	Janie Harris	General Member of the Public	4	01/27/2011	My personal experience with the Alcott Arts Center has  been very positive. The opportunity to see and enjoy live plays at its best has been incredible . Performed by actors and actresses that are keeping the arts alive in a manner that is to be highly commended. We, as a technological society are losing our core of basic arts. This basis is so important to the arts, and to ourselves, developmentally in our society on the whole. Base core arts gives us the fiber to actually communicate and present ourselves as human beings, in a more natural and receptive environment. Doubly, it builds the level of confidence needed to excel in a world that has become very competitive in public speaking and presentation. I have hopes that this organization can survive the tough times and secure funding to keep bringing such quality opportunity to those on both sides of the arts. Janie Harris
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61366	1	/users/profile/66981	Cassandra W.	Volunteer	5	01/27/2011	I have worked with the Alcott Art Center as an actor in shows they have put on and as a dancer of a troupe that was invited to perform at a fundraiser over the summer. I have always met with great people at the Art Center and the way they integrate so many forms of art to spread the word (so to speak) to the public has always amazed me. They have great varied events and are always looking to do more for their community. I hope to continue to work with them in the future. 
L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	61357	1	/users/profile/66972	Rachel A.	Board Member	5	01/27/2011	I had an idea of bringing together artists from different fields to show the connectedness of all of the different artistic mediums, be they visual arts or performance arts. When I stumbled upon the Alcott Arts Center, I knew this would be the perfect place for my event. Not only did they offer a space for so many varing arts from pottery, to theater, to painting, to dance, to videography, and everything in between, but they were always there to support each artist who came through the door with whatever they needed to make their show a success, or learn the finer details of their craft.  The Alcott Arts Center's motto, "Everything Positive. Nothing Negative." is not just a set of words, but a lense by which all decisions are focused. The nuturing environment created at the Alcott Arts Center not only gives artists the confidence and tools to hone their work, but gives them the drive and incentive to surpass their deepest dreams and push their talent to its fullest potential.  The Alcott Arts Center serves a huge geographical area and works diligently to provide an artistic outlet for children in the greater Kansas City Area, too. Offering a myriad of scholarships, classes and opportunities to children in the growing population of our city who are losing funding and exposure to the arts everyday. They produce children focused plays and events giving the children in the Kansas City Area a good foundation in the arts and an opportunity to shine. Young to old, experts to budding, novice artists, writers to visual arts, to performers, the Alcott Arts Center truly has the right level of support to help all types artists from the greater Kansas City Area and beyond flourish. With their positive attitude and the huge blanket of artists they affect on a monthly basis, I could not help but give all of the extra time I have volunteering at this marvelous organization. Not only does the Alcott Arts Center provide the means, they provide the inspiration. They certainly have for me. We are now in the planning stages of our third Flying Asbinis Traveling Sideshow ARTS-Travaganza, a festival of artists, at the Alcott Arts Center and are more than excited for the many years to come. They have afforded a venue that has allowed artists of all ages and backgrounds to grow by leaps and bounds and have helped us express the strong tie between all arts and show what we can do when artists can support each other, just as the Alcott Arts Center has supported so many artists!

L M Alcott Art Center Foundation	42048	1	/users/profile/42800	jessica20	Volunteer	5	05/30/2010	A M Alcott Art Center Foundation, commonly referred to as Alcott Arts Center is a non profit organization that is truly a treasure to the people of Kansas City.Alcott's mission is to nurture artistic talent by providing a place to teach learn, exhibit and perform in an environment  that bolsters community, and to bring together people of diverse cultures for a common cause - the arts. This is truly a mission I have seen exemplified in this first year I have been a part of Alcott. Alcott is active in the Kansas City, KS PTA and offers classes during the summer at little to no cost for the students involved - giving the children in their underprivileged community a chance to be creative. Alcott hosts a trunk or treat on Halloween, which provides an opportunity for a safe place for the children in the community to enjoy the holiday at. Alcott hosts a 'Second Saturday' art exhibit in their two galleries, which  allows members of the community of all ages to display their work and raise money for different causes. I personally feel like Alcott is a class act Art Center, and although they do not get the attention that the crossroads does, they are certainly more dedicated to artists and community than the crossroads district is. Anyone interested in helping the Kansas City, KS community head in the right direction, or anyone rooted in the arts community should take a second and check them out. www.alcottartscenter.org

Deb and everyone else involved in the organization are some of the most true and kindhearted people in Kansas City.  Variety's work has allowed hundreds of children to have opportunities that they otherwise may not have had.  I have seen, first-hand, the way that Deb and the rest of the Variety team has transformed and improved the families of these lovable children.  Thanks to Variety for making KC an even better place to live.

We've been both supporters of Variety as well as recipients of Variety's generosity through a program that benefited our son who has Down syndrome.

Variety Children's Charity of Greater Kansas City	278817	1	/users/profile/368811	Writer	Donor	5	02/02/2016	I just love all the work Variety does and especially their Director, Deb!  She makes sure there is continuous attention drawn to raising funds, bringing awareness to the public and helping these amazing kids with special needs.  Where someone might see a disability Deb see's a miracle and fighting spirit.  Deb works around the clock visiting businesses, educating the world and spreading the Variety message on social media.  This wonderful woman continuously works till she has accomplished her goal for each of her kids.  Each and every child she helps she truly loves and if you have every seen any pictures from Variety you can see the love each child has for Deb.  I've stood by her side as a child's face lit up with so much love and excitement the moment they say Deb.  In one of our planning sessions for a fundraiser, I've watched Deb tell a wonderful happy ending story about one of her kid-o's and every time she tells us one of these great story's she is brought to tears of joy. I imagine during her story she is also reflecting on the hurdles and effort it probably took to make that story a happy one but she never gives up.  The love and compassion in her heart is constant.  She inspires every volunteer she works with.  She never gives up and she makes sure that each file that comes across her desk has their need met.  These are not just files.  These are beautiful soles that need a little help getting around &/or communicating with the world.  Deb & every person at Variety makes dreams for these beautiful kids come true.

During this time, I have seen Deb, the Board and her many volunteers do some amazing things for the children in this area.  Costs of events and fundraisers are low which makes for higher margins and more money available to directly fund equipment for children who just want to have normal kid experiences.

Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	I want to share a unique perspective of how Variety of GKC works, and how a single person can make big changes in our community.  I happened to be in the room when Deborah Wiebrecht (Variety's Exec Director) took a phone call.  It was the mother of a child with special needs.  She had seen a product that would make shopping easier for her, her child and family...a grocery cart with a built in seat for larger children or adults.Deb got off the phone, quickly made another call to a major Variety sponsor (HyVee) - and HyVee aoon ordered these specialized carts for all their area stores.What an amazing display of success!1. Variety families obviously feel engaged enough to call for help and to give help2. Variety staff listens - and acts quickly3. Variety supporters and sponsors truly understands the needs and are eager to help4. The results benefit the entire community. There is nothing territorial about Variety - they help one on one and they help families they will never meet.

Variety Children's Charity of Greater Kansas City	227334	1	/users/profile/291064	Meggin	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	I cannot express in words what Variety of Greater Kansas City has done for my son, Jackson. Jackson has Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) which is non-diagnosable according to the insurance coding book. This all translates into we receive no insurance coverage for any of his treatments or therapy equipment.  SPD does not allow for great gross or fine motor coordination, hence, riding a normal 2 wheel bike is near impossible. Jackson was wanting a three wheel bike that looked "cool" so that he too could be "normal" and ride with the neighborhood kids. No charity has ever been willing to help us due to his lack of being able to be diagnosed and that the bike was not needed for therapy purposes. That all changed when I spoke to Deb with Variety. She explained that Variety is there to help with or without diagnosis and that being a typical kid was just as important as therapy equipment. A month later, Jackson was gifted his AWESOME, new three wheel bike from Variety. He now happily rides with all the neighborhood kids and has actually become the envy of them with his bike. Again, there are no works to express what a difference this has made in his life and what Variety means to us. Absolutely a blessing and God given gift!

Variety Children's Charity of Greater Kansas City	227329	1	/users/profile/256595	KCMom	Client Served	5	10/27/2014	 Jackson, age 12, was unable to ride bikes with his brother because he couldn't balance, steer, stop and pedal all at the same time.  Variety provided him with a 4 wheel pedal bike and he is now off to the races.  While he still has challenges in understanding the concept of braking, it has a bar on it that allows us to walk/run behind him and limit him on his speed and assist him in the stopping process.  He now takes 1 1/2 mile bike rides, while one of us runs along side him.  He has also informed us that next year, he is going to participate in a kids triathlon with his brother (which we will adapt accordingly).  Without Variety, he would not be able to be as mobile and be as participatory in everyday simple things like riding a bike. Thanks Variety for all you do!

Due to my daughter's special needs, growing body, and short endurance for walking and standing for extended periods of time, her toddler stroller was no longer appropriate.  The specialized stroller that we needed to help her access the community was very costly and unobtainable for us, but becoming increasingly necessary.  The Variety Children's Charity helped us to get a specialized "big kid" stroller which has allowed my daughter to particpiate in all kinds of family and community activities, that would otherwise be very difficult.  Thanks again to all of the staff, volunteers, and community members that participate in this organization that is dedicated to helping children of all abilities.   ~Katie and Grace

Variety Children's Charity of Greater Kansas City	161027	1	/users/profile/213490	mark.r.moberly	Board Member	5	06/19/2013	I have been involved in Variety for almost three years and could not imagine a more impactful or meaningful volunteer experience.  Growing up as an able-bodied and "normal" child, I had all the opportunities for activity and mobility.  There are many children in our community who do not get to experience the joys of mobility and independence, and Variety does all it can to change that, one child at a time.  Mobility is such an intangible thing...you can't feel it like hunger or quantify it in dollars to fix.  Giving the freedom of of mobility for the child for the first time is a life changing experience and allows the to live a more active and healthy life, and in many cases, leads to a much higher quality of life.  For me, the highest satisfaction I receive from my volunteer efforts are the smiles on a child's face the first time they ride their new adaptive bicycle or stand-up in a new wheelchair.   Further, the letters from the parents saying how much happier their special needs child is now that they can ride their bicycle with neighborhood children...or parents no longer have the back-breaking task of lifting the wheelchair into the van for a trip...are truly heartwarming!

Our lives have been changed forever.  Sometimes having special needs children you feel helpless, but after meeting Deb I have a whole new energy.  Not only did they jump right on getting us the lift we needed for the van, Deb has shown us a love that no other has shown.  Variety has provided us with many opportunities to be "normal" and go do "normal" things.  Anytime I see a child or family struggling with a special needs child, I tell them all about Variety.  There is no way I could ever repay Variety for the freedom they have given, except to share my story.

As a member of the Shawnee Mission Board of Education, I've seen firsthand the wonderful impact this charity has on kids.  Variety delivered dozens of wheelchairs to our Instructional Support Center.....our teachers were genuinely moved that a group remembered to help their students.  And speaking of students, not only does this nonprofit directly affect children, it also provides volunteer opportunities for students.  It was especially gratifying to listen to a Shawnee Mission student explain on a local newscast about the blessing she received in joining fellow high schoolers earn a special bike for a younger Shawnee Mission student.Variety delivers in many ways....and it chooses to allow others to take the credit thereby enhancing the experience for all.  The executive director Deb Wiebrecht keenly understands that leaders of organizations allow others to shine in order to sustain a successful program.

I am thankful to be involved in one of the best organizations in KC.

Through the money they raised they were able to purchase an adaptive bike for a child. When we presented it to him, the smile on his face was so awesome. Now, my kids are doing fundraising activities this summer with their friends to raise money for Variety.  Amazing, Amazing organization.
Variety Children's Charity of Greater Kansas City	160356	1	/users/profile/212633	4Riceboys	Client Served	5	06/11/2013	My son Sam is 11 years old and has Spinal Muscular Atrophy. He has been in a wheelchair since he was about 5. About 3 years ago, it became time to look into a new wheelchair for Sam, one with a lot more functionality than the basic one that he had at the time. It was important to us that we find ways to promote his independence as best we could, and getting the right wheelchair with all of the right functions was the key to that. Once all the approvals and ordering and all were done, we were left trying to figure out how we were going to pay for the out-of-pocket expense that we would be responsible for when buying this particular wheelchair. As anyone who has every purchased a power wheelchair knows, they are quite expensive, and even with great insurance, having a 10% or 20% co-insurance due really adds up. I was told that Variety Children's Charity provided some resources and funding to help with the purchase of mobility equipment for kids, and was put into contact with Deb. Their group of young volunteers managed to raise the funds to help us pay for the out-of-pocket expense that we owed. Sam loved his new wheelchair and we got the peace of mind of not having to worry about the cost aspect of it all. Deb and Variety planned a big event when they did the official presentation of the check. It was a baseball themed function, since Sam is a big baseball fan. We met at a local high school baseball field, and were met by many of the Variety team and some local team mascots who played baseball with Sam and his brothers. There were news people there to interview us and to video the event for the news, which made Sam feel really special! It was a very cool thing. Since then, we have been invited to many Variety fundraising events where we have met a lot of special people. This is a great organization, and we are proud to consider ourselves part of the Variety family!
Variety Children's Charity of Greater Kansas City	158122	1	/users/profile/209739	Angie Y.	Client Served	5	05/17/2013	My daughter was born with Spinal Bifida and is wheelchair bound.  I suddenly received a call from my school nurse letting me know that Shawnee Mission CCC Club at Shawnee Mission Northwest high school had raised some money.  I then talked with Deborah from Variety KC and they decided that they wanted to help the high school find a student in the district to help and they picked my daughter.   They then notified me of this fantastic news and we got to choose a hand cycle to purchase for my daughter so she can ride bikes with her family and friends.  The school raised half of the funds and the charity came up with the rest.   We then had an event to show my daughter her new bicycle during a recess at her school in front of the entire 1st grade class.  Deborah and Variety made the event so much fun for everyone, they even brought books and stuffed Owls and Rabbits for each child at the event as well.  Was inspirational and my daughter and our family will forever be grateful to Shawnee Mission CCC Club and Variety KC for their hard work and kind hearts. Great organization recommend then to anyone who have a child with special needs Variety cares!!

Board Member	5	10/20/2016	I have been involved in volunteering and working with Star of Hope's staff for the last 10 years participating and speaking at their national conferences for parents and children with disabilities in Romania and visiting many families at home in their own environment. I witnessed the love and compassion of all the staff, employees, volunteers working at Star of Hope International showed to the most vulnerable "the least" population in such a great need for physical, emotional, spiritual and financial support.  Over the years only in Romania thousands  of families with children with disabilities have been helped and supported physically, spiritually, emotionally and financially on a daily bases  and sponsored through the years by Star of Hope International who provided medical and health care, education, food, clothes, shelters, medications, toys for children, animals for self-sustaining, which lifted the burden of parents caring for their disabled children with no resources for daily living and giving them hope for the future. Many of these families have been trained, educated and empowered to help themselves and others in the same situation. Living under communist in the past they never knew that their is hope in God's promises, never had a Bible to read in their life and did not know how to pray to receive strength from our Heavenly Father in their struggles with their physical and emotional pain. Star of Hope  International works relentlessly through their professionals  and developed programs to help these children with disabilities to be integrate in society and to increase their self esteem and to  improve their quality of life. I am amazed by Star of Hope and my heart always has been touched by their love and care for these children with special needs for life.

The seeds planted there over 20 years ago have produced much fruit in the lives of disabled children and their families.  Several centers have been established to nourish and support the educational and spiritual needs of the most vulnerable of populations.  Since the fall of communism, changing the mindset toward disabilities has been a constant effort.  Under the leadership of trusted, local partnerships and Aura Vatamanuic, Director of Star of Hope/Romania, media, political and educational programs have highlighted Star of Hope's positive impact upon its children.  The centers provide a cheerful, bright, clean and supportive environment to help children learn social skills along with character building, godly life skills.  Families have been able to learn coping skills,  Christian values and have HOPE restored to their families and lives.  I thank God for this organization and the support of donors who embrace this work.

Star of Hope International America Inc	219985	1	/users/profile/283609	1daniel2	Volunteer	5	10/04/2014	  I have personally seen the work that Star of Hope does in different country's. They help thousands of children around the world. I was fortunate to be able to travel with Star of Hope to Haiti before and after the earthquake. I have always wanted to help the less fortunate and thru Star of Hope I was able to. The first week I was there I helped with the construction an orphanage in Carrefore Haiti and was able to meet the children and people of Haiti and build lasting relationships. Thru Facebook I am still able to keep in contact with the friends that I made while I was there.  After the earthquake I was able to go back to Haiti thru Star of Hope for 2 months and help rebuild School furniture for the children and help rebuild churches and schools. While I was there I met a young girl that I sponsored until she was of age to leave the orphanage. I still send support for Star of Hope to use where needed. My wife also supports a girl at another one of there schools. Star of Hope Haiti have some very dedicated and loyal Haitians that work for them there in Haiti that really care for the people physically and spiritually. I was able to meet many of the pastors and teachers from  Star of Hopes schools and churches there and was blessed beyond no end. The staff in Ellinwood Kansas are also very dedicated loving and loyal people who fear the Lord and do tremendous work for the needy across the globe.  While on another trip with another ministry I was able to see another one of Star of Hope's schools in Trinidad and was very impressed. The pastor of the church and school there were definitely God's servants, very loving and giving of themselves and there home. I was also blessed by being to help with the construction of their new church and school.  Most all children in these countries that  are associated with Star of Hope would not have anything to eat at all if it weren't for Star of Hope and their sponsors. I was always worried about sending money anywhere not knowing how it would be spent and where. After getting to know the Staff personally in Ellinwood Ks., Haiti and Trinidad and seeing for myself where and how my money is spent I am not reluctant at all to make donations monthly. I wanted to go to less fortunate places to bless others with the talents that my Lord has blessed me with and in return was blessed 10 fold.

He changed radically our life and made us see things and the whole world from his point of view. His world is much better and much cleaner than the one in which we lived until now.Cristian is a little boy which now has been 10 years since he has been diagnosed with autism at age of 7 years old. Until that age we kept going to different doctors that underlined some alleged problems. The child start talking at age of 4 years and a half and at about 3 years we went to a doctor which said: Dont worry, Blaga spoke for the first time at 5 at the first word was silly. I left with a bitter taste because I had other expectations from him.Two years ago I found out about Star of Hope, where I found a big, strong and very united family with human beings eager to offer us help and unconditionally support. Here I have found the serenity and comfort I needed. Cristi comes here for speech therapy and psychotherapy surrounded by very agreeable people for him (autistic children dont empathize with everyone).Thanks to all of staff members because they are doing a great job informing the parents from all points of view, helping us in impasse and keeping us together by organizing all kinds of meetings (with moms, with dads, and children). This matter a lot for us as a family with a child with special needs, we feel understood and safe.It would be a lot more to say about the Star of Hope foundation, about our family experience but I pray for everyones health so we could keep collaborating because we need you so much. Thank you Star of Hope for being there for us! 
Star of Hope International America Inc	169864		/users/profile/225138	Elena Stefanescu	Client Served	5	09/16/2013	Razvan says that his life is a struggle, a ceaseless struggle and chess is royal sport, a sport for mind. He also says that if the king is alone, he can do nothing. The same is for the queen or the horse. In the life everything happens in the same manner. His life started in 1996 in a placement center. Two years later, Star of Hope started to be part of his life. He was a lovely boy that could not sit as others did. He was always in his bed. It was the autumn of 1998 when Star of Hope Romania was set up al local organization, with office in Iasi. It was the same period when Razvan was noticed by the members of multidisciplinary team of Star of Hope. The child was diagnosed with a severe illness in the bones and was abandoned at birth. Razvan will understand only a couple of years after, that meeting Star of Hope also meant meeting with the one that was to become his mother, this means me. The medic from the village asked me: Why did I take him? Couldnt I find another? Razvan heard this and asked me: Why did he say this? And then I told him: Razvan I did not gave birth to you, I choose you. And then Razvan understood.Before Razvan managed to use both legs for walking, it took a lot of endurance. But without Star of Hope support, none of the 6 surgical operations would have been possible. Now I thank God for helping him walk. Because I heard that most children with this diagnosis never walk. Even the doctor that operated was very surprised He can walk? When I operated him I had no hope for recovery Because we asked for it.  I have never thought that he will ever walk and when he saw Razvan he could not believe it. Thanks to Star of Hope, the life of Razvan fundamentally changed. Now he lives a normal life. He is a happy child. Razvan walks without support, can write and is doing well in school. He has many friends. In order to have Razvan today going to normal school, enjoying life with the loved ones, it was needed that 15 years ago Star of Hope Romania was set up, with support from mother organization Star of Hope International.

Like young people, at 21 years old, with enthusiasm regarding our future plans, with faith in God and with jobs, the future was ahead us. But this was only the beginningIn short time we had to take some difficult decisions  for some we were prepared and we passed over them, the other we could not handle and the consequences were big  leisure time, career, budget, but all this help us to be mature, to be strong as a family and help us to see our potential which God putted in us.When I finished the University I gave birth to my first child, Clara Bianca. She is 5 years old. At that time we were living in a flat. Because we didnt want to have only one child, but more, we decided to move out in a house to have more space for the entire family. After 2 years we had a boy, Fillip Timotei, who has Down syndrome. It was like a shock for us and I started to do everything like a routine, like a duty, searching for answers for the entire situation. Ive find out about Star of Hope Romania Foundation from another families who have children with Down syndrome. In 2011 Ive decided to do something for my child and I went to Star of Hope to ask for help. There I received information, I participated at meetings with other parents and we decided to fight for the rights of our children. For a while Fillip went at individual therapy and now he is integrated in a group of children who have the same age. I also worked with him a lot at home. Now he can walk, he can eat by self, he imitates the adults. Fillip is 3 years old. After he was born we moved out and now are living in a house.  Last year, in 2012, God gave us another baby, a girl, Theodora Sophia. Fillip loves his sister very much and together they learn how to share, to speak, to use the potty and other things. Our future is not in our hands, but we try to be prepare for tomorrow. All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits. (Proverbs 16:2) The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD. (Proverbs 21:31).

Star of Hope International America Inc	167072	1	/users/profile/221922	BisonBoy	Board Member	5	09/04/2013	I am one of the newest board members for Star of Hope International America Inc.  I joined Star of Hope because of their statement, "We are working to create a world where children become educated, healthy adults who are involved in their communities and share their love of Jesus Christ."  In my short tenure on the board I have been impressed with the other board members, the leadership, and staff.  They are a very dedicated group of individuals who have nothing but the best in mind for the children and families they serve.  I am not sure just when I might be able to go on one of their work teams but look forward to doing so in the future.

We are from the Isle of Man but work in the NE of Romania. Our Romanian charity "Lumina Pentru Copii" supports the work of Star of Hope Romania. We have seen tremendous changes in the children with special needs who have had an opportunity to attend the Star of Hope centres. Children who had no chance in the Romanian state system of being given the one to one support that they needed. We have seen children being enabled to develop and have their lives transformed. The parents of these children are also supported by the Star of Hope organisation and encouraged to join parent associations where they "as a group" can voice the needs of their children local authorities and also give each other support. The parents are often marginalised by the needs of their children and the group support and understanding that they get enables them to have strength to continue to care for their children. It is a joy to know these parents and their children. I know every one of them would express their thanks to Star of Hope for the love and care that they and their children have received.

Star of Hope International America Inc	165721	1	/users/profile/220223	psdollarhide	Donor	5	08/21/2013	We've seen lots of child sponsorship programs on the TV but never seriously considered becoming a sponsor. I confess...the sight on TV of the conditions where the kids lived touched our hearts but we didn't know the company and the trust was just not there to sign up. While visiting with a dear friend, we heard about the SOH program for sponsoring kids. Wow!!!  Administrative costs are very low, the SOH staff are friendly and helpful, and they see to it that the donated money goes to the kids to help with food and education. They gladly answered all my questions before signing on.  We are now the proud sponsors of a special young Toba boy in Argentina and could not be happier!  For over a year, we have been able to share with friends and family that we have added a godson to our family.  We thought he would be the one thrilled to have a sponsor but we've discovered that the sponsor surely gets an equal amount of happiness.  Thanks to SOH, our joy level is sky high.  The SOH folks are amazing and do a fabulous job managing their sponsorship program.  I encourage everyone to take a look at the program and see if a child grabs their heart like this young boy grabbed ours. SOH is real folks doing good work!  It doesn't get any better than this!

Star of Hope International America Inc	126432		/users/profile/171455	rhothomas	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/17/2012	Greetings in the precious name of Jesus Christ, we are thankful to God for SOH Trinidad, we have two schools that are functioning well, one in St. Joseph and one in Maloney, we do reflect on the importance of the visit that SOH USA made to Trinidad a few years ago at the time the school in St. Joseph which was made of secondhand ply board and secondhand galvanize was in a terrible state, beyond repair as termites had eaten most of the wood and the building was falling apart, it was a timely visit of a team of workers headed by Bro. Barry that saved the day.  The building was demolished and they worked hard to erect a concreate structure, because of the time constraint the building was not completed but funds were supplied so that during their absence work continued, today we have a beautiful building that underwent further advancement and houses 40 children in a deprived community.  SOH America has been a good support towards SOH Trinidad and has been able to intervene at critical times in helping the work here to achieve its objectives.  We recall a crisis at Maloney in the collapse of the roof where SOH America raised funds so that the roof of the school could be repaired, we are thankful for all the past and present support that SOH America have given towards the SOH projects in Trinidad.  We look forward to a healthy, fruitful relationship that will continue to be of benefit to the needy children in both communities, thanks so much to the sponsorship and inspirational leadership that Bro. Barry, Mark Presson, Maria Presson and the team of workers that are working towards the improved lives of the children of SOH Trinidad.

What an amazing experience! I saw firsthand the work that Star of Hope is doing and the impact they are having on a country that has so little and has so many needs. As we toured the schools and villages I saw the look on the faces of the children. The look on their faces was all the confirmation I needed to believe/know that Star of Hope is accomplishing great things and is loved by all they have touched . Thank you Star of Hope for opening my heart and mind.

I have had the tremors all my life now that I am getting older and have had some very stressful events occur my tremors are effecting my personal life and my job drastically.  I am seeing a Neurologist and have tried all the meds, but for some reason or another I have had severe side effects.  I do take the Xanax and have for many years I am aware of the long term side effects, but it is the ONLY thing that allows me to function at a minimal.My doctor told me that the FDA approved an ultrasound procedure and the closest medical center preforming it is Stanford Medical Center.  I have emailed them several weeks ago and I am very interested in a less invasive procedure than Deep Brain Stimulation.  I have not heard back; however, I am so looking forward to this treatment it sounds promising.  I am also dealing with lower back problems and surgery has been suggested by many doctors.  I would like to take of my health issues and have the results be successful, so I can function in my personal life and at work.  My job is getting increasingly challenging with the back pain and my tremor's I do not know how much longer I can continue to work.  It has become very difficult.  :(If anyone has any other information, or how I can get a response from Stanford please let me know.  I live by myself and it is challenging as you all know to take care of everyday life situations.  I am trying to stay positive while I wait to hear back from Stanford.Any suggestions please share it would be much appreciated.
International Essential Tremor Foundation	290402		/users/profile/380726	TheJanster	General Member of the Public	4	05/19/2016	I was finally diagnosed with ET (hand tremor) in 1983 at the age of 32.  I was about 10 years old when I first noticed that my hands would shake, especially in stressful situations.  At the time (and for many years), I thought it was just a "nervous condition".  My father also had a hand tremor so I thought I had inherited his nervousness.  I have had a wonderful response to my hand tremor using Propranalol - feel extremely fortunate!  However, in my late 30s, I started with a tremor also in my head.  It has been a long journey with an amazing Neurologist to finally have some relief from my head tremor with Botox injections in my neck.  My son, now 39, also has a hand tremor that started at the age of 3.  He accepts the tremor as it is & has made a choice not to seek treatment at this point in his life.  I have been a member of the IETF for many many years now and have been so grateful for ALL the information this organization provides... and for their efforts to do continued research for better ways to live with ET.

More importantly, IETF funds essential tremor research and advocates for additional government funding to treat and cure ET.
International Essential Tremor Foundation	289284	1	/users/profile/379516	AngelHarp	Volunteer	5	05/10/2016	I was diagnosed with "benign familial tremor", now known as Essential Tremor (ET) in my 20s, although it had manifested earlier.  All through my life I'd hidden it.  When a support group sponsored by the IETF started within 5 miles of my house when I was in my late 50s, I was elated that there were other folks with ET and excited to learn more about it.  So, I volunteered to be co-leader of the group.  The materials and support provided by IETF to the local support groups are excellent.  It was through the IETF and the support group that I met doctors and other people and learned enough to be confident enough to go through with Deep Brain Surgery (DBS) or brain pacemaker surgery this past month.  The DBS has made a tremendous difference for the tremor on my left side.  I will be talking to folks next month about my experience and the IETF volunteer coordinator is sending out a flyer for me to folks in my area.
International Essential Tremor Foundation	289266	3	/users/profile/379491	craftyladyabqyahoo.com	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	I once had a beautiful hand writing that amazed people. I enjoyed adapting my penmanship and creating different styles. Then my hands starting shaking and I could hardly write legibly. I was fortunate to find an excellent neurologist who also has ET. He understands the physical as well as the social difficulties. When I found an ET support group, I was relieved to talk to others who understood. And even more happy to find the IETF. I wouldn't wish this on anyone, but am so thankful to learn how to live with this condition.
International Essential Tremor Foundation	289252	2	/users/profile/379474	pick53	General Member of the Public	5	05/10/2016	The IETF has made living with ET much easier for me.   I was diagnosed when I was about 35 but I had noticed this condition earlier and also had seen it in my Dad.   I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters.   All but one has ET.  For me, it has progressed as I've aged and really only hinders me when eating, drinking, and personal grooming.  However, due to the nature of this condition, when I have to speak in front of a group of people or play my guitar in public it can become a nightmare.  The IETF through literature and posters they've made available have enabled me to increase awareness in my church, at my workplace, and in my circle of friends and family.   This has limited the amount of questions I get asking me "why are you so nervous" or "why do you shake so much".   Because of the IETF I have been able to consider myself "normal" and this has helped boost my confidence.   This foundation has been a Godsend and I look forward to seeing more of what they can accomplish.    Al Johnson

Very lost and very confused and fully without support.... ET is a life altering neurological condition that affects our lives in so many ways and yet has not really been studied..doctors don't know much about it and aren't much help..it takes a movement disorder neurologist to really dx it really. So, many people don't know what they have and go through life suffering and isolated.  The IETF is working to change that for us through research and support.  They need funding to continue their great work.  We need them!

My diagnosis was a surprise to me, and when I talk to friends and family about it, no one seems to know anything about it either. Through the International Essential Tremor Foundation, I've found out that Essential Tremor is very common, but very little is known about it. To date, ET has attracted far less research funding than it seems like it should, since it affects so many people. The IETF has been very helpful in providing me with information about ET. I recently participated in a research study that I found out about after reading the IETF magazine. IETF is an invaluable resource, providing information to the many thousands of people who suffer from ET.

For many years, since I was in my twenties, I have had problems with my hands shaking lots.  I sold tickets for an air line and always had people asking me why I was so nervous. It really make you feel depressed when you don't know what is wrong. My Father and Grandfather also shook.   I just thought that it was something that I inherited and I did!  Now my Brother, who is 54 and my Nephew, 32, also shake a lot. I even went to the Doctor to find out what it was.  They didn't know. Finally, in the past about 15 years I was diagnosed with Essential Tremor.  I went to one of the functions that Emory/IETF put on about 6 years ago, since then have been connected to their website.  It is wonderful to know what is wrong with you.  On the IETF website, I have found many things that help our entire family.

Annoying : Yes! But one must keep informed about personal health. The IETF organization,  which has been helpful to me since it began,  is more than expected of a foundation.Especially since  full cure is a goal even though ET is not deadly, yet the Board and its Director areclosely in touch with all ongoing investigations and makes personal contact between "victims" by everypossible means from area gatherings to Webinars with actual researchers.  At 90 years even tipson using my Chrome tablet are useful and appreciated.  Thomas F Conlon Cpt USArmy Retired
International Essential Tremor Foundation	214374		/users/profile/277621	BettyAnn	Volunteer	5	09/09/2014	I am the most fortunate of ET patients, because at the time I was diagnosed with essential tremor, I was  given material that introduced me to the IETF.  I joined the foundation and from their literature I learned many facts of essential tremor that I had not known before.  The most important fact, in my case, was to not be ashamed of my tremors.  Without the embarrassment of my tremors, I was able to gain self-confidence and consequently was able to educate my family, friends, and strangers with presentations on essential tremor. The IETF has been the most valuable resource in providing guidance, written material for patients, doctors, and the public, and items such as pens and bookmarks to hand out at health fairs as well as brochures.  The IETF has never let me down when I have requested an item or a notice to be sent out to members of a planned event or meeting.  To me, it is the GREATEST of non-profits.
International Essential Tremor Foundation	214324		/users/profile/277571	Barry16	Donor	5	09/09/2014	   I was a dentist for thirty five years before I retired. Towards the end of my dental career I noticed that I had a slight tremor of my right hand sometimes after a difficult extraction of a tooth.  After retiring I continued to have a slight tremor after doing any difficult or tiring activity that I would do with my right hand. I remembered that my father had some similar difficulties with his hands when he was very old. I realized that I had Essential Familial Tremor, but wasn't sure what to do about it. I looked it up on Google and somehow found out about the International Essential Tremor Foundation.  Reading about the IETF, I decided to sign up for the Tremor Talk  and make a donation. I have found the magazine very informative and and helpful in many respects.  I read in the current issue of Tremor Talk that there will be a ET seminar in Philadelphia ( I live in Bucks County ) sometime in the near future and I hope to attend when the date is available. In the meantime I plan to see a Neurologist about medication for my tremor.

I have received a variety amount of information, books, cards, and lots of emails from IETF informing me about essential tremors (ET).  All this information was passed along for free.  They have coordinated internet lectures by professionals in the field.  I have had the good fortune to make contact with a doctor on their medical advisory committee for a second opinion.  IETF has many local chapters that can and do help people close to them. I now realize that I am not the only one with this condition and as such have many I can reach out to for assistance when needed.  While I may not be able to change the results, I have learned better on how to work around the issues and live a fulfilling life despite the difficulties. Ron LandonApopka, FL

The organization and it's newsletter keeps me informed on the latest developments within the field, but it also helps to keep me aware of how others afflicted are handling and coping with it. It helps to put advancements within the field in front of me and advises me of volunteer experiments and studies that continue to research steps for an ultimate cure. Further, it lists doctors and contact information for those who specialize in the recognition and treatment of Essential Tremor, and also notes cities, dates and times of seminars devoted to discussions of it replete with speakers, written materials, etc. I couldn't more strongly endorse it's website or it's publication.

I have had ET since childhood, have got a son with it, but didn't have a name to it until a couple of years ago. Tje information and tips om their website will help in letting my son deal in a better way. For us born with ET, there are a lot of challenges in daily life that we don't allways knows the cause of.

International Essential Tremor Foundation	158215	1	/users/profile/209895	lynn_dembski	Client Served	5	05/18/2013	I was diagnosed with ET during my twenties - during my college years.  At first, I thought the shaking was just from stress, but I noticed that it got worse with physical activity.  My doctor told me that any type of stress on the body - emotional or physical, will increase ET symptoms. Later, my mother was also diagnosed with ET.  My doctor told me that ET symptoms generally get worse with age - and I can see that clearly in my 75 year old mother.  Her head and voice shake significantly, and the ET clearly interferes with much of her daily life.   Right now, my ET mostly interferes with being able to write well and to eat or drink liquids.  In my job as a school counselor, people often ask me if I am nervous - or if I am OK.  I worry that they think I have an alcohol problem. I am so glad that the International Essential Tremor Foundation is working to encourage and fund research for ET.  I know that my children have a significant risk of developing ET, and I watch for symptoms with a sense of dread.  I hope that they will not have to face the same struggles that I see my mother facing.

Now at 83, my tremor is worse but my attitude is much better.  The embarrassment I lived with especially in my teens and early career years is a thing of the past.  Thanks to IETF I have come to understand that I have a medical condition and while it may create some awkward moments socially, I can simply explain it and any potential embarrassment vanishes.  I am currently a volunteer in a study sponsored by the U. of Miami Medical Center involving the effects of propanolol and alcohol on ET.  The study is under the direction of neurologist Dr. Nahab, a member of the IETF board.  While I probably won't reap the benefits of the study, it's entirely possible my grandchildren will.  (ET tends to be familial.  My Dad had it, two of my children slightly and now at least one grandchild.)

This had to be in the 1980's. (I've been dealing with ET since age 11 & was diagnosed at age 19; I am now 63.) I joined the organization & began receiving information.  The IETF is the only organization educating & helping ET patients & families, increasing public awareness about ET, & funding research. I cannot believe how much the IETF has grown over the years, in scope, member size, & professionalism. They serve their members with such passion.  They have helped me become better educated about my condition, helped me find neurologists & neurosurgeons, introduced me to thousands of fellow ET sufferers so I realized I was not alone, & are always there to answer my questions or direct me to the right place.  I decided to become a Support Group Leader (SGL) in 2001, wanting so much to help others & increase awareness, after having been helped by the IETF. I led a group in Michigan for 6 years. Because of my successful work as a SGL, I was asked to join the board in 2002, I believe. I continue to actively serve on the board, currently as one of the past presidents.

The MD's would just look at me when I told them my symptoms.  Finally my MD retired and sold his practice to a large medical center.   When I saw my PCP for the 1st time, I ask him, that since this hospital is suppose to know everything, I want to know what is wrong with me.  (I was an RN and had worked rehab and never heard of it).  The MD send me to a Neurologist and in 5 minutes I knew what was wrong.   Then going on line I saw this foundation and joined.  I attended a yearly information session  @ Myrtle Beach, NC and was surprised at the no of patients were there.   The next year, they had two sessions in my area of Winston-Salem & Greensboro, NC.  My neurologist spoke at this meeting.   I would like to get a support group started in the area, but right now they have in it with movement disorders, mainly Parkinson Disease.  There was a large group of both of the sessions locally, so I know we could get a group going.  I am willing to help, but right now the person at the hospital left and we are waiting on a replacement.  There has been so much information that IETF has provided.  I did a case study as an RN at my previous job before I retired.  Thanks, IETF for your good work.  My main problem is I can't take some of the meds and there are good references on the web site.

I have visited this pair several times and am so encouraged by the changes in them with proper feed, vet and hoof care, but especially LOVE!  Visitors (like me) quickly become friends united by a common love of horses.

B&C Equine Rescue Inc.	265885	4	/users/profile/354633	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	10/20/2015	Brenda and Cecil are the most caring people,  Brenda works so hard to rehabilitate the animals she rescues.   She not only rescues and rehabilitates,  but teaches and demonstrates to  others.    She loves animals,   and shows it to whom ever is around.   You can tell by watching her and Cecil the animals couldn't have a better home or more caring people.   She takes some of the animals out to fundraisers,  and Birthday Parties,  always spreading the word,  and sharing with others.   I have watched her work on the animals she rescues,   she is tireless, and relentless on helping them recover.   She gets my vote, and if I were an abused animal,  I would sure want her to rescue me!
B&C Equine Rescue Inc.	265471	5	/users/profile/354211	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/20/2015	Brenda and Cecil are not only gems within their own rights as equine rescuers, but also invaluable to the horse community both local and abroad. They are the first to lend a hand to a horseman in need, to educate without condescending, and to taken in the hard cases no one else will. They constantly seek to better themselves for the good of the animals they champion, and share that wealth of knowledge from nutrition to wound  care to training. And unlike some rescues who take on more animals than they can manage and who never adopt any out to new homes, the work they do really does mean something.

The horses had not been handled before and Brenda ( and some volunteers) took it upon herself to halter break momma and baby before they came home.  What a blessing that was.  They gladly fed  (at our request) the horses special feed as well as supplements.  They did a great job of letting us know what was going on with the horses by taking lots of pictures and sending emails via FaceBook.  The horses left B & C Equine Rescue in much better shape then they came.  After this experience, I trust Brenda and her crew to take care of my horses anytime.

Client Served	5	10/09/2014	I inadvertently came across B&C Equine Rescue when I bought a mare and foal that were being sold for slaughter.  (The auction was in OK and I live in Indiana.) The horses from the sale were taken to B&C for safekeeping until buyers could arrange for pick up.  The word safekeeping does not begin to cover the care and attention the horses had.  Brenda arranged for them to have the best feed, to have veterinary care, to have equine dentistry, and to have a driver pick them up to take them to Oklahoma for the new owners.  Additionally, Brenda arranged for volunteers to come help halter break the 3 pairs and even provided the halters!  The tireless efforts and love that this group provided for these unfortunate horses absolutely amazed me.  I wish I could shout from the rooftops the admiration I have for B&C Equine Rescue Inc. This group truly represents the epitome of charitable giving.

We were starting a garden and needed compost, so my husband went over.  We had not realized it was a rescue.  We live only a few miles away, so when he came home, he said I needed to go over.  I love everyone who rescues animals  and who cares for any living thing in need.  What a loving, happy place we found!!  Brenda and Cecil welcomed us and took the time to show us around.  At that time, a few years ago, Buddy was suffering from a tendon problem, and Brenda showed me how she gently stretched his tendons to ease his discomfort.  THEN she explained that she did that 5 times a day, even setting her alarm in the night.  Buddy now is happy and healthy and walks normally.  The same devotion is given to all the animals.

Dennis and I live only 5 miles away, but we were not aware of this wonderful place until we saw an ad for compost for our garden. We were both amazed and so thankful for people who love and care for animals in need as much as Brenda and Cecil do. On our first visit, I met Buddy, who was lying on the floor of the barn where Brenda had been working with his tendons. One animal after another was brought to this place and all were given immediate love and caring.   I cannot begin to express my admiration for the devotion this couple shows to animals who are in desperate need.   And their efforts extend to helping others, children and adults, learn the proper care of animals.  They teach groups of children, and they are always patient in answering all questions about how the animals are doing.  It is a joy to see the difference a couple of weeks or a month can make in the condition of the horses, burros, dogs, and all who come into this wonderful Sanctuary of Love.

Brenda didn't waste a minute and met me at the farm where the pony was and rescued him at once.  He is now living out his days in peace surrounded by love and friends at B&C Equine Rescue.  I have since volunteered several times at B&C Ranch and have found the experience beyond fulfilling.  Brenda and Cecil love these animals infinitely and devote their lives to them.  Brenda has since become a dear friend.  Brenda and Cecil are genuine, passionate and dedicated to their animals and are very generous with sharing their ranch with anyone who wants to be a part of it.  It is truly a peaceful and idyllic place to connect with animals.  I admire Brenda and Cecil immensely and I am proud to call them friends.

I am heavily involved with dog rescue but I didn't know who to call for help with the pony after animal control refused to help.  A friend on Facebook suggested I call Brenda.  She met me out at the farm that day.  Now that pony is being cared for at B&C Equine Rescue.  Brenda personally administers physical therapy to injured and neglected animals and makes sure all of their other needs are met.  Brenda has an enormous heart for animals and devotes her life to help save them.  She works tirelessly every day to help the ones who have been forgotten, cast aside and abused.  I am proud to call Brenda a friend.  She is a hero.

The rescue was well-maintained and I've never seen a happier group of horses!  Brenda takes in the neglected horses that no one else would dream of trying to maintain and she gives many horses a chance to live out their lives in happiness when, in many other situations, they would have been put down due to health issues.  Every animal on the property was obviously loved and taken care of.   This is what a rescue should be!

Brenda also heals their spirit, and calms their fear. They are nurished physically and emotionaly.

B&C Equine Rescue Inc.	190224	2	/users/profile/248337	Terrie Y.	Volunteer	5	12/09/2013	I met Brenda and Cecil a few years ago when they were taking in a donkey, "Richie", whose hooves had been badly neglected. I am an equine hoofcare professional and Brenda needed help with Richie. They had had the extraordinary length of his hooves sawed off (about 14"). Now it was time to trim to get his hooves back to where they should be. Richie was not real agreeable with this idea, but the three of us, Brenda, Cecil and I managed to get him trimmed. This was a process that took a number of trims to get to the point of his hooves being normal again. (To see him now, you would never know the mess his hooves were!) I remember the first time there and I said to Brenda, "If you're expecting me to manhandle and get him done real fast, then I'm not the one for you." And her response was something like, "If you did it like that and hurried out of here, then we wouldn't want you here." I knew then that B&C wanted to do things the right way - even though it would take a lot more time, patience and caring. Brenda does a great job trimming all the hooves of the assorted equine family they have at B&C. When she runs into something unusual, or that she's not certain about, she'll give me a call. Well, with rescue horses, that's probably more times then she'd like.  After seeing all the follow up care that these rescues get, I can't say enough about the devotion shown by Brenda and Cecil.  The dedication and love for the "herd" is quite obvious. Somewhere along the line I decided that B&C Equine Rescue would be a charity client for me - seems it's the least I can do to help out. And B&C's follow up care for hoof rehab has made for some amazing recoveries. You see with hoof rehab, I can trim until I'm blue in the face, but if the owners' don't follow through with the proper diet, exercise, and other therapies, the results will be minimal. B&C treats the whole horse. Always looking for better ways. They have the utmost dedication and determination to help all equine. You can be sure that any donations are used wisely. If B&C were to have any other name, it should be "For the Love of the Horse". 
B&C Equine Rescue Inc.	190123	2	/users/profile/248214	Jaime11	General Member of the Public	5	12/07/2013	I met Brenda on the internet while trying to find help for a severely foundered pony my sister and friend sent me video of during a dog rescue. She and I then met in person months later as I was relocating my horses nearby. She and her husband volunteered to help me mend some fences as well as transport my personal therapy horses to the location once it was finished being repaired. Since then, B&C Equine has been just a phone call away and have assisted me on dozens of occasions, including encouraging and guiding me as I began rescuing and rehoming horses privately. They have selflessly donated hours of their time and labor and we have become great friends.   I see the good they do and their dedication to saving and rehabilitating equine in need or at risk of abuse, neglect, or slaughter.  Brenda is my mentor and I admire the hard work she puts into her rescue and the education she continues to share with people like myself, as well as the general public and children alike.  Her rescue is definitely inspired by her love for horses and donkeys and she remains successful because of her huge heart and strong professionalism.  I will look up to her always.

My daughter & I was hoping to get a pony ride & picture taken with Santa... I got lost on the way. Late, Cold, Brenda & her husband welcomed us to the ranch. Katrina, my daughter rode Max and even though we didn't meet Santa that trip, we were hooked. We arranged for my daughters 4th birthday party to be at the ranch, and used her on Max, as our invites. Since then we have helped lead the horses, groom the horses and spread the word about the rescue to anyone who will listen. I was approached to be on the board to register for 501(c)3 and I was very excited to be able to help the rescue anyway I could. Brenda doesn't just save the horses from the neglect and stupidity of people, but she opens her heart & home to ALL 2 legged and 4 legged beings. My daughter is now 7 and Max is the "bestest" horse ever. We have learned proper hoof care, why trimming hooves is so VERY important, which comb/brush to use, and where. I have learned how to make the emergency slip knot. Brenda is always ready to answer our questions and teach anyone willing to learn.

I have seen two projects go from planning to completion, one was a friendship circle that was sculpted by the fifth graders. The artist then took it and did a pour then mounted the sculpture to a raw piece of tree stump and it was placed in front of the school building. The other project was a tile project, again from brainstorming to completion. There were two concrete supports in the school lobby, again the fifth graders designed and prepped the tiles with the help of the artist and the art teacher then the tyles were placed around the supports. I would highly recommend Arts Partners!!

They have a great staff and group of supporters who are passionate about helping kids learn.  What could be better than that?!
Arts Partners Inc	132271		/users/profile/177894	scienceeucator	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2012	This organization is small but mightly with a passionate staff team and dedicated teaching artists.  They touch the lives of so many students and teachers in a very positive way.  Their commitment to making art accessible is commendable; but even more so, is their unique approach to using art as a teaching tool for subjects across the curriculum.  Too often our educational system is singularly focuses in teaching styles for children when children are very diverse in how they learn.  This program makes an impact in the lives of so many children and opens their minds to subjects in a new and engaging way.
Arts Partners Inc	132243		/users/profile/177861	JanNorman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/01/2012	Arts Partners Wichita partners with the school district and community to engage students, educators and artists at all levels in meaningful learning strategies and experiences that literally change their lives and thinking in a positive way.  They provide opportunities to cultivate creativity and innovation for college and career readiness, promote students' interest and enthusiastic engagement in learning, not only about the arts but in other subjects such as literacy, STEM and ICT, and facilitate interactive experiences that help students understand and apply knowledge and skills that are portable, memorable and relevant to learning across the curriculum and in life.  The sustained commitment and high quality of instructional activity consistently exempliefied in the Arts Partners programs are rarely available at this level and scale and they are worthy of being recognized as a model non-profit organization that makes invaluable contributions to their community, region and the field.

Arts Partners Inc	132215		/users/profile/177829	jrtwotreads	General Member of the Public	5	11/01/2012	Many children have the opportunity to work hand in hand with an artist to create a long lasting Art Work for their school.  Many have made ceramic tile pieces which have also used math skills within the project planning, interdiciplinary to be sure.  What a great experience for the children and the artists to many years.

It uses short videos to demonstrate how to teach for critical thinking not rote learning.  It was designed to serve teachers who work with the poorest children of the world.  All videos are free.  This volunteer work has enriched my life and shown me how I can use my talents  to help others with great needs. All children deserve a quality education. This gives them the opportunity to escape poverty. Sheril Logan
Trees For Life	257491		/users/profile/345924	WendyS9	Donor	5	09/15/2015	I first heard about Trees For Life at a peace conference back in 1986. The idea of planting more trees always appealed to me, and planting trees that feed people was even better. So I started making regular contributions as well as special ones in memory of loved ones who had passed away. The folks at Trees For Life have always been helpful if I had a question or a concern, and it is a wonderful project to not only plant trees that feed the hungry but teach people in those areas to help their neighboring communities to do the same. TFL has since branched out into other areas that are helpful to poor communities. It makes me feel great that over the years my small contributions have helped so many people and helped this organization to continue its wonderful mission.
Trees For Life	257428	1	/users/profile/345848	PeaceCorpsVolunteer	Client Served	5	09/15/2015	A Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal, I reached out to Trees for Life for help with a training on the moringa tree. Dedicated to helping people break the cycle of poverty through grassroots forestry initiatives, Trees for Life seemed like the perfect organization to partner with. With Trees for Life's support, local counterparts and Peace Corps volunteers were able to train close to 200 local health agents on  moringa cultivation and preparation.  With its high nutritional value, moringa has a huge potential to help alleviate vitamin deficiencies in a region of Senegal where 16.7% of the population suffers from severe malnutrition according to the UN's World Food Program. Moringa powder's high commercial value also makes it a lucrative income generating activity. By training local health agents to train at least five households in their neighborhood about moringa, we started the conversation about the tree in over 100 villages and reached hundreds, if not thousands, of people. We wouldn't have been able to do it without Trees for Life and highly recommend working with this organization.

It has made a difference in many countries fighting hunger and malnutrition for more than three decades.  They believe in educating the masses about nutrition, helping them plant trees, create economic empowerment, and improve the health and wellness of villages around the world, all with the power of the Moringa tree. Wichita, Kansas has been home to this selfless organization.  It is unusual to see a non-profit  organization succeed solely with the help of volunteers.  Nalini Gangadhar

Trees For Life	154048	2	/users/profile/200847	Azathoth	Donor	5	04/10/2013	For our wedding anniversary each year, we purchase 100 fruit trees from Trees For Life. We understand fully that there are several amazing ecologically supportive, disease/hunger fighting projects being carried out by Trees For Life. Our monies go to Trees For Life and are spent as only Trees For Life could. Each project is beyond worthy, but this married couple has found a way for romance to be held up by disease fighting, hunger abating, ecology sustaining, and so much more. These projects are done around the globe where it is needed most. We will likely never visit a fruit tree that is providing shade and food while stabilizing a river's bank with its roots. But each year, we buy another 100. And around our own neighborhood in this world, we can gaze out at tree topped vistas to try to see if we could understand what our hundreds of trees amount to if they were grouped. It is very romantic. And every time I have corresponded with someone working for Trees For Life, it has been a pleasure and an honor. Their causes are not easy, but they are achievable and powerful in their beautiful simplicity. Please support them, there is no better gift to give to someone of importance!
Trees For Life	150616	3	/users/profile/200847	Azathoth	Donor	5	03/06/2013	At age 22 I wed the best friend I'd had for 8 years, and as anniversary #1 rolled around I could not fathom any truly appropriate gift to give. Sparing you the shortcomings of all other ideas/items/websites that I came across in my hunt, I have never been so grateful for such a beautiful thing as The Trees For Life organisation- this I knew when I first learned of it.Of course your donations go collectively toward all the environmentally supportive, hunger fighting, humanitarian projects. But you have the romantic option of using their catalog to donate toward specific things. Ever since the first anniversary gift of 100 fruit trees and one fuel-efficient cook stove that helps the smoke not be inhaled by its user, we decided together that our annual way to honor our marriage will forevermore be to purchase/donate 100 trees.Those trees grow, give shade, prevent erosion around rivers, and feed people. And to learn about the humble miracle that is the moranga tree please see the Trees For Life website. Please see it anyway. They are doing some great things very smartly. Both myself and my husband can't to this day imagine a better gift to give. The recipient gets to know that in their name: trees are to be strategically planted to grow and help people in need at many locations around the globe.Humanitarian, environmentally helpful, hunger and disease fighting... all in a single romantic and effective package. Trees For Life makes that possible.

It is the first school for miles around, in an area with no roads, electricity, phones or any other modern conveniences (we arrived by dugout canoe!)  Through Books for Life we were able to outfit the school with hundreds of new schoolbooks, written for Central American children.  There were textbooks and storybooks, for students of all ages.   They also sent large, colorful maps & posters for the walls. All the materials are of the best quality, and arrived in excellent condition.  They turned a simple concrete building into a real school!  Dedication day was pretty overwhelming for us and the townspeople.  Over 100 children attend this school today, learning to read & write - a chance they might never have had.

Trees For Life	48877	1	/users/profile/50088	steverino1	Board Member	5	07/28/2010	I met Balbir in 1984 and we''ve been friends since. He was just in the process of giving birth to Trees For Life and I felt then and still feel it is a kind of paradigm for what helping institutions will become in the future, simple, family-like groups dedicated to empowering people who are often overlooked or exploited by more powerful institutions. The focus is on helping people achieve what they want to achieve by listening to them and joining with them so that what is gained is prized by the receiver since the receiver has worked hard to achieve the goal or project and hasn't just been the recipient of money or goods and services supplied by a donor without any effort on the part of the recipient to share in the work and responsibility.
Trees For Life	47167	1	/users/profile/47943	tcurry29	Volunteer	5	06/30/2010	I became friends with Treva and Balbir through my sister who was a journalist doing a story on Trees for Life.  Over the years my children and I would help out at the office and enjoy the "communal" lunches.  During that time I was working for a well-respected investment manager who managed $350 million in charitable foundation funds.  In talking to him one day about non-profits, he said "it is much easier to build the wealth initially, than to find disciplined non-profits in which to contribute to".  He used Trees for Life as an example of a movement that astutely balances business efficiency and deep compassion. I have contributed to Trees for Life, but more than that I have loved each and everyone of them.  Balbir (and all of them) have set a barometer for me to live by.  As David says, "It is not about changing the world...it is about loving the world.  It is about offering a hand so that others may live, and offering my heart so that I may live.  The change that the world truly needs is the change in me, the opening of my heart".
Trees For Life	45578	2	/users/profile/46462	kathy25	Volunteer	5	06/24/2010	My husband and I were full-time volunteers for Trees for Life for 7-l/2 years, 3 of which were spent in India as volunteer teachers of conversational English at a school for 1200 poverty-level children.  We also helped establish a medical lab at the school and helped teach computers to students and teachers.  Our experience there stands out as the most extraordinary years of our lives.  The school provides a 21st century education to children, many of whom are first-generation learners, whose parents earn about $1 a day.  These children would not be likely to attend school if Trees for Life did not support this school.Trees for Life's philosophy is all about empowering people, whether it's kids attending school or people in a village who want to build a school or a library, drill a water well, improve the health of their community or plant trees ... all of which are the kinds of projects Trees for Life works with communities in developing countries to create.I found Trees for Life to be a personal growth experience.  The leadership is always interested in a volunteer's personal growth as much as "production" of any project.  It is a spiritual place to work, without being religious. Trees for Life uses its resources very judiciously.  Contributions stretch a long way because of a strong volunteer base and an ethic of conservative money management.Volunteers of all ages, races, nationalities, and sexual orientations have found a welcome home at Trees for Life.  If someone is searching for his/her niche in life, no matter what stage of life, Trees for Life might just be the place to figure that out and have a great experience in the process!

Trees For Life	34651	1	/users/profile/35522	bleader	Volunteer	5	04/05/2010	On my first visit to Trees for Life, I was extremely impressed with those who worked there and with the volunteers. After hearing from Mr. Mathur, I was telling him that I thought he was doing a wonderful work on behalf of those in very needy circumstances. He said that for him, the work made him feel as though he was privileged to "dance with the angels" each day. In 2009, my husband & I were involved in a children's book drive in as many areas of Kansas as we could, to collect books to build a library in Ethopia. The person in Ethopia who made this request to Trees for Life,now provides a cart to regularly take more books to the rural areas. We saw a video of the cart entering a small village & the sides of the road were lined with children waiting to see that months delivery. Mr. Mathur was able to talk a large grocery chain into having boxes where people could drop the books when they did their grocery shopping. I find the organization to be very caring; the volunteers that work reqularly there are very pleased with the outcomes of their efforts.

Trees For Life	34204	9	/users/profile/35024	jedosan	Volunteer	5	03/30/2010	This is an organization about which there are not enough superlatives.  Balbir, the founder and guiding light, is someone about whom enough superlatives cannot be articulated.  He is surrounding by a loving and caring "family" of similar persuasion, and the net result is an organization that makes phenomenally effective use of a very, very low level of funding.  There is so much selfless giving going out of that organization, and they all genuinely receive abundant energy back from those who they serve.  Balbir has started a movement (as he is fond of calling "Trees for Life"), and that movement must not be allowed to wither on the vine.One of the big recent disappointments is the fact that a few years ago, I nominated Balbir Mathur for a "Man of Peace / Person of Peace" award, and he was not given it.  This was a rather sizable monetary award that Peace Cereal (my favorite breakfast cereal) was making annually, but appears to have since discontinued.In my capacity serving for 4 years as the inaugural Editor-in-Chief of the Trees for Life Journal, I witnessed time and again the love and compassion emanating from Trees for Life.  If there had been a way that I could have served with them on a full-time basis, I would love to have done that.  Perhaps when I approach retirement they will have a place for me and hope to return to their embrace.  Until then, I continue with my public health research which may ultimately make me a more useful contributor to the Trees for Life movement.

Whenever I visit they're generous with their time, information, and if it's mealtime, even with their food! I especially love how they partner with communities to teach them to be self-sufficient, not dependent on handouts. With TFL's help, the communities become active partners in designing and implementing solutions to their challenges.

The people are great; it's easy to feel connected at TFL on so many levels. It's also a very exciting place to volunteer because everyone is so enthusiastic about all the projects going on, from the Books for Life bookdrive to the educational lessons being developed for low-income countries. The teamwork is incredible. I appreciate TFL giving me the opportunity to apply skills I have just learned in college. I am able to develop my strengths as well as work on life skills with a very compassionate and dedicated group. TFL is definitely an inspiring place to be. For me, my position at TFL is my ideal job in life. As TFL is empowering people in other countries in many ways, it also has empowered me with job skills, life skills, and a meaningful purpose in life.
Trees For Life	32611	9	/users/profile/33435	jeanne-smith	Volunteer	5	03/06/2010	I first learned about Trees for Life when we first moved to Kansas around 1982. It was still in its inception at the time. My family followed it with great interest, particulary because it focuses on world hunger and education which are passions of ours. As we learned to know the organization more intimately, Trees for Life became not just another non-profit for us. I began to see how it was a miracle in progress.  A number of years later our son decided to volunteer for a while for Trees for Life. He lived on the premesis and loved working there so much that he stayed with the organization for 1 1/2 years before continuing on to graduate school. His time with Trees for Life changed his outlook on life, and he still does short-term volunteer work at Trees for Life when he comes home to Kansas. My personal experiece with Trees for Life came after I retired when I began volunteering once a week with the organization. My tasks focused around working with the 100,000 books for Liberia drive in 2008-2009. The country's minister of education had approached Trees for Life's Books for Life program and asked if we could help them. Local school districts donated thousands of used textbooks and library books for the Liberian children. My job was to sort through the books and make decisions regarding appropriateness and condition. It was an exciting adventure. Many groups from Wichita came to help, and it became a community effort. Books lined the halls and filled the rooms ... a book lover's dream come true. Books were everywhere! My most startling moment came several months later when I took time off to go on a trip with my husband's students. Two weeks later when I returned, to my surprise, an the books were finished - sorted, packed, and even sent! Trees for Life had made an all out effort to pull in groups of volunteers to sort the remaining books and get them on their way to Liberia. It is a gratifying feeling to know that school books that otherwise would have been discarded are today being used to educate an entire country of children who otherwise had little hope for a future. Trees for Life has an amazing capacity that enables miracles to happen.

CREW Network Foundation	235181	1	/users/profile/314530	mmclucas	Donor	5	12/09/2014	I served as Chapter Champion for the CREW Network Foundation this past year for the Charlotte NC Chapter which was my first major introduction into the value and benefits CREW Network offers. I  learned through the delegate process about the many resources available from CREW Network for women and their careers at all levels. I had agreed to participate in our local  mentoring program but had never participated in a formal process. The whitepapers available from CREW Foundation gave me direct access to ten women and their experiences in a process I was embarking on....being considered  seasoned in my career, I am excited relevant programming and resources are available to me personally. CREW Foundation also is active in promoting real estate careers in young women. My daughter personally benefitted from CREW Foundation by being awarded one of the Network Foundation scholarships in 2014. She has already received benefits and exposure young women do not normally have the opportunity to be exposed through unless in an environment specifically focused on building women like CREW Network. I was so proud to see the notes she took and engage in the conversations she had about the speakers at convention and networking available in Miami this year. There is no question she has more confidence in herself as a student, leader and future career person after the experiences over the past year through CREW. I believe strongly in the CREW Network Foundation and so excited me and my daughter were able to participate in so many ways this year!
CREW Network Foundation	234882	2	/users/profile/305411	lfern	Donor	5	12/03/2014	Women with successful careers in commercial real estate should be searching for avenues to help the next generation. CREW Network Foundation presents that opportunity, building the future through scholarships, research and mentoring. Significantly, from what I observed, the fundraising is what I would call "fat free" and the $$ end up directly advancing the mission.  For this reason, I am more than happy to support as a donor and volunteer.
CREW Network Foundation	234810	1	/users/profile/303883	SydneeStein	Donor	4	12/02/2014	The CREW Foundation has impressed me a great deal.  The primary reason for this is because the organization is fiscally responsible, which is not always the case with non profits.  That fiscal responsability allows CREW to make many benefits available to its members and recipients of foundation dollars, in all its forms.  Additionally, I enjoy participating with an organization who is so invested in the improvement of career paths for women.  I would whole heartedly make the same choice with my donations and am proud to be a donor to the CREW Foundation.
CREW Network Foundation	234795	2	/users/profile/294121	ldrury	Donor	5	12/02/2014	As the CREW Network Foundation Champion for CREW St. Louis, I have grown to appreciate the value and benefits it provides to members and future real estate career opportunities for women.  Increasing awareness of the scholarship endowment has landed St. Louis two native scholars and helped our members see where their dollars are going.  I speak from experience with the benefits of the benchmark studies and white papers helping with compensation discussions and how to grow in leadership.  Locally, we are able to engage with high school and college women to inform them of the wide range of careers in real estate as well as the students teaching us a thing or two about reaching out to them--mostly through social media. You cannot put a price on the value CREW Network Foundation brings to its members, but we can continue to educate our members on how they can support and make an impact no matter the contribution.
CREW Network Foundation	234741	1	/users/profile/302925	Vbrunk	Volunteer	5	12/01/2014	I joined the CREW Network in 2014 and the experience has been top notch ever since first setting foot inside the door. The sense of community was immediately apparent among the members and beyond just building networks, everyone was extremely intentional on building relationships. I have not only had the opportunity to expand my business in the Northern Colorado area thanks to CREW but have expanded my knowledge of resources around in the surrounding areas. I am excited to see what lies ahead for CREW Northern Colorado and how we can continue to build our community together!

It has been an eye opening experience for me seeing first hand all of the incredible work that is being done at CREW Network and CREW chapters across the country.  The mission of empowering and promoting women in commercial real estate is being meet with diversity to impact as many people as possible.  The programs offered include scholarships, mentoring, leadership, awards and exposure to the dynamic national CREW Network conferences.  This organization takes it mission very seriously and it's team of dedicated staff and volunteers are making a huge impact!
CREW Network Foundation	234722	1	/users/profile/302779	Trish G.	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/30/2014	I was a Scholarship recipient of the CREW Network Foundation to help further my graduate education in Commercial Real Estate. Crew Network provides scholarships, mentoring with industry professionals, and membership for a year. Membership provides the opportunity to grow in a plethora of educational and networking opportunities, and the coup de great is the opportunity to attend the CREW Convention where 1000's of successful women bolster each other to perpetuate careers in real estate. Some of the speakers this year were Steve Forbes, Katty Kay, and Hillary Clinton. The organization is Very well organized, well attended, growing and substantially supported by several of the worlds biggest and best real estate companies.
CREW Network Foundation	234696	1	/users/profile/85232	Collete	Donor	4	11/30/2014	I have been a supporter of CREW Network Foundation as a volunteer, a contributor and a board member. I have given my time and my money because I believe that what the organization is doing to improve (i) awareness of the talent inequities in the commercial real estate industry and (ii) preparedness of women in, and looking to join, the industry is necessary and unequalled. While many firms and individuals in the industry are talking about the issues surrounding gender equality, there are few really putting their time and their money behind the conversation. CREW Network Foundation is doing all of that and more. The only reason why I didn't give the organization 5 stars is that it is limited in its range due to the limitations of funding. I believe that if more funds were available to support the organization's programming it would "far exceed" expectations. 
CREW Network Foundation	234615	1	/users/profile/301518	S3Creative	Donor	5	11/28/2014	CREW Foundation has been instrumental in empowering younger women by educating and providing opportunities in commercial real estate. I have personally seen the impact with several of our local UCREW students. They have gone from our UCREW program, internships and then to careers in prominent companies. CREW Foundation not only serves as an educational resource for younger women interested in the industry, it also continues to remind each of us, that have established careers in the industry, how important it is to share our stories with the younger generation. I have personally donated, and will continue!

As the President of the IndyCREW chapter, one of my missions was to get our chapter committed to fund raising and donating.  Our chapter has successfully raised and donated over $5,000 this year.  Our Board also has 100% donor participation this year. The money supports the very worthy and under served purpose of providing scholarships, as well as funding much needed cutting edge research.  I personally will continue to support the foundation, and hope that our chapter will continue their support for the foundation in the future as well.

Currently, as a CREW Network Foundation Champion Director my journey has intersected with extraordinary leaders and provided the ability to develop new friendships across the U.S. and in Canada.  I believe that time is our most valuable asset.  The time that I have committed to CNF has enriched my life.  Embracing the CNF mission is important to me because through contributions and commitment of time, I am a small participant in a vision that is changing the dynamics of our commercial real estate industry.  Supporting CNF is also close to my heart as it allows me to honor my parent's philosophies in supporting education.  The opportunity to meet some of the CNF scholarship recipients was inspiring.  I found our scholars to be intelligent women, who will bring the strength of new talent to our industry and a willingness to participate in giving back.

CREW Network has helped me advance in my career as well as connect me with women that are leaders in all facets of the commercial real estate industry. I have always believed in paying it forward and CREW Network Foundation is the best platform to do so. It focuses on research and scholarships that work to advance women in commercial real estate. I have had the pleasure of working with the scholars and it fires me up to see the talent entering into the industry. The scholarships assist with entry into the field and the research help guide women in their choices as they navigate their careers. Currently,  a critical focus of the research is guiding women to leadership positions. The work being done is stellar.

Since joining CREW Network through the Kansas City chapter four years ago, it has been my pleasure to support this worthy foundation who does so much good to promote women in the commercial real estate industry.  One way I enjoy making an impact with my gifts is to honor our chapter officers and name the gift for them.  A great way to do good for other women and put a smile on women I admire and appreciate.

I'm a 2014 recipient of the CREW Network Foundation scholarship, and the combination of funds and support have made such a difference in my current path. As a graduating senior, I've had the opportunity to connect with local women in the industry, explore new careers I had never considered, and gain knowledge from successful women who have already "been there, done that"! I couldn't be more grateful to be in the space of hundreds of dedicated individuals, nor more excited to be a part of such a dynamic and beneficial organization. 
CREW Network Foundation	234349		/users/profile/298505	yvetteturner	Volunteer	5	11/23/2014	As a small private organization, we rarely have the opportunity to sponsor and support worthwhile causes because of our internal policies and procedures.  However, CREW has been paramount for me in establishing fruitful and rewarding relationships.  These relationships have enhanced my ability to perform my role in all property management related-areas through connections with vendors and other colleagues in my specialized aspects.  It has also become very important for me to surround myself with so many successful, educated, ambitious women who are like-minded.  I realize that I am not alone and that I can lean on and learn from each CREW member despite their area of expertise.  And for these reasons, I happily support the CREW organization through donations and time.

The philanthropic outreach programs that CNF supports have really made a difference in bringing opportunities to women interested in a career that will support them (and their families). Between the college and graduate school scholarships and internships, the mentoring programs, our signature U CREW program (our university outreach), and CREW Careers, we are introducing girls and women to a very productive and potentially very successful career path.

Their mentoring and educational support of young women in commercial real estate is commendable and something for which their membership should take great pride.

Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	137531		/users/profile/63773	MalcolmSLC	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/12/2012	When it comes to great nonprofits, I believe Music Theatre of Wichita sets the gold standard. Here is my experience. I was finishing graduate studies in arts administration, pondering the gloomy arts outlook, when a friend suggested I come to Wichita to check out MTW and meet Wayne Bryan. It was just the boost I needed. Bryan became a mentor and showed me possibilities. I met a man with great charisma and passion for the arts, an artistic director who possessed the rare combination of creative vision mixed with business and marketing savvy. I met the core Music Theatre of Wichita staff -- Nancy, Vickie, Mary Sue, Bethany -- all delightful, talented, and equally committed to building the MTW dream. I met Board Members with diverse backgrounds and expertise. I sat in on rehearsals and marveled at the range of talent. Broadway veterans mixed freely with interns, all collaborating with a sense of joy and pride in what they were creating. At the evenings performance, I witnessed Bryan come out upon the stage to affectionate cheers followed by hushed, rapt attention as he introduced the evenings tale to an audience hungry for escape. The performance did not disappoint; it was accomplished on all levels. After, Bryan took his position in the lobby, thanking and interacting with audience members as they exited into the night carrying some of the magic with them. Something very special is going on at Century II! My interaction with Wayne Bryan and Music Theatre of Wichita took me from a low ebb to a place of hope for the future of live performance. MTWichita is making a difference. That is why I wanted to include my voice in these reviews. For when it comes to great nonprofits, I believe Music Theatre of Wichita sets the gold standard and provides a golden opportunity for patrons, foundations, corporate sponsors, individual donors -- all who want to ally with a successful and deserving arts organization. Which reminds me  time to pull out my own checkbook 
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	34304	4	/users/profile/35123	patcasken	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/31/2010	I have performed in four shows for MTW, and each time has been a splendid experience! The production quality is of Broadway caliber, and the people who run the company are the best! (Wayne Bryan once came to see me in a show at another theatre, and after that cast met and talked with him, they all said "Now, THAT'S what an Artistic Director should be!") Performers often give up longer-running "gigs" in order to work for MTW, because they know that they will be part of a production they can be proud of and look back on with joy for a lifetime.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	34237	4	/users/profile/35062	jseabough	General Member of the Public	5	03/30/2010	MTW is the best! I live in Kansas City where we do have summer theatre (Starlight) and there is also Muny in St. Louis. I drive down to Wichita and see the great shows and have done this now for 10 seasons. Lots of great talent at MTW.Wayne Bryan, the producing director, his associates Mark Madama, Nancy Reeves, Josh Larson and Roger Castellano are the best! Music Theatre of Wichita reminds me of what  Starlight Theatre, here in Kansas City, use to be before that venue started booking national tours. Music Theatre of Wichita produces all of their own shows. And it's a great starting place for musical theatre students who want a career in professional theatre.Love my MTW!
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	34021	4	/users/profile/34839	traci1	Board Member	5	03/26/2010	We love the shows. Our children have been coming since they were so small they brought pillows with them to sit on!  Now, one of our daughters is old enough to be in the Target Teen Choir that performs before the shows and she has gained so much confidence from the encouragement and positive energy of the MTW Staff.  They are great, positive people providing superb shows and great energy in the community!!

Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	30318	4	/users/profile/31316	sonny1	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	My wife and I have had season tickets to MTWichita productions since 1976 and have only missed one production in all this time. We go to dinner with about 12 others before eachperformance and always look forward to each production with great anticipation.  We have been able to attend musical theatre  performances on Broadway, West End in London, and venues in Kansas City, Las Vegas, and other locations. MTWichita prductions are at least as good and in most cases better than any of these.  Their productions are definitely Broadway quality or better.  Our city is fortunate to have Wayne Brysn and his capable staff who continue to develop and make available this excellent entertainment as well as the educational opportunity for the young musical theatre students that make up the summer company and teen choir.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29991	4	/users/profile/30982	jaybird58	Volunteer	5	02/23/2010	I have been attending MTW productions for many years and the Quality is worthy of a Broadway production. By using some local performers along with the national talent it not only gives the young people expierience with top professionals it encourages the local arts. The production of Les Miserables two seasons ago was fantastic. The use  of Faith Northcutt as young Cosette and Gavin Meyer of Wichita was a great opportunity to see a couple very talented young people.

Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29916	12	/users/profile/30911	jerryandjan	Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	Music Theatre of Wichita is exceptional!  We are truly blessed to have such a great summer theater experience here in Wichita.  My husband Jerry has been involved with MTW for years as their photographer, so he is well aware of what goes into each production.  The quality of the performances is amazing and some of the most talented performers in the country have not only appeared on the MTW stage, but have gone on to make their careers on Broadway, on film and television.  Both of us are also involved as Jester Awards judges, a program which promotes local high school productions and talent.  MTW very actively supports and encourages young people throughout the area who are interested in theatre.  Music Theatre of Wichita is without a doubt one of THE best things that has ever happened to Wichita!

Words don't do justice to the pleasure and joy MTWichita has been to myself and my family. I have not only attended the productions, but have been involved with their audition process and their Jester program designed to recognize high school music theatre programs and individuals. My life would have been considerably poorer without my relationship with MTWichita. Additionally, for nearly 40 years they have produced five musical theatre shows of the highest quality that can be seen anywhere.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29834	6	/users/profile/30823	johnfricke	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2010	I've enjoyed an ongoing association with Music Theatre of Wichita for well over fifteen years. Some of my appreciation has grown from viewing their work from afar and following the extraordinary but ongoing quality of production they manifest, season after season. I've admired at closer range their audition and preproduction processes when they've spent their annual working visits to New York City. And on three occasions, I've been privileged to serve on-site there in Kansas, helping to promote and publicize two productions of THE WIZARD OF OZ and another of MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS.  In my own four decades (plus) of sporadic professional musical theater employment, I've never known a finer aggregation than that assembled, onstage and off, by Wayne Bryan and his compatriots. They never fail to meet (and they generally surpass) their stated goals of offering exemplary entertainment, managing their facility as an intelligent business concession, and providing compassionate and first-class training for those in their orbit.

Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29796	4	/users/profile/30788	sierra1	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/22/2010	Music Theatre of Wichita is one of those "hidden gems" that the majority of the people who live here don't even understand. MTW's performances are on par with, and often exceed ANYTHING I have seen on Broadway. And there's a good reason for that. Many of MTW's alumi are on Broadway at any given time. Wayne Bryan has an eye for picking (and training) talent that has the potential to be on Broadway. In fact, many Broadway producers say when they see "Music Theatre of Wichita" on someone's resume they are more likely to give that person an interview! We have truly been blessed with Wayne Bryan's talents and abilities! And because he's so amazing the majority of stars on Broadway he's mentored come back to appear in MTW performances every year. So when you attend a MTW performance, you're not only seeing the stars of tomorrow, you are getting a chance to see the Broadway stars of TODAY at a much better ticket price!
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29684	9	/users/profile/30694	megbhs65	Volunteer	5	02/21/2010	My husband and I have been season ticket holders at MTWichita since the mid-seventies.  During that time we have seen the theatre's productions go from sometimes awkward renderings with less capable leads to the tryly accomplished and polished productions that we look forward to each summer.  While we have yet to make it to NY we have seen  "Broadway" musical theatre productions in London and other locales and MTWichita need take no backseat by comparison.  In fact they equal or surpass anything we've seen anywhere!     For sometime it has been my privilege to serve on the Board of Directors and be privy to the day-to-day workings of this fabulous organization.  In addition to presenting top flight musical theatre entertainment, its support and encouragement of up and coming local and midwestern talent is a model which all regional theatres would do well to examine.     As the anticipation of the summer season begins to mount, I'm like a child at Christmas waiting to see what wonderful gifts will unfold on stage.  The only sad aspect of the whole process is that the season is over all too quickly and leaving us wanting more!

Music Theatre of Wichita has been the highlight of my musical theatre career. Once you've worked there, you are considered a member of the family for life.I've also had the pleasure of seeing shows at Music Theatre of Wichita when I'm not in the cast, so can say that the productions are of  the highest quality. I travel to New York and don't even go to shows there because I know they won't compare to Music Theatre of Wichita!The professionalism is top notch, from Wayne Bryan, the Producing Artistic Director, all the way thru the staff and volunteers. AMAZING group of people who all work towards bringing the arts to the people in the best way possible.I'm HONORED to know them all.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29601	8	/users/profile/30611	joy2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/21/2010	There are not enough superlatives to heap upon this fabulous organization.  When I met director Wayne Bryan, I was so impressed with him that I flew from California to Wichita to see his production of Camelot.  The production values were first-rate, comparable to what I've seen in New York and San Francisco.  While shopping and dining in Wichita, I met salespeople, waiters, and production staff members who all raved about Wayne and the shows he creates.  One woman called him "The Treasure of Wichita."  The entire organization is suffused with enthusiasm and esprit de corps, which is apparent on stage.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29588	3	/users/profile/30599	nc1	Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	In the last 20 years Music Theatre of Wichita has not only entertained its audience.  They have not only brought the highest quality of Musical Theatre to this community,but has involved each and every school in the area in so many ways.  Their teen choir has not only entertained but has served as a training ground in musical theater. Their Jester awards brings an interest in music theatre to the same heights that a good football team brings to a school.They have enhanced the quality of life in Wichita as has no other arts organization.  As a former board member I realize they put on more and better shows on a low budget and small staff than probably any theatre in the country.  It is the most noteworthy of arts organizations to support.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29584	3	/users/profile/30595	tara1	Former staff	5	02/20/2010	I've worked in the paint shop at Music Theatre for 6 years and really feel that I've grown up as an artist there.  I've advanced within the company and feel that my work there has defined the artist I've become.  Though the schedule is demanding, I know that the pressure has forced me to expand my knowledge and technique to match the high level of quality we all expect form the company.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29569	7	/users/profile/30580	ehansen	General Member of the Public	5	02/20/2010	MTW is a rare find and a cultural treasure. As a seasoned travel journalist, I see it as a remarkable attraction with a very positive impact on the community and on the region in general.Obviously, MTW contributes to the local economy by creating employment opportunities, but they also draw attendance from the entire Midwest, and that creates more jobs in the hospitality industry. I've traveled from California on several occasions to attend performances - it's closer than New York and just as good.Wayne Bryan also makes a huge effort to educate local young people in the theatre arts - thereby expanding their options for career opportunities
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29544	7	/users/profile/30560	kirsche	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/20/2010	I've worked in theatres across the country (and overseas) for over twenty years and return to Wichita whenever possible to renew my sense of connection with the art form and audience. Wayne Bryan is a unique talent, an impresario who truly loves musical theatre and continually finds new ways to delight and challenge his loyal audiences. The staff, artists and hosts of volunteers seem to recognize the unique value of their contributions and the results can be seen in the quality of the productions.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29543	4	/users/profile/30558	thomas-douglas	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/20/2010	My experience has been the mostly thrilling musical and theatrical experiences of my life so far.  I've been involved for the last decade and wouldn't trade any of the years.  The producer is one of the best theatre practitioners, businessman and all around great person.  He's one of a kind and the success of the company trickles down.  The company is committed to excellence in production and education for the many young people involved.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29536	3	/users/profile/30550	happycamper2	Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	MTWichita presents performances of the highest quality, year after year. Wayne Bryan, the Director, has an uncanny ability to attract superb talent and the shape that talent into a superb performer. By example, MTWichita has elevated the quality of other musical ventures in this community.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29515	7	/users/profile/30529	pf63	Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	As someone who has seen over 9,000 theatrical attractions in my life -- and more than 75% of all the Broadway musicals in the last 50 years -- I am in utter awe of Music Theatre of Wichita. Wayne Bryan is nothing less than a theatrical magician in the way that he gets a show up in no time flat and makes it ultra-professional. He knows what his audiences want to see, and sometimes lets THEM know what they would like to see by giving them an unfamiliar but terrific new show. I love attending and seeing the appreciative -- and large -- crowds responding to the work, and afterwards rushing up to Wayne to tell him that he's once again succeeded. This is one of the great musical theaters in the nation, and one of the places to which we can all point with pride.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29502	7	/users/profile/30517	bowserthegreat	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/20/2010	I have worked at Music Theatre of Wichita for 5 seasons now. Ever since my first, in 2002, the company has seemed like home to me. Working there I have met some of my closest friends and most respected business associates. The quality put into our productions is of the upmost care and consideration within every shop and rehearsal hall. MTW's staff is professional yet caring-a characteristic few can manage. In all, I get excited about March in anticipation of the fun I will and the challenges we will meet during the summer.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29439	10	/users/profile/30459	us71367	Board Member	5	02/19/2010	I've had exposure to Music Theatre of Wichita both as a patron and as a volunteer.  As a patron, I can honestly say that the quality of entertainment I get is so much more than I expected when I moved here five years ago.  The shows are fresh and fun and a great value for the price.  As a volunteer, I feel I am greatly appreciated and my ideas/input are heard and considered.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29432	3	/users/profile/30454	fan	Board Member	5	02/19/2010	MTWichita is one of Wichita's cultural gems.  It is a point of great civic pride that "we" produce a season of excellent-quality shows that rival those on Broadway, out here in the Midwest, and at a fraction of the price.  It is a big part of what makes the quality of life in Wichita so good.
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29402	4	/users/profile/30427	steve9	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	Having traveled extensively throughout the United States, I was amazed and astounded to discover MTWichita some 10 years ago.  the quality of their performances rivals New York & London.  The mission of MTWichita will insure music theatre for years to come as they involve so many young people and high schools in their educational venues (Jester's awards).  Am I ever a fan!!!
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29251	5	/users/profile/30281	wichitan	General Member of the Public	5	02/19/2010	It has been our pleasure to be season ticket holders for MTW for over 25 years.  Each summer we are treated to wonderful shows, talented performers, great scenery, and high quality theater experience.  The organization is an important part of Wichita's cultural experience, and gets rave reviews from many who regularly see New York shows.  Thanks, congratulations, and keep up the great work!  We love it!
Music Theatre of Wichita Inc	29155	6	/users/profile/30191	liz2	Professional with expertise in this field	5	02/19/2010	Going to MTW shows are a high-light of my Summer! Festival of Broadway is also a favorite part of the River Festival. I feel extremely lucky to live in a city that features productions of this caliber. I'm looking forward to next season! Keep up the great work. :)
Olathe Civic Band Inc	32037	4	/users/profile/32845	marshall	General Member of the Public	5	03/01/2010	I know this is a day late, but just wanted to say that I have heard the band play and they are very talented musicians,  very polite, visited with the public before and after the concert. It is always a pleasure to listen to their great concerts
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31950	6	/users/profile/32772	vfessler1	Board Member	5	02/28/2010	I have been a member of the Olathe Civic Band for 18 years. I'm also on the board because I want to contribute back to the organization that has provided so much enjoyment and fulfillment for me. This group provides a positive, meaningful experience not only for the audience members, but also for the musicians. The Band is a cornerstone for art and culture in this community, playing for many civic events throughout the summer and fall. Their subsidiary group, the Olathe Civic Jazz Band, also contributes greatly to the community by playing in venues where the larger concert band may be difficult and by playing all year long. All members are volunteers and play for the sheer love of making music. We all share a special comrodery.  My life would be incomplete without this wonderful group of people and the great audiences who come and hear us play.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31919	3	/users/profile/32756	prairie9to1	General Member of the Public	4	02/28/2010	The wife and I attended civic bands in the Seattle area and you would think they would have plenty of talent to draw from. We both agree that the OCB is far better and the approach to their activities is well thought out and much appreciated. The members show that they truly enjoy their participation and display their talents well. We look forward to the 2010 sessions.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31813	4	/users/profile/32655	arab699	General Member of the Public	5	02/28/2010	I had the opportunity to see this amazing band during the Christmas holiday season! They do a wonderful thing for the veterans and their families! They are very professional and super friendly. If your ever in the Olathe or Kansas City area I highly suggest you check them out.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31526	11	/users/profile/32396	apple1	Volunteer	5	02/27/2010	I have performed with this band since 2004. I believe it is the best band in Kansas. We play a nice variety, marches, show tunes, and classical. We play several concerts a year, all free, including a children's concert and a concert at a retirement home. Especially touching is our Memorial Day concert, where veterans stand for their service anthem.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31477	4	/users/profile/32354	oboe4	Board Member	4	02/26/2010	I have performed with the band for the last 15 years and it has been a wonderful experience.  The band has provided an outlet for musicians of various ages to perform quality music, keep up their playing abilities and further their enjoyment that music brings to their lives.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31446	10	/users/profile/32331	wconner30	Volunteer	5	02/26/2010	As others have commented, the Olathe Civic Band provides wonderful music at a variety of public venues and for underserved audiences around the community.    Equally important is that the Band also represents a valuable musical outlet for its members.  I am a strong advocate on behalf of opportunities for people to have direct hands-on experiences that deepen their connection to the arts, and enrich their lives in ways that attendance alone at performances or exhibitions cannot achieve.  The Olathe Civic Band is an outstanding example of this principle.  It is an inter-generational group of musicians, and we all embrace the same goal  to make good music together and share it with our community.  No auditions are held, and consequently this experience is open to all.  The Bands strong music quality becomes self-fulfilling as it encourages each of us, individually and collectively, to work hard and learn during rehearsal, and perform at our best.  This, and the intrinsic satisfaction that accompanies it, are the very essence of public participation in the arts.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31305	10	/users/profile/32209	rpapon	General Member of the Public	5	02/26/2010	My wife and I are huge fans of musical performance. We love going to the local performances of shows, orchestras, or bands. We found the Olathe Civic Band by searching an events list and seeing them performing that same night! They were a very well directed, talented, and diverse group. That was two years ago, and ever since my wife and I have taken active roles in the band. They are extremely welcoming, and continue to impress beyond expectations. If you get the opportunity to see them, please take advantage of it. You will not be disappointed.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31178	11	/users/profile/32099	mamaw	General Member of the Public	5	02/26/2010	We have been going to the OCB concerts for more years than I can remember--at least 11 or 12 for sure.  It is a wonderful group and you can tell the members really enjoy what they are doing--they must since they do not get paid.  We love the Christmas concert and all the other concerts and also really enjoy the Jazz Band.  One thing we would like is if they could get more support so they could have more concerts.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	31135	6	/users/profile/32060	valellis	General Member of the Public	5	02/25/2010	I was invited by a friend of mine to attend an Olathe Civic Band concert who was performing a Christmas Program.  I had no idea of what to expect as it had been a long time since I had been to a band concert.  I invited my mother and we were both so very pleasantly surprised!  One minute I was laughing at the band's light-hearted comedy and the next minute I was in tears because the music was just so beautiful.  The Olathe Civic Band is a very talented organization.  We enjoyed that concert so much and I now have a new-founded appreciation for band music.  It opened my eyes to one of the many aspects of culture that this area has to offer.  Thank you, Valarie Ellis
Olathe Civic Band Inc	30792	11	/users/profile/31742	suzeln	Volunteer	5	02/25/2010	I've been a band member for 8 years.  The concerts are entertaining for the entire family and are fun to participate in.  The friends I've made because of the Civic Band has been priceless as well.

Olathe Civic Band Inc	30714	3	/users/profile/31665	r-kern	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	I have been playing with the Olathe Civic Band now for about 6 years or so and have enjoyed it immensely.  Because of the instrument I play, not many venues come open for me to use it so I was excited when I discovered the OCB. And the musicians that I play with are top notch so it is truly a joy to perform with them. I can't say enough good things about the band and what an opportunity they have opened up to me to play my instrument!
Olathe Civic Band Inc	30673	4	/users/profile/31630	concertgoer	General Member of the Public	5	02/24/2010	I have attended OCB concerts for several years now. From concerts at the Mahaffie Stagecoach Stop and Farmstead to Veteran's Day concerts and holiday concerts. The music is enjoyable and the group carries on a rich tradition.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	30656	3	/users/profile/31616	ed3	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	I started playing with the Olathe Civic Band about eight years ago, after hearing several of their concerts.  They sounded great, and after Ed Colson told the crowd that anyone could join the band at any time and that there were no auditions, I was in!  Not only is the band filled with good musicians, it is filled with people that are nice and fun to be around.  The crowds seem to like our playing, and it's nice to be playing again.  Plus, in addition to joining this group, it's allowed me the opportunity to join and play in other concert and symphonic type bands in the Greater KC metro area.  I don't know what my life would be like without playing in a group such as the Olathe Civic Band, but I imagine it wouldn't be as fun.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	30607	1	/users/profile/31570	lori2	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	I just started playing with OCS this past summer (2009) after I hadn't played since college (2006). Despite my lack of recent practicing, the music was certainly fun to play and it was nice to get out in the community.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	30573	1	/users/profile/31538	beckys32	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	I played in the band for the first time this past summer and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Olathe Civic Band Inc	30533	1	/users/profile/31501	terri2	Client Served	5	02/24/2010	I am the spouse of a member of the Olathe Civic Band and Jazz Band - and I have been enjoying their performances and concerts for many years.  And the best thing is that they just get better and better!  This is a group of dedicated musicians who value music and the enjoyment it brings enough to give of their time to bring it to our citizens.  Watching this diverse group (ages, professions, ability, experience) is such a positive experience.  Our friends who don't play regularly join us for concerts - and bring their children, grandchildren and friends.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	30527	1	/users/profile/31496	dennis3	Volunteer	5	02/24/2010	The Olathe Civic Band has provided me with the opportunity to continue with my love of music and performing.

Olathe Civic Band Inc	29804	1	/users/profile/30796	roger11	Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	I am a new member of the OCB and have found it to be a great challenge; but at the same time have learned to appreciate what it takes to make a "big band" sound come together. Everyone is there for the same reason; the OCB provides a venue for all of us to play a wide variety of music to a wide listening audience; from veterans to children to senior citizens.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	29752	3	/users/profile/30748	saxplayerlw	Volunteer	5	02/22/2010	I have had a great experience playing in the band with my daughter.

Olathe Civic Band Inc	29558	6	/users/profile/30573	sprint1	Volunteer	5	02/20/2010	My love for Music and performance has been filled by playing in the band since 1989.I played in the Jazz Band in college. In 1977 I had a stroke and did not play again until 1989.I would say that many people have been touched by the Band.  People willingly donate their talent  time each week to practices and performances

The experience has enriched our lives and we are so grateful to live in a community where we have this opportunity.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	29360	7	/users/profile/30386	kat2	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	After I graduated from college, there seemed to be no venue for playing my piccolo and flute outside of church service. Then I found the Olathe Civic Band.This wonderful organisation is open to ALL musicians, from high school players to senior citizens. It provides a band experience identical to what we were used to while in school. It also provides fellowship, friendship, and fun to the members--the only payment the musicians receive.But not only is the Band there for musicians, it's there for the community--for people who can't play but enjoy listening. Throughout the summer, the OCB offers free concerts. Most are outside, where families are welcome to bring food and let the kids dance as we play. Some are at various nursing homes, for the seniors who are shut-ins. A couple are at city events. All of the concerts are free.If the Olathe Civic Band were to disappear, not only would my life gain an empty hole, but I believe so would many others' from the entire community. The OCB fills a need, a need that unfortunately is often overlooked when budget cuts are discussed.
Olathe Civic Band Inc	29246	6	/users/profile/30275	kristen1	Volunteer	5	02/19/2010	The Olathe Civic Band is a great organization that provides music in many different venues in our community. It is also an opportunity for people of all ages to come together and share their love of music. As a younger member I keep coming back because of the valuable learning experience from seasoned musicians as well as the joy of making music for others in the community.

Not only are classroom teachers provided with materials and help for their classrooms but others at nature centers and in various organizations use KACEE programs and information to instill environmental steward ship and understanding to Kansans young and old.  With more stress on our schools to provide more with less. Supporting KACEE is essential to the understanding of our natural resources, as our children become decision makers in that future.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	170448	1	/users/profile/225817	Kathy123	Board Member	5	09/18/2013	Kacee brings professionals and lay people from a diverse array of fields together to work as one towards a more environmentally literate Kansas.  Their workshops, conferences, and cutting edge work on educational standards and legislation benefits students, educators, and other residents of the state.  The dedication of KACEE's staff, board and volunteers makes this organization a leader in the field of environmental education.  I am proud to be associated with such a great organization and have benefited both personally and professionally from my involvement with KACEE. 
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	167443		/users/profile/222309	chellegaede	Client Served	5	09/05/2013	I'm a new member of KACEE and went to my first conference in Jul.  In the past few years our school had cut conferences for teachers and I couldn't have afforded to go on my own.  KACEE awarded a scholarship to my district and I was a lucky recipient.  From the conference I learned of many resources for teachers and have taken over the Kansas Green Schools project in our school.  The staff at KACEE have helped me get it all started.  Also at the conference I broke out of my "comfort" zone and went to a physics break out session that my students will benefit from and perhaps future automobiles will benefit from getting them interested at this younger age. Through the networking with other people in the state from the KACEE I have been able to get innovative ideas to teach students in different ways.  I have a renewed excitement to teach science this year and in the next several years.  We will be working on an OWL site and a community garden.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	167428		/users/profile/222297	Jay_17	Professional with expertise in this field	5	09/05/2013	KACEE serves an essential role in the state of Kansas to keep the energy and enthusiasm of environmental educators going.  In a state as large and rural as Kansas, a networking group like this does truly crucial work.  Beyond conferences, their use of social media helps inform members of opportunities and important conversations.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	37718	1	/users/profile/38420	dolores-daniels	Volunteer	5	04/30/2010	This has been a very rewarding and interesting experience working with KACEE.  Their environmental education reaches across the State of Kansas for traditional and nontraditional environmental educators.  I am taking a vast storage of information back to my students, as well as parents, that we can spread in our community.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	37717	4	/users/profile/38419	zoochimp16	Volunteer	5	04/30/2010	Fantastic!The conferences are fun and educational, and affordable. The staff is dedicated and knowledgeable. The is great opportunity to network.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	37708	4	/users/profile/38410	staubach	Board Member	4	04/30/2010	Many rural schools benefit the environmental programs offered by KACEE. Teachers in these schools can use the materials in their classrooms to meet state science and math standards. The lesson plans are easy to use and understand.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	37121	6	/users/profile/37873	dee3	Board Member	5	04/27/2010	Shortly after moving back to Kansas 21 years ago, Ive been involved in KACEE.  For the past 16 years I have had the pleasure of serving on the KACEE Board of Directors, which includes a term as President.  I have personally and professionally benefited from participating in the various workshops offered by KACEE.  As an occasional nonformal educator, I have used the interdisciplinary curriculum, ideas, and teaching techniques generated from KACEE with school children, church associated activities with children, and even adults.  What is really heartwarming and exciting to me is to see all the creative and beneficial conservation and environmental education activities across the state of Kansas that KACEE had a direct or indirect role in.  However, Im always amazed when I hear someone who recently found out about KACEE, who was singing its praises, and commenting that they cant believe they never heard of it before.  So, we, KACEE still has its work cut out in promoting conservation and environmental education opportunities to those who care about protecting our Earth and who want to teach our young people not what to think, but how to think.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	37009	8	/users/profile/37777	kat2543	Volunteer	5	04/26/2010	KACEE is a non-profit that takes the idea of non-baised and science based environmental education to heart.  Having this resource in our state puts Kansas ahead of the rest!
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	36985	8	/users/profile/37749	schanee	Board Member	5	04/26/2010	I have been involved with KACEE since I first moved to Kansas in 1993.  It has been such a great resource for me throughout my career.  What sets it apart from many other environmental education organizations is its one-stop-shopping opportunities throughout the state.  If an educator needs information of any kind KACEE is the place to go.  It facilitates all the main stream environmental education curricula in the state and is very innovative in creating new programs for underserved populations.  Being a part of KACEE is like being a part of a large family you want to visit as much as possible!
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	36920	8	/users/profile/37683	forester	Board Member	5	04/25/2010	I am a retired forester with over 50 years of experience in the natural resources field.  I became involved with the Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education (KACEE) shortly after it was organized over 40 years ago.  KACEE was created as an association of diverse organizations dedicated to promotion of effective, science-based, non-biased environmental and conservation education throughout Kansas.  Over my career, I have served as the head of the state forestry agency and the state wildlife and parks agency as well as two years on the Governor's staff.  In these positions, I have been involved in a range of controversial natural resource issues.  Throughout the time I held these positions, I continued to be actively involved with KACEE, because I recognized that long-term solutions to our environmental problems were dependent upon an educated citizenry who could weigh various sides of complex environmental issues and make and support informed, balanced decisions.  KACEE's programs with training in hands-on problem solving and critical thinking skills seemed the approach that was needed.  KACEE is somewhat unique in that it started as an association of organizations rather than individuals and its membership has grown to over 200 agencies, non-profits, educational institutions at various levels, and business and industry.  These organizations hold widely divergent views on environmental issues, but can agree that balanced, non-biased environmental education that presents various sides on the issues is where they can agree and support a common cause.  For many years, KACEE was an all volunteer organization, but through its success, now has a small dedicated professional staff supported by a wide network of volunteers and partners.  I have found my association with KACEE and its network of partners to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
Kansas Association for Conservation and Environmental Education	36572	8	/users/profile/37364	tonyab	Board Member	5	04/22/2010	I started working with KACEE over 8 years ago when I began my environmental education career.  The KACEE staff and organizational members came alongside me and encouraged me to get involved and take on leadership roles.  I have grown as an educator, a professional, an earth-conscience human through my KACEE experiences.

Wounded Warriors United	295743		/users/profile/386523	Vickie15	Professional with expertise in this field	5	07/12/2016	I have never been so impressed with the dedication and level of volunteerism shown by WWU. I have had the pleasure of working with some great folks that are involved for all the right reasons and take no salary either!  After working in the non profit sector, this charity is the real deal and your support is 100% dedicated to the cause.  
Wounded Warriors United	295615		/users/profile/386399	Writer	Client Served	5	07/12/2016	Awesome guys that really care about vets! They don't have a payroll so everything they raise goes to the outings
Wounded Warriors United	265967	2	/users/profile/195612	Beverly13	Client Served	5	10/21/2015	I've volunteered with them in fundraising and the staff is truly amazing with hearts so big.. It leaves me with no words. In less than a heart beat they were there for us by getting roofing donated when our insurance wouldn't cover even 1/4 of the cost. There is no limit WWU would go to help veterans of any era!

Wounded Warriors United	262671	2	/users/profile/351357	Mary385	General Member of the Public	5	10/09/2015	 We met at the bear camp in Minnesota earlier in October.  Rarely am I impressed with a group or organization,  but I certainly was with this one. Tom and Andy were with everyone all weekend doing what they could for the guys and just making it an overall great experience . Skyler and JD were awesome to meet, they really gave me a new outlook on life.  They seemed to be having a great time. which is what the whole program is about.   When I donate, I don't want my money going to the people who run the program for their own personal gaines, I want it to go to the people who deserve it, and that's exactly what this Program does. If you're looking  to give something back to the men and women who gave so much for us this is the place .Mary Reetz

I connected with him and offered to help him in any way I could...What this organization does for veterans is awesome, especially since nearly all the funding goes into outdoor therapy for the veterans... I have helped donate funds, introduced retired professional athletes to WWU to assist with fundraising, and even volunteered my small 400 acre hobby farm for hunts.. WWU is an incredible organization that truly benefits the veterans!

Wounded Warriors United	262530	1	/users/profile/351214	Writer	Donor	4	10/08/2015	The Wounded Warriors United is a great organization. Tom Tavatigan is very dedicated to what he does. He goes out of his way to get wounded Soldiers together for a good cause. It is a good combat stress recovery, physical health, and wellness. Fishing trips, Turkey hunts, Deer Hunting, and the most recent event a 10 day Bear hunt. It seems that a lots of wounded warriors bonded  and enhanced the whole experience. This is a wonderful thing what the Wounded Warriors United are doing , Keep up the great work Tom.

What a great organization that gives back to our wounded vets by taking them on hunting and fishing trips and more. This organization is 100% the best. I believe in them and what they do so much that I closed my caf and did a pancake feed to help raise money for their cause and hope to do it again. You really couldn't ask for a better group. Wounded Warriors United is number 1 in my book.
Wounded Warriors United	262411	1	/users/profile/351084	Chrisnbrook C.	Client Served	5	10/08/2015	Tom Tavtigan and his crew running Wounded Warriors United are top notch. I had a great experience on a turkey hunt with them, we all were welcomed like family. Everyone wanted to talk and hear our stories, tell a few of their own, and make new friendships. We met some KC Chiefs alumni, and thr hosts and their friends and family were amazing! I had a successful hunt but the best part was meeting and talking with everyone involved and also meeting new warriors...I think that the events are great but the main take away is new military wounded warriors and sharing experiences together. This is a huge part of the healing process. Thank you WWU!!
Wounded Warriors United	262385	1	/users/profile/351055	Writer	Volunteer	5	10/08/2015	WWU is an awesome non-profit group that does nothing but wonderful things for their members.  I had the privilege of assisting with one of their events and not only was the staff amazing but the wounded warriors they brought were just an awesome all around group of guys.  Always respectful, carrying, and laughing.  Always have had nothing but immense respect for our brave soldiers who are willing to fight and sacrifice for my freedom, but after getting to know these guys personally they are easily some of the best people I have ever met.  I look forward to having the pleasure of assisting with another event in the near future and tell others who haven't had the opportunity to definitely try and get involved.

Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	124245	1	/users/profile/169070	vmillercoleman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/02/2012	Family Promise of Lawrence is one of the most effective and engaging service programs in Douglas County, Kansas.  Truly a community response to homelessness, FPL transforms the lives of families and children in crisis.  Volunteers who host through participating congregations learn to put their faith into action right within the walls of their own house of worship.  It's an extraordinary way for families to connect with families, and for all of us to grow in love of neighbor.  Keep up the good work, FPL!  
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22812	10	/users/profile/23814	Monica	Volunteer	5	11/18/2009	My husband and I were able to volunteer in September at Corpus Christi Catholic Church for Family Promise. We made the most of it, and had a great time doing it!  My husband brought his DJ equipment and had a dance party.  Everyone from the youngest to the oldest had fun.  We hope we were  able  to  help them forget about their struggles for that one night. My son and I made goodie bags for the kids. My sister-in-law sent a care package of fun stuff for everyone. We ordered pizzas and just really had a blast! Christy Sullivan let us make the night our own.  She was awesome!
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22771	11	/users/profile/23766	kuknapik	Volunteer	5	11/17/2009	I have been honored with providing my assistance to Family Promise towards the beginning.  Unfortunately, there were potential resistances from the public and I helped to send "town hall meeting" notices to the community surrounding volunteer churches.  During this process, the more I learned about Family Promise, the more excited I became to help in whatever way I could.  To my delight my church agreed to join as a host church and I help in several ways each and every time.  The program is dear to me and my family.  Even though my son has started College he has already signed up to volunteer while at home over his holiday break.  Many times when you decide to support programs or donate to different causes, you pray and hope you are making a difference.  When you allow yourself to participate in the Family Promise program you absolutely know you are making a difference to not only the families but in yourself.  There are so many rewards it almost seems impossible to list them all.  With the diversity that exists between the families and volunteers, it may seem on paper that the program would not be successful or run as well as it does.  However, there is more than enough respect, love and genuine desire to see everyone and the program to succeed that the differences do not really seem to exist.  No one and life is not perfect and in that respect everyone has something to share and contribute.  Family Promise is not just how I am helping homeless families.  I receive so much from each family and I am truly blessed and thankful for what the families provide me during their time in the program and afterward.  Family Promise is a "family" with lasting relationships.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22734	7	/users/profile/23741	Grateful	Volunteer	4	11/16/2009	A month after a family stayed at our church, I was at the bowling alley & stopped to talk with them.  I was going to be traveling to a city they were familiar with.  They gave me tips on entertainment and a nice restaurant.  I felt so loved.  I was glad to know, things were looking up for them.  They were now both employed.   I was blessed with our sharing.  A moment of time is priceless!  Volunteering w/ Family Promise is greatness at it's best! A simple meal or overnight stay for them.   Blessings abundantly for all volunteers. Thank you Family Promise!
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22664	11	/users/profile/23663	Mr Network	Volunteer	5	11/14/2009	I support technology at our church.  I have helped do set up and reset of the family rooms.  I have made sure that families had DVD/VCR facilities in their rooms.  I have also made sure that computer and internet was available.  On some occasions that allowed family members to complete school work.  I make sure thermostats are reset for overnight occupancy.  I am on call if anything goes wrong.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22581	13	/users/profile/23596	madanne	Volunteer	5	11/13/2009	I've watched this service grow from its infancy as idea and a dream into a living and breathing reality.  The program is well constructed and organized, has many years of success behind it, and it's already proven "tried & true" here in Lawrence.  At least two families I know of personally are back on their feet and living in real homes and thriving.  The coordinator at our church is amazing, and there are other amazing volunteers in charge of different aspects of our week of hosting...the food, the setup and tearing down of rooms, etc.  Everyone pitches in and it gives you a warm feeling to be part of something that directly helps others.  And my children LOVE Family Promise week and beg to go play with their new friends every evening.  Meeting the families and hearing their stories has been a blessing to my family that I never would have expected.  We now find ourselves wanting to keep in touch and see the families whether they are visiting another church or are back on their own.  It's just another way of making new friends now for us-- and who couldn't use more friends?
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22567	5	/users/profile/23585	nancy	Volunteer	5	11/13/2009	I've been involved with Family Promise since it was just an exciting idea.  We asked for nothing from the city except to let us do our job.  It's the faith congregations who put the petal to the metal, so to speak.  These fantastic volunteers put in countless hours planning and organizing their host/support weeks and seeing that the week is fully staffed.  The Board and Executive Director are equally dedicated and skilled.  Valerie is truly impressive, working with volunteers while encouraging and motivating the guests to a new level of responsibility in overcoming obstacles and meeting whatever challenges they face.  It's a privilege to be part of this great organization.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22549	10	/users/profile/23568	flatlander	Volunteer	5	11/13/2009	I got involved with the program when it was in it's infancy and have watched and participated as it has blossomed.  And blossomed it has!  Beyond my expectations really.  I think God has really blessed this effort and the fruits being born out of it are all the proof one needs of that!  My wife and are one of the coordinator couples at our church and it is an absolute joy and honor to work this program.With that said, I think the one thing that can be made better is more consistency across the various churches as to how things are handled for the overnights.  The guests can get a bit frustrated that what is allowed at one place is not at another.  This is getting better though as the coordinators have opportunity to get together and discuss procedures.Overall though, the program is well thought out, there is an excellent board and program coordinator, and most of all...  RESULTS!
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22548	6	/users/profile/23567	stacey22	Volunteer	5	11/13/2009	I will NEVER forget about a dozen volunteers, standing in the driveway, holding hands in a circle, heads bowed and giving a blessing to one of our families as she and her daughter moved into their home. i am the coordinator of Family Promise at our church. i became involved becausei think it is my responsibility as a human being to love and care for others...especially when they are at a critical time in their lives. Being able to make a real difference..either by fixing a yummy dinner, playing bingo with the kids, or giving a nice, long hug to a mom who is completely exhausted is incredible.Family Promise is about love, hospitality and mostly success. My life is so much richer and i hope that i have made other lives richer, as well. truly is the best thing i have ever been involved with.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22429	3	/users/profile/23459	Nancy	Volunteer	4	11/12/2009	I've known about Family Promise since it was just a dream that the Lawrence faith community could provide support to homeless families.  I watched as many dedicated individuals worked to make that dream a reality.  Now that Family Promise is a reality, I can lend my talents to this project.  I have a double connection with Lawrence Family Promise.  First my husband and I are coordinators for our church.  We spend the over night shift one night each quarter as well as help with the evening meal and fellowship.  It is a privilege to help with this project.     My second connection is as an elementary school principal in Lawrence.  I know the effects that homelessness has on children.  There are homeless children attending every one of our 15 elementary buildings.   Two children that have been served by Family Promise have attended school in my building.  Having a safe place to sleep and meals that you can depend on are critical to a child, without these learning is impossible.  When this family became involved with Family Promise, I saw an immediate improvement in the children's attitude at school.  They were more focused and ready to learn each day. They willingly talked about the nice people that provided meals and a place for them to sleep. They told me that they felt safe sleeping at the church.  They came to school with their homework done and ready to learn. Sometimes when we have homeless children, they will ask me to keep a special possession for them.  Living in shelters, you never know if your favorite possession will be there when you get back.  These children were happy to know that they could leave their favorite toy while they were at school, and it would be okay until they returned. It seems so simple, but so important.  My only regret is that we can't support more families.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22402	3	/users/profile/23440	P and C	Volunteer	4	11/12/2009	We have really loved our involvement. It is very rewarding to see the families who come full circle.  We have seen families who are in the prgram who are dealing with being without a home for the first time and have seen how the program has helped them to get back on their feet.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22394	3	/users/profile/23431	cristy	Volunteer	4	11/12/2009	What a blessing this program is!  I have been a coordinator since our first time to host families about 1 year ago.  I never could have imagined what an impact this program had on me, my family & our parish. Our parishioner have embraced this program & these families.I feel lucky to be a part of this network!
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22360	2	/users/profile/23402	FP	Volunteer	5	11/12/2009	I have found this to be a great experience as a volunteer.  It has been eye-opening to get to know these nice families who are working hard to improve their situation.  It is satifying to know that they have a genuine opportunity to change their lives, and they are given the tools to realistically make the change.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22358	2	/users/profile/23401	sherry	Volunteer	5	11/12/2009	I've been working with Family Promise in various ways (i.e. host co-coordinator, spending an evening here and there with the families, organizing/obtaining furniture for move in days) for almost a year now and it has been a blessing for me and my family.  It puts a real face to a real problem in our great nation.  Just being there for the families and letting them know not only in words, but actions that there are people who truly care about them.  Plus, coming together with other people in Lawrence who come from all different walks of life to serve together for this great cause has been wonderful and exciting.  One time I had the privilege of watching one of the little girls in the guest family ride a horse for the first time!  This was arranged by the great volunteers of Family Promise for her birthday.  She was so excited and I'm sure for that moment at least, she got to be just an average little girl without the thought of her living arrangements.  Another time, last Christmas, the mother of the guest family gave each of my two kids a Christmas present.  This is a woman with a small child who didn't have much, but she sure had a big heart!  She showed us the true meaning of giving.  Family Promise is a blessing to all involved!

Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22347	2	/users/profile/23393	Wendy Wheeler	Volunteer	5	11/12/2009	I have thoroughly enjoyed my experiences with Lawrence Family Promise. I coordinate the meals for our guests stays at First Baptist Church as well as volunteering as an evening and overnight host. I really look forward to the families stay with us even though it means lots of work for us preparing for the week. I always know that there may be ups and downs as with any family but I really enjoy the opportunities the week presents.  Homelessness so often carries such a negative stigma but this program helps to put a face on this issue and allows a huge number of volunteers to participate in small ways to make an enormous difference. Alone we could not make the difference that we are making as a network of churches and volunteers.  I have made lasting friends among the families that I have encountered through this program and have deepened my understanding that poverty and homelessness can happen to anyone through circumstances often beyond your control. Through the Lawrence Family Promise network families are given support that enables them to have safe haven for their children and themselves and a network of new friends that encourage and enable them to work toward independent housing. It is hard to describe the feelings that I experience when I get to help move families into a new home. They are not just people I am helping but rather they are friends added to my life. I do realize that not all families who enter the Lawrence Family Promise network will be successful because the program itself is a hard thing to do. I would challenge any of us to live it. But for those families who do find housing independence through this program we have made a difference that is vitally  important to their lives.
Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22344	2	/users/profile/23389	dupchurch	Volunteer	5	11/12/2009	I've been a volunteer when Promise of Lawrence comes to our church for our turn to host guests.  It has been a tremendous opportunity for us to help people in a way that makes a difference in their lives.  We are not just throwing money at folks to assuage our consciences.  We are actually helping homeless families with children find a permanent home.

Family Promise Of Lawrence Inc	22321	2	/users/profile/23376	SWade	Volunteer	5	11/12/2009	We have served as volunteers at our church by preparing and serving food, eating with the families, spending the night and getting the families off to the day center in the morning 4x in the past year.  It's been an eye-opening experience for my teenage daughters to meet the families - kids just like them who are classmates.  Our church coordinators are amazing, they spend hours finding volunteers, thinking out each detail of what's needed for the week, rallying support and goods.  I find that this experience feeds my soul - almost more than feeding the needs of others.  Valerie and Family Promise do an amazing job of coordinating each church involved, training each volunteer on the need for privacy and respect of the families, and developing support in the community.  It's a HUGE job and labor of love.

I helped host dinner for a family and found the effort and the interaction very worthwhile and rewarding.  I was also able to see the family again and find out a little about their journey through a difficult period in their lives into a much brighter future with housing and new employment.Family Promise of Lawrence made a huge difference in their lives and continues to help make possible major positive changes for many other families in need.Greg Hurd

Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	287326		/users/profile/377411	Writer	General Member of the Public	4	04/26/2016	I have been involved with this organization for several years and have found it to be a wonderful organization who fulfills the mission of providing assistance dogs to persons at no cost.   When students train at KSDS, most of their expenses are taken care of, including meals and lodging.  KSDS offers accessible housing for students who train,  including cooking and laundry facilities.   The only expense the student has is an application fee of $25, and transportation to KSDS if they have to drive a long distance or schedule a flight.   KSDS has placed over 515 assistance dog teams in the past 26 years.   Many people who tour our facility or attend a graduation is extremely impressed with KSDS.    The KSDS family extends their friendship and support to all who need it.

My dog was high-strung and hard to manage from the get-go. I was told I needed to be more ALPHA. Um, I'm a quad. What the heck! They have a total lack of understanding of their clients. I asked for them to have my dog know to pull off covers because I can't in the middle of the night. And same with pulling them on. I had to have friends help train this when I got home because my dog didn't know it (as promised) when I got there. I have gotten no followup even though I've asked multiple times with phone calls and emails. I also got my dog and got my vet papers only to find out my dog scored a POOR on their hip OFA. Now I have to spend money and know that my dog will have a shorted work life. I've been scammed. Learn from my experience. Don't be scammed. Send your friends and family elsewhere for a dog!!!!
Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	277387		/users/profile/367183	Writer	Client Served	5	01/20/2016	I received my service dog from KSDS a few years ago. I have had very few issues with my dog, and when i did have an issue, the staff at KSDS were more than helpful in finding a way to fix the issue.  I am able to be more independent because of my service dog. I am grateful to EVERYONE at KSDS for all their hard work and dedication that goes into training the assistance dogs that are placed. Since being placed with my dog, I know of only 1 match that didn't workout, this was because of the persons support system at home didn't want the individual to have a successor dog. The failure had absolutely nothing to do with ANYONE with KSDS. I don't understand why there are such hateful reviews, if people knew the whole story their minds would change.
Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	277216		/users/profile/367001	Pupraser	Volunteer	5	01/19/2016	I have been a volunteer puppy raiser for KSDS for 13 years and love seeing how much the dogs mean to the graduates and how they help them gain independence.  The dogs are specifically trained to help with specific needs of the person they are teamed with and the bond that it creates goes beyond measure.  The trainers are very professional and so dedicated, they will go above and beyond to help a team succeed so that they might become independent and  live a full life of their own.  The trainers also regularly attend ADI (Assistance Dogs International) conferences and further training to stay up with any new training techniques so that they can be the best at what they do.   The whole school is like one big family, many graduates will tell you how much KSDS has become a part of their family.  KSDS is the only ADI Accredited School in Kansas.
Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	233936	1	/users/profile/297972	pollywantsacracker	General Member of the Public	1	11/18/2014	My friend has a dog from this school. It's a shame because they raised money to get to travel to KSDS and their dog isn't even capable of doing basic skills, let alone being able to do advanced skills like they need. They love the dog, but love doesn't turn on and off lights or open or close doors or retrieve dropped items. My friend has contacted the school for additional followup and support and has consistently been told it's her fault. WRONG, that's not how you treat people.
Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	218399		/users/profile/281952	disappointedpublic	General Member of the Public	1	09/30/2014	I have witnessed several dogs that have graduated from this school being aggressive. One even attacked my dog and bloodied it's ear and I had to take it to the emergency veterinarian. The dogs are too much for their clients to handle and they don't do a good job of matching dogs with people. I feel bad for anyone who gets a dog from them. 
Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	189521	1	/users/profile/247398	myopinions80	Donor	1	11/29/2013	As a previous donor to this organization, I became suspicious in the last few years with all the changes and none that have been positive. I did some research on the current training staff and found that the senior trainer has in fact been convicted for steeling money in her prior job at a bank right there in Washington.   I can't believe that they are allowing her to collect donations and etc.  What type of place is this.Every time they make one of their changes, they explain how there will be new guidelines such as the breeding and training programs.  I have taken the time to look back at past newsletters and such and they are not changing anything but staff members and leadership.The new duplexes were supposed to allow for larger classes, however I have not seen a class larger than five since the addition.  You never see more that one or two guide students in class.  Why do they even place guide dogs?The new breeding guidelines are not new, but have been in place for years...established by Karen Acre Price herself.  The puppies in training are kept in their puppy homes until the age of  two or older so that the latest placements are being made when the dog is between 3-4 years of age.  How is that fair for a person with a disability to receive a dog that old when they only work 8 -10 years? How is it fair for dogs to spend over a year in the kennels in training?  The poor puppy raisers waiting and waiting for the dog they spent time loving and training to finally be placed.
Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	189370	1	/users/profile/246837	sassylady	Professional with expertise in this field	1	11/26/2013	This organization is anything but transparent...just try asking to see any of their financial information or board meeting minutes. There are no term limits on this board and the won't invite new members on. The board members secretly meet and make decisions in groups of 2-3 and then sway the rest of the board members to agree. Previous employees were treated like dirt after dedicating and developing the programs for over 10 years. These employees were discarded but their ideas were kept and later implemented being passed off as the "new guidelines". Any signs of leadership from employees is frown upon and seen as a struggle for power and attempt at taking over. These board members have a warped sense of "helping people", they are all about themselves.

At Ksds, everyone is family, and everyone is valued as individuals. They haveamazing follow up procedures with each individual whos life they have touched.

The important training for both of us provided by KSDS, Inc. employees and many volunteers provide confidence that is beyond belief to change my life and many others who suffer chronic disabilities. Among the volunteers, my partner's puppy raiser gave Carmine many experiences that are related in my book, A Priceless Gift, including a film documentary viewed by thousands of people.  My book honors puppy raisers. You may laugh and then cry, as an editor said she did, but you will appreciate Carmine and her puppy raiser.  Carmine and I join with other KSDS graduates and their partners at least once a year to review training and renew lifelong friendships. 
Ksds Assistance Dogs Inc	55837	1	/users/profile/58080	Heather M.	Client Served	5	10/28/2010	I spent several months doing research before I chose KSDS.  I was, and continue to be, impressed with the staff, dogs, puppy raisers, training facility, and community support.   Sopapilla and I are personality matched, so she is a little stubborn - but it's an attitude I share.   At our graduation from the training camp we were introduced as a team by Sopapilla's puppy raiser.  It was wonderful to meet the woman who had raised my girl through the rough puppy times and then had the hugeness of heart to give her up so we could be a team.  KSDS's commitment to connect the puppy raisers and the graduates is a wonderful thing.  I contacted the trainers soon after returning home and was given immediate attention and a solution to the issue we were having.  I attended the Graduate Retreat  last summer and met other teams from all over the country.  We had time to socialize and work on skills.  The support from the other graduates is so important, as very few people have the experience of being the human half of a service- or guide-dog team.  When giving presentations about Service Dogs, I always emphasize these aspects of KSDS and the importance of working with certified trainers.  KSDS changed my life forever and I will always be grateful.

Boo has also given me a sense of confidence.  The trainers at KSDS know what they are doing in training these dogs in that these dogs are very highly trained for the specific tasks that they are needed to accomplish.  KSDS trainers do an extremely good job at matching these dogs with the persons personality.  The two week training camp process that they provide for the person getting the dog is absolutely well worth the time and energy  they put in to it, it helps us graduates know exactly how to work with the dog and what commands to give.  It also gives us the tools we need to problem solve through any situation we may face as a Team.  Through the Grad Retreat that is put on every year in the month of July/August, KSDS trainers help graduates work through any difficulties they may have with the team process and/or public issues.  KSDS is like having the best Support Network that money can buy without having to shell out any money.  As far as I am concerned, KSDS is the best!!

After graduation, I headed home with a highly trained service dog and began the first day of my new life!  My dog's assistance has allowed me to live independently, to maintain an active lifestyle, and to become a very productive member of my community.

We had spoke with several VA facilities and was unable to get answers. I then contacted NGWRC where we found all our answers and then some. I would recommend this to anyone out there that has fought in the gulf and has come home with health issues. The NGWRC is #1 to get things straightened out!!! We are very happy with the outcome of the NGWRC!!! Thank You

It's only a non-profit because all the profit goes to pay the salary and expenses of the Executive Director. The Board of Directors are all family and friends of the Executive Director. Membership in the organization is required to get any assistance from them, and there is a fee to join. It's just a private little club for the Executive Director, which he took over after running off all the dedicated people who got it started for him and did all the hard work.

Youth City Network, Inc.	196022		/users/profile/256298	masongtthecomic	Volunteer	5	03/20/2014	Youth City Network is a great after school program that teaches kids about the Arts. I was asked to come down and teach an improv workshop. The kids were really responsive to the lessons. We had a great day of improv acceptance and being comfortable with being silly. Some of the exercises we did were: Redball, Yes, Seven things, and the Ad game.  It went so well I was asked to come back. The second workshop we went over characters. We worked on some exercises that helped develop characters and scene work. The kids had even more fun the second time. This program is a great way for the kids to get some positive reinforcement in there lives.If you are interested in a Improv Workshop you can contact me through email at masongtthecomic@yahoo.com.

Youth City Network has been able to give young people a creative outlet. Youth City Network gave young people a voice and it was through that voice that those young people became empowered.  Over the course of the school year it was wonderful to see young people become invested in themselves, their thoughts and the output of their thoughts. It was also wonderful to see the youth in Youth City Network become a family; they were able to create a bond with each other that will hopefully keep each other safe through high school and college career. The lessons they learned on how to use their voices and word will give them an added advantage in life.

In the last two years ive done a talent show, help promote and went to many open mic events. this experience was very helpful for me as far trying to learn how to project my voice, over come my stage fright & gaining courage. if i could i would drag every teen i know to open mic night's. . its life changing :)

The dedication from everyone to ensure that the community is able to have healthy mother and babies is inspiring and extremely effective. MN has delivered over 3,600 babies without a single infant or maternal fatality by providing HIV/AIDS screening, prenatal care, and postpartum vaccinations. The staff also provides family planning and community health education. It is clear that this organization was founded on grassroots principles because strides are always taken to ensure that the community's needs are being met for their specific situations. The commitment and hard work of staff of MN and The Global Birthing Home Foundation to ensure care for mothers and babies sets a paradigm for what all organizations should strive to be.

People always praise me when I speak of the work I did, and MN does.  I always reply, "Haiti, its people, and MN did more for me than I could ever repay"

I plan to continue a partnership with MN and am currently working towards a return trip soon.

Volunteer	5	08/27/2012	Maison de Naissance has successfully provided the women in their zone of service access to experienced and knowledgeable obstetrical health care. Through MNs employment and education of a primarily Haitian staff, she has made her work and services sustainable. This is paramount to alleviating the burden of inadequate and unsafe maternal/child care that is prevalent throughout the globe. My experience while volunteering at MN allowed me to get a first hand view of the inspiring facility that is MN. Everyone involved lives and breaths for healthy moms and babies and will do everything in their power to continue making this a reality. If only they could  donations to increase space and staffing Mn would be able to serve more moms and babies daily.
Global Birthing Home Foundation	152837		/users/profile/203732	Bade	General Member of the Public	5	04/06/2013	At Maison de Naissance, it is their mission to provide every mother with the opportunity for a safe delivery of a healthy baby, which includes 3 prenatal visits, HIV/AIDS testing, midwife supervised delivery, one postpartum visit, one family planning consultation, and a well baby visit, all for $115! That is one percent of the cost here in the USA, and their total cost to deliver a healthy baby at MN. They have delivered over 4,000 babies at MN, without a single maternal mortality, and a neonatal mortality rate of less than 2%  one quarter of the Haitian national average.   You can donate through their website.  More than 90% of your donation goes directly to the cause and it is tax deductible.  What a wonderful thing they do for these women and their families by helping transform an entire community.  Brilliant!

Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies it's what they call Dekabes! A double win!   Every effort is made to have the experience be in balance with the culture of the community while providing this level of healthcare.

Perhaps one of the lowest administrative costs you will find for your dollar, this is funded by your love and donations, please give generously.
Global Birthing Home Foundation	152496		/users/profile/203480	Sherry Krin	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2013	This is the most amazing place!  The thing I like best is that it provides excellent care for women and babies in a country where their lives are not valued.  They are afraid to go to hospitals as they are so often abused there and the care is inadequate care anyway.  MN also provides care that is culturally appropriate which is so important in so many ways.  Oh, and 100% of donations go directly to care for the women and babies.  They can keep women and babies healthy and alive for a tiny fraction of what it costs in the US and the women are so happy for it that they often walk miles to get there, even when in labor.  Can you imagine that?  Walking MILES for good care?  
Global Birthing Home Foundation	152322		/users/profile/203358	drbetsykansas	Board Member	5	04/05/2013	Since its inception in 2004, this birthing home has delivered thousands of women, giving them healthy babies, birth control options, vaccinations, and a chance at a better life.  Our support of this foundation goes directly to Haiti (over 90%), as there is a very limited staff here in the US.  We believe that every mother and baby in the world has a RIGHT to prenatal care and someone to help them through delivery. Maison de Naissance makes that miracle happen, free of charge, every day.

Their saying is "dekabes" happy mothers, happy babies, and they live up to that every day. They have drastically reduced infant mortality rate in their area, and far beyond, as people come from everywhere to be treated at MN. It is absolutely wonderful, and volunteering there was life changing for me, because it helped me to remember how absolutely blessed I am to have everything I do, and reminded me that I need to help as many people as I can, through this and other organizations.

The community around the center has so much pride in the work being done there that they have even become advocates for the center as well.  The best part the services are all free to the patients and no on is turned away.  1st world medicine in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.  Fiscally responsible, and accountable for all spending.  Perhaps one of the most efficient ways to help the people of Haiti.  Programs so strong that they are used to teach other centers around the nation.
Global Birthing Home Foundation	121509	1	/users/profile/165321	Betsy8	Professional with expertise in this field	5	08/27/2012	Maison de Naissance opened in 2004 with the intent of breaking down barriers to prenatal care and safe delivery for women in rural southern Haiti.  After almost 8 years and over 3500 deliveries, no mothers have been lost in a region where maternal mortality is distressingly common.  Though initially the concept of American physicians, the protocols and procedures have been adapted by the Haitian staff of expert certified nurse midwives. Constant effort to support the local community by hiring local builders and workers, purchasing supplies in the nearby town, and interviewing patients, neighbors and community health committee members has produced a clinic and delivery service which are prized by the national health department as the reference for maternity care in Haiti.  Next steps include expanding HIV care to include case management and nutrition, and integrating assistant midwives into the care team.

Global Birthing Home Foundation	93904	1	/users/profile/108336	Mary G.	Donor	5	07/15/2011	Maison de Naissance was started by two doctors in Kansas City who wanted to ensure that women in the southwestern peninsula of Haiti had access to professional healthcare at the time of delivery. Their efforts to bring modern standards of healthcare to the poorest of the poor have had a dramatic effect, reducing infant mortality rates in the region by 75%. The hospital is staffed entirely by Haitians with the exception of a single ex-pat clinical director.  Since the fall of 2004 Maison de Naissance has delivered nearly 3,000 babies and conducted over 42,000 healthcare visits with women and their babies. In Haiti,  women typically have to bring their her own medical and surgical supplies and pay for medical care in advance, before being admitted to a hospital for delivering a child. Maison de Naissance provides its services free of charge.

When I first came across Seamless Dance at the Kansas City Fringe Festival, I was highly skeptical. Here was a group of interpretive dance performers, as they claimed, who went as far as to name themselves "Seamless" which I felt was a bold move and highly unlikely an accurate statement. After a bit of online research I decided that they may actually be the interpretative dancers that I have long sought to enjoy and may actually come close to fulfilling the "interpretive" aspect of performing! So do they live up to their name? HALLELUJAH, do they ever! Everything from the posted description of what they were to perform, leaving you only with your own interpretation of what to expect, to the truly "seamless-ness" of their movement on the stage, the story portrayed, to the costuming, the choreography, to expression through movement, was utterly and perfectly breathtaking! Being one who is usually highly analytical of dancers, I found myself undistracted by the usual and natural flaws in production but instead engrossed completely in emotional understanding and even in tears at various times. Their dance style was a beautiful collaboration of ballet and liquid, elegant popping movements with every step, twist, jump, twirl, perfectly in sync with the music and other dancers. The only not-so-seamless but somewhat forgivable aspect was the transitioning between songs which was often long and noisy. It would be great to see these dancers with a few extra stage hands to help create a smooth transition. But truly, the choreography and these dancers are a real beacon of light in the otherwise dim world of expressive dance! 
Seamless Dance Theater Inc	61430		/users/profile/67056	meagriff	Volunteer	4	01/27/2011	I am an Occupational Therapy student from KUMed, and I have been given the opportunity to volunteer through Seamless Dance Theater working with a class for children with special needs. The class is free and open to individuals looking for an opportunity to dance. Seamless has provided a dance studio and teacher to support this service learning experience. It has been incredible and we could not have put this class together without their support. The class not only benefits my learning experience but provides a safe and encouraging environment for children with special needs to dance. The smiles one can see around the room tell all- the children are thrilled to be there! It is truly a blessing to be able to work in this environment.
Seamless Dance Theater Inc	60597		/users/profile/65960	Susan Lally	Board Member	5	01/21/2011	I have been honored to be involved with Seamless Dance Theater for the last 3 years and the wonderful work it does for children and women in the Kansas City community.   Seamless Dance, in short, provides a rare opportunity to hundreds of children each year to be exposed to the arts and specifically, dance.  Many of the children would otherwise never have this exposure.  Seamless is not only exposing them to this wonderful culture, but maybe even opening their eyes to something they too might participate in and become passionate about.  The annual Seamless performances held at the GEM, at 18th and Vine, also provides the general public one of the best opportunities in KC to see professional dance unlike any other in town.  Under the artistic direction of Erin Novak Lustig, the choreography is amazing and experiencing it can be life altering.
Seamless Dance Theater Inc	60422		/users/profile/65693	Juliann C.	Volunteer	5	01/19/2011	I participated in this dance class as a service learning opportunity for school.  It was a great chance to work with other volunteers to help children with special needs participate in a fun activity, dancing. It was great that Seamless Dance Theater sponsored this activity by providing a free studio space, volunteer dance teachers and assistance, and giving us a chance to participate in a fun service learning activity to gain experience.  Thanks Seamless Dance Theater!
Seamless Dance Theater Inc	60357		/users/profile/65605	Becky Nicholson	Professional with expertise in this field	5	01/19/2011	For the past two years Seamless has supported the development of a program to provide a dance class for children with special needs.  As a faculty member in the Occupational Therapy Education Department at the University of Kansas we developed a collaboration with seamless in an effort to give children with special needs access to dance regardless of their disability. Occupational therapy graduate students assist with the class each week to provide extra support to the students that need extra assistance. We have children with a variety of physical, cognitive and behavioral challenges that come together each week to enjoy dance. Erin Lustig the director of Seamless connected us with Tarrah Bossert a dance instructor that has volunteered her time with assistance from Lucy Elbel a dance student at Starstruck Performing Arts Center.  Seamless has provided studio space to us free of charge and has provided ongoing support with costumes and connecting us with children in the community that want the opportunity to dance. With donations from the community we are able to provide dance classes and costumes at no cost to the students.  I have been an occupational therapist for 25 years and this dance class has been the most enjoyable experience of my career.  Watching the enjoyment and the accomplishments of these children each week has been remarkable.  This class would not have been possible without the support of Seamless Dance Theatre

Breakthrough House Inc	243122		/users/profile/329770	runfun	Volunteer	5	05/16/2015	Because of my desire to support mental health recovery and because I had learned about the work of Breakthrough House and the many lives they help, I chose in 2014 to raise funds via running the Los Angeles Marathon.  I couldn't believe the support I received from that organization!  The effort was celebrated from the start to finish of the fundraising.  I had the time of my life!   I couldn't help but think seriously of repeating last year's "fun-raising" and, indeed, I did choose to run the Oklahoma City Memorial Half-Marathon for Breakthrough House.   I had a beautiful send-off from the members of the Clubhouse.  They had a wonderful luncheon and gifts and most of all--encouragement.  What beautiful spirits were exemplified as they shared.  Their words came to me as I ran a tough race.  These are people worth supporting every way possible and dedicated board members and employees.  I have seen how much they care and I celebrate the work that they do.  No longer is mental illness something to be ashamed of.  We realize it is an illness that can be treated.  No longer do we think mental illness is something to be stabilized and endured.  There is recovery.  That means we concentrate on the positives and the strengths.  it is a new day in mental health recovery and I am thankful for the dedication of all those associated with Breakthrough House.
Breakthrough House Inc	270297		/users/profile/359013	Writer	Donor	5	10/31/2015	Breakthrough House (BTH) has been serving persons with severe and persistent mental illness since 1978. The "flagship" of BTH is the Clubhouse where members support one another in a community of mutual respect. The Clubhouse has no clinical staff and BTH is not reimbursed by Medicare of Medicaid for services provided.  I am a former member of the BTH Board of Directors, but my role now is to provide whatever financial support I can. I know first hand that the bulk of my support will go toward direct services and not  to inflated administrative costs.

Without the assistance of the kind staff at BTH I would struggle very much in my daily living.  The staff help me to succeed and to reach for my potential.  They go above and beyond and work extra hours many times to help the clients get the services they need.  I am also a mental health advocate and share a lot about BTH through social media and a blog.  The reason I do this is I believe the work of BTH needs to be applauded and recognized.  I am so thankful for everyone at BTH.  Their compassion and the respect they have shown me means more than I can express.
Breakthrough House Inc	80966		/users/profile/88423	No names please	General Member of the Public	5	03/02/2011	Fifteen years ago, I worked for Breakthrough House as a "house parent." It was the most rewarding experience I've had. Every client brought a different set of "willingnesses" and "capabilities" to every communal activity. This is what made it both rewarding and challenging. One didn't like the dinner. One loved the dinner, but didn't want to set the table. One wanted to set the table, but didn't want to do the dishes. Some wanted to do menu planning. Some did not. Some wanted to help with meal preparation. Some did not. Balancing these unique demands - and working through them with the give and take that's vital to a family experience is what made Breakthrough House so special to me. Some of these clients had never experienced "give and take" and - as a result - had never enjoyed the feeling of "getting" from another in one arena or "giving" to another in a different arena.This kind of living experience - and challenging clients to strive as if they had nothing to lose - is the model for success in my never-to-be humble opinion. 
Breakthrough House Inc	70988		/users/profile/77604	PWhite	Board Member	5	02/18/2011	I have been on the BTH Board for a little more than 3 years now.  In addition I am serving as Treasurer  (3rd term) Very interesting and challenging experience.   Of course our main focus is on financials and the continuing stability of the agency.   Given the current economic crisis, this issue is a long on-going discussion which commands most of our efforts.It has been my good fortune to be able to work with fellow Board members who are both focused and dedicated to helping BTH grow.  BTH staff has also been very inovative and hard working.   Have much enjoyed the action and challenge.

Military Veteran Project	288566		/users/profile/378762	Writer	Volunteer	5	05/05/2016	Military Veteran Project is an amazing and unique non-profit organization.  It is an organization that truly puts veterans first.  All proceeds raised are put directly back into the cause to help veterans and the research/treatment of PTSD and TBI to help end military suicides.  The organization and the volunteers go above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the veterans are receiving the help they need.  Each volunteer shows a great deal of respect, care and devotion for their part in the organization.  Melissa has truly honored her dying soldier's wish to care for his brothers and sisters and continues to do so with great determination and strength!  I am honored to be able to volunteer my time to the Military Veteran Project and be a part of an organization that is helping the lives of countless veterans and service members. 
Military Veteran Project	288377		/users/profile/346174	Mandy16	Volunteer	5	05/04/2016	I've worked with a lot of places to volunteer my time with the military but Military Veteran's Project by far takes the cake. They are 100% volunteer. Nobody gets paid which means ALL yes ALL of the donations go directly to the programs that they offer. Also I've been on the Veterans Day Parade Committee for 3 years now and every year we get bigger and better. My son who is 10 is also able to volunteer with me which at other places has not been available. Every event that we've done I've met some of the greatest mentors, friends, veterans and their families that I am pleased to call my family for life.
Military Veteran Project	257711		/users/profile/346174	Mandy16	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	I Just LOVE this Nonprofit. It's the one nonprofit that 100% of the donations go directly to the troops and Veterans. Nobody get's paid!! 
Military Veteran Project	257718		/users/profile/346180	Rscinks	Volunteer	5	09/16/2015	Totally focused on the mission of assisting veterans with any and all needs. MVP exemplifies the excellence of honoring and caring for the nations veterans! From lobbying for change, in our nations Capitol....to sponsoring local and national events....to assisting veterans and families with medical needs...if it's a concern of a veteran, it's a concern of MVP! Stellar leadership and awesome volunteer support make MVP the "go to" for veterans needing assistance. Keep up the great work!
Military Veteran Project	257429		/users/profile/345852	Writer	Client Served	5	09/15/2015	The time and dedication put into our veterans by MVP is awe inspiring. The ground story behind the organization and its founder is one that would pull on even the hardest of heart strings. The sad fact is the majority of true non profit veteran organizations is that they are majority supported by other vets and their loved ones. Exposure from all avenues will hopefully create a movement that invokes civilians to get involved. The stigma of PTSD is that it is a violent illness. Truth is it can be debilitating.. Health is affected both physically and mentally. We can reduce instances of violence, suicide and homelessness by simply bringing awareness and doing our best to provide treatment for our soldiers. As the significant other of a veteran that suffers from severe PTSD I can't begin to tell you of the need for this. Our  family has the same struggles as any other normal family only amplified by 100. He lost both his legs fighting for our rights, what are you doing to say thank you? Thank you and God bless our troops. 
Military Veteran Project	257392		/users/profile/345798	Beenjammin	Volunteer	5	09/15/2015	Hands down my favorite thing about the MVP, besides the amazing director, is that so much of the donations they receive actually go back to the veterans that are most in need.

While the purpose has evolved over the years, it has done so to meet a great need. I only wish we could replicate this in every state! MVP doesn't care who you are or where you've been, or what your experience is. Whether you are a spouse of actively serving (active or guard - we are guard), wounded, widow...Melissa and her organism will help you or find someone who will.

It went from honoring the fallen to homeless veterans to veteran with PTSD. Seems to be a hot topic charity that changes to where the money comes from. 
Military Veteran Project	241640	2	/users/profile/328244	AndiMVP44	Volunteer	5	04/24/2015	I was blessed enough to learn of Melissa Jarboe & her Husband's story, SSG Jamie Jarboe when Melissa first started the Non-Profit (originally named Jamie Jarboe Foundation.  In the 3Years of knowing and Volunteering for events for MVP & Melissa, I have had the great pleasure of seeing the faces of so many Veterans & their families when they receive assistance, go to fun events for Veterans & their families and fundraisers held in honor of our Military. I do not know of another Non Profit that does this in such a personal & compassionate manner.  Those looking for a safe & caring place to comeTo when a Loved one,Family member, friend or comrade is in need and they feel so comfortable because they learn the heart of Melissa who herself has experienced Military life & loss.  She has a way of sharing her strength & ability to overcome which in turn gives others inspiration to believe and know it's ok to breakdown when they need to and she & her volunteers will be right there to pick you back up!  She and MVP do not just talk about what they can do for Military & their families, but they Walk the Walk every single day for the past 3 years!  When you become partOf MVP, you becomePart of a Family and it's a Lifelong Family no matter where or what stage you areIn at the time, they will be there for you & your family!

My son was named after David who this foundation was started in honor of.  I am sure David would be a role model for my son so one way to honor him is to like dragons.  My son loves dragon books and has several dragon shirts.  In a small way, by liking dragons I feel like I am supporting Dragon Master Foundation.  
Dragon Master Foundation	227539	2	/users/profile/291271	StaceyGravina	General Member of the Public	5	10/27/2014	While I am a "General Member of the Public" I am also a mom who lost her 8 year old son to brain cancer.  I am so thankful that this organization is taking the lead in bringing together such important information to help push research forward.  It makes so much sense to do this so that time is not wasted on duplicating results.  Time is of the essence... the more time it takes to find cures, the more lives that will be lost.  Thank you Dragon Master Foundation for your incredible insight and determination.
Dragon Master Foundation	227506	2	/users/profile/291237	John296	Volunteer	5	10/27/2014	The Dragon Master Foundation is one of the smartest ideas I have ever heard of and when the president of the Foundation informed me of the database, I was amazed at how perhaps looking at cancer in a different way would be an answer to our prayers. I volunteered with the Foundation at Curefest in 2013, and since then, the Foundation has grown and will continue to grow until it is one of the top cancer research facilities in America. 
Dragon Master Foundation	226917	2	/users/profile/290644	Kelli10	Volunteer	5	10/26/2014	I have had the pleasure of meeting the President of Dragon Master Foundation, Amanda Haddock, personally.  Her desire and vision for using Big Data to find a cancer cure is obvious. She has taken the personal heartbreak of losing a child to pediatric brain cancer, and turned it into a mission to save other children. Not only children, but in the grand scheme of things, save the lives of thousands living with cancer.  I lost my husband to brain cancer, and during his battle to save his life, "Big Data" never was mentioned. Dragon Master Foundation is thinking above and beyond the confines of a box. Brain cancer was discovered in 1873 and now, in 2014, Amanda and her Foundation are beginning to make advances that are 141 years in the making.  With people like Amanda and her Foundation in the corner for cancer, I don't see it taking another 141 years before there is a cure for brain cancer.  Cure one, possibly cure all.  Imagine a world where ALL cancer can be cured. It would be a wonderful thing. Thank you Amanda, and Dragon Master Foundation for all your tireless efforts to make this happen. 
Dragon Master Foundation	226910	2	/users/profile/290640	Mary310	General Member of the Public	5	10/26/2014	Dragon Master Foundation (DMF) is an excellent non profit.

Dragon Master Foundation is getting the scientists the tools that they need to build the databases to cure these relentless diseases. I can think of nothing more important to the research community
Dragon Master Foundation	226880	2	/users/profile/290617	Laurie_Orloski	Professional with expertise in this field	5	10/26/2014	I have had the pleasure of speaking with the President of Dragon Master Foundation (Amanda Haddock) at great length.   I am so impressed and inspired by their big thinking, to undertake a genomic/clinical database project so huge that most would shy away.  They have a vision for using Big Data to conquer cancer and other diseases, starting with pediatric brain tumors--and area for which advances have been lacking.   They have the expertise and know-how to integrate medicine and technology.  Therapeutic advances in cancer have been achieved by genomic database projects like this, but those projects have been limited in scope and time.   Dragon Master Foundation is thinking bigger and broader and longer term.  I believe in Dragon Master Foundation and their vision--that they can do exactly what they are setting out to do.   Amanda and the Foundation are motivated by the desire to make a difference for other people, and from that motivation (and their unique technology expertise) good things will come.

When I met other members of The Dragon Master Foundation I realized that theirs was truly an altruistic focus and determination to not only expand the treatment options for pediatric brain cancer but to cure pediatric brain cancer.    By using innovative and   modern techniques available due to the vast technology of our generation we can develop an open secure database that can truly change the face of cancer.   As a new board member I was extremely excited to learn of the various hospitals and researchers that share our aspiration and want to be a part of this exciting leap into the future; a future in which we can cure cancer

With all the research that is being done across the nation and across the world, it is about time someone had the drive and insight to create a centralized database for all these researchers to share and compare their work. I am so proud and truly humbled to know that my amazing sister and her equally remarkable husband have identified this Herculean task and have chosen to tackle it head-on!

I also volunteer what I can to help with the funding as well since I believe that the at the core of the technologies that the Dragon Master Foundation is pioneering has the very real possibility of changing the very face of cancer research and human genetic research in general.  I am not sure what else to put here since everyone one I have worked with at the Dragon Master Foundation are great people and are all fighting for the future with what could be accomplished.
Dragon Master Foundation	225245	1	/users/profile/289012	Roger Kasten	Board Member	5	10/22/2014	I did not have a lot of free time on my hands, so when I was asked to become a founding board member of the Dragon Master Foundation I had to do some investigating. What my research uncovered was amazing and caused me to immediately join DMF in their journey. Dragon Master Foundation is not about fancy platitudes and fun events. Rather, they are all about working to help "find a cure" for pediatric brain cancer. DMF is focused on developing the worlds largest non-profit, open access, database of childrens genomic brain tumor information. The goal is to create high quality data and work with researchers to move and collate existing data to the open-access platform, which we feel will inevitably unlock the cures for cancers. We have entered into a very exciting partnership with the Children's Hospitals of Philadelphia (CHOP), Pittsburgh, Chicago and Seattle. The plans, spirit, and beliefs of the people in DMF makes me proud to be a part of what will likely be the beginning of the end of cancer.

DMF has chosen the "find a cure" role, focusing first on pediatric brain cancer, which we feel will inevitably unlock the cures for other cancers.  With a mission of using big data to cure cancer, and having under a year under our belts as a Foundation, we've recently secured our 501c3 status and entered into a partnership with the Children's Hospitals of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Seattle.  We all are eager to take our efforts to the next level.  Get involved NOW, and you can say you were there at the beginning of the end of cancer.

Assistance League of Wichita, Inc.	314064		/users/profile/405423	lottiemay	Board Member	5	10/24/2016	I joined ALW after I retired.  Been a member for 10 years and have been so proud to be a member.  I've watched this organization grow, even more, into a more advanced caring and supportive organization supporting the youth in Wichita.  We support children with providing clothing and hygiene needs, with scholarships for high school students, and with providing needs for those who have been abused.  We continue to excel in our quest to help our children to be caring and productive citizens of society by taking care of their needs as they mature.  I can't say enough good things about the Assistance League of Wichita!  This video shows the old Operation School Bell model.  We have partnered with JC Penney to provide clothing and hygiene needs to identified students now.  This video does show  our programs.  Watch our Assistance League website, in a couple of months, for the revised video showing our wonderful new liaison with JC Penney!
Assistance League of Wichita, Inc.	312513		/users/profile/403886	Carol243	Client Served	5	10/20/2016	Assistane League of Wichita is a caring and committed group of volunteers who truly give back to the Wichita community through their four philanthropic programs. Their main focus is on children and education. ALW's funding comes mostly from their Thrift Shop which I like to say is the best Thrift Shop, "this side of the Mississippi."  Donations are tax deductible. I like to shop and donate!
Assistance League of Wichita, Inc.	229298		/users/profile/292950	utwbarb	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	The Assistance League of Wichita's membership is dedicated to the community and schools.  Their philanthropic programs are dedicated to students in Wichita Public Schools with Operation School Bell and vocational scholarships.  Another program is Sexual Assault Victim Support and bear hugs for abused children.  The members are all volunteers providing support.  One more thing, there is a "top-notch" shopping experience at the Thrift Shop @ Douglas and Grove on the south side of the street.  
Assistance League of Wichita, Inc.	229253	1	/users/profile/292902	CAY64	Board Member	5	10/29/2014	Like many of our volunteers, I joined the Assistance League of Wichita after I retired.  As a former School Counselor I had the great joy of taking bus loads of children to Operation School Bell in Idaho.  Without this great program, many of these students would not have had school clothing and winter coats.  This is only one of the great philanthropic programs offered by the Wichita Assistance League.  We also provide vocational scholarships for graduating seniors from local high schools.  In addition we provide sexual assault survivor kits to the local hospitals, serving over 300 individuals annually.  Our Bear Hugs program provides teddy bears to comfort sexually abused children while they are being cared for at local hospitals.  These four programs are funded entirely by the profits from our fabulous Thrift Shop, generous donations from the community, and our annual  Gingerbread Gala and Gingerbread Village fund raisers.  The Assistance League of Wichita operates entirely with volunteer staff.  Having no paid staff, we are able to use all of our resources to help those in our community.  The Assistance League of Wichita is 160 members strong with a vision  to empower volunteers to make lasting change through community-based philanthropic programs.

I was amazed at the number of volunteers and their excitement and energy in volunteering for this nonprofit.  This organization is 100% volunteer! Amazing Their philantropies are so helpful and needed in the community, and their Thrift Shop is a wonderful place to shop.  They have great items that are donated to them and you can get really good bargain prices for quality merchandise. I enjoy volunteering and knowing that I am giving back to my community at the same time.

In 2013, we clothed over 3,500 students in USD 259, supported 355 victims of rape or domestic violence and granted over $8,000 to post secondary students to complete a job skill or certificate program. It is amazing the difference a small group of dedicated women can do for a community. Our Thrift Shop at 2431 E Douglas is a major part of the reason that we can continue to provide these services. Please drop by and shop or consider becoming a member to connect and care with a wonderful community.

Every year for about the last 7 years The forgotten men at Victory Mission and the Cook's Kettle Culinary Training School, were invited to enjoy God's beautiful creation,on the river, camping in "Eagle Nests" ( 2 man outdoor, screened in, breathable dry sleep shelters). There are also OTHER camping options available. The campground there at Living waters is pristine atmosphere with picnic tables, shower/flush toilets, a small store surrounded by Christian staff and many volunteers that believe in the vision there. The trip down the CLEAN Niangua river is a  beautiful time for the folks to interact, splash, play and enjoy nature one on one. They are driven up on school buses to a beautiful place of launch. Then they can float/paddle at their leisure down to the campground which is downstream on the Niangua. A truly A+++++ adventure.
Living Waters Christian Canoe Camp and Retreat Center Inc	299063	2	/users/profile/389953	Dawn146	Volunteer	5	08/02/2016	Our family has been involved with Living Waters for many years as it has grown and changed.  Our children have learned many skills, and had great times on the river as well as camping.   The river is spring-fed, beautiful, and relaxing.  Living Waters Canoe Camp has great accommodations, with tee-pees, eagle's nests (covered structures with protection from mosquitoes and a comfortable flat surface to sleep on), and plenty of space for tent camping.  There are showers and there is also a trading post if you want to purchase snacks or forgotten necessities.  A good deal of planning and preparation goes into the float trips as well as into the space at the camp site.  We have really enjoyed this place so much throughout the years.  If you're looking for a family friendly float trip with camping that is affordable, Living Waters is the place.  Come to float and camp, and maybe you can be like our family, you can stay around to serve as well.

American Holistic Nurses Association	153487		/users/profile/204285	Carole10	Board Member	5	04/08/2013	The American Holistic Nurses Association (AHNA)has enhanced the quality of nursing care for over 35 years by first recognizing that nurses need to take care of themselves then they are in a much clearer frame of mind to tend to the needs of the whole client.  Five stars does not even begin to quantify how much nursing has benefited from this organization.
American Holistic Nurses Association	153213		/users/profile/204051	LKeegan	Professional with expertise in this field	5	04/07/2013	The American Holistic Nurses Association (AHNA) has contributed to a positive change in both American nursing and indeed world wide nursing over the past three decades.  Since the organizations inception in 1980, nurse leaders and caregivers have learned and refined so many holistic skills and attitudes. Personally I have been involved with this exceptional organization from its beginning and have experienced my own conscious growth and development via the friendships and opportunities gleaned through personal and professional involvement. I heartly endorse the AHNA as the finest nonprofit organization in the United States of America. Lynn Keegan, PhD, RN, AHN-BC, FAAN

American Holistic Nurses Association	153005		/users/profile/203865	Shields	Volunteer	5	04/06/2013	Holistic nursing is, to me, a philosophy and a way of being in the world. It is an expression of the art (caring, presence, relationship, intuition, communication, creativity, personal knowing) and the science (theory, research, evidence-based practice, critical thinking, reflection) that I believe are the lived experience of the profession that I love - nursing. Holistic practice is the way I choose to show up  fully present with those entrusted to my care, meeting people where they are and knowing deeply that with every encounter I receive far more than I give.   The American Holistic Nurses Association (AHNA) supports me to be that nurse every step of the way. Through numerous initiatives (eg: education, conferences, research), the AHNA creates opportunities for me - and all nurses and healthcare providers - to expand and deepen awareness and knowledge. AHNA is committed to ensuring that healthcare is grounded in caring/healing practices...they are a clear voice, advocating for whole-person,  quality care that is accessible and affordable. The AHNA advocates, as well, for caregiver self-care - be it the family or the healthcare provider. Self-care is a priority! The American Holistic Nurses Association leaders, members and staff work tirelessly with open hearts and a commitment that is deep and boundless. It is an honor to be part of this professional association.

Foundation For A Christian Civilization Inc	297023	1	/users/profile/387796	FaithfulRC	Donor	1	07/18/2016	Catholics be advised.  This 'cult' -like organization has been condemned by the NCBB (National Council of Brazilian Bishops)  and ordered Catholics to have nothing to do with it, on April,18 1985. They use the name ANF, TFP and Foundation for a Christian Civilizaion for filing. America Needs Fatima campaign is wholly operated by an organization called The Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property (TFP), founded in Brazil by late Professor Plinio Corra De Oliveira in 1960.     This group are followers of the eccentric Professor Plinio  whose teachings are heretical in the Roman Catholic Faith.  They feign to be 'faithful Catholics' exploiting the Fatima devotion in their propaganda and aggressive direct mail fundraisings targeting Catholics with rented mailing lists.     They recruit young men to join full time.   But the Bishop in Brazil said, "their entire recruitment procedure is in violation of Canon Law 219 prohibiting any coercion in choosing or remaining in any state of life."This organization has been condemned by Roman Catholic Bishops in  Brazil, Scotland,  Africa and Miami Florida-http://www.miamiarch.org/atimo_s/Bulletin/2007/Bulletin20071017.pdfThe bishops' warning, characterized the group as a "cult of personality " (meaning that they are giving excessive or worshipful devotion to their leader) and also accused the group of "abusing the name of Holy Mary." The official nature of the notice was subsequently confirmed by the Under-Secretary General of the Brazilian Conference, Fr. Valentini Netto on Dec. 8, 1995.http://www.unitypublishing.com/NewReligiousMovements/FatimaCult.html
Foundation For A Christian Civilization Inc	285416	2	/users/profile/375403	Writer	Volunteer	5	04/09/2016	My wife & I have been affiliated with The American TFP for over 12 years & must say that we are profoundly impressed by the TFP members whom we have had the opportunity to meet over these many years.  They are extremely dedicated to the Roman Catholic Church & to the traditions that make up the Church, along with their incredible support for family values & private property, the first thing that communist/socialist governments take away from the people when they gain control of a country.  They are very open in everything that they do, as was Our Lord, to the extent that they do tend to attract detractors, as did Our Lord, & as would any organization that stands up for the truth & for Catholic values that are so sadly being set aside today.  We have worked with the TFP for 10 years sponsoring local Rosary Crusades which have the intent of encouraging individuals & families to pray the rosary daily as requested by Our Lady at Fatima.  They also have an incredible program to promote the messages that Our Lady gave to the 3 shepherd children at Fatima in 1917, 99 years ago this May 13th.  Their current campaign is to promote family values by supporting traditional marriage, that is marriage between one man & one woman as ordained by God, starting with our first parents in the Garden of Eden.  When you support such  "controversial" issues today, yes, you do tend to make some enemies, enemies that are also enemies of the Catholic Church.  We have never found such an outstanding organization of men & women in our 65+ years of experience as Roman Catholics.  If you have a true love for the Church, for the traditional values of the Church as taught by Our Lord some 2,000+ years ago, & if you are a true supporter of democratic values then you will be extremely impressed with The American TFP.

They do massive HIGH pressure fundraiser direct mailings two times a month.  They are NOT Catholic  but want people to think they ARE.   They follow in cult-like devotion a heretical deceased founder from Brazil condemned by many Roman Catholic Bishops beginning in Brazil -  for their heresey, secretiveness, exploitation of young men and destruction of families.   Their grip on the youth who are under their full control and domination  is for the purpose of more fundraising, and treating and using them as slaves for their massive office work and campaigns.    They pay high salaries to management and the real 'owners'  who are all family members.People need to know the truth of this evil organization.
Foundation For A Christian Civilization Inc	52899	5	/users/profile/53963	truthandjustice	Donor	1	09/20/2010	this secretive group does not tell the public in their massive, agressive direct mailings to Catholics in their rented lists that they follow an eccentric founder from Brazil that has been condemned by Roman Catholic Bishops in many countries.

Foundation For A Christian Civilization Inc	108650	8	/users/profile/147852	Jack Burnham	Donor	5	03/30/2012	I'd like to comment on the "secretive" nature of TFP, which is a part of the Foundation for a Christian Civilization:  what a lie! My goodness, what does it take to be considered "open" and not secretive. TFP's books and writings are voluminous and the Church has never censored one thing. In fact, they have written many glowing letters of praise for several of TFP's publications. Their books and magazines and websites are readily available to all honest souls. I've known this group for 30 years and spent time with them in their sister organizations' offices and housing in Europe and Brazil. They've let me attend their weekly general meetings, been a free, totally unwatched, roaming guest in their offices, etc... Anyone can smile and be nice to you. If you want to know what an organization is all about, read what they write, because they can't wriggle out of it or 'spin' it. TFP and it's America Needs Fatima campaign promote the public practice of virtue according to the traditional and contemporary magistirium of the Catholic Church. No bishop has EVER challenged, in writing, any of the publications of the TFP. Why? because what the TFP believes and preaches is 100% in accordance with Catholic doctrine. If you're against that, especially if you're inside the Church, you can't actually put your wrong headedness in writing, so you whisper your calumnies and never WRITE a response....typical methodology of those 'whited sepulchers'. Because they can't convict TFP of sin, they whisper calumnies and untruths for over 50 years now.
Foundation For A Christian Civilization Inc	59370	6	/users/profile/64069	Obiterdictum	General Member of the Public	5	01/03/2011	I had to laugh when I read the negative comments by anonymous posters, but then I thought: what if in today's world...just because they're ONLINE...such comments are taken as deified, necessarily known to the organization, and thus "true"? Well, readers certainly can ask the foundation at their own website(s) if they want to know who knows what.  As to being created by a "secretive" leader, that man was a Brazilian lawyer and professor as one can view reasonably reliably (at the moment!) at Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_the_Defense_of_Tradition,_Family_and_Property . It may be that as in original day, around the globe State-regulated if not appointed "bishops" don't approve of such talk...but then, it would be such TALK, no matter if a Muslim, LBGT, Buddhist, Jew, or any person of any "-ism" or bent disapproved! Consider also neither the USCCB nor Vatican, for example, disapproves of the foundation. This is intended to submit a counterpoint to knee-jerk and possibly sometimes prank "critics" offering no details of self-opinions, and I neither encourage nor discourage the public about this foundation.

Josh suffered a Tramatic Brain Injury and lost his left eye when another car crashed into the topOf his roll cage in a multi car accident.  Josh was 17 at the time and 4 days away from starting his Senior year of Highr school.   The accident put his life on hold for just under a year.  Josh required a total of 7 surgeries and 8 months in two different rehab hospitals.   With the help of the Steve King Foundation I was able to remain by my sons side as he recoverd. I will always be thankful to the foundation and to our family friends Kent and Shari Skaggs who knew about the foundation and completed the application for us.  Josh is still on the road to recover but is doing absolutely amazing!   Josh has just completed his first semester of his Senior year and has even gone back to racing Legends.  No words will ever be enough to express how grateful Josh and I are for the support of such an amazing foundation!
Steve King Foundation	320135		/users/profile/412288	David394	Client Served	5	12/14/2016	August 28th 2015,  I was in a real bad wreck in my sprint car.  Steering malfunctioned and I slammed head on into the wall coming out of turn 4.  As a result, I ended up with two broken knee caps.   This put me out of work for a period of 4 months.  The morning after surgery a fellow racer called me and told me "the Steve King Foundation wants your contact information".  Not thinking much about it at the time I went ahead and emailed them my info.  Three days out of the hospital I had a check in the mailbox.   The foundation really helped a lot during my recovery.    I like to tell my wife that they basically saved our home while I was out. Great people like the Steve King Foundation, are rare these days, and these are truly wonderful people. Thank you again SKFD.J.

I had 2nd and 3rd degree burns over 35% of my body (arms, stomach, legs) even after wearing all approved safety equipment. I spent 29 days in the burn center at Lehigh Valley. As I've recovered the outpouring of support from the racing community has been more than overwhelming.  one group, the Steve King Foundation, was one of the first organizations to step up once they heard about me. Knowing what I had ahead of me, they got in touch with my family and did what they could to make sure our needs were taken care of. It's so amazing that they are out there to help people like myself.

You hear of so many organizations who keep the majority of the money raised as "administration fees" and that is absolutely not he case with the Steve king Foundation!If anything, running the organization, and keeping it going most likely costs the King family money out of their own pockets.Thankfully they are willing to help so many people and should be commended for their efforts!

Over the last year and a few months, Steve King Foundation has been able to relieve so many of my families stresses by continuing to help support me while I try to get back to my normal life. Because of the support they've offered, I've gotten to stay in therapy and have progressed from no movement to being able to walk with a walker.

Steve King Foundation	319347		/users/profile/410784	AJ F.	Advisor	5	11/22/2016	I run a charity event titled "Pave the Clay Invitational".  Drivers and crew of any and every division get together to race for the Steve King Foundation benefitting Injured Racecar Drivers. We began the event in 2014 and have done it annually since. Our most recent race, the 3rd Annual, raised $6800 for Injured Racecar Drivers. The event was tough to get started in 2014, however, we got in touch with the Steve King Organization and they helped guide us towards where we are today. The event has grown by double every year of its existence and we hope to continue that trend in 2017. As drivers, we know the risk. But the thrill of the sport overwhelms us and causes us to ignore those thoughts. Sadly, this sport is unforgiving and drivers can and do get hurt. To have the people we do at Steve King, that continue to work hard to ensure hurt drivers are cared for properly, should give all of us just a little extra comfort every time we wheel onto the speedway.

I had a safe home to go to, my parents home, but I was really in need of help to restore my self esteem/worth, and went through years of counseling. I selected SAFEHOME to volunteer for when I retired.  As a volunteer, I have never experienced such an appreciative staff for volunteer work. I volunteer at the front desk, and every time I'm there several staff members give me a "Thank you for being here." Those words sound so good to me because it makes me feel that I am truly contributing to a huge need in all of our communities. Everyone is very professional, and very friendly.

Waldorf Association Of Lawrence	52204		/users/profile/53064	lovemyschool	Board Member	5	09/11/2010	This school has been amazing for my child and my family. The faculty work tirelessly at providing a rich, nurturing, whole child curriculum that respects and meets each child where they're at. By "whole child" I mean that when they learn math, it's not just done sitting at a deskthere's movement, music, and art in each subject. The students learn the subjects with their whole bodies. I especially love the fact that my child is not just having facts downloaded into his brain for rote memorization and having to regurgitate it back. Instead, he's learning HOW to learn, and his innate love of learning is being nurtured rather than squashed. I love that he will be with his 1st grade teacher all the way through 6th grade. His teacher will know exactly where he's at, what he needs and when, and he will be communicating that with us, the parents, all the way through. I love this school and my child loves it. His self-confidence around learning is big and bright, not stressful or fearful.
Waldorf Association Of Lawrence	51671	2	/users/profile/52393	visionforthefuture	Volunteer	5	09/03/2010	For information about Waldorf education, you can visit www.whywaldorfworks.com.Prairie Moon was founded by a group of parents and community members committed to bringing Waldorf education to Lawrence, Kansas. Since the initial impulse began in 1997, and then again in 2001, the school community has grown and blossomed.  For the young children (ages 3-6), the school is a haven for childhood, allowing sufficient time for free play, outside play, the creative arts, practical work and rest (when needed).  Seasonal verses, songs, puppet shows, fingerplays, and storytelling told in a weekly rhythm help to strengthen the child's ability to listen and concentrate, expand language development, foster memory growth, and create the foundation for long term literacy. In addition, movement and circle games also help improve physical coordination and dexterity, and build capacities for the understanding of mathematical concepts.  The grades program (grades 1-6) has seen many successes, particularly for children who have been 'burnt-out' on learning in mainstream education.  While even children who do well in mainstream education, when coming to Prairie Moon have a new initiative and develop a love of learning that they may not have experienced before.  The grades curriculum is an experiential process that brings the 'facts' alive and the children are more readily able to grasp the concepts.  They receive specialty classes in handwork, movement and language (German).

Employees with intellectual/developmental disabilities show commitment, pride and stronger self-esteem as they come and go from their daily work schedules and community involvement.   Each employee is either taking part in the goody products sales trips to local corporate offices or assisting in the two Heartstrings shops and sales. Even taking part in maintenance of their shops goes hand-in-hand with spending time participating in health and fitness activities, and giving to others through outings at local nursing homes.  Smiles are everywhere at Heartstrings because of what the organization has committed to our communitys special population and the employees pride in their group.  Growth comes with community awareness, participation and giving.

It has provided me an opportunity to give back to my community, and provide an incredible service to a set of individuals that truly deserves my attention.  I find that when I am actively involved with this organization, I lose sight of who is serving who, and who is benefiting from my service.  Likely, I am receiving more than those I assist.  Many thanks to this wonderful organization for allowing me this opportunity.

There should be more nonprofit groups out there like this one...you can go in to get food and not feel like you're being pitied.
HELP317, Inc	142844		/users/profile/189276	Virginia P.	Volunteer	5	11/26/2012	I worked in the Pantry for 4 years. What a blessing to be able to help those less fortunate than I. We were always blessed with good comments about the workers and the food. Would do it again, had to quit due to health problems. My appreciation to all those who carry on and help those who need the food, etc, that is distributed to them. I still serve on the Executive Board and glad to be a part of that.

We strive to be a place where we can serve others in need. Our clients tell us often how appreciative they are and how we have provided much needed help for them. Sometimes we even get a hug. We appreciate so much all who help donate food and money to help keep us here every week. 
HELP317, Inc	109765		/users/profile/149531	jhousel	Volunteer	5	04/12/2012	I have been a volunteer at HELP 317 for more that 3 years.  We have a very well kept and friendly facility.  We not only provide food, we have used clothing and some household items that are free for the taking.  Many times we have been ask to pray for some special need that is pressing on someones mind.  It is a great blessing to me when I can give someone a bit of information to help them find a way to get help for other needs.  We do our very best to provide a variety of items from fresh veggies and fruits, canned goods, meats, and baked goods.   I feel God is blessing our efforts as we serve our community.
HELP317, Inc	107095		/users/profile/144966	cdresz	Donor	5	02/25/2012	I've donated both food and money.  I've been at their location too.   I am especially pleased that this Nonprofit is operated as a ministry, by a volunteer staff.   Anyone can lose a job, their health or a marriage and struggle to feed their family.  So many families have been helped already, I can't imagine the hunger and struggle our community would experience without HELP317.  I know you don't know me... but I just wanted there to be one more voice saying Yes, HELP317 is faithful with your contribution and faithful with God's love.
NAMI Kansas Inc.	93388		/users/profile/107385	blinktwice	General Member of the Public	4	07/05/2011	The few times I have been able to attend NAMI--Wichita meetings, I have been welcomed and treated graciously.  I receive information about meetings and activities through both regular mail and email .  I appreciate feeling included in the organization, even though I am not able to be active.
NAMI Kansas Inc.	91564		/users/profile/104811	Jason	Client Served	4	06/22/2011	NAMI support groups are a great help. When my wife was having a break down and I heard about NAMI and located the support group in Johnson country, KS. It was a life line to connect with other people that understand the difficult situation I was dealing with. Mental health support with NAMI is very important and much needed service.
NAMI Kansas Inc.	91558		/users/profile/104797	MissionPossible	Volunteer	5	06/21/2011	NAMI has been an instrumental part of my becoming who I am today. September of 2008, after 40 years of an unfulfilling marriage, I finally received the answer for the challenges I have experienced with my husband. It was like a light bulb for me that went on; and that enlightenment happened as I participated in the Family to Family class and recognized the presence of mental illness. It has not been an easy journey even with that knowledge, but at least I understand. Since that time I have been involved for two years in raising funds for the NAMI Kansas Walk and have brought in between $500 and $900 each year from my own efforts. I accepted the position of Community Communications Coordinator for Wichita NAMI and am in my second year of service. In that role I have distributed over 1,500 rack cards/posters to over 50 mental health agencies in the area. I also co-presented NAMI's supportive role to over 270 USD 259 school professionals. NAMI is available to provide support to both family members and the consumers who struggle with mental illness. I am most grateful for exposure to this valuable nonprofit public service organization. 
NAMI Kansas Inc.	91493	1	/users/profile/104693	Skj59	Volunteer	5	06/21/2011	My daughter  was diagnosed with mental illness in 2000 after a suicide attempt.  My husband and I were devastated, confused, and felt helpless.  We didn't know anything about the condition, medication, or future expectations.  Learning about the Family-2-Family twelve week class, we signed up in a hurry.  As we began educating ourselves about mental illness, we began to feel empowered and hopeful again.  The friends we made and the leaders who gave the class were family members too.  They shared their experiences and we learned we were not alone.  We could make a difference in our daughter's life with empathy and knowledge.  It felt like the weight of the world was lifted and we began to enjoy the little things again and see that our path did not have to be the dismal, dark tunnel that we had found ourselves buried in .  NAMI made all the difference and now is the time I've chosen to pay back this wonderful organization that saved us from ignorance and anger.

NAMI was there for me, providing me with not only the factual information that I needed, but gave me the skills to interact with my loved one in a better way through one of their classes.  The support groups were also invaluable to me.  I received the emotional support that I needed.  My experience with NAMI has been so positive that I have continued my involvement and now help out as a volunteer for NAMI.   My loved one is now doing a lot better, I am coping much better, and I have NAMI to thank for that.

Theatre Lawrence	139398		/users/profile/185513	maggie.gremminger	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Theatre Lawrence offers so many incredible opportunities to the community. I have been volunteering for over 6 years both onstage and off and have been so impressed by the various type of people who are all drawn together to support live performance. I am especially appreciative of the Youth Education programs that involve children in so many engaging creative activities!
Theatre Lawrence	139368		/users/profile/185483	Dean B.	Board Member	5	11/14/2012	Though I' m a board member, I'm also a volunteer, and from the beginning my experience has been so positive that I kept looking for new ways to be involved.    Theatre Lawrence not only brings first-rate entertainment to our community, but it also changes the lives of those who participate in our many programs, from the 3- to 5-year-olds in our "Tiny Tot Thespians" to the seniors in our Vintage Players.  This theatre is so welcoming that volunteers keep coming back for more, contributing tens of thousands of hours each year.  Its support by the community is clearly evident in the overwhelming response to our recent capital campaign to replace our ancient and bursting-at-the-seams facility.  We look forward to the opportunity that increased space will give us to serve many more young and older people in our educational programs, as well as to heighten the quality of our stage productions.
Theatre Lawrence	139329		/users/profile/185442	maisaunders	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	 I have been volunteering at Theatre Lawrence since 1994. I am continually amazed at the high quality finished product turned out with each production.  And, that it is done with nearly all volunteers, is incredible. Paid staff is very small and mostly part time. Actors and stage managers are all volunteers. Set painters, prop and running crew are all volunteers. Ushers and House Managers are volunteers. With this large cross section of folk, one of the most wonderful things is the feeling of family everyone has when they become part of the mix in this organization. You want to come back and help bring another great show to life for the audiences to enjoy. Those enjoying the end product are not just audiences for the main stage productions but also the classes of elementary students learning about performance and the group of senior citizen actors who perform all around the area. The Senior group (Vintage Players) also goes into classrooms and works with 2nd grade students helping them learn to express themselves and not be afraid to speak in front of a group. What a great thing is this living, breathing non-profit called Theatre Lawrence. The community would be so much poorer without it!
Theatre Lawrence	139196		/users/profile/185304	judyheller	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Theatre Lawrence always provides top notch performances of comedy, drama, and musicals, but also provides you an amazing visual experience as you notice the authentic costumes and stage settings.  It caters to the youngest, oldest, and all those in the middle with a variety of programming, acting experiences, and volunteer activities.  Get involved!  You'll be glad you did.
Theatre Lawrence	139194		/users/profile/185302	Laughinggravy	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Theatre Lawrence, and its earlier incarnation Lawrence Community Theatre, has had  a definite impact on my life and the life of the family.  So much of my personal and social life is wrapped up in the organization.There truly are no people like show people, and those involved in TL span the generations.  The level of involvement, commitment, and sense of purpose attached to every show and production is without par.
Theatre Lawrence	139177		/users/profile/185282	BabyK	Donor	5	11/14/2012	One of the things that is great about Theatre Lawrence ( and most community theaters) is how it bridges the generational gap. Being able to volunteer with kids, and for seniors to come together with younger folks, all for a similar goal creates a greater understanding of the other age groups. Too often you see kids who want nothing to do with their parents or grandparents- its a chore. Not with theatre people! They come together and cherish each other after working a show together. HOw fun is that! 
Theatre Lawrence	139174		/users/profile/185278	ErinFox	Volunteer	5	11/14/2012	Getting involved with Theatre Lawrence has been such a wonderful experience! My husband and I recently moved to Lawrence from Michigan and I literally knew no one in Kansas. Theatre Lawrence welcomed me in with opened arms and made me feel like part of the family! Besides the friendly atmosphere, the shows are professionally executed and the support behind the shows is impressive.
Eagle Valley Raptor Center Inc.	34704	7	/users/profile/35579	awhiteman	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2010	My family has visited EVRC many times since it began.  My daughter has gone on tours with school, and Ken Lockwood has come to her school a few times to do presentations for her class.  Ken always does a fabulous job teaching the kids various facts about the raptors, while at the same time making sure the kids are respectful toward the birds.  He asks the children questions to keep their attention and get them involved.The raptors at EVRC, as well as their environment, are well maintained.  Repairs are made as needed to keep the animals safe while providing the best view possible for visitors.  A sidewalk was recently put in to make the tours more accessible to those who are in wheelchairs.I have always enjoyed seeing the passion Ken has not only for his birds but also for making sure people leave EVRC having learned some new bit of information about the raptors.  He strives to give everyone a new respect for these creatures and let them know what they can do to help take care of the environment the raptors live in.
Eagle Valley Raptor Center Inc.	34649	4	/users/profile/35520	gertie	General Member of the Public	5	04/05/2010	I took a group of gifted students to the Center and Ken was wonderful with them, answering all their questions and allowing them as much hands-on experience as possible. Based on this experience, our primary school (K-6) had Ken bring some of his birds to present a program in the school. Again, it was wonderful and Ken did a wonderful job, especially making the perfect choice of the one student allowed to have a bird perch on her arm. I've heard many, students and faculty, say this was the best assembly they've ever had.
Eagle Valley Raptor Center Inc.	34584	4	/users/profile/35445	lward	General Member of the Public	5	04/03/2010	My husband and I are nature lovers, and I wanted a way to surprise him with something really special for our anniversary.  We had been hearing about Eagle Valley for years in the news regarding rescues and releases of local birds like hawks, owls, and eagles (and sometimes unusual ones, like pelicans).  I had heard the director would offer educational tours, so I scheduled one for just my husband and I.  We were amazed at the tranquility and spacious rehabilitation facility this man has achieved simply by using his rural acreage to serve hurt wildlife.  The pens are perfectly suited to the animals, they have spaces to practice their flying as they grow stronger, and the birds on their way to release are protected from human contact so they don't become too tame while recuperating.It is clear that Ken and his wife are FULL-time on this mission and have invested so much in their found orphans.  Email updates keep supporters informed with stories and pictures of their triumphs and tragedies.  Ken is also regularly appearing with his program birds (unable to ever be released to the wild) at Boy Scout events, local charities and fundraisers, news & community programs, schools, and the local science museum: Exploration Place.  Ken also has a long-standing relationship with the University of Kansas State where their veterinarian program students and professors are invloved in all his serious bird health issues.  The drive is over 2 hours, one way, but Ken will make the trip several times in a week if he has a raptor in serious condition.After spending an hour with Ken on our first tour, we understood the heart of this man for the orphaned and injured birds of our state.His program deserves your award demonstrating the level of professionalism, commitment, and community service Ken humbly and enthusiastically performs in our state every day of his life.
Eagle Valley Raptor Center Inc.	34517	4	/users/profile/35374	jwright	General Member of the Public	5	04/02/2010	My introduction to Eagle Valley Raptor Center, Inc. was in the Spring of 2007.  A pair of Great Horned Owls had a nest in a tree in our neighborhood, which we didn't realize.  Upon returning home one evening after work, my husband told me to look out in the back yard.  I saw something white and fuzzy in the distance.  I asked him what it was.  He said a baby owl.  He said one of our neighbors had a Eagle Valley business card, which my husband used to contact them.  My husband left a message on the answering machine. Ken Lockwood, Director of Eagle Valley, returned my husband's call after I got home.  I spoke with Ken and told him there was a baby owl in our back yard.  He told me it was imperative that we get it out of the yard right away.  He told me to put on a ball cap and leather gloves and try to get control of the owl by getting ahold of his feet.  He told me to watch out for his talons.  He also told me that the owl would make a clacking sound at me, but it was just his warning to me.  I was uneasy about reaching under the owl to get his legs, so I asked Ken if I could put a towel over him to gain control of him.  Ken said yes, but be careful of his wings when you do that.  He told me to put a towel in the bottom of a box and put the owl in the box and cover it with another towel to keep the owl calm.  He asked if I could bring the owl to him as he was in the middle of taking care of an injured bald eagle.  I told him that I would bring the owl to him.  When I reached Eagle Valley, Ken looked at the owl and told me it was a great horned owl.  I asked Ken why he had me put on a ball cap.  He told me that it was to protect my scalp in the event the adult owls didn't like me messing with their baby and go after me. I asked Ken how he thought the baby got out of the nest.  He said the wind could have blown it out or sometimes the adults will tear up the next in order to get the young owls to fly.  This owl still had down on it, so it wasn't ready to fly yet. By the time I reached Eagle Valley, it was getting dark outside, but Ken took a flashlight and showed me around the facility and invited me back in the daylight to see their operation.  Ken kept the baby owl, which I named Hooty and eventually ended up taking it to be fostered by an adult Great Horned Owl in another city.  Since my introduction to Eagle Valley, I have returned numerous times taking family and friends to see this wonderful operation. I never get tired of taking a tour or hearing Ken talk about the birds. Being an animal lover myself, I appreciate Ken's care and concern for his raptors.  He does a wonderful job of rehabilitating injured raptors (and other animals) and releasing back into the wild.  If they are unreleasable after rehabilitation, he uses them in his educational programs he presents to the public. If he is unable to use them in his programing, he finds another facility that can take them.  My hat is off to Ken and his volunteers for a job well done!
Eagle Valley Raptor Center Inc.	34502	4	/users/profile/35356	labbmom	General Member of the Public	5	04/02/2010	The Eagle Valley Raptor Center should not be such a well kept secret!  Everyone should make plans to learn more about the animals we share our planet with. The raptors are amazing, there is much to be learned from them, and from Ken, who cares for them like nobody else. Go there, listen, watch, learn, and enjoy the majesty of these glorious birds.  You'll be very glad you did!

Our grandson's 10th birthday was months away, but I knew he would really enjoy this place. We brought him and his friends to Eagle Valley Raptor Center in Sept 2008. We had a wonderful time. Ken showed everyone all the birds and let the birthday boy hold one. Also got into the cage with the bald eagles and really enjoyed watching Ken interact with Annie. He has space for eating in a shelter as well.His discussion about how to work with birds seemed as if it was made for humans too. Treat them well and they will be loyal and return. Just one punishment and they lose their trust and won't come back.We've seen the articles in the Eagle and also ran into Ken and one of the birds at the Home Show in Wichita.I have enjoyed Ken's Facebook site too.
Eagle Valley Raptor Center Inc.	34473	9	/users/profile/35329	jackie11	Donor	5	04/02/2010	My exxperience with Eable Valley Raptor Ctr has been multi-faceted.  Watching the release after a bird has been rehabbed has brought tears to my eyes..I have cheered each time Ken and Susan have planned a new project at the Center and then always completed it with the involvement of the entire community...scouts, college students, retirees, corporations. I have learned to love each bird because Ken shares such heartfelt stories and pictures from Raptor Care. The educational demonstrations at the schools and wildlife centers are one of the most popular in Sedgwick County.  Their work is invaluabe to the community of Wichita and the community of Birds of Prey.
IBSA, Inc.	286850		/users/profile/376921	Lazone_G	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	If I have time to live, I have time to give.I started supporting IBSA, Inc. not just because Im the founder, but because I needed something to do to occupy my time while I looked for work. Having studied business formation at Washburn University, I realized that I could at least create a job for myself; while looking for a job to work for somebody else. It gave me meaning and purpose to wake up everyday to help someone else looking for employment or a young person going down the road I had already been. New to a city with no family, friends or classmates may have been tough because I had no social network, but overcoming the challenges I faced, by helping others I didnt know brought me a peace that I could not have gotten working for anyone else. To help others with difficult barriers to employment due to generational poverty, having no marketable skill or having no support in the home is helping myself. I may not have a lot of money to give, but I received a great education, have created networks and now have 22yrs years of life experiences to share. www.ibsa-inc.org

I grew up poor, but never had to totally go hungry. It means a lot to me, to see the lines outside the Lord's Diner waiting to eat the food I helped to provide. I feel more willing to give to a local charity, where I can see my money going to support a needy cause, rather than sending money to national or international charities. I have all that I need to support my family, and find it uplifting to be able to help other families that are not as fortunate as I. I help to support the Kansas Humane society, by adopting my pets from them, rather than buying them from a breeder or pet store. I have adopted 5 wonderful dogs from the Humane Society over the years, that have been wonderful pets. I also was able to use the Humane Society to have one of my pets put down, and was so comforted by their kindness during the process.

According to data published on the Kansas Humane Society webpage, the actual number of 'animals' that the Kansas Humane Society took in, was (and this requires extrapolating dome data from the graph the Kansas Humane Society provides), the Murfin Animal Care Campus (The Kansas Humane Society plus the Wichita Animal Shelter comprise the Murfin Animal Care Campus), the 'campus' took in approximately 22,00 animals in 2011.  But the Wichita Animal Shelter (statical data provided on the City of Wichita Animal Care data website) took in 10,245 of the total, leaving, if my calculator works correctly, 11,755 animals to be attributed to the Kansas Humane Society.  Now in my grade school, I was taught that 17,000  (claimed by the 'former board member and president') is actually 5245 animals FEWER than this writer claims.  Perhaps the public is unaware of different figures, but as the Kansas Humane Society claims to follow the ASILOMAR accords, the protocols of the accords are very straightforward, and simple, as to how the intake numbers are ascertained.  These figures I presented had to be extrapolated from data published by the Kansas Humane Society since the Society seems to refuse data pertinent to the Society itself.  Instead, it seems to bury their data in the generalized Murfin Animal Care Campus statistics (supported by the Wichita Animal Shelter 'hard' data) using innuendo to suggest greater success than the Society in reality, enjoys.  Every fact mentioned here is verifiable online and in person.
Kansas Humane Society	133327	1	/users/profile/179035	kec263	Donor	5	11/04/2012	As a past board member and president of the board, I have been able to see the Kansas Humane Society from the inside out.  I've spoken with many people who were satisfied and many who were dissatisfied with the Humane Society and have found many, many more who liked the organization.  The goal of the Humane Society is to find homes for all adoptable animals which is not as easy as some may think when they have 17,000 animals coming through the doors on a yearly basis.  Working with animals in this forum is extremely difficult.  But the Humane Society does their level best to make the lives of the animals in their shelter as comfortable as possible while showing as much compassion as possible.  It's a great organization. 
Kansas Humane Society	125332	1	/users/profile/170487	Ellen Q.	General Member of the Public	2	10/14/2012	I wish that The Kansas Humane Society would be open with the public and give actual numbers of how many animals are brought in to their shelter, and the actual disposition of those animals. They talk about percentages of live release rates, but don't give any actual numbers.  Just recently Jennifer Cambellr stated, October 2012, to the newsmedia that they took care of over 17,000 animals last year.  Yet when you look at the total numbers taken in by both KHS and the Wichtia Animal Shelter it shows a much lesser number.  They did cut the number of cat cages in half last year and routinely have empty dog runs when dogs are being euthanized at the neighboring facitly.
Kansas Humane Society	121417	2	/users/profile/149603	cnickel47	General Member of the Public	1	08/26/2012	Financial data for 2011 from the Kansas Humane Society is STILL not available in late August 2012.  I would advise that no one make any contributions to this organization until this information is publicly available.  I believe that every charitable organization is responsible to the public which both donates to them and essentially subsidizes their programs.  This long delay in making any financial available leads one to question the integrity, and indeed financial viability, of any organization.  A charitable 'humane' shelter is essential to a community the size of Wichita.  The question is, 'are we getting good management of donated funds and publicly subsidized facilities, or does the public need to re-evaluate the current organization...and find an equation that works for the unwanted and unloved animals in this community'?  
Kansas Humane Society	109830	2	/users/profile/149603	cnickel47	General Member of the Public	2	04/13/2012	Actually, I am a former volunteer and was in fact dismissed from this organization because I was not in 'philosophical agreement' with the administration.  And no, I wasn't.  I do not condone subterfuge. It is my opinion, that the UN-AUDITED financial report (see Charity Navigator) makes a false statement when identifying this agencies assets (listed at approximately $10 million), because in fact the Kansas Humane Society does NOT OWN its shelter (which this agency paid to be constructed at a cost in excess of $10 million) but is instead a lessee of the building which is owned by the City of Wichita.  It is my opinion that this is misrepresentation of agency assets made to deceive the public and donors as to the 'success' of this agency, which in turn generates confidence...and more donations.  I would volunteer for this agency again, in a heartbeat if there were what I consider (my opinion) qualified, competent, and ethical administration and board. 
Augusta Arts Council	60295		/users/profile/65495	jlggaac	General Member of the Public	5	01/18/2011	As a recent transplant from a larger city in Georgia (Atlanta), I can't tell you how thrilled I was to find such a vibrant and engaged arts community when I recently moved to Augusta, spearheaded in large part by the Greater Augusta Arts Council (GAAC).  From bringing in well-known and local artists to talk about their lives and work, to interactive events such as the annual Oysters on Telfair silent art auction (again, spotlighting local artists), I have been consistently impressed by the breadth of GAAC's mission, as well as the dedication of the staff.  GAAC truly is an invaluable addition to the cultural life of Augusta (and beyond).
Augusta Arts Council	60041		/users/profile/65169	divot	Volunteer	5	01/13/2011	Arts In the Heart of Augusta is a wonderful event to participate in as a volunteer - the types of art - dance, poetry, watercolor, blown glass, sculptur, just to mention a few - are spectacular.     The cultural experience is exciting - the food possibilites are tremendous - Brazil, Greece, Phillipines, China, and the list goes on.  The event is well organized and well attended.  There are also events and activities for children to participate in.AND by volunteering - you get a free T-Shirt!
Augusta Arts Council	59917		/users/profile/64988	Erin S.	Donor	5	01/12/2011	I've known several of the board members and outreach coordinator for years, and 2010 was certainly a pinnacle year for GAAC. I am especially impressed with the new Contemporaries program which encourages 20-30 somethings to get more involved in the arts community. I have had the pleasure of attending several events, and look forward to many more in the new year! GAAC events and info remain visible on Facebook, but I would like to see a more user friendly website, perhaps more interactive with photos.
Augusta Arts Council	59886		/users/profile/27984	razz51	General Member of the Public	5	01/12/2011	The Augusta Arts Council provides a great service to both the artists in the CSRA and the people who live here.  They keep the artist apprised of opportunities, give them venues for performance/display and offer assistance at every turn. This gives residents and visitors a rich arts experience in Augusta.

Topeka Youth Project Inc	271891		/users/profile/360804	Writer	Board Member	5	11/12/2015	Over the years I have had a lot of interactions with the young adults going through this program, including the honor of having a couple as employees. The information and skills they learn through this program are things that I believe every child should be taught and are giving them a huge step up from their situations.
Topeka Youth Project Inc	271805		/users/profile/360703	Kevin115	Board Member	5	11/11/2015	I am a proud member of this organization.  TYP reaches out to an area in desperate need of attention.  The organization helps develop our community's youth so they can protect themselves from  current temptations and put themselves in a position to succeed.  The foundation of TYP is putting forth effort and time in the lives of young people, not lip service.   
Topeka Youth Project Inc	271791		/users/profile/360687	Writer	General Member of the Public	5	11/11/2015	The time invested in youth is priceless and the Topeka Youth Project does this well.  The entire staff genuinely cares about each and every young person that walks through their door and ensures they get what they need to become a successful member of society.  I cannot begin to tell you the impact they have had on the Topeka community and the thousands of young people they have helped.
Topeka Youth Project Inc	271747		/users/profile/360639	Writer	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/10/2015	Helping youth to join a working society. Amazing confidence building that so many young people lack as they start a search for a career. 
Humane Society Of Greater Kansas City	88558	2	/users/profile/99822	TuneyFletch	Volunteer	5	05/10/2011	I started volunteering to give myself a break from job hunting. At first it was "all about me". After the first visit I realized that being jobless was not the most tragic thing in the world; that these poor sweet victims of cruelty and neglect had no family but the staff and thatthey all have so much love to give, if a human would just take a moment to see. The staff at HSGKC are some of the most loving and selfless people I have ever met. Everything they do is for the best interest of the animals in their care, even if it means getting up at 5:00 AM to go to the shelter so a dog could be picked up by his forever mom. 
Humane Society Of Greater Kansas City	88549	2	/users/profile/99807	Janice Warner	Volunteer	5	05/10/2011	Our beloved L.T. was almost 17 when he died.  My husband was overcome with grief.  I searched Petfinder for another small dog.  When I saw Maggie  Mae, I knew that she was just what we needed.  She was a 10 year old special needs dog whose owner was suffering from cancer.  She had actually been brought to HSGKC for euthanasia.  She was the perfect compainon to my disabled husband.  After my husband died, I wanted to give back to the organization.  Being useful to this team of dedicated individuals has helped me establish myself as a single person after 47 years of marriage.  It is the highlight of my week to spend time helping them. My granddaughters volunteer with me during their summer vacation.
Humane Society Of Greater Kansas City	88545	2	/users/profile/99795	Rebecca	Donor	5	05/10/2011	Working with the Greater Kansas City Area Humane Society is one of the positive experiences.  The staff is excellent with their professionalism and compassion and always doing what is best for their animals.  The Ray of Hope is a tremendous program, as well as their annual events and fund raisers they sponsor.
Humane Society Of Greater Kansas City	88541	2	/users/profile/99790	Amy Shields	Client Served	5	05/10/2011	The Humane Society of Greater KC has proven to me that volunteers CAN change animals lives. Hundreds of pets were saved through the Ray of Hope program last year at adoption satellites where I volunteer.  ROH is a partnership between HSGKC, KCK animal control and rescue groups in KC. When I first started volunteering in 2009, 70% of the animals were euthanized at KCK Animal Control. This year, it is less than 1%. Dozens of animals who would not have a chance at many shelters with broken legs, heartworm and neurological problems have a home at HSGKC through the Gabriel Fund.   Volunteering at HSGKC is more than something to look forward to every week.  I wake up early on Saturdays (rain, snow, or shine) and cant wait to see my canine, feline and human friends.  I have seen dogs and cats overcome unfathomable abuse.  Fletch, a bait dog, found a forever home just this month.  Not only did Fletch get a second chance; He gave us one.  HSGKC has changed my life and the way I live it. 
Humane Society Of Greater Kansas City	80993	2	/users/profile/88474	Amy Wurst	Client Served	5	03/02/2011	My first experience with HSGKC came when I was looking for a second dog as a playmate to my collie, Cabernet. It was important to me that they were a no-kill shelter. I explained that I wanted an older, large, female, black dog - one that was probably not very adoptable - but a dog that could possibly do therapy work. They told me to bring my dog to the shelter to meet some options. They brought in a small (40 lbs), 2 year old, blonde, male dog. Cabernet bonded to him instantly and even though he wasn't what I was looking for, apparently she and the shelter staff knew what I needed. Sake was a long-timer at the shelter having been there since he was found as a pup. Needless to say, he is now my favorite and has become an extraordinary therapy and crisis response dog. Since adopting Sake 7 years ago, I've been actively involved in the shelter and its mission. I am a staunch financial supporter and have included them in my estate plan. I  joined their board of directors in 2008 and am continually impressed with the way the shelter is run and its outstanding insight to partner with KCK Animal Control to significantly reduce their euthanasia rate. HSGKC's intensive focus on education and spay & neuter programs gives me hope that maybe someday in the futuure we won't need a shelter.

He was annoyed that I had no way of delivering it to them, so gave me 2 dates to pick from and then was sarcastic when I picked the first available.

His Helping Hands Inc	146561	1	/users/profile/193495	Jackie Jones	Professional with expertise in this field	5	12/13/2012	This is one of the most efficient and effective ministries I have yet to come across. From the top leadership down to the occasional volunteer, a caring and generous spirit is displayed to anyone who walks in the door. They are a "furniture bank" helping distressed families get back on their feet. In addition, they provide counseling services, clothing, food, and much much more. On top of all of that, they are environmentally friendly as they have created a "mattress decomposition" area so that all the non-useable mattresses they obtain don't end up in a landfill. What impresses me the most is there efficiency - no waste of anything. For example, they bundle up clothing that isn't used and its shipped to 3rd world countries. They keep tweaking themselves to be productive, useful and efficient in every aspect.

Any way to contact them and give them your opinion of their messed-up propaganda?  Apparently not; they seem to be one of those post-Citizens-United SuperPACs; I suspect that because they're located apparently in a Washington DC suburb.  Karl Rove lobbyists, I'd hazard a guess.

Friends of Yates	83133	1	/users/profile/92003	SAparicio	Volunteer	4	03/24/2011	I have had the opportunity to work in Friends of Yates for over a year now as a Spanish interpreter and translator.  In this time I have had the opportunity to learn about the vital role which this organization has had in this community for many years.  The fact that the organization has sought to have someone like me come on board reflects their desire to continously reach out to help people from many different backgrounds, in my case working directly with Spanish-speakers.
Friends of Yates	82835		/users/profile/90753	bperry	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/22/2011	Friends of Yates, Inc. has been a vital part of the community for many years.

Support for young people has always been a part of their mission and they have initiated many new programs which reach out to many people in our community. The group of people who work with and for FOY are from many ethnic/race groups - very diverse. I continue to work with them because I work with victims each  & every day.

This person had significant health needs in addition to developmental disabilities and could not make ends meet.  He did not have family members to assist either.  Because he had celiac disease, he had a very special diet that was about 3 times more costly than a typical diet.  In addition, finding the appropriate food for someone with this diet at a food pantry is extremely challenging.  This person came into crisis just before the beginning of the school year.  Friends of JCDS was able to provide him with a gift card to Wal-Mart so that he could get school clothing and food.  Friends was truly a lifesaver.

None of these items would have been possible to fund without the assistance from Friends of JCDS. They are always timely in their communication and are always pleasant to work with.

The services provided by both shelters astound me in the way that they give tools to people in dire circumstances to overcome their circumstances and establish building blocks to attain a safe and better life for themselves and their families.   They truly are an asset in sharing God's Love to the people in Kansas to make a better society for us all.

Catholic Charities Inc	56670		/users/profile/59314	Womanof1faith	Volunteer	5	11/10/2010	One year ago my 3 year old son and I began serving meals at the St. Anthony's Family Shelter. We went two Tuesday's every month and assisted the kitchen cook. My son was 8 wks old when his father was in a tragic accident leaving us as a single parent family. We were blessed to be provided all of our needs over the next few years and I wanted to teach my son what it meant to give back. Our experience serving at the Shelter far exceeded what I ever imagined. We were a testimony to other single mom's there and gained so much personally by sharing the experience together as a mother and son. My son is 4 now and still recalls serving at the shelter. When I asked him the other day what serving meant to him, he responded, " I like serving at the shelter to help others." It's an experience to reach out to others in ways we may never fully realize the impact it will leave. Catholic Charities provides resources to families and individuals that need hope, love and grace.

I have served on numerous civic and charitable organization boards over the years. I can honestly say that my experience with SAFS/CC has been the best of all. SAFS provides not only a temporary home for displaced families, it provides education and referrals to help families break out of the cycle of poverty and hopelessness.  I feel very strongly that time, talent or money invested in SAFS/CC is an investment in helping families grow out of poverty.

Homeless concerns are never a popular local topic and many local citizens would like the homeless to leave the city.  In spite of many hurdles, the director, Loring Henderson, and the board members have persevered in finding private funding and support to keep the difficulties of housing our local homeless population in front of the city commission and Lawrence citizens.  The board has spent countless hours working to obtain a space large enough to house those who need shelter from the summer's heat and winter's cold; to provide health and social services; to provide a breakfast and supper each day; to provide job training; to provide a safe place to keep clean and sleep.

What could I do to really help? There were so many people that needed more than I could ever give. I soon realized that many times, the best thing that I could offer was my compassion and caring while simply chatting with a few of the guests. Throughout my conversations with the LCS guests, I quickly learned that the case managers are the people that can make things happen. Conversations frequently included things like, "Sally helped me get into a rehab program" or "Arnell helped me get a job" or "Dianne helped put me in touch with [an outside social service agency]"The LCS case managers are amazing at taking care of the helping people fill out applications for housing, jobs, and benefits; they could coordinate help from outside agencies for things like legal aid, medical health, mental health, and addiction issues; and they could work with each guest to build a path to a positive future for people experiencing homelessness. Those experiences ultimately led me to join the Board of Directors and I've spent more than 7 years advocating for local, community-based solutions to the issue of homelessness.
Beak N Wings Inc	210915		/users/profile/273725	CaitlinLOL	Volunteer	1	08/16/2014	You will watch good birds come in and their training will slowly fade away as they are removed or shoved back into their cages with towel restraint. Attempts to solidify prior training with positive reinforcement will be physically interrupted by the overbearing hand of force from other volunteers. Those who do not believe that treats are bribes are simply ignored or worse, mocked in private.The money situation is sketchy. They ask more of their volunteers than anyone should ever be asked to do and the entire business side is collapsible by a hair trigger because of it. There is no financial report, no itemized register for anything. Birds are regularly denied veterinary care, especially the small ones who dont bring in much money. You have to be persistent and annoying to get your foster birds to the vet.     Good people are taken advantage of and asked to do far beyond what is reasonable. Honestly I don't understand why they don't start their own charity.      The president has the final say on everything, which is probably why they don't report numbers. It is also illegal for them to operate that way since they are a 501(c)(3) organization. There isn't supposed to be any person with sole control and your leader is supposed to be voted in but that's not how it is.Some birds become flat out neurotic or otherwise mental because theyre crammed into homes that are bursting at the seams with parrots. There is literally no limit to the number of birds they will give the foster homes, yet adopters have to jump through hoops and cut through red tape in order to adopt one. They refuse to have limits and standards because the person in charge and **some** (not all) of the homes willing to take in this many birds are hoarders who are incapable of basic cleaning and care for the birds.      Minimum requirements by law for sanitary conditions are considered too anal by the person in charge. There are no public reports of how many birds get adopted each month and which ones went to new homes. Most of the big birds have been here for years. YEARS as a foster, despite being fairly good natured. Sometimes foster birds die and nobody knows about it for months. They have no official policy with steps to take on animal cruelty or how to handle it within their shelter. The one sentence that acknowledges this is in any way basically says (paraphrased) 'go to the proper authorities but also let us know if someone is talking bad about us.' Riiiight, like totally sketch.     Education is run by someone with antagonistic ignorance, who doesnt know how to identify many common species or differentiate between those who are sexually dimorphic. The educational presentations include such gems as which parrots in the rescue are extinct in the wild. Thats right folks, they are so exotic and specialized that they have extinct parrots (/s).      They don't even have the education person present the things that matter. They know. They bring your surrendered parrots to birthday parties as if they were clowns. it makes me cringe to write this but it is a sad, sad truth. They are so incapable of fundraising appropriately that this is what they do. These are rescued parrots, not trained performers. No wonder they pluck and bite and scream. If you cant stomach the sight of such atrocities and more at the heart of a shelter, dont volunteer here. Adopt the birds but for the love of God, don't surrender to them.

Beak N Wings Inc	157527	1	/users/profile/208906	Safari64014	Volunteer	5	05/09/2013	I have been a member/volunteer of this club, Beak N Wings, for several years.   The goal being to educate more people about parrots.  Their needs, which include; good nutrition, personal attention, toys, correct cage sizes, health, and grooming.  Also discussed are the many things that are toxic in our homes and environment for our pet birds.  To prevent having so many that are neglected, fed improper diets, not provided with toys, never seen by a veterinarian, and given little to no attention. We participate in many events around the metropolitan area.  Which provides awareness of our club,  and our monthly meetings.  Which are free and open to the community.  Our meetings are educational and fun. These events also allow us to show case our foster birds and make them visible to our communities, to help find them new homes.    All of our birds are released by owners who for whatever reason, are unable to keep and care for their birds any longer.  We then take them into our program, for re homing.  But before we receive them we have volunteers/club members lined up, who take these bird into their homes and become responsible for getting them seen by one of our many club veterinarians, and thirty days later, to as many of the monthly events as is possible.  Depending on the information we have received about the birds, we assess them, and treat them medically as needed.  We then allow them time, 30 days, to adjust into their foster homes.  We spend time a lot of time with them and try to place them in good, responsible homes.   All of our foster homes and adopters homes and given a home study before birds can be placed in them.   Beak N Wings inc, is a 501 C3, we operate solely on donations which include cash and items that we always need.   http://www.beaknwings.org/

Kids Need To Eat	318950		/users/profile/410265	Peter76	Board Member	4	11/15/2016	The need for food support during the summer between school years is one of the more insidious problems facing families in many small communities. KN2E came into being to plug the gap, nutritionally and educationally, by providing meals and activities that bring kids and their families a respite from despair and malnourishment.
Kids Need To Eat	318949		/users/profile/410264	jgstorandt44	Board Member	5	11/15/2016	KN2E supports community efforts to address childhood hunger.

Forever Friends Animal League	194600		/users/profile/254315	anonyoudontknowme91	Client Served	1	02/20/2014	I am not sure if you are aware that one of the Shelters listed on your site was closed as Debbie Sharts was charged with 5 animal code violations including not providing sanitary condition and adequate vet care.  Here are a couple of valid links regarding the shelter, Debbie Sharts, and its closing.  http://fox4kc.com/tag/forever-friends-animal-league/ https://www.facebook.com/pages/Forever-Friends-Animal-League/197114283649670 
Forever Friends Animal League	171695		/users/profile/227341	Pamela Armstrong	Client Served	1	09/25/2013	My daughter purchased a puppy for $550. The conditions in the facility were abhorrent. Nasty cages; fleas and ticks; no attention to the dogs. She likes cats, so they are treated somewhat better. Forever Friends released the puppy WITHOUT being neutered and did not require or care if the puppy was neutered. They offered to pay for the process if my daughter brought him back to their vet, but it was an option. Two days after adopting the dog, my daughter took the puppy to our vet to be neutered -- she did NOT want to return him to Forever Friends because of the deplorable conditions. The vet informed her that the puppy has a heart murmur and he would not under any circumstances perform the surgery. Tests to determine and treat the heart murmur are very expensive, so my daughter called Forever Friends and asked if she could have the $550 returned to spend on the puppy's medical needs. Ms. Sharts, the person who runs Forever Friends, absolutely refused to work with her, called her a liar, and told her that "big dogs don't live very long anyway." She was completely unconcerned about the puppy or the puppy's health.  We believe that Ms. Sharts knew the puppy had a heart murmur and sold him anyway. She was prepared for the phone call and steadfastly refused to even discuss the best interests of the dog. She did not care if the dog was sick or if the dog dies -- as long as she gets her money. The organization claims that they just want animals to find good homes, but that's not true. My daughter didn't want to return the dog -- only have the extra money for medical treatment. If Ms. Sharts had cared only about finding a good home, she would have returned the money. This puppy will be loved and well-cared for. He is just a puppy, but he can't walk around the block or run and play without being totally exhausted. He pants and is uncomfortable even in his sleep. It is sad.

The board is active in its involvement and support and includes members from business, academic, public school, nonprofit and religious organizations who, like the choir, are  of diverse ethnicities. I have been on the board for about five years and love the organization and its members.  We had a tremendously successful celebration of our 25 years in November 2013 at Calvary United Methodist Church with a full house that enjoyed a delicious soul food dinner and uplifting concert that left me frequently in tears.  DVDs of our concerts are available also.  In April we are premiering a new composition at Wichita State University thanks to board member J.C.

Justice For All, Inc.	199570	2	/users/profile/260523	JoshBrahm	Volunteer	5	05/03/2014	Justice For All is one of the most effective organizations I've ever worked with. I've participated them as a volunteer for about six years, and a heavily involved speaker, mentor and facilitator of their seminar for two years. Their director and staff are virtuous, honest and highly intelligent. They are making a great impact for life, and their dialogue training has transformed the way I talk with pro-choice people.
Justice For All, Inc.	198339	1	/users/profile/259043	FamilyFoundation	Donor	5	04/18/2014	My family and I have been involved with Justice for All since being introduced to David and his team during the Focus on the Family Institute in the Summer of 2003. We became involved because of the alignment with our family's values to see abortion become unthinkable in our generation's lifetime.  Obviously many organizations exist that have a similar goal but none that I have found go about that mission in the way Justice for All does. In particular, the following tactical reasons are the differentiating factors that compel us to be involved and support Justice for All:  (1) Multiplication Principle - Justice for All's training model that includes "seat work" and "feet work" with mentorship by Justice for All staff members is not only pedagogically sound, it is a "train the trainer" model that provides the groundwork for multiplication.  This allows for our time and financial investment to multiply exponentially. (2) Engagement at a Critical Age - Many of us have experienced the exchange of ideas that occurs on a college campus and the life inflection point the college years represent for many.  Justice for All is there, offering the great proposition that the unborn is human like you and I. College students change their mind on many issues during these critical years; why not on a topic that could not be more crucial than abortion?  In addition to engaging high school and college students, Justice for All is exploring additional tools to begin the conversation at a younger age about the humanity of the unborn.  (3) An End to the Culture of Silence with an Ecumenical Voice - Too many followers of Jesus sit on the sidelines waiting to be put into the game.  Justice for All has player-coaches that call us into the game to engage our fellow citizens in discussions about the value of the unborn.  Even better, these coaches come from many perspectives within the Church.  This creates a unified mission for the Church, as it is represented at Justice for All, to make abortion unthinkable. I would encourage everyone to become involved with Justice for All.  Come out to a campus event - I have been to campus events in 3 states and each one is different.   Give your time and provide the financial means for Justice for All to accomplish the mission of training thousands to make abortion unthinkable for millions, one person at a time.

Cancer Action Inc	91592		/users/profile/104859	Mary	Volunteer	5	06/22/2011	I have been both a client and a volunteer at Cancer Action.  My journey with the organization began with my breast cancer diagnosis at 43.  Cancer Action provided me with a wig, in-dwelling cath supplies, and emotional support.  I was fortunate to have excellent insurance and wonderful friends and family, who could take me to appointments, etc. so I did not need to utilize Cancer Action's programs such as prescriptions aid and transportation.  Shortly after finishing treatment, I began volunteering with Cancer Action, mainly with PC support (logging volunteer supplies and hours, entering clients, etc.).  The organization is a group of remarkable people, consisting of both employees and volunteers.  They provide hugely needed support and services and do so with compassion, friendship and humor.  I have never met a more remarkable group of women as the ones I "work" for at Cancer Action.  I am a better, more richly developed, and happier person for my association with them.

Pals Animal Rescue Inc	240100	3	/users/profile/326154	depley24	Client Served	1	03/28/2015	My family and I wanted to adopt this beautiful cat that my daughter and I fell in love with that was up for adoption through pals at a local Petsmart. After going home and discussing it first I went back the next day and filled out their application. It took two days before I heard anything back and that was only because I emailed the director and another person. The only reason I did this was because the manger of Petsmart recommended it, and said she would put in a good word for me. After 5 days of emailing back and forth we were bluntly denied being able to adopt. The reason, we could not show three years of vet history on current pets. Well or current pets we have owned two years or less. Which they are current on necessary vet visits. My past vet from pets that passed on 4 years ago would not give a reference without first talking to me. I called and gave permission and then informed the PALS director and other person handling the adoption that they could call back. They refused to call that vet back for the reference and still said their was nothing they could do as it was their policy. With that aside (that they never followed through on a reference that could give them a 7 year history of me as a good pet client), no where on their website or their adoption application does it list a "policy" that you have to prove a three year vet history in order for them to approve an adoption. They simply did not want to put forth the effort to adopt this cat to my family. A cat they adopted out to what they considered an approved family, and that family returned him and the dog they adopted a week later. Something I would never do. We met all of their qualifications and were still turned down. The Petsmart manager even stated they are hard to adopt from and make their own rules as they go. The director mainly was who she was referring to. I understand being picky, but acting this way, its no wonder why it takes them so long to find homes for pets. Plus they don't even respond to your application unless you constantly email them. As they do not return your phone calls and half the time their voicemail box is full. Something needs to be done so they stop abusing the power they feel they have. I have worked as an adoption coordinator for a shelter before. They are taking their standards too high. This cat my family wants has been up for adoption for four months and still does not have a home. Especially now when it could, but they are denying it. Their so called policies are not listed on the application or their website. Where is this set in stone? Also I was told by one of their people she had to deny it because of the vet reference, but I could talk to the director as she has before and could very well override that decision. They were solely basing their decision off of the vet not giving them a reference the first time they called. But yet never called that vet back after the vet was given permission to talk to them. 
WHOLE Women Ministries/Dirty Girls Ministries	146076		/users/profile/192735	ljacobs81	Volunteer	5	12/06/2012	Dirty Girls Ministry (DGM) has literally been a God-send for me. This ministry, founded by Crystal Renaud, is one of the first who candidly & gracefully addressed the growing epidemic of sexual addictions within the Christian community, especially for Christian women. The ministry helps women to recognize that they are not alone in their struggles & meets them with grace, love, and unconditional support. I was so impacted by this ministry & it's mission to help others, that I am now on staff as the Volunteer Community Manager. Daily I meet new women who are being affected by many types of sexually-based addictions and daily I am amazed at how God is using DGM to impact these women in a profoundly positive way. I am so thankful that a ministry like DGM exists & that I have been blessed enough to be a part of it. 
WHOLE Women Ministries/Dirty Girls Ministries	145928		/users/profile/192537	libertyanne01	Client Served	4	12/05/2012	Dirty Girls Ministries is an amazing Christmas organization. It helps women who are addicted to pornography, and sexual addictions. A lot of us have had some sort of sexual abuse in our pasts which did not help us. I use to think I was the only women who was addiction to pornography or something was seriously wrong with me. Come to find out there are tons of women struggling with the same thing. Dirty Girls Ministry is a safe place for women to find accountability, prayer, friendships, support and they just had their first conference this year. We are all committed to finding sobriety and working on our roots of why we struggled in the first place. I so love this ministry, it has saved my life and helped me so much in my recovery in my addiction. 
Association Of American Educators	272612	1	/users/profile/361692	William77	Professional with expertise in this field	5	11/20/2015	This organization is truly giving a voice to teachers unlike any organization out there. AAE offers many of the same benefits as the teachers unions without forcing you to join or stay or sending member dues to partisan political campaigns that teachers may disagree with. Because of that, membership with this organization is a fraction of the cost. I'm incredibly enthusiastic about this organization and I encourage teachers across the U.S. to find out more!
Association Of American Educators	168903	2	/users/profile/223875	Likeitis	Client Served	1	09/10/2013	Several teachers recieved emails in our area from this organization. They claim they are here to help teachers, but a quick web search revealed they are against public education, pro voucher and private schools. Several teachers I know replied critically to the emails they recieved.  They were attacked by this group, who complained to the school district. Their intention was to get the teacher in trouble by accusing them of inappropriate behavior th the HR department.  This organization is looking to rob teachers of their money then use that money to destroy their profession. They have no interest in helping teachers. This group is a tax dodge for union busting groups and nothing more.

Awake Inc	256964	2	/users/profile/345367	Liesastheyspeak	General Member of the Public	1	09/13/2015	I find that the non-profit organization known as Planting Peace is a sham and is serving more as a political background for the gay community rather than doing it for the orphanages they so desperately want to be noticed for. That billboard about Kim Davis shows just how mean spirited they can be; obviously they must really need to draw attention to their organization (nobody would care about them otherwise), or else they wouldn't have done such a thing. This is no "Red Cross" or "Salvation Army". Save your money and support a real organization.  How much money did they waste on that billboard to begin with, when they could have used it for the orphans?  I would call them a bunch of idiots, but that would be too good for them.

EDUCATION AND MORE	3900	30	/users/profile/5663	clara	Volunteer	5	04/23/2009	I have been a volunteer in Guatemala and know firsthand the poverty that I witnessed there.  Poor living conditions are the norm.  The people are friendly and happy, but are so poor compared to us.  Any help we extended, they appreciated so very much. We took used shoes to be distributed around the community and you would have thought we were delivering brand new items from the mall.  Even considering the improper fit, having shoes was better than no shoes at all.  The children are happy to play marbles in the dirt, unlike some of our children who are so spoiled to TV, video games, and movies.  Since seeing the malnutrition in some of the children, it is hard for me to throw out table scraps knowing how precious they would be in Guatemala.  My experience was a moving one.  It is hard to return to life in the USA and live like we are so accustomed to, knowing what circumstances remain in Guatemala.

Prairie Museum of Art & History	903	5	/users/profile/1725	judylsweeney	Donor	5	08/04/2008	The importance of presenting the history of the development of western Kansas has begun thanks to museums like the Prairie Museum of Art & History.  I was born and grew up in the far northwestern corner of KS.  However, I have lived the majority of my life on the East coast where I have experienced historical preservation in multiple venues and often wondered when such preservation would start in Western Kansas and indeed it has.  Recently, it was my pleasure to research the records for the Lone Star Presbyterian Church, which is on the grounds of the Prairie Museum. These hand written records are now available to descendants (and others) of the original congregation of The Lone Star Presbyterian Church, which is representative of early prairie churchs. This church is only one of many parts of the museum that tells of the  development of prairie life in that part of our country. Through newsletters and personal visits, it has been a pleasure to observe the development of the museum. The museum's programs focusing on numerous aspects of prairie life history through to current day developments are to be highly commended. Thus the Prairie Museum of Art and History is an important part of the foundation for understanding and supporting the future development of Western Kansas.

We have so many projects going there at the museum and many more to entice innovative people who are proud of local culture and history. This is a great place to preserve the regional heritage for generations to come.
Kansas Food Bank Warehouse Inc	165301	4	/users/profile/219747	HAPI	General Member of the Public	5	08/19/2013	The Kansas Food Bank is an amazing non-profit organization that serves 85 counties in Kansas.  Providing food to several hunger care partnering agencies, they reach children, adults & seniors who are experiencing food insecurity.  Their outreach is amazing, the staff/board is ethical, honest & their mission is being met, as they are focused on positive outcomes.  I would recommend this agency to anyone looking to make a donation or do volunteer work.  Remember, we all experience hunger, however not everyone has the means to put food on the table, hence the Kansas Food Bank provides support.

All India Mission	198209		/users/profile/258900	Terroljones	Board Member	5	04/17/2014	I have known Pastor NJ Varughese since 1968 when we served on the same Operation Mobilization evangelistic team in Bihar northeast India.  I took one month leave from my pastoral duties in the USA and worked with Brother NJ and his partner Pastor Joycutty in 1975, buying them their first two bikes. I have been a part of their ministry ever since serving on the board of All India Mission and being committed to the vision for Shanti Bhavan Medical Center which I have visited from the beginning of construction until it's ongoing completion. In the beginning my wife and I bought Pastor NJ's ticket to Sri Lanka where we served many years as missionaries teaching at Lanka Bible College.  Then we purchased a one way ticket for him to come to the USA and gave him my mailing list to help him get started.  He and his wife Ellen along with his friends and prayer partners have developed All India Mission and have brought the Jharkhand medical facility into reality by their faithful work.  We have been prayer partners with them and watched God perform wonderful miracles in their ministry.   I visit them two or three times a year and greatly value the opportunity to share the Word with the over 650 pastors, evangelists and Christian workers whom they have seen raised up in northeast India around Bihar and adjacent states. I have been privileged to be involved with many different national groups in India since 1968, and none are more grassroots, on target church planting and sincerely serving The Lord with much fruit, as Brother NJ ministry. You can contact me if you like at terroljones@gmail.com Terrol Jones

Allegro Choirs Of Kansas City Inc	237378	1	/users/profile/321931	corporalk	Client Served	5	01/27/2015	I was a member of Allegro Choirs of Kansas City since 2004, and have loved every single year of it. Yes, there are a lot of rehearsals, and yes, sometimes it is necessary to add extra rehearsals in if the singers are not prepared for the concert in time. That's totally understandable, though- being in a choir isn't about yourself or for yourself.  This is a constant with any choir, and if you can't embrace that ideal, choir isn't your best option. What we do each practice and performance is give 110% of ourselves to improve ourselves and our peers. Most importantly, it's to change everyone in the Allegro community with the power of song, whether it's an audience member attending our concerts, or even during rehearsal.  The Allegro building is out in Bonner Springs, Kansas. Most of the members of the choir are from Leawood, Shawnee, Overland Park, etc. Nowhere near the studio. But it doesn't matter that the drive is long- everyone is here because they want to be, and that's because the director has such motivation, such intense and sincere passion, to make people realize how powerful we, as children, and as adolescents, can be. Sometimes, the singers might not meet the standards Allegro sets, and we are urged to improve. Many times, overprotective parents have lashed out at the staff simply because /their/ child isn't doing their work. That's nobody's fault but the singers'. Allegro wants the individual to exceed, but also reminds us that, especially in a choir, if you don't pull your own weight, you hold the entire choir back from something greater.  Newer members of Allegro sometimes become frustrated with the nitpicky aspects of the choir, like the concert uniform, the note checks, the restarting a piece in practice 20 times until everyone's vowel matches. But as someone who has literally grown up in this choir, I can tell you the nitpicking makes all the difference. It teaches the singers how to act outside of Allegro as well- to give everything we have, and to be the best people we can possibly be.   When you sign up for Allegro, it's a two-sided commitment. And part of that commitment is being at every, or nearly every, rehearsal ready to devote yourself to what is happening right then. Commitment is doing the weekly assignments in their entirety, not just checking off the boxes blindly and pretending you've practiced at home. And it means preparing yourself to adapt to changing situations- many times, a choir is on track for the concert, but there's one song that a few individuals can't sing from memory, or simply haven't learned. In these situations, it's necessary to add extra rehearsals and homework. If there's no issue, there are no extra rehearsals. And a side note- there is a carpool system. All you have to do is find someone who lives nearby and take turns providing a ride to choir. Allegro has provided so many incredible opportunities to me, and has more or less shaped me into the person I am today. The people you meet, the music you perform, and the connections you make are priceless. I owe the Allegro staff so much thanks for everything they do. They really put themselves out there for the singers, and are our biggest fans. If you have a child who is of age to join Allegro, I absolutely urge you to- but only if you're truly and honestly willing to devote yourself to it. Allegro is an experience for its singers to grow musically, but also morally. And if your singer really gives everything they have, I can tell you firsthand there's nothing more thrilling than finding out you've moved up a choir, and nothing more humbling than your first concert wearing Brio's pearls.
Allegro Choirs Of Kansas City Inc	213261		/users/profile/276433	kadumm	Client Served	1	09/04/2014	My 13 year old son joined this choir back in June. When we registered him we got a 2 page contract to initial and sign. In this contract it clearly states certain things that are required as a member of this choir. Not until after we paid our$ 600 tuition cost we were provided a calendar. In This Calendar We Found Multiple Additional Dates That We Were Required To Be Out There For rehearsals. These dates and times were totally inconvenient for us.Upon making Allegro aware of the conflict we had with these dates. When we tried to drop out we were told the tuition was non refundable.  We made it work and once again we were blind sided with another bit of required time and money. Again after we paid our tuition this continued to happen  The week of August 19th my son was ill all week and  did not attend the required rehearsals. I Se t an end mail telling the choir director why he would not be there.  The next day I received an email back that insulted my son's commitment to this choir so we dropped out. Now we are fighting with them saying we were deceived on many occasions and want all money paid to Allegro to be refunded. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY OR CHILDS TALENT WITH THIS SCHEMING CHOIR GROUP. They are clearly in it for the money . A disgruntled former member.

EASTERN COWLEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER	56459		/users/profile/58949	Lynn P.	Volunteer	5	11/06/2010	ECCRC started out as a 501-C non-profit community resource center in the fall of 2003. Since then, it has moved its headquarters to Dexter, KS. A huge part of ECCRC is their Lighthouse Library project, in part a living tribute to a local teen who was killed in an auto accident & as a tribute to the town. The library is a needed service for the town as the nearest library is about 20 miles in one direction and 30 in the other direcgtion. Two sustaining projects - the Grouse Valley Lodge (a rental cabin) and The Treasure Chest (a thrift store) are the sustaining projecgts that will preven any financial burden to the town folks for keeping the library open. The hope is for these two projects to raise the funds to pay the utilities on the library. A local author has also donated proceeds from two books in support of the library. Nearly 200 people have volunteered to make the Lighthouse Library project a reality. Located at 104 S. Main in Dexter, KS. In years past - 100 Thanksgiving food boxes were donated by ECCRC with the help of local volunteers. ECCRC receives no Government funding & relies on public donations. 
Emmanuel House Seminary	13740	8	/users/profile/15720	rca03	Former staff	5	10/13/2009	I really loved being at Emmanuel House as an intern for Precious and Liam. I learned a lot of skills there, not just about writing newsletters and setting up events, and doing some errands, but also about who I am as a person.  The classes at Emmanuel House and the work I did there helped me grow so much spiritually in more ways than I had ever experienced.  I learned so much more about the bible and also what it means to be a Christian and how to grow as a person.  Being at Emmanuel House has been a huge, profound, and lasting impact on my life that I will never forget.  I have made lifelong friends with Precious and Liam and am so grateful for their direction and spiritual wisdom in my life.
Emmanuel House Seminary	12437	8	/users/profile/14438	EmmaHouse	Volunteer	5	10/08/2009	I have seen the entire process that my parents, Liam and Precious Atchison, have gone through to begin and continue this ministry.  I have not only learned a great deal simply from watching them interact with students and other people, but I have also been incredibly inspired by the mission of Emma House.  Their focus is so personal and they really care about each individual who comes through the door.  I think that the small class sizes, which provide a much more intimate and welcoming setting, is very appealing to most people.  Also, as a household setting, it is comfortable, welcoming, and the coffee's always ready! Something that I see as a non-student but as a first-hand observer of how things are run, is how much time, even outside the classroom, that my parents put into this ministry.  They are truly passionate about it, genuinely care about people, and they are so very good at what they do!

One Spark Foundation	286649		/users/profile/376719	Becky_J	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	I am inspired to give to others whenever I can but especially during the Holiday seasons because as someone who was a single parent with 3 kids that even with working 2 and 3 jobs at a time could never quite make enough to be able to furnish the way I wanted to for the Holidays and yet we always made it a family tradition to help at least one child if not more off the angel tree.  Now that I am older and my kids are grown, we still help out as much as we can around the Holidays through the Angel Tree, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities and others but I am inspired even more when I hear the stories of how one particular local group helps out hundreds of people every year, not only through the Holidays but every single day.  One Spark Foundation and David Hill are Amazing Angels that have affected countless lives for the better and the kind of people that others strive to be like.  They are why I strive to be a better person every day and help others to be better too.

It is also a site that delivers information about this history and the local heroes who have made it.  Annually the museum honors  Trailblazers and Torchbearers, people of various races who have contributed to the struggle for freedom and equal opportunity for all in this country.  Its exhibits, its programs for adults--like the geneology classes and Senior Wednesday speakers, its programs every Saturday for families 2-4 pm, and its summer programs for middle school children are exemplary.  The staff is creative and amazingly productive, and the museum is off to a great new start under Mark McCormick's diligent and innovative leadership.  The board is fully engaged in supporting the museum and is composed of leaders in Wichita's business, nonprofit and academic communities.

These dedicated people have stepped up at a time of dire need.  Their dedication and hard work has been inspiring.    Many of the residents were elderly and the center of the community which contained their beloved community center was destroyed.   After 7 years of working with the organization I am motivated to do more as I see the strength of the women who work on the committees and the board.   Many of the women are in their 80s and continue to work on many of the fund raising and community projects.   The rebuilding has been due to their willingness to roll up their sleeves and tackle the difficult jobs.   A donation to this organization would allow them to continue to rebuild and provide programs to residents throughout all of southeast Kansas.
Food Equality Initiative Inc	286832		/users/profile/376902	Tammy_R	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Why weve done 2 food drives for the Food Equality Initiative within the last 6 months.My daughter is my world and I would do anything to give her good health, happiness and normalcy...  No child should have to settle for less.  But when your world is rocked with anaphylactic food allergies and Celiac Disease, you learn very quickly that the word normal is no longer an option.  I have worked very hard every day to ensure that my daughter never feels left out.  Whatever her friends are eating, I will create a safe version.  It might not be a perfect match, but I will do whatever I can to get as close as possible.  But for all of those lopsided gluten free and nut free cake pops or warped versions of Olaf cupcakes, I am reminded every day that we are actually the lucky ones.  We have the resources and ability to redefine the word normal when most do not.  I knew I needed to raise a grateful child, one who would want to look out for her allergy friends and let them know they should not have to go without either.Here is my daughters take on giving backMy name is McKenna Rhodes and I am 8 years and 10 months old right now.  The reason why I donate and have food drives for The Food Equality Initiative is because I know what it feels like to not be able to eat whatever I want. I am lucky that my parents and family can afford the food I need.  If you go to the store and get food that I cant eat, like cornbread, then it would be so much cheaper like $1.30. But, if you buy it gluten free, it would be more like $5.30 and you can see the difference.  Its so super expensive!! There is like a $4.00 difference.  So, some people barely have the money to even afford cornbread, but if you go to FEI, you can get what you need to eat for free.  So, I think that FEI is great because some people cant afford that, but it has made a change in a bunch of peoples lives.  I usually see regular food pantries needing peanut butter, but this place needs soy milk and the 8 most common food allergens like milk, eggs, dairy, wheat, and nuts. I know how hard it is to not be able to get to eat what all my friends are eating.  Like, when my class won a competition, I had to eat something different and that made me feel left out.  I know how hard that is, so I can only imagine how it would feel to not even be able to eat a safe version of what others are getting to eat. So, that is why FEI needs more donations so my friends never go hungry and never feel left out like we already do every day.Love,Tammy and McKenna Rhodes
Media for the Missing Inc.	161776	2	/users/profile/214570	marianne asher-chapman	Professional with expertise in this field	5	06/29/2013	We, with Missouri Missing, recently had the pleasure of working with Media For the Missing on an awareness event, Missouri Missing and Unidentified Person's Awareness day, as proclaimed by Missouri Governor, Jay Nixon. I, a co-founder, of Missouri Missing, knew I needed some help in putting this big event together. I recalled meeting Stephanie Coplen several times in the past with various missing person's gatherings and was very impressed with her and her organization. I reached out to her for help. She went beyond helping me, in several ways, including getting the word out far and wide. Media For the Missing is a vastly important organization to especially, the families with a missing loved one. I am excited to know there is a much needed organization such as this, as mother of a missing daughter and a missing person's advocate. It has been a long time coming.

sacred-Sexually Abused Childrens Relief Endeavor	234443		/users/profile/299272	JohnDatt	Board Member	5	11/25/2014	It has been an amazing year for Sexually Abused Children's Relief Endeavor,sacred, as we have added two extremely experienced and passionate members to our board and have granted over $20,000 to the families of Sexual Child Abuse.  In 2013, we granted less than $5000.  We are grateful for the local Rotary Clubs who have raised and donated over $10,000 this past year for us.  We were also fortunate to have received our first grant from a corporate entity in Leawood, KS.  Our ability to successfully fundraise will allow us to continue to increase our aid and assistance to families who have a child who has been sexually abused and experienced financial difficulties.

Monty Thompson Continuing Education Foundation	94928		/users/profile/109927	melvaa	Board Member	4	08/02/2011	Prior to Monty's death, he was serving on a committe that was in the process of setting up an educational  foundation to support the teachers and students of South Barber School District , USD 255.  His wishes were that any memorials at the time of his death be the seed to start this foundation.  The wheels were put into motion and the week prior to his death the foundation was established as a non-profit organization.  The foundation is fortunate to have 13 members who are forward thinking, love kids, and are dedicated to South Barber. the board consists of one teacher, one  principal, the superintendent, one family member, one board member and 9 members of the community. To date the foundation has funded grants in the total amount of $2,648.68 that was used to purchase the following for teachers and their classrooms: 1st and 2nd grade field trip to the Wichita Zoo, simulated baby and car seat for CTE program at the high school, material for forensics and speech class, live organisms and microscope repair for HS and Jr. H science classes, partial paymeng for CNC plasma cutting machine, buzzer system for scholars bowl. 2 worklights for webcast. wireless interactive teaching tablet, reading supplies for the elementary, reading telephones, 2 Xbox 360's, and $500 for a children's relief fund.

Veronicas Voice Inc	253063		/users/profile/341211	JodyWilliams	Professional with expertise in this field	2	08/16/2015	I'm troubled when I find more than one article that states that this is the "only one of it's kind in the country" or the "sole program that offers these services" when that's not true.  This program was started in 2009 and was founded by a survivor who does street outreach and provides also residential support for adult women.  That said, the Mary Magdalene Project was founded in Los Angeles in 1980 and is still active today doing the same thing.  It was not founded by a survivor - but they've had Sex Workers Anonymous support from 1987 until approximately 2000.  Dignity in Phoenix was founded by a survivor for adult women and they've been operating since 1991.  From about 1988 until 2000 - almost every Salvation Army and Catholic Charity had Sex Workers Anonymous survivors doing outreach, and running the meetings in their shelters.  The Dream Center also has an outreach and program for adult women where they're located.  So for them to have multiple listings of being the "sole" program of it's kind is not accurate - especially when used in fund raising.  Especially when it causes "economic interference" with competitor programs.   One article could be a misquote.  I see that all the time.  But multiple cases is an issue to think about.  One has to wonder why someone would open a program to help alcoholics without an AA meeting or a Big Book.  I'm the founder of Sex Workers Anonymous and I've never had even a conversation with the founder, nor have we sold any Recovery Guides to anyone in their program.  Shame.  We have a very high success rate.   In my opinion it's a disservice to the women to not let them know about other services available.  I'm aware of other programs because whatever we can't provide - I'll find the people who call our hotline which has been answered by a survivor since 1987 now.  To me it's like a doctor putting out a shingle that he's a doctor when he's only had one year of medical school.  If they're not aware of other programs that do exist, and research what other people are doing - how seriously are they taking the quality of services they're offering these women?  What about transgenders and males?  I just have concerns here.  
Concordia Foursquare Church	277571		/users/profile/367384	marymichellemcmichael	Client Served	5	01/21/2016	This is probably the best church I have been to even though I only went for Christian Challenge it was a great experience and the things we talked about were amazingly eye opening like other churches' don't really do. I like how much that they listen to people and just to know that there are actually people who care and want to share Christianity through strength and wisdom.
Global Education Plus Inc	273843		/users/profile/363129	busyladytoo	Donor	5	12/05/2015	This is a fine organization run by an all-volunteer Board. Approximately 95% of donations go to support its projects. Currently they are providing college scholarships to needy and deserving students in Guatemala.  They also partner with ACSI to provide scholarships to needy teachers for online teacher training and certification.  They also provide bonuses to teachers in a creative access nation where teachers are paid next to nothing.  This past year they also helped to provide a medical clinic in Haiti.  Most of the efforts of this organization is in promoting a Christian worldview in education.  In the past they have provided textbooks, medicines and helped to build schoolhouses in needy Central and South America.

MUSIC THEATRE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE INC	32231	2	/users/profile/33020	steven3	Volunteer	5	03/02/2010	I've been involved many years with MTYP, as a participant, a volunteer, and an employee. In all aspects, the program played a vital role in teaching me important life lessons, preparing me for the future, and supporting me when most needed. I don't think I can look back at my life and see anything that MTYP has not touched. Its shows are always professional quality, but still an educational and fun environment for the students; and by choosing to perform a rich variety of shows, the messages are always moving. The one drawback is that word has not spread farther.
Bless The Beasts Inc	248549		/users/profile/336289	missalma	Client Served	5	07/15/2015	In 2003 I went on petfinder and saw a picture of a little havanese dog named Sierra.I fell in love on the spot and dashed off an application to Bless the Beasts! This was my first dog from a rescue and they were very very accurate in describing her personality and temperment. At the time she was being treated for heartworm that she contracted at a high kill shelter where Bless the Beasts rescued her from. As soon as they gave me the go ahead I drove over 700 miles to get her. They will not ship dogs (which no reliable rescue would do). Needless to say, Sierra, renamed Miss Alma was the love of my life for the next 10 years!!! She was 12 when she died and I miss her everyday. I have continued to be in contact with Karla and donate regularly to this organization. I highly recommend this organization. They are honest and really care about their rescue dogs!Nancy Rech

KVC Health Systems	150827		/users/profile/201147	notoveryet	Professional with expertise in this field	5	03/09/2013	I am a professional with expertise in this field because I am a mother, A good mother and KVC took my daughter because they would financially gain from me! I never did anything wrong, or hurt my daughter in any way. My daughter was taken illegally by her father and missing 9 months. My daughter was found in Arizona and sent home to me in March 2009. She was returned only weighing 90lbs, her hair was almost completely fallen out and had been cutting herself. I got her immediate Health attention and Psychological help. I went to all meetings and took her to several Health appointment's on a weekly basis. Once I got her healthy, we still continued therapy.  Her behavior changed and I had to call the police,hoping they would explain the consequences if this behavior continued. They did a good job, she didn't listen. The last call i made was non emergency and spoke to an officer. I thought 2 days in detention would WAKE her up. They came promising this was going to only be 2 days. My daughter was never taken to detention. YOU TOOK her and she is still not home and it is March 2013. She was 15 years Old at the time. I Lost her, when she was taken by her father...I raised her myself her whole life. I cried everyday and prayed she would be found. I lived in a NIGHTMARE for 9 months. Seeing and hearing the tragedy's that happened to my daughter in Arizona, I studied all of it and how to help her. I did more than I was supposed to. I am her mom and I love her so much. Than YOU TERRIBLE People took her from me, like I was a bad mother! EXPLAIN to me, WHAT did I EVER DO! And to make matters worse. you lied and did not know what to say about me, so you say, I neglected medical care for her. Funny!! I have proof of every appointment and counselling session. 3-5 times a week we. My daughter and I   were seeking treatment for her and never missed an appointment for her. I am not finished and I will get an apology and more even if I take you to the supreme court. And the Court Appointed attorney should not ever talk about his assigned case. I found out he and My daughters Social worker were helping each other out to keep her in the KVC custody.. You put her in care of bad people where she was raped, bribed and abused! HOW DARE YOU! Her life was already ruined and now, "think about it"Think of the Pain I am continuing to go through. YOU ruined not only my daughter, you ruined me for life. This is also going public!!!! You will know by next week, get your made-up, thoughtless answers ready/Don't worry.You can not explain 1 of them, when or if you lie,that is more against you!

They have a 24-hour hotline, advocates (who helps victims from the beginning of a rape exam through trial and beyond), educational program (which goes to schools and businesses to inform about what classifies as sexual assault and how to prevent it), and classes/meetings for survivors. I was introduced to this organization when a speaker came into my college classroom.  As a survivor of childhood rape I can't say enough good things about how beneficial this program is to victims and families of victims in our community as well as survivors from other areas!

Managerially, the agency's clinical director wouldn't negotiate with the previous psychiatrist, Dr. Wallace, on his salary so Doc left. HUGE loss to the Winfield community! Earlier this year I needed a refill of one of my prescriptions and was told the agency's computer system would be down for several days as the clinical director had allowed the subscription to the medical records program to lapse.  What is up with this guy???? Hope there were no hospitalizations where someone really needed a doctor to have his or her records.  Other than managerial matters, I HIGHLY recommend this agency, at least the Winfield branch! 
Doorstep Inc	201257		/users/profile/251838	BreKS	Client Served	5	05/29/2014	When my mother was sick with cancer she was unable to work and had a very limited source of income. I lived at home with my brother at this time to help take care of her and house. There came a point where we were unable to pay the utility bills and Doorstep help us out. We were able to keep keep everything going and get ahead of the bills again. Their small donation mad a world of difference to me and my family because nobody else could help us. I had never heard of them before that time, but i will never forget them. Now whenever I have anything I can donate (usually clothes and food) I always split it between them and the rescue mission in town. 
Casa Of Shawnee County Inc	150375		/users/profile/200532	PetsitterG	Donor	5	03/02/2013	This agency is great. They are court appointed by the Judge in the court system to cases of children that have been removed from their homes by SRS b/c their parents were neglectful or abusive to them. These highly trained volunteers are then appointed to the children's case to monitor how the parents are doing to get their children back into their home; make sure that all court orders are being followed; make sure that the child is in a safe foster home, & much more. There is an opportunity for these volunteers to become friends, mentors and advisors to the children throughout the life of the case which could be over 1 year of out of home services. They also monitor how the child is doing in school. They can observe the visits between parents and children as the case progresses. Everything is then written down in a court report that is overviewed by the volunteers supervisor. A final draft is then sent to the Judge and all parties on the case. The volunteer and supervisors do appear at the hearings for the case.These volunteers can be a real support system to a child that has been let down by a neglectful parent. Traditionally foster care agency workers move around a lot, leave a case after a child gets use to them. Here is an opportunity for the volunteer to be the one 'constant' on a childs case. The one person that remains during the entire life of the case. The person that has been there for the child the whole life of the case. They are for the Child!
Youth For Christ Usa Inc	286849	1	/users/profile/376920	Destinee_B	General Member of the Public	5	04/22/2016	Thankfulness for a changed life, from being used and abused to being loved and valued, inspires me to give back. After growing up in foster care, in 19 different foster homes to be exact, I started looking for the love that I was missing.  I wanted someone to love me and I would do anything to get it.  This need led me into the arms of the wrong man.  Everything was so perfect; he built me up and made me feel beautiful and special, AND loved.  But when I found out I was pregnant he became real abusive in every way possible.  The State of Kansas enrolled me into high school completion classes at Youth for Christ-Wichita in 2010.  The longer I attended classes, the closer I got to the staff there.  I built a bond with them that was strong enough for me to know that I could trust going to them for anything.  The YFC Parent Life Director, Pam, always knew when there was something wrong with me, but I was trying to hide the abuse as much as I could.  Then the love of my life told me I had to go out and use my body to make money.  A 9 to 5 job wasnt good enough, he wanted that fast money.  I made several attempts to leave him, but he had cut me off from everyone so I thought I had to stay. When our son was 9 months old the abuse moved to him.  The day I had to see my son with bruises and cuts all over his face was my last straw.  I couldnt let my son go through what I did.  So, with no money or belongings, I took my son and left.  I had an old trick get me a motel room where I called Pam and told her everything. That morning the YFC Parent Life staff picked us up, took us to eat, and found us a place to live with another YFC couple, Chuck & Janis.  The hope, encouragement, and help I received through Youth for Christ-Wichita turned my life around.  I completed my high school education and began attending church.  I began to see my value through Jesus and accepted Him as my Savior.  The choices I make in my life now are based on what God wants me to do not what someone else or the world says.This past February I began giving back by becoming a volunteer with the ministry that helped me so much.  YFCs slogan is Give Life to Your Story.  Sharing my story the first time was hard and brought me to tears, but it is so rewarding to know my story can help other young moms see their lives change for the better too!

Also, their treatment program and use of the outdoor ropes course contribute to a much higher than average success rate.  I can tell that their staff thoroughly enjoys their work, and as a result, many have very long tenure with the organization.

Trilogy Cultural Arts Centre	207377		/users/profile/270033	show_stopper_247	General Member of the Public	2	07/28/2014	I recently saw a theater production by this group and I really enjoyed it. It was a mostly youth cast so I was pretty impressed with the talent based on some of the age. I went back to watch a dance performance by them. I was greatly disturbed by several things:The dancers had terrible technique. several of them had a lot of potential but they aren't going to  grow as dancers in that facility. Not only did they lack technique but the teachers put girls who were clearly not ready on pointe shoes. This is very dangerous and can cause serious injury if a student doesn't have enough ankle strength or technique. Another thing I noticed was they had two young ladies on aerial silks. While this was very beautiful and added a new element to the performance I couldn't help but notice they had no crash pads. I have seen many performances of aerialists and anytime there is a underage child involved crash pads are provided. This just seemed irresponsible and dangerous to me.

I have been aquatinted for several years with this wonderful organization and have observed how they have assisted many who could not afford eyeglasses and prescription medications. The kindness of the Executive Director Rosa Molina is the force behind the caring and assisting of these very needy recipients. She shows individual compassion and makes sure that her staff does the same. She works endless hours to make sure that she has funding, which has been very limited and works very hard to assist her clients not just with MSB provides but with information about other organizations services that her clients have a need for. I am proud to know Rosa and to support MSB, I hope you will too.

I was very impressed how they helped after the tornado in Oklahoma so I gave even more at that time.

If you are not from around the area you want to avoid getting involved in the back stabbing, two faced antics of this place.  Very dysfunctional staff in a dying town.

Valeo Behavioral Health Care Inc	239092	2	/users/profile/324695	Marie63	Client Served	1	03/10/2015	Valeo is one of the biggest frauds and cheats in town. I have a family member required to go by order of drug court. They are refused treatment unless they pay the full price $115.00 for 45 minutes. They refused to allow her to apply for a sliding fee scale. Unable to obtain insurance due to no income. When insurance was in the picture last year, premiums were approx $450 a month, and they had to pay $18,600 dollars of the full price due to copays and coinsurance. There is no financial help available. Everyone I have talked to, and I have called every number they have published, are extremely nasty, and just say "We don't do that".The only civil employees at Valeo work in Human Resources, and they really don't have anything to do with that.

HOSPITALIZED VETERANS WRITING PROJECT INC	61617	1	/users/profile/67295	poethack	Volunteer	5	01/29/2011	I have been a poetry editor for Veterans' Voices magazine--part of The Hospitalized Veterans Writing Project--since 1976. The magazine publishes prose and poetry written by vets under the care of the VA. This writing therapy project has served veterans from every war and engagement since WW II. Writing about experiences, emotions, fears, and challenges has given solace and encouragement to thousands of veterans throughout the county.  Also, by writing, veterans explore the world of creativity--a world in which they can expand and develop their talents. Not every piece of writing published in Veterans' Voices could be published in a literary journal unless the pieces were judged on how much they touch and heal hearts. Veterans' Voices currently pays each veteran upon publication and also offers cash prizes for each issue. The pride veterans feel when they see their work in print is priceless for them and for our country.

Welcome Inn Leisure Center Inc	246849		/users/profile/334296	Marcheta	Client Served	5	06/30/2015	   When I was asked to express my feelings about patronizing the Welcome Inn in Larned, my thought immediately went to the many benefits that are available for all patrons.   I enjoy coming to the Welcome Inn Senior Center for a number of reasons.  First of all, we are greeted as soon as we enter the door.  Then there are the wonderful meals.  They are always appetizing and served with care and concern for all the patrons as to their needs, such as diabetics, gluten free diets, and other health concerns.   There is a person who makes announcements at noon every day to let us know of activities that are available in the center as well as locally in the city.  Prayers are also said before each meal.   When there is a death within the group or a relative we all sign a sympathy card for that person.  Every Friday we all wear something red as a support for our troops and veterans.     Activities are much appreciated -- Coffee Time every week, Pot Luck once a month, cards and Mexican Train games daily.     I appreciate our board members, President, Treasurer, Vice-president, Secretary, Reporter, and Historian who volunteer to monitor the needs of the Center.  Other volunteers bring patrons to meals, deliver home bond meals and take us to doctor appointments.   The monthly Newsletter is always welcomed and appreciated  It keeps everyone informed of current activities here at the Welcome Inn as well as other articles of interest.   Exercise equipment is available to everyone of which I am greatly involved.  I use the bicycle almost daily.   One of the most appreciated things I have experienced is the Seeing Eye Books.  My eyesight is not the best, so I am able to enjoy my love of books.  Thanks to our Activity Coordinator for helping me get started on this program.Leo Skelton, 89 years old

Heart Of America Humane Society	122428		/users/profile/166744	fixin2	Volunteer	5	09/17/2012	HAHS is partnered with two local shelters, one in Lee's Summit, MO and one in Ottawa, KS.  They "pull" cats and dogs who, for no fault of their own, have ended up in the shelter.  Many times the animals are family pets who were left behind due to moving, money, or allergy issues.  The animals are fostered to determine their personalities, and the fosters use much of their own money.  Fund raisers are held frequently to provide for spay/neuter costs, shots, and other medical needs.  PetSmart in Overland Park, KS and Ward Parkway Mall, plus PetCo in Olathe, KS have donated space so the cats will be seen; there is also a website to view animals.  I have volunteered for about 10 yrs.;  I'm the Thursday "cleaning lady" at PetSmart in O.P.  There is no way to add up all the hours the fosters have spent to transport animals to and from adoption events, plus having them in their homes.  They are a great group of people!
Social Service League Of Lawrence	239635		/users/profile/325511	SSL1863	Board Member	5	03/23/2015	The Social Service League is one of the oldest non-profit organizations in KS.  Established in 1863 when a group of citizen came together to help the survivors after Quantrill's raid, the League set up the first two bed hospital. Throughout the ensuing decades the League established sewing and knitting rooms where sweaters and blankets were made and shipped to US soldiers in WWI and WWII.  A canning kitchen was established during the Great Depression and at the peak of its usage 10,000 quarts of food per month were put up to help the citizens of Lawrence and outlying areas store food for the winter.   Since the 1930's the Social Service League has owned and operated a thrift store in their historic building at 905 Rhode Island. Their Mission is to aid no and low income individuals and families by providing them with necessary clothing and household goods (for no or low cost) in an effort to help them get back on their feet and ultimately sustain themselves.  The thrift store self-subsidizes its voucher program, free eye glass program and the standard low pricing on general merchandise by selling high value donations in a Boutique area.  The store is run with minimal employees, using volunteers, community services workers, and Board members for much of the day to day maintenance and work.  The Social Service League has the good fortune of being supported through the generosity of socially conscious donors and customers who enjoy knowing that 100% of the proceeds from donations and purchases are used to benefit the local population.  I have been a member of the Board of Directors for 3 years. We have an excellent Board with members who put an enormous amount of effort and energy into the organization. This level of dedication takes a true belief in the Social Service League as an organization with a rich history and a bright future.

Youth For Christ International	178606		/users/profile/235236	stal7	Volunteer	5	10/17/2013	I have had a long history with YFC.  Both of my parents were youth leaders and had worked with YFC for many years. My first memories with YFC were as a child. My parents lead youth groups in our home and always had an open door policy. I remember kids in high school coming to hang out with my parents not only for youth group, but also for movie nights, to play cards, to talk, to eat, or just to have a safe place to hang out. I always loved having older kids around to bug an pester, but it never seemed to bother them. I've made many life long friends just from that. YFC is a great organization  that lets kids feel comfortable to talk about Jesus and any problems that they may be facing in their everyday life. I grew up with and being involved in YFC. I became a youth student leader in High school. YFC taught me many things; how to stick up for people who were being bullied, how to get people involved in YFC/safe events, how to talk to fellow peers about problems, how to live my life for Jesus, to not judge others, and many more things.  I was able to be involved in a lot of things that without YFC I would not have been. Many of the fun and life changing memories happened at Quaker Ridge Camp in Woodland Park Colorado. There's no place (still to this day) that I feel closer to God than at QRC. I was also able to go to Juarez, Mexico on a mission trip. That was by far the most eye-opening experience of my life. To be able to go to Juarez to help a family who was living in a cardboard/pallet/tarped enclosure they called home in the middle of the dessert. It was the saddest thing I've ever seen with my own eyes and it taught me to never take anything or anyone for granted. We were able to share the love of God not just by telling them, but also showing them. The greatest thing about that trip was that we were there to teach them, but we left forever changed by what they taught us. They were happy, giving, and grateful for everything. They were such an inspiration! Youth For Christ is a place where kids from any and all backgrounds/problems/status/etc. can go to fell accepted. In todays world we need more uplifting and encouraging organizations for kids to be involved in. It spreads the word of God's love, provides and safe environment for kids who may need one, and a fun place for kids to hangout without getting into trouble. To say that YFC was life changing is an understatement.  I am grateful for the years that I was involved with YFC, for what it taught me, for the wonderful experiences that I have had, and for the life long friends that I have made.

Childrens Christian Concern Society	165319		/users/profile/219767	Eugene E.Schmidt	Board Member	5	08/19/2013	This organization has a passion for children.  The mission statement defines the activity of CCCSleadachild and it has proven to be an attainable goal since its existence.  The dedication of the Board members to the mission is evident for they do not receive any remuneration for their time and services.  The Board members cheerfully pay their own expenses for meetings and also when they volunteer to visit the locations it supports world wide.  The founding family gave unselfishly for years, of their time and financial support .Their example and passionate leadership still is evident in the commitment of the Board leadership to "share the love of Jesus with children".  The results of the mission is demonstrated in the lives of children who have received Christian Education and their growth in service as adults in their community and nation.  It has been a thrill for me to see these individuals grow from hopeless poverty to productive Christians in the Church, Business, and Government.  
Lamb Tracks Ministry	145570	1	/users/profile/192072	lambtracks	Board Member	5	12/01/2012	We are Vance and Linda Andreas, founders and president of Lamb Tracks Ministry.  The report does not truly represent what we do.  While the broadcasts in Africa have been instrumental in determining need in various locations in Africa, this information does not reflect the impact of this organization.  Through radio broadcasts, a needs basis was determined.  As a result, the charity built an orphanage in Malawi which houses 70 children, ages 2 to 21.  All our kids are housed, clothed, fed, educated and provided health care through graduation from secondary school.  In addition, we provide food to the poorest of the poor in Malawi through free distributions mostly in the south portions of Malawi.  Food is provided by delivering maize to bush villages which remain untouched by other organizations. People are fed regardless of religious affiliation.  Also, we support 2 secondary schools and a college established through this charity.  This charity is an "all volunteer" organization.  With exception of small administrative expenses, all donations reach the target.  100% of designated contributions reach the people.  As an example, 100% of donations for the Lamb Tracks Orphanage, actually reach the orphanage, and usually within a few days of the donation.  We may be reached by email at "lambtracks@juno.com".

The Theatre In The Park	66450		/users/profile/72632	tomo	Board Member	5	02/10/2011	I have been personally involved with The Theatre in the Park since 1996.  Prior to that I was an attendee as an audience member for many years.  All the members of my family have been involved with TTIP, participating as cast members, orchestra members, and rehearsal accompanist.  We have all been previously nominated for a Demmi award, signifying best performance in a particular category, and several years ago my wife was awarded the Founders Award for her long time service to TTIP.  Having a venue like TTIP, which is the largest outdoor community theatre in the country, seating approximately 4,500 people has allowed us to realize, first hand, our love of musical theatre!  I have been a cast member in 11 TTIP shows, and my family combined has been in over 50!  At present, I serve on the Advisory Council at TTIP, and will serve as it's Chair in 2012. Every year, between 700-800 people audition for the 4 shows being presented.  From that total, approximately 250 will be cast.  The theatre's reputation is well known throughout the entire Kansas City metropolitan area, and performers, musicians, directors, and back stage people come from all over the area, just to be a part of it!  In addition to the 4 musicals presented, performances by various dance showcases, in addition to the Kansas City Symphony Orchestra, to mention a few, are also on the schedule.  Furthermore, our new pavilion allows for other group functions, such as wedding receptions, Rotary events, or private parties, either separately or in conjunction with one of the performances.  The mission & goal of TTIP is to be a theatre for the entire community, involving different types of family entertainment, with an appeal for everyone.   The success of TTIP is dependent upon the many volunteers that make things work.  In addition to our Advisory Council, there is a Friends Committee that not only helps behind the scenes and at auditions, but also on the nights of every performance.  In a number of cases, these are also performers wanting to be additionally involved.  The ambience of the grassy amphitheatre, the quality productions presented, and the family atmosphere make The Theatre in the Park part of thousands of people's summer experience, which is why they continue to return year after year. As more people become exposed to all TTIP has to offer, it's reputation and importance to the community will do nothing but get stronger.  I intend to continue being a part of that growth and success! 
Morse Covenant Church Overland Park Ks	194567		/users/profile/254274	FaithfulChristian	General Member of the Public	1	02/20/2014	I am a parent of a wonderful girl that plays on a volleyball team with the daughter of Reverend Bryan Dahms.  Earlier this week a parent of one of the girls on the team voiced some concerns about the way the team was being coached.  Reverend Dahms took the time to email all the parents with his delightful thoughts and comments on this girls future.  I am a catholic and very faith based.  But as you will see from his words, he seems to lack faith in our youth.  Very disheartening for a man that founded a church that is supposed to be very faith based would write this.  Enjoy the reading from Reverend Bryan Dahms, the founder of this church: Your daughter is not going anywhere in this sport.Your daughter is not going to play D1 volleyball.  Your daughter is not going to the olympics.   These are all quotes from a long email basically saying that the player of the parent who spoke up will never succeed in this sport.  I don't understand why a parent can't make suggestions without a Reverend insulting a wonderful 13 year old girl.  I would strongly suggest you consider who this man is before attending his church. Sincerely, Concerned Christian
Jeda Mase Support Service Institute	92687		/users/profile/106362	Jada	Client Served	4	06/28/2011	I believe that this organization is a great thing in the future.  It's a small organization with one key player and a small host of volunteers.  The vision is great and it's visionary states "It'll be like Wal-Mart ~ every where you look up; i'll be there". The bases of it comes from a scripture in Proverbs 31:9 to be the voice of those poor and in need. - That's any and everybody. I challenge people to give to this non profit; because the visionary has done work for years (for no money) and has been commited for 13 years.

Co-founder SuEllen Fried (nationally-known anti-bullying expert) and Executive Director Lynn Hinkle, along with their board of directors and volunteers, help prisoners from all walks of life to meet and study together, share and gain self knowledge, commit to new values and address behavioral goals to serve others on the inside and prepare for success on the outside. The ROFW team also helps those of us outside of prison to understand the incarcerated as fully human individuals  capable of change and worthy of encouragement, hope, dignity and support as they help themselves through the structured ROFW program.

Great Plains Spca	8237	15	/users/profile/10019	khot	Volunteer	5	07/31/2009	NMHPKC has completed over 10,000 spay/neuter surgeries at it's clinic in Merriam, KS.  In 2008, Kansas City area shelters reported a decrease in euthanasias to 13,000 from over 25,000 size years earlier.  They provide high volume, high quality, low cost spay/neuter services to the Kansas City community.  This is the key to reducing the number of animals killed nationwide.  This is a professionally managed organization that is rapidly expanding it's outreach.  In addition to s/n services, it provides animal adoption, outreach to animals in substandard living conditions, and a feral cat program.  They are dedicated to the No-Kill movement outlined by Nathan Winograd.  I've seen firsthand how this effectively this group functions and I would highly recommend supporting this organization.

Kitty City Kansas Rescue Incorporated	322080		/users/profile/415680	pmcbee	Volunteer	5	01/24/2017	I began looking for a kitten to replace my loving cat Andy who died and found Kitty City.  After visiting their adoption events a couple of week ends, I knew I had to volunteer.  This was a dedicated group of people who cared deeply about every life they were saving.  They took cats and kittens into their homes and most would foster those charges until they got adopted, no matter how long that took.  Sometimes it was a week, sometimes it was months.  I have been fostering and volunteering for 3 years now and about 200 cats later, there is no place I would rather be.  Each volunteer gives their special talent, whether it be bottle feeding newborns or cleaning the adoption center daily, working fundraising events, or doing data entry.  Everyone gives their all.  And because of that,  Kitty City saves lives every day.

Sisters Of St Joseph Dear Neighbor Ministries Inc	196507		/users/profile/256854	gkelley1179	Donor	5	03/26/2014	I highly recommend giving to Sisters of St. Joseph Dear Neighbor Ministries. I have donated to this organization since 2004, and it has always been a rewarding experience for me to see the money go to great use directly in the community.  This group of ladies believes in the mission of helping others, and in so doing, achieving closeness with Christ. I only heard of the organization because I lived for three years in Missouri; I am from Mississippi and have lived in the South most of my life.  I give to them as often as I possibly can, and never have regretted it or questioned the use of the money.  A great group of ladies and a wonderful, honestly run organization.  Your money will not go to a CEO, but directly to the needs of the community and ministry.  
Chanute Ministerial Alliance	274025		/users/profile/363360	Vickie W.	Volunteer	2	12/08/2015	Attempting to find a phone number to call regarding this charity. I am taking classes with CASA and we are required to research a social service resource and report about it back to the class.  I know from my years in social services that I have worked with many ministerial alliances in different towns to help clients. Finding the right person to contact to get resources seems to always be a challenge. in most towns it seems a minister starts the contact in securing resources for clients but your home page does not say how to make contact. I will be calling my local pastor to gather more information. I will check "community guidelines to see if I can gather more information.
